Lv5-1x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that parkour is on the far left, so it goes in the first column (1).
2. Since biathlon is to the left of golf, and parkour is on the far left, biathlon must be in the second column (2).
3. Now, we know that surfing is to the left of weightlifting and between biathlon and weightlifting. So, surfing must be in the second column (2) as well, and it must be to the right of biathlon. This means that weightlifting must be in the third column (3).
4. Finally, golf is to the right of biathlon, so it must be in the fourth column (4).

The final solution table is:

```

Lv6-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the frog is on the right of the person eating lemon, and the person eating lemon can't be in position 1 (because of rule 11), the frog owner must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. The person eating lemon can't be in position 1 (rule 11), so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5. Let's assume the person eating lemon is in position 2. This means the frog owner is in position 1.

2. The owner of the guinea-pig is in an even position, which can be 2, 4, or 6. Since the person eating lemon is in position 2, the guinea-pig owner can't be in position 2 (rule 5). So, the guinea-pig owner is either in position 4 or 6. Let's assume the guinea-pig owner is in position 4.

3. The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the fisherman. Since the fisherman can't be in position 1 (because the owner of the frog is there), the fisherman can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the fisherman is in position 3. This means the social-worker is in position 2.

4. The librarian is in an even position and is to the right of the social-worker. So, the librarian can be in position 4 or 6. Since the guinea-pig owner is in position 4, the librarian can't be in position 4. So, the librarian is in position 6.

5. The analyst is somewhere to the right of the librarian. So, the analyst can be in position 5 or 6. Since the librarian is in position 6, the analyst is in position 5.

6. The person eating garlic is on the left or right of the social-worker. Since the social-worker is in position 2, the person eating garlic can be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the person eating garlic is in position 1.

7. The person eating garlic is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig owner is in position 4, the person eating garlic can't be in position 2 (because the social-worker is there). So, the person eating garlic is in position 1, and the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3.

8. The accountant is not the person eating eggplant. Since the person eating garlic is in position 1, the accountant can't be in position 1, 2, or 3 (because the social-worker, the person eating garlic, and the person eating lemon are already assigned). So, the accountant can be in position 4 or 5. Let's assume the accountant is in position 4.

9. The person eating kale is on the left of the person eating eggplant. Since the person eating garlic is in position 1, the person eating kale can't be in position 1 or 2 (because the social-worker and the person eating lemon are already assigned). So, the person eating kale can be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the person eating kale is in position 3.

10. The owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the social-worker is in position 2, the owner of the pony can't be in position 1 (because the owner of the frog is there). So, the owner of the pony can be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the librarian is in position 6, the owner of the pony can't be in position 6 (because the owner of the pony is to the left of the owner of the cat, and the owner of the cat can't be in position 6). So, the owner of the pony is in position 2, and the owner of the cat is in position 5.

11. The person eating zucchini is the only one left. Since the person eating kale is in position 3, the person eating zucchini must be in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-4x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different movie genres, and 2 different nationalities. So, each category will have exactly one item in common with another category (since there are 4 categories and 2 items in each).

2. Let's start with the beverages. Since there are 2, and one of them is milk, the other must be iced-tea.

3. Now let's consider the foods. Since there are 2, and one of them is not to the left of the Australian (which we'll place later), the other must be to the left of the Australian. Let's say peach is to the left of the Australian and zucchini is to the right.

4. Now let's consider the movie genres. Since the person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person drinking milk, and we know the milk drinker is having iced-tea (which is on the right), the spy movie watcher must be on the left. Let's say the spy movie watcher is watching mystery movies.

5. Now we have one spot left for the spy movie watcher, one spot for the iced-tea drinker, and one spot for the Australian. Since the Australian is to the right of the person eating peach, the Australian must be in the last spot.

6. The only remaining spot is for the zucchini eater and the Italian. Since the Italian cannot be to the left of the Australian (which we placed), the Italian must be the zucchini eater.

7. Now we have placed all the items in their respective categories. The final solution table is as follows:

   |               |    1    |     2      |
   | Beverage      | iced-tea | milk       |
   | Food          | peach    | zucchini   |
   | Movie-Genre   | mystery  | spy        |
   | Nationality   | italian  | australian |

So, the final solution is:

Lv9-4x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the Turkish is either in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the Turkish is in position 1 (we'll check the other possibility later).

2. From rule 2, the parity of the positions of reggae and lemonade is the same. Since the Turkish is in position 1, the Turkish cannot be the person drinking lemonade (as it would violate rule 16). So, the Turkish cannot be in position 3 either, as it would violate rule 19 (an odd position). So, the Turkish must be in position 1.

3. From rule 3, the person drinking fanta is not to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the Turkish is in position 1, the person drinking fanta cannot be in position 2 or 3. So, the person drinking fanta must be in position 4 or 5.

4. From rule 4, the Turkish is not to the left of the Nigerian. Since the Turkish is in position 1, the Nigerian must be in position 2.

5. From rule 5, the person playing basketball is not to the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 4 or 5, the person playing basketball cannot be in position 5. So, the person playing basketball is in position 1, 2, or 3.

6. From rule 6, the fan reggae is on the left of the fan disco. Since the Nigerian is in position 2, the fan reggae must be in position 1.

7. From rule 7, the fan metal is somewhere between the fan electronic and the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person playing basketball is in position 1, the fan electronic must be in position 2. The person playing skiing cannot be in position 5 (as it would violate rule 10), so the person playing skiing is in position 3.

8. From rule 8, the fan country is on the far left or far right. Since the fan reggae is in position 1 and the fan electronic is in position 2, the fan country cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the fan country is in position 5.

9. From rule 9, the Pakistani is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the person playing basketball is in position 1, the person playing biathlon cannot be in position 2 or 3. So, the person playing biathlon is in position 4 or 5. Since the person playing skiing is in position 3, the person playing biathlon must be in position 5.

10. From rule 10, the person playing sailing is on the far right. Since the person playing biathlon is in position 5, the person playing sailing is in position 1.

11. From rule 11, the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person playing biathlon. Since the person playing biathlon is in position 5, the person drinking fanta is in position 4.

12. From rule 12, the Russian is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 4, the Russian cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the Russian is in position 5.

13. From rule 13, the russian is the russian (this rule doesn't provide new information).

14. From rule 14, the fan electronic is somewhere to the left of the person playing sailing. Since the person playing sailing is in position 1, the fan electronic must be in position 2.

15. From rule 15, the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the fan metal. Since the fan metal is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1.

16. From rule 16, the person playing badminton is somewhere to the right of the Mexican. Since the Mexican is in position 3, the person playing badminton is in position 4 or 5. However, this would violate rule 18 (the person playing badminton is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade, but the only position left for the person drinking lemonade is position 1). So, the Mexican must be in position 5, and the person playing badminton is in position 4.

17. From rule 17, the fan metal is not to the right of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 4, the fan metal must be in position 2 or 3. However, this would violate rule 7 (the fan metal is between the fan electronic and the person playing skiing, but the only position left for the fan electronic is position 1). So, our initial assumption that the Turkish is in position 1 was incorrect. The Turkish must be in position 3.

18. With the Turkish in position 3, the rest of the positions fall into place:
   - The Nigerian is in position 2.
   - The fan reggae is in position 1.
   - The fan electronic is in position 2.
   - The person playing basketball is in position 1.
   - The person playing skiing is in position 3.
   - The fan country is in position 5.
   - The person playing biathlon is in position 5.
   - The person playing sailing is in position 1.
   - The person drinking fanta is in position 4.
   - The Russian is in position 5.
   - The person drinking almond-milk is in position 1.
   - The Mexican is in position 5.
   - The person playing badminton is in position 4.

Lv6-4x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food, two hobbies, two jobs, and two means of transport. So, we can fill the first row with the two types of food, the second row with the two hobbies, the third row with the two jobs, and the fourth row with the two means of transport.

2. From point 1.6, we know that the person driving the train is not the project-manager. So, the project-manager cannot be in the second row (Train).

3. Let's assume the project-manager is in the first row (Food). Since there are two types of food, the other person must be eating pomegranate. So, the first row becomes:

   | Food       | Lemon      | Pomegranate |
   |-----------|------------|-------------|

4. Now, the person driving the train cannot be the project-manager, so it must be the security-guard. The only remaining option for the second row is the Transport row, so the second row becomes:

   | Hobby      | Magic-tricks| Rock-climbing |
   |-----------|------------|--------------|

5. From point 2.2, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. So, the order of the hobbies must be Magic-tricks, Rock-climbing.

6. Now, the only remaining row is the Job row. Since the project-manager is eating lemon, the security-guard must be eating pomegranate. So, the Job row becomes:

   | Job        | Project-manager| Security-guard |
   |-----------|---------------|----------------|

7. From point 2.1, we know that the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person eating pomegranate. Since the project-manager is eating lemon and cannot drive the scooter, the only remaining option for the Transport row is the scooter. So, the Transport row becomes:

   | Transport  | Scooter      | Train          |
   |-----------|--------------|----------------|

8. Now, we have only one position left for the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person eating pomegranate, and the project-manager is eating lemon and cannot drive the scooter, the only remaining option is the first row (Food). So, the first row becomes:

   | Food       | Lemon (Scooter driver) | Pomegranate (Project-manager) |
   |-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|

9. Finally, we have filled all the rows with the given conditions. The final solution table is:

Lv10-5x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different items in each category, so we can fill in the categories with their respective unique items.

   |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

   | Sport         | badminton| swimming       | tennis   |
   | Transport     | bike     | helicopter    | jet-ski  |

2. From rule 1, we know that the fan techno is on the far right. So, techno must be in the third column.

   |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

   | Sport         | badminton| swimming       | tennis   |
   | Transport     | bike     | helicopter    | jet-ski  |

3. From rule 2, the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. This means helicopter must be in the first column, and swimming must be in the second or third column. Since swimming can't be in the third column (because techno is there), it must be in the second column.

4. From rule 3, the person who's sport is swimming is the fan techno or the owner of the goldfish is the person who's sport is swimming, but not both. Since we already placed swimming in the second column, techno must be in the second row (because it's the fan of techno). This means the person who's sport is swimming is in the first row. But since swimming can't be in the first column (because helicopter is there), it must be in the third column. This means the person who's sport is swimming is in the first row and third column, which contradicts rule 2 (the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming). This means our initial placement of swimming in the second column was incorrect. Swimming must be in the second column, and the person who's sport is swimming is in the first row.

5. From rule 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. This means hot-chocolate can't be in the first column (because bike is there). So, hot-chocolate must be in the second or third column. Since it can't be in the third column (because techno is there), it must be in the second column.

6. From rule 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since we already placed hot-chocolate in the second column, the person who's sport is swimming must be in the first or third column. But since swimming can't be in the first column (because helicopter is there), it must be in the third column.

7. From rule 6, the person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since we already placed swimming in the third column, the person who's sport is tennis must be in the first or second column. But since tennis can't be in the first column (because helicopter is there), it must be in the second column.

8. From rule 7, the fan punk is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we already placed hot-chocolate in the second column, the fan punk must be in the first or third column. But since punk can't be in the first column (because funk is there), it must be in the third column.

9. From rule 8, the fan techno is on the left or right of the fan funk. Since we already placed techno in the second row and punk in the third column, the fan funk must be in the first row.

10. From rule 9, the owner of the frog is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since we already placed mirinda in the third column, the owner of the frog must be in the first or second column. But since frog can't be in the first column (because it's a pet and we already placed a pet in the first row), it must be in the second column.

12. From rule 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. This means hot-chocolate can't be in the first column (because mirinda is there). So, hot-chocolate must be in the second or third column. Since it can't be in the third column (because techno is there), it must be in the second column.

13. From rule 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since we already placed hot-chocolate in the second column, the person who's sport is swimming must be in the first or third column. But since swimming can't be in the first column (because helicopter is there), it must be in the third column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

14. From rule 6, the person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since we already placed swimming in the third column, the person who's sport is tennis must be in the first or second column. But since tennis can't be in the first column (because helicopter is there), it must be in the second column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

    | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

15. From rule 7, the fan punk is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we already placed hot-chocolate in the second column, the fan punk must be in the first or third column. But since punk can't be in the first column (because funk is there), it must be in the third column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

    | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

16. From rule 8, the fan techno is on the left or right of the fan funk. Since we already placed techno in the second row and punk in the third column, the fan funk must be in the first row.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

    | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

17. From rule 9, the owner of the frog is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since we already placed mirinda in the first column and frog in the second column, the owner of the frog is in the first column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
    | Beverage      | mirinda  | hot-chocolate | fanta    |

    | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

18. From rule 10, the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means mirinda must be in the first column. But we already placed mirinda in the first column, so this rule is satisfied.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
    | Beverage      | mirinda  | hot-chocolate | fanta    |

Lv1-1x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who plays lacrosse is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column with 'lacrosse'.

|-----|-----|---------|---------|----------|
| Sport| lacrosse|         |         |          |

2. The person who plays baseball is on the far right, so it must be in the last column. Since the person who plays parkour is to the left of the baseball player, parkour must be in the second-to-last column.

|     | 1   | 2   |    3    |    4     |
|-----|-----|------|---------|----------|
| Sport| lacrosse| parkour|         | baseball  |

3. Now, we only have cycling left. Since it's a different sport from the ones we've placed, it can go in any of the remaining columns. However, to satisfy the condition that parkour is to the left of baseball, cycling cannot be in the last column. So, cycling must be in the first or second column.

   If cycling is in the first column, the table would look like this:

|     | 1   | 2   |    3    |    4     |
|-----|-----|------|---------|----------|
| Sport| cycling| parkour| baseball | lacrosse  |

   But this arrangement violates the rule that parkour is to the left of baseball, so cycling cannot be in the first column.

   Therefore, cycling must be in the second column:

|     | 1   | 2   |    3    |    4     |
|-----|-----|------|---------|----------|

Lv9-4x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 2 different movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and sports. So, for each category, we have 2 unique options.

   For Movie-Genre: Comedy, Thriller
   For Music-Genre: Ambient, Indie
   For Pet: Cat, Lizard
   For Sport: Basketball, Soccer

2. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. This means that either Comedy is in column 2 and Soccer is in column 1, or Comedy is in column 1 and Soccer is in column 2. Let's assume Comedy is in column 1 and Soccer is in column 2 for now.

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy  | Thriller   |

   | Sport         | Soccer  | Basketball  |

3. The fan ambient and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions. This means they are either in the same column or the same row. Since they can't be in the same row (because there's only one pet and one music genre in each row), they must be in the same column. Let's assume Ambient is in column 1 and the Cat is in column 1 for now.

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy  | Thriller   |
   | Music-Genre   | Ambient | Indie      |
   | Pet           | Cat     | Lizard     |
   | Sport         | Soccer  | Basketball  |

4. The fan indie is somewhere to the right of the fan ambient. Since Ambient is in column 1, Indie must be in column 2.

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy  | Thriller   |

5. Now, we have filled all the unique options for each category in the table. The final solution table is:

Lv9-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people with unique conditions. The person watching superhero movies is on the far right (5), and the project-manager is in the middle (15). So, the project-manager must be in position 3, and the superhero movie-watcher is in position 5.

2. Since the project-manager is in position 3, the mechanic must be in position 1 or 2 (11). Let's assume the mechanic is in position 1 for now.

3. The person watching action movies is not to the left of the person eating artichoke (16), so the artichoke eater cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the artichoke eater must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since the artichoke eater cannot be to the left of the paramedic (14), the paramedic cannot be in position 1. So, the paramedic must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

4. The paramedic is not the person eating mango (1), so the paramedic cannot be in position 1. The paramedic is also not to the left of the person eating mango (13), so the paramedic must be in position 3 or 4.

5. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the paramedic (4), so the animation movie-watcher must be in position 4 or 5. Since the animation movie-watcher is not to the left of the person eating cabbage (12), the cabbage eater cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the cabbage eater must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

6. The person watching scientific movies has a different parity position from the mechanic (9), so the mechanic cannot be in an even position. Therefore, the mechanic is in position 1.

7. The person eating avocado and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions (2), so the avocado eater must be in an even position. Since the avocado eater is not the person watching action movies (10), the avocado eater cannot be in position 1. So, the avocado eater must be in position 2, 4, or 6.

8. The person watching action movies is not to the left of the person eating avocado (18), so the action movie-watcher cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the action movie-watcher must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Since the action movie-watcher is not to the left of the person eating artichoke (16), the action movie-watcher cannot be in position 3. So, the action movie-watcher must be in position 4 or 5.

9. The person eating cabbage is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies (12), so the person watching scientific movies cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the mechanic is in position 1, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2 or 3.

10. The person eating mango is not the paramedic (1), so the mango eater cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, the mango eater must be in position 4 or 5. Since the person watching animation movies is on the right of the paramedic (4), the mango eater cannot be in position 4. So, the mango eater must be in position 5.

11. The person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating mango (5), so the western movie-watcher must be in position 4 or 5. Since the superhero movie-watcher is on the far right (5), the western movie-watcher must be in position 4.

12. The person eating garlic is the person watching superhero movies (7), so the garlic eater is in position 5.

13. The person eating avocado is not the person watching action movies (10), so the avocado eater cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the avocado eater must be in position 2.

14. The person watching action movies is in position 4, so the person eating artichoke must be in position 1 or 3. Since the person eating artichoke is not to the left of the paramedic (14), the paramedic cannot be in position 1. So, the paramedic must be in position 3, and the artichoke eater is in position 1.

15. The teacher is on the left or right of the person eating artichoke (14), so the teacher cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the teacher must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the project-manager is in the middle (15), the teacher cannot be in position 3. So, the teacher must be in position 2 or 4.

16. The person eating cabbage is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies (12), so the person watching scientific movies cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the mechanic is in position 1, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2 or 3. Since the person watching animation movies is on the right of the paramedic (4), the person watching scientific movies cannot be in position 3. So, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2.

17. The mechanic is in position 1, and the person watching scientific movies is in position 2. Since the mechanic and the person watching scientific movies have different parity positions (9), the parity of the positions must be 1 and 0. So, the positions are 1 (mechanic) and 2 (scientific movies). The remaining positions are 3 (paramedic), 4 (western movies), and 5 (garlic, superhero movies). Since the person eating garlic is the person watching superhero movies (7), the person eating garlic is in position 5, and the person watching western movies is in position 4.

18. The teacher is in position 2 or 4. Since the person eating artichoke is not to the left of the teacher (14), the teacher cannot be in position 2. So, the teacher must be in position 4.

19. The person eating cabbage is in position 3, and the teacher is in position 4. Since the person eating cabbage is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies (12), the person watching scientific movies must be in position 1.

Lv4-4x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the Dutch is between the person driving the ship and the Russian. Since the person driving the ship is on the far right (point 2), the Dutch cannot be in the first or last position. The Russian also cannot be in the first position (as the Dutch must be to its right), so the Russian must be in the second position. The Dutch is then in the third position.

2. The Dutch is on the left of the person driving the subway (point 3), so the subway driver cannot be in the first or third position. The subway driver must be in the fourth position, and the Dutch is in the third position.

3. The positions are filled as follows: Dutch (3), Russian (2), Subway (4), Ship (5).

4. The surfing person is between the pomegranate eater and the parkour person (point 4). Since the surfing person is the helicopter driver (point 6), the helicopter driver cannot be in the first or last position. The pomegranate eater cannot be in the first position (as the surfing person must be to its right), so the pomegranate eater must be in the second position. The parkour person cannot be in the last position (as the surfing person must be to its left), so the parkour person must be in the fourth position. The surfing person (helicopter driver) is then in the third position.

5. The apricot eater is in an odd position (point 5), so it cannot be in the second, fourth, or sixth position. The apricot eater must be in the first, third, or fifth position. Since the Dutch and the surfing person (helicopter driver) are already in the first, third, and fifth positions, the apricot eater must be in the fifth position.

6. The carrot eater cannot be in the first position (as the apricot eater must be to its left), so the carrot eater must be in the second position.

7. The corn eater is the person who's sport is basketball (point 11), so the basketball player is in the fifth position. Since the basketball player is on the far left or far right (point 14), it must be in the first position. The corn eater is then in the third position.

8. The cabbage eater is on the right of the parkour person (point 13), so the cabbage eater cannot be in the second position (as the parkour person is in the fourth position). The cabbage eater must be in the fourth or fifth position. Since the cabbage eater cannot be in the fifth position (as the apricot eater is already there), the cabbage eater must be in the fourth position.

9. The Indonesian is on the right of the roller driver (point 8), so the roller driver cannot be in the first or last position. The roller driver must be in the second, third, or fourth position. Since the Indonesian cannot be in the first position (as the Dutch is already there), the roller driver must be in the second position. The Indonesian is then in the fifth position.

10. The cricket player is on the left or right of the water-polo player (point 12), and the water-polo player is on the left or right of the basketball player (point 9). This means the cricket player and the water-polo player must be in the first, third, and fifth positions, and the basketball player must be in the second position. The cricket player is then in the first position, the water-polo player is in the third position, and the basketball player is in the second position.

11. The pomegranate eater is in the second position.

12. The Egyptian is on the left or right of the Russian (point 7), and the Russian is in the second position. This means the Egyptian must be in the first or third position. Since the Egyptian cannot be in the first position (as the Dutch is already there), the Egyptian must be in the third position.

13. The Polish and the Russian are the only nationalities left, and the Russian is in the second position. This means the Polish must be in the fifth position.

Lv12-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the soul fan can't be to the left of the Nigerian (1), and there are only four positions, it means the soul fan can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the soul fan is in position 2 for now.

2. The Japanese is in an odd position (4), so the positions are filled as follows:
   - Position 1: Not used yet
   - Position 2: Soul fan (assumption)
   - Position 3: Not the Nigerian (1)
   - Position 4: Japanese

3. The dressmaker is not to the left of the doctor (3), so the doctor must be in position 4 (since the Nigerian is in position 3). This means the doctor is Brazilian (9).

4. The entrepreneur is on the right of the Japanese (5), so the entrepreneur is in position 5.

5. The fan folk is not the pilot or the fan folk is not the Nigerian (4), and the soul fan is not the dressmaker (6). Since the soul fan is in position 2, the fan folk can't be in position 2 (as it would be the Nigerian). So, the fan folk must be in position 1, 3, or 4. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

6. The fan hip-hop is to the right of the fan folk (7), so the fan hip-hop is in position 5.

7. The fan country can't be to the right of the fan soul (8), so the fan country must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

8. The fan country can't be the Brazilian (9), so the fan country must be one of the remaining nationalities: Japanese, Nigerian, or Russian. Since the Japanese is already taken (4), the fan country must be either Nigerian or Russian. But the fan soul is to the left of the Russian (12), so the fan country must be Nigerian. This means the nationality of the person in position 1 is Nigerian.

9. Since the fan country is Nigerian and the soul fan is in position 2, the fan folk must be in position 3 (as it can't be the Nigerian or the pilot). This means the fan folk is Japanese (as the remaining nationalities are Brazilian and Russian, and the Brazilian is the doctor).

10. The fan hip-hop is in position 5, and the entrepreneur is to its right (5), so the entrepreneur must be Russian.

11. The only position left is position 3, and it must be the pilot.

Lv6-2x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food (apricot and grapefruit) and two types of pets (goldfish and hamster).

2. From point 1, we can create a 2x2 table with the possible combinations of food and pets for each row:

   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Grapefruit |
   | Pet    | Goldfish| Hamster    |

3. Now let's apply the clues:

   a. The person eating grapefruit is not the owner of the goldfish. This means that in the row with Grapefruit, the Pet cannot be Goldfish. So, the table now looks like this:

      |        |    1     |     2      |
      | Food   | Apricot | Grapefruit |
      | Pet    | Goldfish| Hamster    |

      (X) means the combination is not possible due to the first clue.

      |        |    1     |     2      |
      | Food   | Apricot | Grapefruit |
      | Pet    |       X | Hamster    |

   b. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot. This means that in the table, the row with Grapefruit should be to the right of the row with Apricot. However, in our current table, the Grapefruit row is already to the right of the Apricot row. So, this clue doesn't help us eliminate any more combinations.

4. Now let's arrange the remaining possible combinations according to the second clue:

   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Grapefruit |
   | Pet    | Goldfish| Hamster    |

   To satisfy the second clue, we need to swap the positions of the rows:

   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Goldfish  |
   | Pet    | Hamster  | Grapefruit |

5. Now, let's apply the first clue again to the new arrangement:

   a. The person eating grapefruit is not the owner of the goldfish. This means that in the row with Grapefruit, the Pet cannot be Goldfish. However, we already know that the Pet in the Grapefruit row is Hamster, so this clue is satisfied.

6. We have satisfied both clues with the final arrangement, so the solution table is:

   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Goldfish  |
   | Pet    | Hamster  | Grapefruit |

   (The '#' symbol is used to separate the table from the explanation.)

   #####
   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Goldfish  |
   | Pet    | Hamster  | Grapefruit |
   #####

This is the final solution table that satisfies both clues. The person eating Apricot is the owner of the Goldfish, and the person eating Grapefruit is the owner of the Hamster, with the person eating Apricot being to the left of the person eating Grapefruit."	E6 	{}	False	0	False
Lv9-4x5-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign odd numbers (1, 3, 5) to the positions on the left and even numbers (2, 4) to the positions on the right. This is based on the clues that some people/pets are on the far left or far right, and some people have different parity positions.

2. Let's start with the positions of the pets. Since the chinchilla is on the far left (clue 17), it must be in position 1. The dog is the nigerian (clue 14), so it must be in position 4 (even position, as per clue 20). The frog does magic-tricks (clue 19), so it must be in position 5 (far right). The cat, turtle, and chinchilla are left, so they must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the turtle in position 2 (left of the dog, as per clue 9) and the chinchilla in position 1 (as we already decided). This leaves the cat in position 3.

3. Now, let's place the nationalities. The argentine is not to the left of the japanese (clue 12), so the argentine cannot be in position 1 or 2. The british is not to the left of the chinchilla (clue 4), so the british cannot be in position 1. The polish is in an even position (clue 20), so it cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. The nigerian owns the dog (clue 14), so it must be in position 4. This leaves the polish in position 2 and the argentine in position 5. The japanese must be in position 3 (left of the argentine, as per clue 12).

4. Now, let's place the hobbies. The person doing sudoku owns the frog (clue 10), so they must be in position 5. The person doing writing cannot be the one eating zucchini (clue 7), so they cannot be in position 5. The person doing collecting is on the left of the person doing writing (clue 13), so they must be in position 2. This leaves gardening, magic-tricks, and sudoku for positions 1, 3, and 4. Since the person doing magic-tricks is on the far right (clue 19), they must be in position 5. This leaves gardening in position 1 and sudoku in position 3.

5. Finally, let's place the foods. The person eating zucchini is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 1), so they cannot be in position 1. The person eating grapes is not to the left of the person eating zucchini (clue 11), so they cannot be in position 2. The person eating pineapple is somewhere to the right of the japanese (clue 21), so they cannot be in position 3. This leaves the person eating peas in position 1 (left of the chinchilla), the person eating zucchini in position 2, the person eating grapes in position 3, the person eating pineapple in position 4, and the person eating peas in position 5.

The final solution table is:

  |               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |      5       |
| Food          | peas       | zucchini   | grapes   | pineapple | peas        |
| Hobby         | collecting  | gardening   | magic-tricks| sudoku    | writing      |
| Nationality   | polish     | argentine   | japanese  | nigerian  | british      |
| Pet           | cat        | chinchilla  | dog      | frog      | turtle       |

Lv8-4x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can label them from 1 to 5.

2. From rule 9 and 14, we know that the positions of the people with hobbies baking and card-games are even and odd, respectively. Since there are only 5 positions, the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 2, 4, or 6, and the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. From rule 13, the person with the hobby of baking is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver can't be in position 1 (because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 1), the snowmobile driver must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the snowmobile driver can't be in position 4 because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 3 (from rule 23). So, the snowmobile driver must be in position 2.

4. From rule 11, the fisherman is on the left or right of the dressmaker. Since the snowmobile driver is in position 2, the dressmaker can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the dressmaker must be in position 3 or 4. But the dressmaker can't be in position 4 because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 3 (from rule 23). So, the dressmaker must be in position 3.

5. From rule 15, the person driving the tram is between the fisherman and the fan of pop. Since the fisherman is in position 3 and the fan of pop can't be in position 1 (because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 1), the fan of pop must be in position 4 or 5. But the fan of pop can't be in position 5 because the person driving the tram must be in an even position (since the person with the hobby of baking is in an even position and the person with the hobby of card-games is in an odd position). So, the fan of pop must be in position 4.

6. From rule 12, the fan of disco is on the left or right of the fan of pop. Since the fan of pop is in position 4, the fan of disco can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the fan of disco must be in position 2 or 3. But the fan of disco can't be in position 2 because the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2 (from rule 3). So, the fan of disco must be in position 3.

7. From rule 16, the fan of folk is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the taxi can't be in position 1 (because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 1), the person driving the taxi must be in position 2, 4, or 5. But the person driving the taxi can't be in position 5 because the person driving the tram is in position 4. So, the person driving the taxi must be in position 2. Since the person driving the scooter can't be in position 1 (because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 1), the person driving the scooter must be in position 3 or 5. But the person driving the scooter can't be in position 5 because the person driving the tram is in position 4. So, the person driving the scooter must be in position 3.

8. From rule 18, the person with the hobby of card-games is on the left or right of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in position 3, the person with the hobby of card-games can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 2 or 4. But the person with the hobby of card-games can't be in position 4 because the person driving the tram is in position 4. So, the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 2.

9. From rule 19, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person with the hobby of card-games. Since the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 2, the fan of folk can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the fan of folk must be in position 4 or 5. But the fan of folk can't be in position 5 because the person driving the tram is in position 4. So, the fan of folk must be in position 4.

10. From rule 5, the person with the hobby of collecting is the musician. So, the musician must be in position 3 (since the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 2).

11. From rule 7, the person with the hobby of board-games is between the fan of folk and the person driving the scooter. Since the fan of folk is in position 4 and the person driving the scooter is in position 3, the person with the hobby of board-games must be in position 2.

12. From rule 1, the fan of pop is not to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person with the hobby of sudoku can't be in position 1 (because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 1), the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the person with the hobby of sudoku can't be in position 4 because the fan of pop is in position 4. So, the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But the person with the hobby of sudoku can't be in position 3 because the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2. So, the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 5.

13. From rule 6, the person with the hobby of sudoku is not to the left of the lawyer. Since the lawyer can't be in position 1 (because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 1), the lawyer must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the lawyer can't be in position 4 because the fan of pop is in position 4. So, the lawyer must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But the lawyer can't be in position 3 because the person with the hobby of collecting (who is also the musician) is in position 3. So, the lawyer must be in position 2.

14. From rule 8, the person with the hobby of sudoku is not to the left of the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in position 2, the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But the person with the hobby of sudoku can't be in position 4 because the fan of pop is in position 4. So, the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 5.

15. From rule 10, the person with the hobby of collecting is the musician. Since the musician is in position 3, the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 5.

16. From rule 2, the lawyer is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person with the hobby of collecting is the musician (who is in position 3), the lawyer must be in position 4.

17. From rule 17, the fan of folk is on the right of the fan of trance. Since the person with the hobby of trance can't be in position 1 (because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 1), the person with the hobby of trance must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the person with the hobby of trance can't be in position 4 because the lawyer is in position 4. So, the person with the hobby of trance must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But the person with the hobby of trance can't be in position 3 because the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2. So, the person with the hobby of trance must be in position 5.

18. From rule 11, the fisherman is on the left or right of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in position 3, the fisherman can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the fisherman must be in position 2 or 4. But the fisherman can't be in position 4 because the person driving the tram is in position 4. So, the fisherman must be in position 2.

19. From rule 12, the fan of disco is on the left or right of the fan of pop. Since the fan of pop is in position 4, the fan of disco can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the fan of disco must be in position 2 or 3. But the fan of disco can't be in position 3 because the person driving the scooter is in position 3. So, the fan of disco must be in position 2.

20. From rule 18, the person with the hobby of card-games is on the left or right of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in position 2, the person with the hobby of card-games can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 4 or 5.

21. From rule 20, the fan of d&b is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Since the person driving the car can't be in position 1 (because the person with the hobby of card-games is in position 1), the person driving the car must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the person driving the car can't be in position 3 because the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2. So, the person driving the car must be in position 4 or 5. But the person driving the car can't be in position 5 because the person driving the tram is in position 4. So, the person driving the car must be in position 2.

22. From rule 1, the fan of pop is not to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 5, the fan of pop can't be in position 6.

Lv1-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the accountant is a fan of funk, we can place the accountant in the first row, second column (1,2) because the first column is reserved for the fan of trance (4).

2. The fan of folk is on the right of the fan of trance, so the fan of folk must be in the third column. Since the designer is on the far left, the designer cannot be the fan of folk. So, the writer or the mechanic must be the fan of folk. Let's assume the writer is the fan of folk for now (1,3).

3. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the writer, so the disaster movie fan must be in the fourth column (4). Since the mechanic watches mystery movies, the mechanic cannot be the disaster movie fan. So, the accountant, designer, or the fan of trance cannot be the disaster movie fan. The accountant and designer are already placed, and the fan of trance is on the far left (1,1), so the fan of trance cannot be the disaster movie fan. Therefore, the designer must be the disaster movie fan (4,1).

4. The fan of trance is on the far left, so it must be in the first column (1,1).

5. The fan of folk is on the right of the fan of trance, so the writer must be in the second column (1,2).

6. The designer is on the far left, so the mechanic must be in the third column (3,2).

7. The fan of funk is on the right of the person watching horror movies, so the horror movie fan must be in the fourth column (4,2).

8. The writer is the fan of reggae, so it is in the second row, fourth column (2,4).

Now, let's put the jobs and movie-genres in the table:

|               |    1     |    2     |   3    |     4      |

| Music-Genre   |         | Reggae  |        |            |

Since the writer is the fan of reggae, we just need to find the fourth music-genre. Since all other genres are already assigned to the other people, the remaining genre must be funk. So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-4x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The people have 2 different jobs, so we can write them down:
   - Job 1: Photographer
   - Job 2: Videographer

2. There are 2 different nationalities, so we can write them down:
   - Nationality 1: Colombian
   - Nationality 2: Polish

3. The people prefer 2 different types of sport, so we can write them down:
   - Sport 1: Ice-hockey
   - Sport 2: Sailing

4. The people use 2 different means of transport, so we can write them down:
   - Transport 1: Train
   - Transport 2: Van

Now let's apply the clues:

1. The videographer and the person driving the train have different parity positions. This means that if we number the rows and columns starting from 1, the sum of the digits in the row or column that the videographer is in should not be the same as the sum of the digits in the row or column that the train driver is in. Since there are only two numbers in each row and column, this means that the videographer cannot be in the same row or column as the train driver.

2. The person driving the train is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This means that the train driver cannot be in the second column (since the ice-hockey player is in the first column according to clue 3).

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the colombian. This means that the ice-hockey player cannot be in the second row (since the colombian is in the second row according to the nationality).

Now we have some restrictions:
- The videographer cannot be in the same row or column as the train driver.
- The train driver cannot be in the second column.
- The ice-hockey player cannot be in the second row.

Let's try to place the elements one by one while respecting these restrictions:

- We can place the Colombian in the second row and first column (since the ice-hockey player cannot be there).
- We can place the Polish in the first row and second column (since the train driver cannot be there).
- We can place the Photographer in the first row and first column (since the ice-hockey player cannot be there and the train driver cannot be in the second column).
- We can place the Videographer in the second row and second column (since the train driver cannot be there and the Colombian is in the second row).
- We can place the Ice-hockey player in the first row and second column (since the Colombian is to its left).
- We can place the Sailing player in the second row and first column (since the train driver is not to its right).
- We can place the Train driver in the first row and second row (since the Colombian is not there and the ice-hockey player is not there).
- We can place the Van in the second row and second column (since the train is not there).
- We can place the Ice-hockey in the first row and the Sailing in the second row.

The final solution table is:

Lv2-1x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fans of the 4 different music-genres are arranged in a row, and there are no repeats. So, we can start by placing the fan of hip-hop on the far left (position 1).

   |-----|------|------|-------|
   | hip-hop |     |     |       |

2. Since the fan of jazz is on the left of the fan of metal, and the fan of hip-hop is on the far left, the fan of jazz must be in position 2.

   |  1  |  2  |  3   |   4   |
   |-----|-----|------|-------|
   | hip-hop | jazz |     |       |

3. Now, the fan of metal is to the right of the fan of jazz, but not in the last position because the fan of soul is to the right of the fan of metal (according to the puzzle's statement 1). So, the fan of metal must be in position 3.

   |  1  |  2  |  3  |   4   |
   |-----|-----|-----|-------|
   | hip-hop | jazz | metal|       |

4. Finally, according to the puzzle's statement 1, the fan of soul is to the right of the fan of metal and to the right of the fan of jazz (who is already in position 2). So, the fan of soul must be in position 4.

Lv5-1x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating grapes is to the right of the person eating broccoli. So, the possible arrangements for the first two columns are:
   - Broccoli, Grapes
   - Grapes, Broccoli (this is not possible because the grapes must be to the right of broccoli)

2. Now, the person eating raspberry is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes. Since the only possible position for grapes is to the right of broccoli, the only arrangement for the last two columns is:
   - Grapes, Raspberry

3. Now, we can combine the columns to get the final arrangement:
   - Broccoli, Grapes, Raspberry

4. So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-2x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 5, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is to the right of the person who's hobby is camping. So, we can place camping in the first or second position, and drawing in the third, fourth, or fifth position.

2. From rule 6, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since camping can only be in the first or second position, biathlon must be in the second position. So, camping is in the first position.

3. From rule 1, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's sport is rowing. Since we know that biathlon is in the second position, and camping is in the first position, the only possible positions for rugby and rowing are the third and fourth positions. But from rule 4, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is not the person who's sport is rowing. So, rugby must be in the third position, and rowing in the fourth position.

4. From rule 2, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since we know that rugby is in the third position, reading can be in the first, second, or fifth position.

5. From rule 3, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby (this rule is redundant because we already know where rugby is).

6. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is not in the first position. So, reading cannot be in the first position.

7. Now, if reading is in the second position, then the hobby in the first position must be chess (because we know that the hobbies are different and we've placed camping and drawing). But this would mean that the person who's hobby is reading is to the left of the person who's sport is rugby, which contradicts rule 2. So, reading cannot be in the second position.

8. Therefore, reading must be in the fifth position. The only hobby left for the first position is chess.

So, the final solution table is:

3. From rule 5, the person eating tomato is between the person eating watermelon and the designer, so the watermelon must be in position 2.
4. From rule 4, the person eating zucchini is between the person eating grapes and the person eating tomato, so the zucchini must be in position 1.

Lv10-3x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 movie genres (disaster, drama, epic) and 3 music genres (blues, house, punk), and 3 nationalities (Canadian, Italian, Nigerian), we can assign one of each to each row and column.

2. From rule 1, the person watching house music is to the right of the person watching drama movies. So, we can place house in column 3 and drama in column 2. Let's place drama in row 2 for now.

3. From rule 2, the person watching disaster movies is either to the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since we placed drama in row 2, disaster can be in row 1 or row 3. Let's place disaster in row 1 for now.

4. From rule 4, the Italian is to the right of the person watching drama movies. So, the Italian cannot be in row 1 or row 2. Therefore, the Italian must be in row 3.

5. From rule 5, the Italian is between the Nigerian and the fan of blues. Since the Italian is in row 3, the Nigerian and the fan of blues must be in rows 1 and 2. The Nigerian cannot be in row 2 because the Italian is to the right of the person watching drama movies, so the Nigerian must be in row 1.

6. From rule 6, the Italian is not the fan of house. Since the Italian is in row 3, the fan of house must be in row 1 or row 2. But the fan of house is to the right of the person watching drama movies, so the fan of house cannot be in row 1 (because the Nigerian is there). Therefore, the fan of house is in row 2.

7. From rule 3, the fan of punk is not to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is in row 3, the fan of punk must be in row 1 or row 2. But the fan of house is in row 2, so the fan of punk must be in row 1.

8. Now we know that the nationalities are in the first column, so the Canadian must be in row 1.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-5x4-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions and the corresponding hobbies, music-genres, pets, sports, and transport for each person.

Let's start by assigning numbers to the positions (1 to 4, from left to right) and assigning variables for each person's hobby, music-genre, pet, sport, and transport.

|               |       1       |   2    |     3      |     4     |
| Hobby         | B (baking)    | F (filmmaking) | H (hiking) | P (puzzles) |
| Music-Genre   | C (classical) | M (metal)   | P (punk)   | R (r&b)    |
| Pet           | B (bird)      | G (guinea-pig) | H (horse) | R (rat)    |
| Sport         | L (lacrosse) | R (rowing)  | S (skateboarding) | SF (surfing) |
| Transport     | B (boat)      | B (bus)     | S (ship)   | T (trike)  |

Now let's use the clues to deduce the relationships between the variables:

1. The owner of the bird is not to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
   - Since Puzzles (P) is in position 4, the bird owner cannot be in positions 2 or 3. So, the bird owner is either position 1 or 4 (B).

2. The person who's sport is rowing is the person who's hobby is hiking or the fan metal is the person who's sport is rowing or both.
   - If the person who's sport is rowing (R) is in position 1, then the hobby of position 2 (F) must be hiking (H) or the fan metal (M) must be in position 1. However, since M is not in position 1, R must be in position 2.

3. The owner of the horse is not the person who's sport is skateboarding (S).
   - Since S is in position 4, the horse owner cannot be in position 4. So, the horse owner is either position 1, 2, or 3 (H).

4. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's hobby is puzzles (P).
   - Since P is in position 4, S must be in position 4 as well.

5. The fan punk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing (R).
   - Since R is in position 2, P (punk) can be in positions 1 or 3 (P).

6. The fan r&b is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse (L).
   - Since L is not in position 1 (as per clue 5), R&B (C) must be in position 1.

7. The owner of the rat is not to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse (L).
   - Since L is in position 4, the rat owner cannot be in positions 3 or 4. So, the rat owner is either position 1 or 2 (R).

8. The person driving the trike is not the fan metal or the person who's sport is lacrosse is not the person driving the trike or both.
   - Since L is in position 4, the trike driver cannot be in position 4. So, the trike driver is either position 1, 2, or 3 (T).

9. The person driving the ship is not to the right of the owner of the rat (R).
   - Since R is in position 1 or 2, the ship driver cannot be in positions 3 or 4. So, the ship driver is either position 1 or 2 (S).

10. The owner of the horse is not to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (F).
    - Since F is in position 2, the horse owner cannot be in position 1. So, the horse owner is either position 3 or 4 (H).

11. The fan r&b is the person who's sport is surfing (SF).
    - Since SF is in position 3, C (r&b) must be in position 3.

12. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the fan metal or the fan metal is the person who's sport is rowing or both.
    - Since R is in position 2, F (filmmaking) must be in position 1 (M) or position 2 (M). However, since M is already assigned to position 1, F must be in position 2.

13. The person driving the ship is in an odd position.
    - Since the ship driver is in position 1 or 2 (S), the ship driver is in position 1 (S).

14. The person driving the bus is not the person who's sport is lacrosse or the owner of the bird is not the person driving the bus or both.
    - Since L is in position 4, the bus driver cannot be in position 4. So, the bus driver is either position 1, 2, or 3 (B).

15. The person who's hobby is baking is in an even position.
    - Since the baker is not in position 1 (as per clue 14), the baker is either position 2 or 4 (B).

16. The owner of the guinea-pig is not the person who's hobby is baking or the owner of the guinea-pig is not the person who's sport is rowing.
    - Since B is in position 2 or 4 (B), the guinea-pig owner cannot be in position 2 (G). So, the guinea-pig owner is in position 4 (G).

17. The owner of the horse is the person who's sport is rowing or the person driving the boat is the owner of the horse or both.
    - Since R is in position 2, H (horse) must be in position 2 or 4 (H). However, since H is already assigned to position 3, H must be in position 2 (H). This means the person driving the boat (B) must be the horse owner (H).

18. The person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the left of the fan punk (P).
    - Since P is in position 3, L cannot be in position 1 or 2 (L). So, L must be in position 4 (L).

19. The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere between the person who's hobby is hiking (H) and the person driving the boat (B).
    - Since H is in position 3 and B is in position 4, G must be in position 2 or 3 (G). However, since G is already assigned to position 4, G must be in position 3 (G). This means the person who's hobby is hiking (H) must be in position 2 (H).

20. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (S).
    - Since S is in position 4, R must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (R). However, since R is already assigned to position 2, R cannot be in position 3 (R). So, R must be in position 1 (R). This means P (puzzles) must be in position 3 (P).

21. The fan metal is not to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking (H).
    - Since H is in position 2, M cannot be in position 3 or 4 (M). So, M must be in position 1 (M).

22. The person driving the trike is the fan r&b.
    - Since C (r&b) is in position 3, T must be in position 3 (T).

23. The person driving the boat is on the far right.
    - Since B is in position 4 (as per clue 17), this clue is redundant.

24. The owner of the guinea-pig is not the person who's hobby is baking or the fan punk is not the owner of the guinea-pig.
    - Since G is in position 4 and P is in position 3, neither of these conditions can be true. This clue is contradictory and invalid.

25. The fan r&b is not to the right of the person driving the boat (B).
    - Since B is in position 4, C (r&b) cannot be in position 3 or 4 (C). So, C must be in position 1 or 2 (C). However, since C is already assigned to position 1, C cannot be in position 2 (C). This clue is contradictory and invalid.

Now that we have assigned all the variables, the final solution table is:

|               |       1       |   2    |     3      |     4     |
| Hobby         | M (metal)     | F (filmmaking) | H (hiking) | P (puzzles) |
| Music-Genre   | C (classical) | M (metal)   | P (punk)   | R (r&b)    |
| Pet           | B (bird)      | G (guinea-pig) | H (horse) | R (rat)    |
| Sport         | L (lacrosse) | R (rowing)  | S (skateboarding) | SF (surfing) |
| Transport     | B (boat)      | B (bus)     | T (trike)  | S (ship)   |

Lv4-5x5-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the jobs to the people. We know the teacher is not on the far left or right (12, 11), so they can't be the first or last person. Let's place the teacher in the middle (position 3). The remaining jobs can be distributed among the other positions.

2. The teacher is on the left of the Malaysian (2). So, the Malaysian can't be in position 3, and must be either 1 or 5. Let's place the Malaysian in position 1 for now.

3. The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig (3). The guinea-pig owner can't be in position 1 (since the Malaysian is there), so they must be in position 5.

4. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the Malaysian (13). Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the person watching family movies can't be in position 2 or 3. Let's place them in position 4 for now.

5. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies (15). Since the person watching mystery movies is in position 5, the person watching family movies can't be in position 1 or 3. So, they must be in position 2.

6. The person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies (7). Since the person watching adventure movies is in position 10 (from 18 and 10), the person watching spy movies can't be in position 9 or 11. Let's place them in position 8 for now.

7. The person watching spy movies is the owner of the goat (8). So, the goat owner must be in position 8.

8. The turkish is on the right of the owner of the goat (16). So, the turkian must be in position 4 or 5. Since the person watching family movies is in position 2, the turkish can't be in position 5. So, the turkish is in position 4.

9. The pakistani is on the left of the egyptian (6). Since the teacher is in position 3, the pakistani can't be in position 1 or 3. Let's place the pakistani in position 5 for now.

10. The person watching adventure movies is the person who's sport is tennis (10 and 18). So, the person playing tennis must be in position 1.

11. The person playing tennis is the architect (18). So, the architect is in position 1.

12. The person watching mystery movies is the person watching mystery movies (20). So, the person watching mystery movies is in position 5.

13. The person watching spy movies is in the middle (17). So, the person watching spy movies is in position 3.

14. The owner of the hamster is in an odd position (14). Since the positions 1, 3, and 5 are filled, the hamster owner must be in position 2.

15. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the malaysian (13). Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the person watching family movies can't be in position 2. So, the person watching family movies is in position 3.

16. The pilot is on the left or right of the teacher (12). Since the teacher is in position 3, the pilot can't be in position 1 or 3. Let's place the pilot in position 2 for now.

17. The nurse is on the right of the teacher (11). Since the teacher is in position 3, the nurse must be in position 4.

18. The person watching soccer is between the egyptian and the teacher (4). Since the teacher is in position 3 and the egyptian can't be in position 1 (since the Malaysian is there), the person playing soccer must be in position 2.

19. The brazilian is on the far right (19). Since the nurse is in position 4, the brazilian must be in position 5.

20. The person playing golf is on the left or right of the person playing tennis (1). Since the person playing tennis is in position 1, the person playing golf can't be in position 2. So, the person playing golf is in position 3.

21. The person playing sailing is on the left or right of the person playing golf (not specified in the puzzle, but since there are only 5 positions, it must be true). Since the person playing golf is in position 3, the person playing sailing must be in position 2.

22. The person playing water-polo is on the left of the person playing golf (5). Since the person playing golf is in position 3, the person playing water-polo must be in position 1.

23. The person playing tennis is the architect (18). So, the architect is in position 1.

24. The person playing golf is on the left or right of the person playing adventure movies (3). Since the person playing adventure movies is in position 10, the person playing golf can't be in position 9 or 11. So, the person playing golf is in position 10.

25. The person playing sailing is in position 2.

26. The person playing water-polo is in position 1.

Lv4-1x3-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three beverages: cola, fanta, and iced-tea.

2. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking cola. This means that either iced-tea is in position 2 or 3, and cola is in position 1.

3. The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position. Since positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3, and an odd position means either 1 or 3, iced-tea cannot be in position 2. So, iced-tea is either in position 1 or 3.

4. If iced-tea were in position 1, then cola would have to be in position 3, but that would mean both iced-tea and cola are in even positions, which contradicts the fact that iced-tea is in an odd position.

5. Therefore, iced-tea must be in position 3. Since iced-tea is on the right of cola, cola must be in position 1.

6. The remaining beverage, fanta, must be in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who's sport is soccer is in position 4, which means row 4.

2. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is in the middle (position 3), it can't be soccer (position 4). So, let's assume the hobby of position 1, 2, or 5 is collecting.

3. The person who's hobby is collecting is in position 3, so the sport of position 3 can't be soccer (position 4).

4. Let's place the hobby of position 1, 2, or 5 as collecting. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the person who's sport is soccer, video-games can't be in position 1 (left of soccer). So, let's place video-games in position 5.

5. Now, the person who's hobby is video-games is in position 5, and the person who's sport is soccer is in position 4. Since video-games is on the left or right of soccer, soccer must be in position 3.

6. The person who's hobby is collecting is in position 3, so the sport of position 3 is soccer. The person who's sport is soccer is in position 4, so the sport of position 1, 2, or 5 can't be soccer.

7. The person watching superhero movies is the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is the hobby of position 10 (soccer is in position 3), the person watching superhero movies is in position 10.

8. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since snowboarding is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (position 3), adventure movies can't be in position 4 (right of position 3). So, let's place adventure movies in position 2.

9. The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since video-games is in position 5, reading can't be in position 5. So, let's place reading in position 1.

10. The person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since superhero movies are in position 10, horror movies can't be in position 10. So, let's place horror movies in position 9.

11. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since action movies haven't been placed yet, let's place action movies in position 8 (left of horror movies).

12. The person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since adventure movies are in position 2, western movies can't be in position 1 (left of position 2). So, let's place western movies in position 6.

13. The person who's sport is cycling is the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is the hobby of position 10, the person who's sport is cycling is in position 10.

14. The person who's sport is rugby is the person who's hobby is video-games. Since video-games is in position 5, the person who's sport is rugby is in position 5.

15. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (position 3). So, let's place snowboarding in position 6 (right of position 3).

16. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since action movies are in position 8, horror movies are in position 9 (right of position 8).

17. The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since superhero movies are in position 10, action movies are in position 8 (left of position 10).

18. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since snowboarding is in position 6, adventure movies are in position 2 (left of position 6).

Lv7-5x5-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the hobbies, beverages, movie-genres, music-genres, and pets. We'll use the same number for each category to make it easier to refer to them.

   Hobby: 1 (sudoku), 2 (chess), 3 (filmmaking), 4 (magic-tricks), 5 (sudoku)
   Beverage: 6 (almond-milk), 7 (lemonade), 8 (milk), 9 (mirinda), 10 (sprite)
   Movie-Genre: 11 (animation), 12 (documentary), 13 (family), 14 (musical), 15 (time-travel)
   Music-Genre: 16 (d&b), 17 (disco), 18 (funk), 19 (house), 20 (reggae)
   Pet: 21 (cat), 22 (frog), 23 (goldfish), 24 (guinea-pig), 25 (lizard)

2. From rule 1, we know that d&b is to the left of funk. So, let's place d&b first, and funk second.

   Music-Genre: 16 (d&b), 18 (funk)

3. From rule 3, we know that chess is not the fan of funk. So, chess cannot be in the second position. Let's place chess in the third position.

   Hobby: 2 (chess)

4. From rule 4, we know that reggae is between guinea-pig and lizard. Since the position of the guinea-pig is even (rule 18), the lizard must be in an odd position. The only odd position left is the first position. So, let's place the lizard first.

   Pet: 25 (lizard)

5. From rule 5, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the lizard. So, let's place lemonade in the second position.

   Beverage: 7 (lemonade)

6. From rule 6, we know that filmmaking is not the person drinking lemonade. So, filmmaking cannot be in the second position. Let's place filmmaking in the fourth position.

   Hobby: 3 (filmmaking)

7. From rule 7, we know that the person watching family movies is on the far left. Since the lizard is already in the first position, family movies must be in the second position.

   Movie-Genre: 13 (family)

8. From rule 8, we know that the lizard is to the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the lizard is in the first position, documentary movies must be in the third position.

   Movie-Genre: 12 (documentary)

9. From rule 9, we know that the fan of reggae is not the person who's hobby is chess. Since the chess fan is in the third position, reggae cannot be in the first position (where the lizard is). So, let's place reggae in the fifth position.

   Music-Genre: 20 (reggae)

10. From rule 10, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the lizard is in the first position and the guinea-pig's position is even (rule 18), the person drinking sprite must be in the third position.

    Beverage: 10 (sprite)

11. From rule 11, we know that the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since the lizard is in the first position, the goldfish must be in the second position.

    Pet: 23 (goldfish)

12. From rule 12, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is not the owner of the cat. Since the lizard is in the first position and the guinea-pig is in the third position, the cat cannot be in the first or third position. So, let's place the cat in the fifth position.

    Pet: 21 (cat)

13. From rule 13, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the fan of house. Since the person drinking sprite is in the third position and the lizard is in the first position, the fan of house must be in the fourth position.

    Music-Genre: 19 (house)

14. From rule 14, we know that the owner of the frog is the person watching time-travel movies. Since the cat is in the fifth position, the frog must be in the fourth position.

    Pet: 22 (frog)
    Movie-Genre: 15 (time-travel)

15. From rule 15, we know that the fan of disco is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the lizard is in the first position, the goldfish is in the second position, the cat is in the fifth position, and the frog is in the fourth position, the person drinking mirinda must be in the third position.

    Beverage: 9 (mirinda)

16. From rule 16, we know that the fan of funk is not the person who's hobby is camping. Since chess is in the third position, camping cannot be in the first position (where the lizard is) or the third position (where the chess fan is). So, let's place camping in the fifth position.

    Hobby: 4 (camping)

17. From rule 17, we know that the fan of funk is somewhere to the left of the fan of house. Since the fan of house is in the fourth position, the fan of funk must be in the second or third position. Since the lizard is in the first position and the goldfish is in the second position, the fan of funk must be in the third position.

    Music-Genre: 18 (funk)

18. From rule 18, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig is in an even position. Since the lizard is in the first position and the goldfish is in the second position, the guinea-pig must be in the fourth position.

    Pet: 24 (guinea-pig)

19. From rule 19, we know that the person watching animation movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard is in the first position and the guinea-pig is in the fourth position, the person watching animation movies must be in the fifth position.

    Movie-Genre: 11 (animation)

20. From rule 20, we know that the owner of the frog is somewhere between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the lizard is in the first position, the goldfish is in the second position, the cat is in the fifth position, and the guinea-pig is in the fourth position, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in the third position and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in the fifth position.

    Hobby: 5 (magic-tricks)

21. From rule 21, we know that the person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in the third position and the lizard is in the first position, the person watching animation movies must be in the first position.

    Movie-Genre: 11 (animation)

Lv6-5x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them P1 to P5 from left to right.

2. From rule 15, we know that P1 (the musical movie fan) is not driving the snowmobile. So, P1 can't be in position 3.

3. From rule 16, we know that the person driving the trike is to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since P1 can't be in position 3, P5 (the trike driver) can't be in position 5. So, P5 must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

4. From rule 17, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding (P4, according to rule 6) is not the owner of the chinchilla. So, the chinchilla can't be with P4. Therefore, P4 can't be in position 5.

5. From rule 18, we know that the person driving the snowmobile (not P1, as we found in step 2) is to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since P5 can't be in position 5, P5 can't be the tennis player. So, P5 can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, P5 must be in position 4.

6. From rule 19, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding (P4) is in an odd position. Since P5 is in position 4, P1, P2, and P3 must be even positions.

7. From rule 20, we know that the person watching sports movies (not P1, as we found in step 2) is to the left of the owner of the turtle. Since P5 can't be in position 1, P5 can't be the turtle owner. So, the turtle can't be with P5. Therefore, P5 can't be in position 2. So, P5 must be in position 4.

8. Now we know that P5 is in position 4, so P1, P2, and P3 are in positions 1, 2, and 3.

9. From rule 21, we know that the person watching musical movies (P1) is not the fan of blues. So, the blues fan can't be in position 1.

10. From rule 22, we know that the owner of the ferret (P2, according to rule 22) is watching spy movies.

11. From rule 23, we know that the owner of the hedgehog (not P2, as we found in step 10) is in an odd position. So, the hedgehog can't be with P5 (in position 4). Therefore, P5 can't be the owner of the hedgehog. So, the hedgehog can't be in position 2 or 4.

12. From rule 24, we know that the person driving the tram (not P1, as we found in step 2) is to the left or right of the fan of hip-hop. Since P5 can't be the fan of hip-hop (in position 4), the fan of hip-hop can't be in position 5. So, the fan of hip-hop can't be in position 5.

13. From rule 25, we know that the person watching superhero movies is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since P5 can't be the boat driver (in position 3), the boat driver can't be to the left of the superhero movie watcher. So, the boat driver can't be in position 1 or 2.

14. From rule 26, we know that the fan of blues is to the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle can't be with P5 (in position 4), the turtle can't be to the right of the fan of blues. So, the fan of blues can't be in position 5.

15. Now we know that the fan of blues can't be in position 5, so the fan of blues can be in position 1 or 2. Since P1 can't be the fan of blues (as we found in step 9), the fan of blues must be in position 2.

16. Since the fan of blues is in position 2, the turtle can't be with P2 (the fan of blues). So, the turtle can't be in position 2.

17. From rule 3, we know that the fan of jazz is in an odd position. Since P1 can't be the fan of blues and can't be in position 1 (as we found in step 9), P1 must be the fan of jazz.

18. Since P1 is the fan of jazz (in position 1), the person driving the snowmobile (not P1) can't be in position 1. So, the snowmobile driver can't be in position 1.

19. From rule 4, we know that the person watching musical movies is to the right of the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues is in position 2, the person watching musical movies can't be in position 1.

20. From rule 5, we know that the fan of punk is to the right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in position 1, the fan of punk can't be in position 1.

21. From rule 13, we know that the owner of the ferret is to the left or right of the owner of the frog. Since the owner of the ferret (P2) is in position 2, the owner of the frog can't be in position 1 or 2.

22. From rule 14, we know that the person watching musical movies is to the left or right of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the ferret is in position 2, the person watching musical movies can't be in position 1.

23. From rule 1, we know that the people prefer 5 different movie-genres. Since we have already placed the fans of blues, jazz, and musical, the remaining genres are documentary, sports, spy, and superhero.

24. From rule 11, we know that the fan of hip-hop is not the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the ferret (P2) is not the chinchilla owner (as we found in step 10), the chinchilla can't be with P2. So, the chinchilla can't be in position 2.

25. From rule 12, we know that the person watching documentary movies is to the right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in position 1, the person watching documentary movies can't be in position 1.

26. From rule 19, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding (P4) is in an odd position. Since P5 is in position 4, P1, P2, and P3 must be even positions. Since P1 is the fan of jazz (in position 1), P3 must be an even position.

27. From rule 2, we know that the person who's music genre is blues is in an odd position. Since P1 is the fan of jazz (in position 1), P3 can't be the blues fan. So, P3 must be the person watching documentary movies (as we found in step 26).

28. From rule 18, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since P5 is in position 4, P1, P2, and P3 are in positions 1, 2, and 3. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret (watching spy movies), and P3 is watching documentary movies, P5 must be the tennis player.

29. From rule 16, we know that the person driving the trike is to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since P5 is the tennis player, P4 is the snowboarder, and P3 is watching documentary movies, P1, P2, and P4 are in positions 1, 2, and 4. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, and P4 is the snowboarder, P3 must be the person watching sports movies.

30. From rule 20, we know that the person watching sports movies is to the left of the owner of the turtle. Since P3 is watching sports movies, P5 (the tennis player) can't be the turtle owner. So, the turtle can't be in position 4.

31. From rule 23, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is in an odd position. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, P3 is watching sports movies, and P5 is the tennis player, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 1.

32. From rule 9, we know that the person driving the trike is to the left of the person who's sport is sailing. Since P3 is watching sports movies and P5 is the tennis player, P1, P2, and P4 are in positions 1, 2, and 4. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, and P4 is the snowboarder, P3 must be the person driving the trike.

33. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the person driving the tram. Since P4 is the snowboarder, P1, P2, and P3 are in positions 1, 2, and 3. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, and P3 is watching sports movies, P5 must be the person driving the tram.

34. From rule 10, we know that the person who's sport is sailing is not the owner of the turtle. Since P3 is watching sports movies and P5 is driving the tram, P1, P2, and P4 are in positions 1, 2, and 4. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, and P4 is the snowboarder, the person who's sport is sailing can't be in position 1, 2, or 4. So, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 3.

35. From rule 24, we know that the person driving the tram is to the left or right of the fan of hip-hop. Since P5 is driving the tram, P1, P2, and P4 are in positions 1, 2, and 4. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, and P4 is the snowboarder, the fan of hip-hop can't be in position 1 or 4. So, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2.

36. From rule 2, we know that the people prefer 5 different music-genres. Since we have already placed the fans of blues, jazz, and hip-hop, the remaining music genres are punk, reggae, and punk.

37. From rule 5, we know that the fan of punk is to the right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in position 1, the fan of punk can't be in position 1.

38. From rule 1, we know that the people prefer 5 different pet types. Since we have already placed the chinchilla, ferret, frog, hedgehog, and turtle, the remaining pet type is the pet of P5 (the tennis player).

39. From rule 25, we know that the person watching superhero movies is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since P5 is the tennis player, P1, P2, P3, and P4 are in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, P3 is watching sports movies, P4 is the snowboarder, and P5 is the tennis player, the person watching superhero movies can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 5.

40. From rule 26, we know that the fan of blues is to the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle is owned by P1 (the hedgehog owner), the fan of blues can't be in position 1.

41. From rule 2, we know that the people prefer 5 different music-genres. Since we have already placed the fans of blues, jazz, hip-hop, and punk, the remaining music genre is reggae.

42. From rule 40, we know that the fan of blues can't be in position 1. Since the fan of blues can't be in position 1, the fan of reggae must be in position 1.

43. From rule 41, we know that the remaining music genre is reggae. Since the fan of reggae is in position 1, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 5.

44. From rule 42, we know that the fan of blues is not in position 1. Since the fan of blues can't be in position 1, the fan of reggae must be in position 1. So, the fan of blues must be in position 2.

45. From rule 5, we know that the fan of punk is to the right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in position 1, the fan of punk can't be in position 1.

46. From rule 1, we know that the people prefer 5 different pet types. Since we have already placed the chinchilla, ferret, frog, hedgehog, and turtle, the remaining pet type is the pet of P5 (the tennis player).

47. From rule 45, we know that the fan of punk can't be in position 1. Since the fan of punk can't be in position 1, the fan of punk must be in position 3.

48. From rule 46, we know that the remaining pet type is the pet of P5 (the tennis player). Since the fan of punk is in position 3, the tennis player can't have a pet that is a chinchilla, ferret, frog, hedgehog, or turtle. So, the tennis player must have a dog.

49. From rule 2, we know that the people prefer 5 different music-genres. Since we have already placed the fans of blues, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and reggae, the music genre of P5 (the tennis player) must be country.

50. From rule 1, we know that the people prefer 5 different sports. Since we have already placed the sports of lacrosse, sailing, skiing, snowboarding, and tennis, the sport of P1 (the fan of reggae) must be golf.

51. From rule 1, we know that the people prefer 5 different means of transport. Since we have already placed the bike, boat, snowmobile, tram, and trike, the transport of P2 (the fan of blues) must be a car.

52. From rule 1, we know that the people prefer 5 different movie-genres. Since we have already placed the genres of documentary, musical, sports, spy, superhero, and the remaining music genre is country, the movie genre of P2 (the fan of blues) must be action.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv6-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person watching time-travel movies is to the right of the person drinking mirinda, we can place the mirinda drinker in the first or second position. Let's place it in the first position (1).

2. The person who's sport is baseball is between the person drinking tea and the person watching romance movies. Since mirinda is in the first position, the tea drinker must be in the second position (2). The baseball player can't be in the first position (1) because it's occupied by mirinda, so it must be in the third position (3).

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the baseball player is in the third position (3), the ice-hockey player must be in the second position (2).

4. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since the ice-hockey player is in the second position (2), the skydiving person can't be in the first position (1) because it's occupied by mirinda, so it must be in the third position (3).

5. The owner of the hamster is not the person watching romance movies. Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, and skydiving are filled, the hamster owner must be in the fourth position (4).

6. The person drinking soy-milk is not the person who's hobby is drawing (8). Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, skydiving, and the hamster owner are filled, the soy-milk drinker must be in the fifth position (5).

7. The person watching time-travel movies is to the left of the owner of the pony. Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, skydiving, the hamster owner, and soy-milk drinker are filled, the time-travel movie watcher must be in the sixth position (6).

8. The person who's sport is cycling is to the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, skydiving, the hamster owner, soy-milk drinker, and time-travel movie watcher are filled, the cyclist must be in the seventh position (7).

9. The person drinking tea is in an odd position. Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, skydiving, the hamster owner, soy-milk drinker, time-travel movie watcher, and cyclist are filled, the tea drinker must be in the fifth position (5).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

| Beverage      | mirinda | soy-milk | tea   |

Since the hobby, movie-genre, pet, and sport are not specified, we can't fill those columns. However, we know the order of the people for the given conditions.

Final solution:

Lv3-2x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different sports (golf and surfing) and two different beverages (almond-milk and water).

2. The person who surfs is either to the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is on the far right, the surfer must be on the left.

3. Now, we know the positions of the surfer and the person drinking water. The only remaining positions are for the person playing golf and the person drinking almond-milk.

4. Since there are only two sports and they are different, the person playing golf must be on the other side of the person drinking water, which means they are on the far left.

5. Now we know the positions of the golf player and the person drinking water. The last position is for the person drinking almond-milk.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Golf    | Surfing |
|  Almond-Milk | Water |
#############

This table represents the positions of the beverages and sports, with the person drinking water on the far right and the surfer on the left.

Lv8-2x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two jobs (librarian and videographer) and two means of transport (helicopter and scooter).

2. The videographer is on the far left, so the first row and first column must contain ""videographer"" and ""scooter"". Let's fill that in:

   | Job         |      1       |     2     |
   |-------------|-------------|----------|
   | Job         | videographer|          |
   | Transport   | scooter     |          |

3. Now, the librarian is not to the right of the person driving the scooter. This means the librarian cannot be in the second column (since the videographer is in the first column). So, the librarian must be in the first column:

   | Job         |      1       |     2     |
   |-------------|-------------|----------|
   | Job         | videographer| librarian |
   | Transport   | scooter     |          |

4. Since there are only two means of transport, the person driving the helicopter must be in the second row:

   | Job         |      1       |     2     |
   |-------------|-------------|----------|
   | Job         | videographer| librarian |
   | Transport   | scooter     | helicopter|

5. Now we have filled all the jobs and transport, so the final solution is:

Lv2-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the bartender is on the left of the person watching thriller movies, we can place the bartender in the first column and the person watching thriller movies in the second column. Let's assume the bartender is in the first row and the person watching thriller movies is in the second row.

   |   | 1 | 2 |
   |--|--|--|
   | Food | Eggplant | Kale | Orange |
   | Job | Bartender | Doctor | Paramedic |
   | Movie-Genre | Disaster | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Pet | Chinchilla | Goldfish | Snake |

2. The owner of the chinchilla is between the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies. Since the paramedic is in the third row, the chinchilla owner must be in the second row. So, the person watching mystery movies is in the first row.

   |   | 1 | 2 |
   |--|--|--|
   | Food | Eggplant | Chinchilla | Orange |
   | Job | Bartender | Paramedic | Doctor |
   | Movie-Genre | Disaster | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Pet | Goldfish | Snake |  |

3. The owner of the goldfish is the person eating kale. So, the goldfish owner must be in the second column. Since the paramedic is already in the second row and owns the chinchilla, the doctor must be in the second row and the goldfish owner in the first row.

   |   | 1 | 2 |
   |--|--|--|
   | Food | Kale | Chinchilla | Orange |
   | Job | Doctor | Paramedic | Bartender |
   | Movie-Genre | Mystery | Thriller | Disaster |
   | Pet | Goldfish | Snake |  |

4. The person eating eggplant is on the far left. Since the doctor is already eating kale, the eggplant must be in the first row. But we already placed the doctor in the first row. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently stated.

However, if we assume that the bartender is not on the far left, we can solve the puzzle as follows:

   |   | 1 | 2 |
   |--|--|--|
   | Food | Eggplant | Kale | Orange |
   | Job | Bartender | Doctor | Paramedic |
   | Movie-Genre | Disaster | Mystery | Thriller |

Lv4-2x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage, and the person eating cabbage is on the right of the person eating mango, we can deduce that the arrangement of the food must be either:
   - Mango - Cabbage - Pepper
   - Pepper - Cabbage - Mango

2. Now, let's consider the pet owners. The owner of the cat is between the owner of the hamster and the person eating pepper. If the arrangement of food is Mango - Cabbage - Pepper, then the owner of the cat cannot be in the first position (as there is no hamster owner before it), so the arrangement must be Pepper - Cabbage - Mango.

3. The owner of the cat is in an odd position. In the arrangement Pepper - Cabbage - Mango, the positions are 2, 3, and 4. So, the owner of the cat must be in position 3 (Cabbage).

4. Now we know that the owner of the cat is the person eating cabbage, so the owner of the cat cannot be the owner of the mouse (as per point 5). This means the owner of the mouse must be in position 1 (Pepper) or position 5 (Watermelon). But since the owner of the cat is in an odd position, the owner of the mouse must be in an even position. So, the owner of the mouse must be in position 4 (Watermelon).

5. Now we know the owner of the mouse is the person eating watermelon, so the owner of the hamster must be in position 2 (Mango).

6. Finally, the owner of the turtle is left, which means it must be in position 5 (as all other positions are occupied).

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############

Lv12-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3 and 15, the lawyer or the fisherman is on the far right. Since the nurse is not on the far right (rule 2), the lawyer must be on the far right, and the fisherman is not. So, the lawyer is in the last column (column 5) and the fisherman is in one of the first four columns.

2. From rule 1, the nurse is somewhere between the analyst and the collector. Since the lawyer is in column 5, the nurse cannot be in column 5. So, the nurse is in one of the first four columns.

3. From rule 4, the nurse is not to the right of the puzzles person. Since the nurse is not in column 5, the puzzles person must be in one of the first four columns.

4. From rule 5, the nurse is not to the left of the teacher. Since the nurse is in one of the first four columns, the teacher must be in one of the last three columns (columns 3, 4, or 5).

5. From rule 7, the cooking person is not to the right of the fantasy person. Since the teacher is in one of the last three columns, the fantasy person must be in one of the first two columns (columns 1 or 2).

6. From rule 8, the fantasy person is the accountant. So, the accountant is in one of the first two columns.

7. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is puzzles is not the person watching western movies or the person watching western movies is not the accountant. Since the accountant is in one of the first two columns and the western movies person cannot be in column 1 (because the fantasy person is there), the western movies person must be in column 2.

8. From rule 11, the sudoku person is somewhere between the teacher and the cooking person. Since the teacher is in one of the last three columns and the cooking person is not in column 5 (because the lawyer is there), the sudoku person must be in column 4.

9. From rule 13, the puzzles person is in an even position. Since the puzzles person is not in column 1 (because the fantasy person is there), the puzzles person must be in column 2 or 4. But the puzzles person cannot be in column 4 because the sudoku person is there. So, the puzzles person is in column 2.

10. From rule 10, the collector and the accountant have different parity positions. Since the accountant is in column 1, the collector must be in column 3.

11. From rule 6, the zombie person is between the action person and the puzzles person. Since the action person is in column 1 and the puzzles person is in column 2, the zombie person must be in column 3.

12. From rule 14, the drama person is on the left of the action person. Since the action person is in column 1, the drama person must be in column 2.

13. From rule 12 and 15, the western movies person is the fisherman or the lawyer. Since the fisherman is in column 2 (because the zombie person is there), the lawyer must be in column 5.

14. From rule 13, the cooking person is in an odd position. Since the accountant, the fantasy person, the puzzles person, the drama person, and the zombie person are all in even positions, the cooking person must be in column 3.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-1x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating cabbage is on the left of the person eating pear, we can place the cabbage on the far left (1st position). Let's assume the pear is in the 2nd position.

2. Now, we know that the pumpkin is between the person eating pepper and the person eating pear. Since the pear is in the 2nd position, the pumpkin can only be in the 3rd position or the 4th position. If the pumpkin were in the 3rd position, the pepper would have to be in the 4th position, but that would violate rule 3 (the person eating pepper is to the right of the person eating pumpkin). So, the pumpkin must be in the 4th position.

3. Now, the only place left for the pepper is the 3rd position.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv5-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the japanese is in an odd position and there are 3 options, they must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, since the sprite drinker is to the right of the japanese (1), the sprite drinker cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 6). So, the japanese must be in position 3.

2. Now we know the japanese is in position 3, so the sprite drinker must be in position 4 or 5. But since the sprite drinker is to the right of the japanese, they cannot be in position 4 (as it would violate rule 5). So, the sprite drinker must be in position 5.

3. Now we know the sprite drinker is in position 5, so the almond-milk drinker must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But since the almond-milk drinker is to the left of the sprite drinker (5), they cannot be in position 5. So, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 1 or 2. However, if the almond-milk drinker was in position 1, it would violate rule 6 (the sprite drinker is to the right of the almond-milk drinker). So, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 2.

4. Now we know the almond-milk drinker is in position 2, so the water drinker must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the water drinker is to the left of the sprite drinker (5), they cannot be in position 5. So, the water drinker must be in position 1 or 3. However, if the water drinker was in position 1, it would violate rule 5 (the thai is to the right of the water drinker). So, the water drinker must be in position 3.

5. Now we know the water drinker is in position 3, so the thai must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But since the thai is to the right of the water drinker (3), they cannot be in position 3. So, the thai must be in position 1, 2, or 5. However, if the thai was in position 1, it would violate rule 4 (the japanese is in an odd position). So, the thai must be in position 5.

6. Now we know the thai is in position 5, so the person eating watermelon must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the watermelon eater is to the left of the hamster owner (as the hamster owner is to the right of the thai), they cannot be in position 5. So, the watermelon eater must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, if the watermelon eater was in position 1, it would violate rule 2 (the watermelon eater is to the left of the hamster owner). So, the watermelon eater must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But if the watermelon eater was in position 4, it would violate rule 5 (the thai is to the right of the water drinker, who is to the right of the watermelon eater). So, the watermelon eater must be in position 3.

7. Now we know the watermelon eater is in position 3, so the person eating corn must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But since the person eating cranberry is between the person eating corn and the owner of the snake, the person eating corn must be in position 1 or 4. However, if the person eating corn was in position 1, it would violate rule 2 (the watermelon eater is to the left of the hamster owner, who is to the right of the person eating corn). So, the person eating corn must be in position 4.

8. Now we know the person eating corn is in position 4, so the person eating cranberry must be in position 2.

9. Now we know the person eating cranberry is in position 2, so the owner of the snake must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the owner of the ferret is to the right of the thai (who is in position 5), the owner of the snake cannot be in position 5. So, the owner of the snake must be in position 1 or 3. However, if the owner of the snake was in position 1, it would violate rule 7 (the person eating cranberry is between the person eating corn and the owner of the snake). So, the owner of the snake must be in position 3.

10. Now we know the owner of the snake is in position 3, so the owner of the ferret must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But since the owner of the ferret is to the right of the thai (who is in position 5), the owner of the ferret cannot be in position 5. So, the owner of the ferret must be in position 1, 2, or 4. However, if the owner of the ferret was in position 1, it would violate rule 3 (the owner of the ferret is to the right of the thai, who is to the right of the person drinking water, who is in position 3). So, the owner of the ferret must be in position 4.

1. We know that the nigerian is the teacher, so we can place the teacher in the 4th row and 1st column (Teacher, Nigerian).

2. The person drinking lemonade is between the malaysian and the nigerian. Since the nigerian is already placed, the lemonade must be either between the malaysian and the first position or between the second position and the nigerian. Let's try placing the lemonade between the malaysian and the first position (Lemonade, Malaysian, Nigerian).

3. The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the engineer. Since the lemonade is already placed, the engineer must be in the second or third column. Let's try placing the engineer in the second column (Designer, Engineer, Fisherman, Teacher).

4. The designer is the person drinking 7up, so we can place the 7up in the first row and first column (Designer, 7up).

5. The canadian is on the left of the nigerian, so the canadian must be in the first column. Since the designer is already in the first column, the canadian must be in the first row (Canadian, Designer, Engineer, Fisherman, Teacher).

6. The fisherman is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the lemonade is already in the second column, the almond-milk must be in the first or third column. Let's try placing the almond-milk in the third column (Canadian, Designer, Almond-milk, Engineer, Fisherman, Teacher).

7. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the fisherman. Since the almond-milk is already placed, the fisherman must be in the fourth column (Canadian, Designer, Almond-milk, Fisherman, Teacher).

8. The engineer is on the right of the pakistani. Since the engineer is already placed, the pakistani must be in the third column (Canadian, Designer, Almond-milk, Engineer, Pakistani, Teacher).

9. We have placed all the nationalities, so there are no more constraints for nationality.

3. The person who's hobby is fishing is the person watching sports movies. Since the American is not watching sports movies, it must be either person 1 or 2. Let's assume person 1 is fishing. So, Hobby 1 is fishing, and Movie-Genre 1 is sports.

Lv12-5x5-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's the solution:

1. Since the person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right, let's assume the person drinking 7up is in position 1 (far left). This means the person drinking 7up is not a hobby, job, music-genre, or transport.

2. The fan electronic is not to the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 1, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2. So, sprite is a drink, and the fan electronic is not in position 3, 4, or 5.

3. The lawyer and the person who's hobby is reading have different parity positions. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 1 (odd), the lawyer must be in an even position.

4. The person who's hobby is cooking is in an odd position. Since the lawyer is in an even position, the person who's hobby is cooking cannot be in position 2 (since the person drinking sprite is there). So, the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3, 5, or 7.

5. The fan punk is somewhere between the person who's hobby is collecting and the fan salsa. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 1 or 2, and the fan salsa must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

6. The person who's hobby is fishing is the person driving the motorbike. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3, the person who's hobby is fishing cannot be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. So, the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 6. This means the motorbike is a transport.

7. The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 6, the person driving the scooter is in position 5.

8. The lawyer is not the person drinking water or the lawyer is not the fan punk or both. Since the lawyer is in an even position, the lawyer cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since those positions are already taken). So, the lawyer is in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the lawyer is not the fan punk, the lawyer cannot be in position 6 (since the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 6). So, the lawyer is in position 2 or 4.

9. The person driving the skateboard is not the fan electronic or the person driving the skateboard is not the person who's hobby is cooking or both. Since the person driving the scooter is in position 5, the person driving the skateboard cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, the person driving the skateboard is in position 6.

10. The person who's hobby is reading is not the fan electronic. Since the lawyer is in position 2, the person who's hobby is reading cannot be in position 2.

11. The fan r&b is not the chef or the person driving the motorbike is not the fan r&b or both. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3, the fan r&b cannot be in position 3. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 6, the person driving the motorbike is not in position 6. So, the fan r&b is in position 5.

12. The fan punk is not the person drinking soy-milk or the fan punk is not the person driving the skateboard or both. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in position 2. Since the person driving the skateboard is in position 6, the fan punk cannot be in position 6.

13. The coach and the person who's hobby is fishing have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 6 (even), the coach must be in an even position.

14. The person driving the scooter and the person who's hobby is reading have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the scooter is in position 5 (odd), the person who's hobby is reading must be in an odd position.

15. The fan soul is somewhere to the left of the fan salsa. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in an odd position, the fan salsa cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the fan salsa is in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3, the fan soul cannot be in position 3. So, the fan soul is in position 1, 2, or 4.

16. The fan punk is the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in an odd position, the fan punk is in position 1, 3, or 5.

17. The musician is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the fan punk is in position 1 (odd), the musician must be in an even position.

18. The person who's hobby is reading is not the coach or the person driving the skateboard is not the person who's hobby is reading or both. Since the coach is in an even position, the person who's hobby is reading cannot be in position 2 (since the person driving the scooter is there). So, the person who's hobby is reading is in position 4 or 6. Since the person driving the skateboard is in position 6, the person who's hobby is reading cannot be in position 6. So, the person who's hobby is reading is in position 4.

19. The person drinking 7up is not the person who's hobby is reading or the person drinking 7up is not the person driving the skateboard or both. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in position 4, the person drinking 7up cannot be in position 4. Since the person driving the skateboard is in position 6, the person drinking 7up cannot be in position 6. So, the person drinking 7up is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

20. The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in position 4, the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 1, 2, or 3.

21. The person drinking coffee is the fan electronic. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3, the person drinking coffee cannot be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. So, the person drinking coffee is in position 6.

Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 1 or 2, and the fan salsa must be in position 4, 5, or 6. Since the person drinking coffee is the fan electronic, the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 1, and the fan salsa is in position 6.

28. The person drinking water is between the person drinking coffee and the lawyer. Since the person drinking coffee is in position 6 and the lawyer is in position 2, the person drinking water is in position 5.

29. The fan soul is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car. Since the fan soul is in position 1, the person driving the car cannot be in position 1. So, the person driving the car is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Lv1-1x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the dog is on the far right, so we can place it in the last column (column 5).

2. Since the owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the goldfish, and the dog is on the far right, the goldfish must be in the second-to-last column (column 4).

3. Now we know that the mouse is in the middle (column 3), as stated in point 4.

4. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the mouse, so the lizard must be in the fourth column (column 4). But we already placed the goldfish there. This means the lizard and the goldfish are in the same column, which is a contradiction because they are different pets.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as it is currently stated, as it is not possible to arrange the pets according to the given conditions. Let's try to rearrange the pets to make it solvable:

Possible rearrangement:

- Dog remains on the far right (column 5)
- Goldfish becomes the first pet (column 1)
- Lizard becomes the second pet (column 2)
- Mouse becomes the third pet (column 3)
- Frogs can be the fourth pet (column 4) or the fifth pet (column 5), it doesn't matter as long as the conditions are met.

With this rearrangement, the puzzle can be solved:

Lv8-5x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is camping is in an odd position. So, the positions for camping, board-games, collecting, and skydiving (hobbies with 4 unique options) must be 1, 3, 5, and 7 (or their reversed order). Let's assume the order is 1, 3, 5, 7 for now.

2. From rule 11, the person watching epic movies is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since the positions for hobbies are decided, the only possible position for the fish owner is 4. So, the movie-genre for position 4 is epic.

3. From rule 12, the owner of the pony is not to the right of the owner of the fish. So, the position for the pony cannot be 5 or 7. Let's assume the position for the pony is 2.

4. From rule 4, the designer is between the firefighter and the manager. Since the positions for jobs are also unique, the designer must be in position 2. So, the job for position 2 is designer.

5. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person drinking tea. Since we know the position for the pony (2), the position for tea must be 6. So, the hobby for position 6 is skydiving.

6. From rule 18, the person drinking coffee is not the firefighter. Since the position for the designer is 2, the firefighter cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 4). So, the firefighter must be in position 3. So, the job for position 3 is firefighter.

7. From rule 17, the person drinking coffee is the person who's hobby is camping. So, the hobby for position 3 is camping.

So, the pet for position 4 is guinea-pig.

10. From rule 13, the person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since we know the position for board-games (3), the position for horror movies must be 1 or 5. However, position 1 is already taken by the hobby of board-games. So, the position for horror movies is 5. So, the movie-genre for position 5 is horror.

11. From rule 16, the person who's hobby is board-games is not to the left of the person watching romance movies. Since we know the position for board-games (3), the position for romance movies must be 7 or 4. However, position 4 is already taken by the movie-genre of epic.

14. From rule 8, the person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the police-officer. Since we know the position for adventure movies (7), the position for the police-officer must be 5 or 6. However, position 5 is already taken by the hobby of collecting.

However, position 1 is already taken by the hobby of board-games. So, the position for mirinda is 5. So, the beverage for position 5 is mirinda.

17. From rule 18, the person drinking coffee is not the firefighter. We already know the position for the firefighter (3) and the coffee drinker (1). So, the position for the manager must be 2. So, the job for position 2 is manager.

18. From rule 21, the firefighter is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since we know the position for the firefighter (3) and the skydiving person (6), the position for the person watching horror movies must be 1. So, the movie-genre for position 1 is horror.

1. We know that the baking hobby cannot be in the first position (as it can't be the person watching adventure movies) and the sixth position (as it can't be the owner of the ferret). So, the baking hobby can only be in the second or third position.

2. Since the person watching action movies is in an even position, it can only be the second or fourth position. As the baking hobby can't be in the second position, the action movie-genre must be in the second position.

3. Now, we know that the board-games hobby is to the right of the hamster owner. As the hamster can't be in the first position (since the action movie-genre is in the second position), the hamster must be in the third position. So, the board-games hobby can only be in the fourth or sixth position.

4. The person watching disaster movies can't be the owner of the hamster, so the disaster movies can't be in the third position.

5. The owner of the ferret is in an even position, so the ferret can only be in the second or fourth position. But we already know that the action movie-genre is in the second position, so the ferret can't be there. Therefore, the ferret must be in the fourth position.

6. Now, the only remaining hobby for the fourth position is board-games. So, the board-games hobby is in the fourth position, and the hamster is in the third position.

7. The person watching disaster movies can't be the owner of the hamster, so it must be in the first position.

8. The only remaining hobby for the first position is card-games, and the only remaining pet for the third position is the mouse.

6. The person watching western movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting (rule 6). Since the collecting hobby cannot be in the first column, the western movies cannot be in the first row. So, the western movies can be in the second or third row.

7. The person who's hobby is reading is not the person watching western movies (rule 7). Since the western movies cannot be in the first row, the reading hobby cannot be in the first column. So, the reading hobby can be in the second or third column.

8. The software-developer is the owner of the rabbit (rule 8). Since the chinchilla is in the middle (rule 11), the rabbit cannot be in the middle. So, the rabbit can be in the first or third row.

9. The accountant is somewhere to the right of the fan of country (rule 9). Since the accountant cannot be in the second row (as per point 5), the fan of country cannot be in the second column. So, the fan of country can be in the first or third column.

10. The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies (rule 10). Since the western movies cannot be in the first row, the fantasy movies can be in the second or third row.

Now, let's arrange the information we have:

- The collecting hobby can be in the second or third column.
- The architect can be in the second or third row.
- The mystery movies can be in the second or third row.
- The funk music fan can be in the first or third column.
- The reading hobby can be in the second or third column.
- The western movies can be in the second or third row.
- The fan of country can be in the first or third column.
- The fantasy movies can be in the second or third row.
- The rabbit can be in the first or third row.

Since the chinchilla is in the middle (rule 11), the rabbit cannot be in the middle. So, the rabbit must be in the first row, and the accountant must be in the third row.

Now, let's place the architect, mystery movies, and funk music fan in the second row. This is because the architect is to the left of the person watching western movies (rule 2), and the mystery movies are to the right of the person watching mystery movies (rule 3). Also, the funk music fan is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla (rule 4), and the chinchilla is in the middle (rule 11).

Now, the only remaining options for the first row are collecting, western movies, and country music. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the accountant (rule 5), and the accountant is in the third row, the collecting hobby must be in the first row.

Since the person watching western movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting (rule 6), the western movies cannot be in the first column. So, the western movies must be in the third column.

Now, the only remaining option for the first column is reading. Since the reading hobby is not the person watching western movies (rule 7), the reading hobby must be in the second column.

Now, the only remaining option for the first row is country music. Since the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies (rule 10), the fantasy movies must be in the first column. So, the country music must be in the first row.

Now, the only remaining option for the second column is fantasy movies. Since the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies (rule 10), the fantasy movies must be in the second column.

Now, the only remaining option for the third column is the pet. Since the chinchilla is in the middle (rule 11), the pet must be in the third column.

So, the final solution table is:

| Transport     |               |          |         |

2. Let's start with the sports. We know that the skateboarder is on the left of the jet-ski driver and on the left or right of the trance fan. Let's place skateboarding in the first column (1) and put jet-ski in the third column (3). Since skateboarding is on the left of the jet-ski driver, the skateboarder must be in the first row. Now we know that the skateboarder is in the first row and third column.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

| Transport     |             |         | Jet-ski |

3. The skateboarder is on the left or right of the trance fan. Since the skateboarder is in the first row and third column, the trance fan must be in the second row. Let's place trance in the second row and second column.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

| Transport     |             |         | Jet-ski |

4. The skateboarder is on the left of the trance fan, so the skateboarder must be in column 1. Since the skateboarder is in the third row, the trance fan must be in the second row. This means that the D&B fan must be in the first row. Let's place D&B in the first row and first column.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

5. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski is in the third row, the trike must be in the fourth row. Let's place trike in the fourth row and third column.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

| Sport         | Skateboarding | Surfing  | Climbing |
| Transport     | Airplane     |         | Trike   |

6. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since the mystery movies are in the third column, the airplane must be in the second row. However, the second row is already occupied by the trance fan. This means that the mystery movies cannot be in the third column, so they must be in the first column. Let's place mystery in the first column and airplane in the second row.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

7. The person watching family movies is on the left of the fan of soul. Since the soul fan is in the third column, the family movies must be in the second column. Let's place family in the second column and second row.

| Sport         | Skateboarding | Surfing  | Climbing |
| Transport     | Airplane     | Trike    | Jet-ski |

8. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the mystery movies are in the first column and family movies are in the second column, they are not on the same column, so they must be on different rows. Since the family movies are in the second row, the mystery movies must be in the first row. Let's place mystery in the first row and first column.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

| Transport     | Airplane     | Trike    | Jet-ski |

9. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies, but we already placed the mystery movies in the first row. This means that the airplane cannot be in the second row, so it must be in the fourth row. Let's place airplane in the fourth row and first column.

| Sport         | Skateboarding | Surfing  | Climbing |
| Transport     | Airplane     | Trike    | Jet-ski |

10. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski, but we already placed the jet-ski in the third column. This means that the trike cannot be in the fourth column, so it must be in the second column. Let's place trike in the second column and second row.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

| Transport     | Airplane     | Jet-ski  |         |

11. The person watching family movies is on the left of the fan of soul. Since the soul fan is in the third column, the family movies must be in the second column. However, the second column is already occupied by the trike. This means that the family movies cannot be in the second column, so they must be in the first column. Let's place family in the first column and first row.

| Transport     | Airplane     | Jet-ski  |         |

12. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies, but we already placed the mystery movies in the first row. This means that the airplane cannot be in the second row, so it must be in the fourth row. However, the fourth row is already occupied by the skateboarder. This means that the puzzle has a contradiction and cannot be solved with the given conditions.

Therefore, the puzzle has no valid solution with the given conditions.

Lv3-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the coach is the biathlon person, let's place them in the first row, first or second column (1A or 1B).

2. If the coach is in 1A, then the person with baseball must be in 1C or 1D because the coach is to their left. If the coach is in 1B, then the person with baseball must be in 2A or 2B. Let's assume the coach is in 1A for now.

3. Since the fan of rock is on the left or right of the person with golf, and the coach is in 1A, the fan of rock can only be in 1B or 2B. If the fan of rock is in 1B, then the person with golf must be in 2A or 2C. If the fan of rock is in 2B, then the person with golf must be in 1A or 1C. Let's assume the fan of rock is in 1B for now.

4. Now, the person with golf is in 2A. Since the coach is in 1A, the person with baseball is in 1C.

5. The fan of indie is on the left or right of the person with golf, so they can only be in 1A or 1B. Since the fan of rock is in 1B, the fan of indie must be in 1A.

6. The person with rowing must be in 3A or 3B because the entrepreneur is on their left. Since the doctor is on the right of the fan of funk, the fan of funk can only be in 4A or 4B. If the fan of funk is in 4A, then the person with rowing must be in 3B. If the fan of funk is in 4B, then the person with rowing must be in 3A. Let's assume the fan of funk is in 4A for now.

7. Now, the person with rowing is in 3B. Since the doctor is on the right of the fan of funk, the doctor must be in 4B.

8. The only remaining job is the videographer. Since the doctor is in 4B, the videographer can only be in 2C or 2D. If the videographer is in 2C, then the person with baseball must be in 1D. If the videographer is in 2D, then the person with baseball must be in 1A. Since we already placed the person with baseball in 1C, the videographer must be in 2D.

9. Now we have the following arrangement:

10. The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person with biathlon. Since the coach is in 1A and the fan of indie is in 1A, the fan of reggae must be in 2B.

1. We know the person eating corn is between the owner of the dog and the person who's hobby is sudoku. Let's place the sudoku person on the far right (column 4) and the dog owner in column 1. Since corn can't be in column 4 (as it's already occupied by the sudoku person), corn must be in column 2 or 3. Let's place corn in column 3 for now.

2. The person watching epic movies is on the far left. Since the sudoku person is on the far right, the epic movie person must be in column 1.

3. The fan of salsa is the person watching epic movies. So, salsa is in column 1.

4. The fan of classical is on the left of the owner of the frog. Since the epic movie person (salsa) is in column 1, the classical fan must be in column 2.

5. The owner of the frog is between the owner of the horse and the person watching superhero movies. Since the dog owner is in column 1 and the epic movie person (salsa) is in column 1, the frog owner can't be in column 1 or 4. So, the frog owner must be in column 2 or 3. Let's place the frog owner in column 2 for now. This means the superhero movie person is in column 3.

6. The person eating grapes is the person who's hobby is singing. Since the gardening person (cauliflower) is already placed, the singing person must be in column 2 or 4. Let's place the singing person in column 4 for now. This means the grapes person is in column 2.

7. The owner of the pony is the person eating grapes. So, the pony owner is in column 2.

8. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the blues fan. Since the superhero movie person (column 3) and the pony owner (column 2) are already placed, the time-travel movie person must be in column 1 or 4. Let's place the time-travel movie person in column 4 for now. This means the blues fan is in column 3.

9. The person who's hobby is gardening is the person eating cauliflower. So, the gardening person is in column 1.

Now, let's check the consistency of the table:
- All food, hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, and pets are unique.
- The conditions 1-11 are satisfied.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-1x4-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the Chinese is on the far right, we know that the nationalities must be arranged as follows: ______ Chinese.

2. The Chinese is on the left or right of the Thai. If the Thai were on the far left, the Chinese would have to be on the far right, which contradicts the first point. So, the Thai must be in the second or third position. Let's consider the Thai in the second position for now: ______ Thai _ Chinese.

3. The Colombian is in an odd position. Since we have already placed two nationalities, the Colombian must be in the third position: ______ Thai _ Colombian _ Chinese.

4. Now, we have three nationalities placed, and the fourth one must be Brazilian. The only remaining position is the first one: Brazilian _ Thai _ Colombian _ Chinese.

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |  3   |    4    |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Thai     | Colombian | Chinese |
```

Lv7-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 items in each category, we can represent the positions with numbers from 1 to 4.

2. From point 2, the person eating blueberry (Nigerian) must be in an odd position. So, Blueberry cannot be in position 1 or 4.

3. From point 3, the person drinking sprite is not the person eating cauliflower. Since there are only 4 items, sprite cannot be in position 1 (as it would be next to cauliflower in position 2). So, Sprite cannot be in position 1.

4. From point 4, the person drinking water is the person eating pepper. Since the person eating pepper is the polish (from point 6), Water must be in position 3 (as it is the only position left for Pepper).

5. From point 5, the person eating blueberry (Nigerian) is the nigerian. Since we know that Blueberry is not in position 1 or 4, and it's not in position 2 (as it would be next to Sprite), Blueberry must be in position 4.

6. From point 6, the person eating pepper is the polish. Since we know that Pepper is in position 3, the Polish is in position 3.

7. From point 7, the person drinking sprite is on the right of the Mexican. Since we know that Sprite is not in position 1, Sprite must be in position 2 or 4. But if Sprite was in position 4, it would be on the left of the Mexican (as the Mexican is the only one left to be placed), which contradicts point 7. So, Sprite must be in position 2.

8. From point 8, the person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the Mexican. Since we know that Blueberry is on the far left (position 4), Raspberry cannot be in position 1 (as it would be on the far right). So, Raspberry must be in position 2 or 3. But if Raspberry was in position 2, it would be on the left of the Mexican (as the Mexican is the only one left to be placed), which contradicts point 8. So, Raspberry must be in position 3.

9. From point 9, the person drinking 7up is somewhere between the person eating raspberry and the person drinking sprite. Since we know that Raspberry is in position 3 and Sprite is in position 2, 7up must be in position 1 or 2 or 4. But if 7up was in position 1, it would be on the left of Raspberry (as Raspberry is in position 3), which contradicts point 9. So, 7up must be in position 4.

10. From point 10, the nigerian (who is eating Blueberry) is on the left or right of the person eating pepper. Since we know that Blueberry is in position 4 and Pepper is in position 3, the nigerian (Blueberry) can be in position 2 or 4. But if the nigerian was in position 2, it would contradict point 2 (as the positions are numbered from 1 to 4 and 2 is an even position). So, the nigerian must be in position 4.
