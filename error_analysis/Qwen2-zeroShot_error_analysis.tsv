Lv5-2x4-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.
2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies.
3. The person who's hobby is card-games is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching epic movies.
4. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies.
5. The person watching romance movies is the person who's hobby is skydiving.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 5:
- The person with the hobby of skydiving has the hobby of romance.
- Therefore, Skydiving -> Romance.

#### Clue 1:
- Card-games is on the left of singing.
- This means if we place Card-games in position 1, then singing must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- If we place Card-games in position 2, then singing must be in position 3 or 4.
- If we place Card-games in position 3, then singing must be in position 4.

#### Clue 3:
- Card-games is between the person watching romance (Skydiving) and the person watching epic movies.
- Since Skydiving is Romance, this means Card-games must be in position 1, and Epic must be in position 3 or 4.

#### Combining Clues 1 and 3:
- If Card-games is in position 1, then Epic can only be in position 3 or 4.
- Since Skydiving (Romance) is between Card-games and Epic, Epic cannot be in position 3 (because it would not leave room for Skydiving). Thus, Epic must be in position 4.

- Therefore, the sequence so far is:
  - Position 1: Card-games
  - Position 2: (unknown)
  - Position 3: (unknown)
  - Position 4: Epic

#### Clue 2:
- Woodworking is to the right of Family movies.
- Given the positions we have, Family cannot be in position 4 (Epic), so Family must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 4:
- Family is on the left or right of Romance.
- Since Romance is in position 4, Family must be in position 3.

- Therefore, the sequence is:
  - Position 1: Card-games
  - Position 2: Family
  - Position 3: Romance
  - Position 4: Epic

#### Final Verification:
- Card-games (position 1) is indeed on the left of singing (position 2, 3, or 4).
- Woodworking is to the right of Family (position 3).
- Card-games is between Romance (position 3) and Epic (position 4).
- Family is on the left of Romance.

12. **Clue 12**: The owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
13. **Clue 13**: The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of indie.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. From **Clue 7**, the person eating pepper is the fan of house.
2. From **Clue 2** and **Clue 10**, the person eating cucumber cannot be the fan of house. Therefore, the fan of house must be eating pepper.
3. From **Clue 1**, the fan of classical cannot be to the left of the person eating cauliflower.
4. From **Clue 5**, the owner of the pony is between the fan of house (pepper) and the person eating cauliflower.
5. Since the fan of house (pepper) is at position 4, the owner of the pony must be at either position 2 or 3.
6. From **Clue 5**, the person eating cauliflower cannot be at position 1 or 2 (since the owner of the pony would have to be to the left).
7. From **Clue 3**, the person eating cauliflower must be to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
8. From **Clue 6**, the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person eating grapes.
9. From **Clue 11**, the person eating blueberry cannot be to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
10. From **Clue 12**, the owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
11. From **Clue 8**, the fan of electronic is on the left or right of the fan of house (pepper), so it could be at position 1, 2, or 3.
12. From **Clue 9**, the person eating pepper (house fan) is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Since the fan of house is at 4, the person eating blueberry can only be at 1, 2, or 3.
13. From **Clue 13**, the owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of indie. So the fan of indie must be at 5, and the owner of the turtle must be at 1, 2, or 3.

### Final Placement:
- **Position 1**: Owner of turtle (fan of indie)
- **Position 2**: Owner of bird (classical fan, since the owner of the hedgehog must be to the right)
- **Position 3**: Owner of hedgehog (grapes eater, since the owner of the bird is to the left)
- **Position 4**: Fan of house (pepper eater)
- **Position 5**: Owner of pony (between the fan of house and the person eating cauliflower)

### Step 1: Identify Key Information

1. **Food**:
   - Nectarine, Pepper
2. **Hobby**:
   - Collecting, Magic-Tricks
3. **Music-Genre**:
   - House, Metal
4. **Pet**:
   - Goldfish, Lizard
5. **Sport**:
   - Basketball, Rugby

### Step 2: Analyze Clues

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of Metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is Magic-Tricks.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating Pepper is on the far right.
3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the Lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is Rugby.

### Step 3: Arrange Based on Clues

#### Clue 2: The person eating Pepper is on the far right.
- This means the person in position (2, 2) eats Pepper.

#### Clue 1: The fan of Metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is Magic-Tricks.
- Since the person with the hobby of Magic-Tricks must be to the left of the fan of Metal, and given that the person in (2, 2) eats Pepper, the person in (2, 1) cannot have the hobby of Magic-Tricks (since there would be no space for the fan of Metal).

#### Clue 3: The owner of the Lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is Rugby.
- This implies that the person with the pet Lizard must be in (1, 1), and the person with the sport Rugby must be in (1, 2).

Lv7-3x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
   - This means the order could be: Drama-Thriller or Thriller-Drama.

2. **Clue 2**: The Russian is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the Australian.
   - This means the order involving the Russian must be: Soy-milk-Russian-Australian or Australian-Russian-Soy-milk.

3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching western movies.
   - This means the order involving milk and western movies must be: Western-Milk.

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching thriller movies is the Russian.
   - So, the Russian is watching thriller movies.

5. **Clue 5**: The Australian is on the right of the person watching thriller movies.
   - Since the Russian is watching thriller movies, the Australian must be on the right of the Russian.

### Putting it Together:

From Clue 4, we know:
- The Russian is watching thriller movies.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The Australian is on the right of the Russian (who is watching thriller).

So, the order for the columns must be:
1. Russian (Thriller)
2. Someone else
3. Australian

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching western movies.
- Therefore, the order involving milk and western movies must be: Western-Milk.

Given the Russian is in the middle (Clue 2), the order must fit with Clue 3 as well. Let's place these elements:

- If the Russian is in column 2, then the Australian must be in column 3.
- The person drinking milk must be in column 3 since they are to the right of the person watching western movies.

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:

- Since the Russian is watching thriller, the Australian is watching drama (to fit Clue 1).
- The only beverage left for the first column is soy-milk, which must be between the Russian and the Australian (Clue 2).

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | milk     | cola       |

Lv4-1x3-3	"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct placement of the hobbies.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person who's hobby is drawing is in an even position.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 2.

2. **The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.**
   - Since the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 2, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be either in position 1 (left) or 3 (right).

3. **The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in position 1 because the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 2. Therefore, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 3.

### Conclusion:
- Position 1: The person with the hobby of magic-tricks.
- Position 2: The person with the hobby of drawing.
- Position 3: The person with the hobby of board-games (since the only remaining hobby is board-games).

   - Beverage: Sprite and 7up
   - Movie-Genre: Mystery and Scientific
   - Nationality: Chinese and Russian
   - Sport: Rugby and Skiing
   - Transport: Quad-bike and Train

2. **Analyze the clues:**

   - **Clue 1:** The person drinking Sprite is on the left of the Chinese.
     - This means if we have the order: Sprite, ..., Chinese, then the person on the left (Sprite) is not necessarily the first but must be to the left of the Chinese.

   - **Clue 2:** The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is Skiing.
     - This means the person who does Skiing cannot be the last one, and the person who drives the quad-bike must be after them.

   - **Clue 3:** The person driving the quad-bike is the person watching Mystery movies.
     - This directly links the person driving the quad-bike to watching Mystery movies.

3. **Construct the table based on the clues:**

Let's denote:
- \( P_1 \): Person 1
- \( P_2 \): Person 2

We need to fill the table with the given constraints.

| Transport     |            |           |

### Applying Clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking Sprite is on the left of the Chinese.
   - Possible pairs: (Sprite, Chinese) or (Sprite, Other), (Other, Chinese).

2. **Clue 3:** The person driving the quad-bike is the person watching Mystery movies.
   - So, Mystery and Quad-bike must be together.

3. **Clue 2:** The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is Skiing.
   - This means Skiing cannot be the last, and Quad-bike must be after Skiing.

### Combining Clues:

- If we assume:
  - \( P_1 \) is the person who drinks Sprite and \( P_2 \) is the person who drinks 7up.
  - \( P_1 \) is also the person who watches Mystery movies and drives the quad-bike.
  - \( P_2 \) must be the person who watches Scientific movies and uses the train.

- Since \( P_1 \) is on the left of the Chinese, \( P_2 \) must be the Chinese.

- Since Skiing must be before Quad-bike, \( P_1 \) (who does Skiing) must be before \( P_2 \) (who does Rugby and uses the train).

7. **The owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish.**
8. **The person drinking 7up is not to the left of the person drinking juice.**
9. **The person drinking iced-tea is in the middle.**
10. **The owner of the rat is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.**
11. **The person drinking 7up is not to the left of the owner of the bird.**
12. **The person drinking iced-tea is in the middle.**
13. **The owner of the snake is in the middle.**
14. **The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird.**

Given that the person drinking iced-tea is in the middle (position 3) and the owner of the snake is in the middle (position 3), we can start by placing these:

|            |    1     |  2   |    3     |     4      |    5     |
| Beverage   |          |      |  Iced-tea |            |          |
| Pet        |          |      |  Snake   |            |          |

From clue 3, the person drinking tea must be to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Therefore, the person drinking tea can only be in position 4 or 5.

From clue 4, the person drinking tea is between the person drinking soy-milk and the owner of the goldfish. This means the person drinking soy-milk must be to the left of the person drinking tea, and the owner of the goldfish must be to the right of the person drinking tea. Given the positions, the only possible arrangement is:
- Soy-milk in position 1 or 2
- Tea in position 4
- Goldfish in position 5

Let's place them accordingly:

|            |    1     |  2   |    3     |     4      |    5     |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk |      |  Iced-tea |  Tea       |          |
| Pet        |          |      |  Snake   |            | Goldfish |

From clue 7, the owner of the bird is to the right of the owner of the goldfish. So, the owner of the bird must be in position 4 or 5. But since position 4 is taken by the person drinking tea, the owner of the bird must be in position 5.

|            |    1     |  2   |    3     |     4      |    5     |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk |      |  Iced-tea |  Tea       |          |
| Pet        |          |      |  Snake   |            | Bird     |

From clue 14, the person drinking juice is to the left of the owner of the bird. So, the person drinking juice must be in position 1 or 2.

|            |    1     |  2   |    3     |     4      |    5     |
| Beverage   | Juice    |      |  Iced-tea |  Tea       |          |
| Pet        |          |      |  Snake   |            | Bird     |

From clue 1, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the owner of the bird, which is consistent with our placement.

From clue 2, the owner of the snake is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, which is also consistent.

From clue 6, the owner of the chinchilla is not to the left of the person drinking tea. The owner of the chinchilla must be in position 4 or 5. Since position 4 is taken by the person drinking tea, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 5, but the owner of the bird is already there. So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 4.

|            |    1     |  2   |    3     |     4      |    5     |
| Beverage   | Juice    |      |  Iced-tea |  Tea       |          |
| Pet        |          |      |  Snake   | Chinchilla | Bird     |

From clue 8, the person drinking 7up is not to the left of the person drinking juice. So, the person drinking 7up must be in position 4 or 5. But position 5 is taken by the owner of the bird, so the person drinking 7up must be in position 4.

|            |    1     |  2   |    3     |     4      |    5     |
| Beverage   | Juice    |      |  Iced-tea |  7up       |          |
| Pet        |          |      |  Snake   | Chinchilla | Bird     |

From clue 9, the person drinking iced-tea is in the middle, which is consistent.

From clue 10, the owner of the rat is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. The owner of the rat must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is taken by the person drinking 7up, so the owner of the rat must be in position 5.

|            |    1     |  2   |    3     |     4      |    5     |
| Beverage   | Juice    |      |  Iced-tea |  7up       | Rat      |
| Pet        |          |      |  Snake   | Chinchilla | Bird     |

From clue 11, the person drinking 7up is not to the left of the owner of the bird, which is consistent.

From clue 5, the owner of the bird and the person drinking juice have different parity positions. The person drinking juice is in an odd position (1), and the owner of the bird is in an even position (5).

From clue 12, the person drinking iced-tea is in the middle, which is consistent.

From clue 13, the owner of the snake is in the middle, which is consistent.

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining positions for the beverages and pets:

|            |    1     |  2   |    3     |     4      |    5     |
| Beverage   | Juice    | Tea  |  Iced-tea |  7up       | Rat      |
| Pet        | Chinchilla| Bird |  Snake   | Goldfish   | Rat      |

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|            |    1     |  2   |    3     |     4      |    5     |

Lv2-2x5-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the tram is between the firefighter and the person driving the quad-bike.
2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the scooter is the firefighter.
3. **Clue 3**: The designer is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
4. **Clue 4**: The firefighter is on the left of the doctor.
5. **Clue 5**: The accountant is between the person driving the scooter and the designer.
6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the bike is on the far right.
7. **Clue 7**: The accountant is on the left of the person driving the scooter.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 2**: The firefighter (F) drives the scooter (S).
   
   | Job         |     1      |     2     |     3      |      4      |   5    |
   |-------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|--------|
   | Transport   |            | quad-     |            |             | bike   |

2. **From Clue 4**: The firefighter (F) is on the left of the doctor (D).

   | Job         |     1      |     2     |     3      |      4      |   5    |
   |-------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|--------|
   | Transport   | F          | quad-     |            |             | bike   |

3. **From Clue 6**: The person driving the bike (B) is on the far right.

   | Job         |     1      |     2     |     3      |      4      |   5    |

   | Transport   | F          | quad-     |            |             | B      |

4. **From Clue 1**: The person driving the tram (T) is between the firefighter (F) and the person driving the quad-bike (Q).

   Since F is at position 1 and B is at position 5, T must be at position 3 or 4. However, since D must be to the right of F, T cannot be at position 4 because there would be no room for D. Therefore, T must be at position 3.

   | Job         |     1      |     2     |     3      |      4      |   5    |

   | Transport   | F          | quad-     | T          |             | B      |

5. **From Clue 5**: The accountant (A) is between the person driving the scooter (S) and the designer (Des).

   Since S is at position 2 and Des must be to the right of S, A must be at position 1 or 3. But position 1 is already occupied by F, so A must be at position 3, which conflicts with T being there. Thus, A must be at position 4.

   | Job         |     1      |     2     |     3      |      4      |   5    |
   |-------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|--------|
   | Transport   | F          | quad-     | T          | A           | B      |

6. **From Clue 3**: The designer (Des) is on the right of the person driving the skateboard (Sk).

   Since A is at position 4, Des must be at position 5.

   | Job         |     1      |     2     |     3      |      4      |   5    |
   |-------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|--------|
   | Transport   | F          | quad-     | T          | A           | Sk     |

7. **From Clue 7**: The accountant (A) is on the left of the person driving the scooter (S).

   This is already satisfied as A is at position 4 and S is at position 2.

8. **Assigning Jobs**:
   - Position 1: Accountant (A)
   - Position 2: Designer (Des)
   - Position 3: Transporter (T)
   - Position 4: Firefighter (F)
   - Position 5: Doctor (D)

Lv3-2x4-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
3. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
4. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
5. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person drinking soy-milk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Hiker
From clue 1, we know that the person with the hobby ""hiking"" is in position 1 (the far left).

| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | Singing | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  |         |         |         |             |

#### Step 2: Place the Person Drinking Soy-Milk
From clue 5, we know that the person with the hobby ""woodworking"" drinks soy-milk.

| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | Singing | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  |         |         |         | Soy-milk    |

#### Step 3: Place the People with Beverages and Hobbies
From clue 4, the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking 7up. This means fanta and 7up must be in consecutive positions, and fanta must be to the right.

From clue 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Therefore, hot-chocolate must be in the last position.

From clue 3, the person with the hobby ""drawing"" is either to the left or right of the person with the hobby ""hiking"". Since the person with the hobby ""hiking"" is in position 1, the person with the hobby ""drawing"" can only be in position 2 or 4.

Given the above constraints, let's try to place the beverages:

- If we place 7up in position 2 and fanta in position 3, then hot-chocolate will be in position 4.
- This leaves position 3 for fanta, which contradicts clue 2. So, we need to adjust.

Instead, let's place 7up in position 3 and fanta in position 4. Then hot-chocolate will be in position 4.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Hiking
- Position 2: Drawing (since it must be to the left or right of Hiking)
- Position 3: 7up
- Position 4: Fanta (and Hot-Chocolate)

So the table looks like this:
| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | 7up     | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  |         |         | 7up     | Soy-milk    |

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining beverage (Hot-Chocolate) in position 2:

| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | 7up     | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  | Hot-Chocolate |         | 7up     | Soy-milk    |

Thus, the final solution is:

```
| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | 7up     | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  | Hot-Chocolate | Fanta  | 7up     | Soy-milk    |

Lv9-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Analyze Clues

**Clue 1:** The person eating broccoli and the nurse have different parity positions.
- Broccoli and Nurse have different positions (odd/even).

**Clue 2:** The bartender is somewhere to the left of the person eating broccoli.
- Bartender < Broccoli

**Clue 3:** The person eating grapefruit and the person whose sport is baseball have different parity positions.
- Grapefruit and Baseball have different positions.

**Clue 4:** The pilot is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is cricket.
- Pilot < Cricket

**Clue 5:** The person eating nectarine is not to the left of the person whose sport is baseball.
- Nectarine > Baseball

**Clue 6:** The bartender and the owner of the goat have different parity positions.
- Bartender and Goat have different positions.

**Clue 7:** The nurse is not to the left of the owner of the goat.
- Nurse > Goat

**Clue 8:** The person whose sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person whose sport is cricket.
- Cricket < Snowboarding

**Clue 9:** The owner of the mouse is not the pilot.
- Mouse ≠ Pilot

**Clue 10:** The pilot is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is sailing.
- Sailing < Pilot

**Clue 11:** The person eating nectarine is the person whose sport is cricket.
- Nectarine = Cricket

**Clue 12:** The person eating grapefruit is not to the left of the owner of the fish.
- Fish > Grapefruit

**Clue 13:** The owner of the fish is on the left of the person eating garlic.
- Fish < Garlic

**Clue 14:** The owner of the hamster is somewhere between the owner of the mouse and the person whose sport is baseball.
- Mouse < Hamster < Baseball

### Step 2: Deduce Positions

1. **Clue 11:** Nectarine = Cricket. So, Cricket is in position 4 (since it's the only one that can be nectarine).
2. **Clue 4 & 10:** Since Cricket is in position 4, Sailing must be in position 1 or 2. But since Pilot is to the right of Sailing, Pilot cannot be in position 1. So, Sailing must be in position 2, and Pilot must be in position 3 or 4. But since Cricket is in position 4, Pilot must be in position 3.
3. **Clue 8:** Since Cricket is in position 4 and Snowboarding is to the right, Snowboarding must be in position 4, but Cricket is already there, so this clue doesn't change anything.
4. **Clue 12:** Since Fish > Grapefruit, and Fish is not in position 1 (because Pilot is there), Fish must be in position 3, and Grapefruit must be in position 1.
5. **Clue 13:** Since Fish is in position 3 and Garlic is to the right, Garlic must be in position 4.
6. **Clue 14:** Since Mouse is not the pilot (Clue 9) and Hamster is between Mouse and Baseball, and since Pilot is in position 3, Mouse must be in position 1, Hamster in position 2, and Baseball in position 3.
7. **Clue 2:** Since Bartender is to the left of Broccoli, and Broccoli cannot be in position 1 (Grapefruit) or 3 (Baseball), Broccoli must be in position 4, and Bartender must be in position 1.
8. **Clue 6:** Since Bartender (position 1) and Goat have different positions, Goat must be in position 3.
9. **Clue 7:** Since Nurse is not to the left of Goat, Nurse must be in position 4.
10. **Clue 3:** Since Grapefruit (position 1) and Baseball (position 3) have different positions, this is consistent.
11. **Clue 5:** Since Nectarine (Cricket, position 4) is not to the left of Baseball (position 3), this is consistent.
12. **Clue 9:** Since Mouse is not the pilot (position 3), this is consistent.
13. **Clue 1:** Since Broccoli (position 4) and Nurse (position 4) have the same position, they have the same parity (even). This is consistent.

Lv8-4x2-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the car is the person driving the car (redundant and doesn't provide new information).
3. **Clue 3:** The person eating lettuce is somewhere to the right of the doctor.
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the car is not to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person eating lettuce.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- The person eating lettuce is to the right of the doctor.
- This means the doctor cannot be in position 2 for both food and job (since there would be no room for the person eating lettuce).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- The person driving the car is not to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
- This means the person driving the car must be in a position to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 5
- The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person eating lettuce.
- This means the person eating lettuce must be in a position to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.

#### Step 4: Combine Clues 4 and 5
- From Clue 4, the person driving the car is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
- From Clue 5, the person eating lettuce is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
- Therefore, the person driving the car must be in position 1, and the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 1
- The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
- Given that the person driving the car is in position 1 and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2, we need to place the cabbage and lettuce eaters and their respective hobbies.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 3
- The person eating lettuce is to the right of the doctor.
- Since the person driving the car (position 1) is not the doctor, the doctor must be in position 2 (since the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2).

#### Step 7: Final Placement
- Position 1: Car (Driver)
- Position 2: Snowmobile (Driver), Doctor, Eating Lettuce
- Position 3: Cabbage Eater (Not Writing)
- Position 4: Writing (Not Eating Cabbage)

Given these placements:
- The person eating cabbage cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- The person writing cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- The person eating lettuce is in position 2 (doctor).

Thus, the final solution is:

### Final Placement:

1. **Crime** -> 1st position (leftmost)
2. **Disaster** -> 4th position (right of Argentine)
3. **Documentary** -> 2nd position (right of Crime)
4. **Time-travel** -> 3rd position (left of Argentine)
5. **Argentine** -> 5th position (right of Time-travel)

Now we need to assign the nationalities and transportation methods:

- **Russian** -> Jet-ski (Clue 6)
- **Brazilian** -> Helicopter (Clue 2, 11)
- **Argentine** -> Car (Clue 7, 10, 4)
- **German** -> Airplane (Clue 4)
- **Quad-bike** -> Not assigned yet (Clue 9, 12)

Since the quad-bike cannot be to the left of the jet-ski and must be to the right of the Brazilian, it must be in the 4th or 5th position. However, the car is already in the 5th position, so the quad-bike must be in the 4th position.

Thus, the final arrangement is:

1. **Crime**
2. **Disaster**
3. **Documentary**
4. **Time-travel** -> Quad-bike
5. **Argentine** -> Car

Lv2-2x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the information provided and systematically deduce the correct arrangement.

### Given Information:
1. Three sports: ice-hockey, swimming, weightlifting.
2. Three modes of transport: bus, quad-bike, snowmobile.
3. The person driving the bus is on the left of the person whose sport is swimming.
4. The person driving the bus is between the person whose sport is weightlifting and the person driving the quad-bike.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Identify the position of the person driving the bus:**
   - From clue 1: The person driving the bus is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
   - From clue 2: The person driving the bus is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person driving the quad-bike.
   
   This means that the person driving the bus cannot be in position 3 (the far right), as there would be no one to their right for clue 1 to hold true. Therefore, the person driving the bus must be in position 1 or 2.

2. **Determine the positions based on clues:**
   - If the person driving the bus is in position 1, then the person with swimming must be in position 2 (from clue 1).
   - This would mean the person with weightlifting must be in position 3 (since the person with the bus is between the person with weightlifting and the person with the quad-bike).

   Let's check if this arrangement fits all clues:
   - Position 1: Bus (person driving the bus)
   - Position 2: Swimming
   - Position 3: Weightlifting

   This arrangement satisfies both clues:
   - Clue 1: The person driving the bus (position 1) is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming (position 2).
   - Clue 2: The person driving the bus (position 1) is between the person who's sport is weightlifting (position 3) and the person driving the quad-bike (position 2).

3. **Assign the remaining sports and transport:**
   - Since we have three sports and three modes of transport, the remaining sport must be ice-hockey.
   - The remaining mode of transport must be the quad-bike.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Bus (person driving the bus)
- Position 2: Swimming
- Position 3: Weightlifting

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-3x2-10	"Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two movie genres: **mystery** and **romance**.
2. There are two nationalities: **american** and **colombian**.
3. There are two means of transport: **bus** and **quad-bike**.
4. The person watching **romance** movies is on the left of the person driving the bus.
5. The **american** and the person watching **romance** movies have different parity positions (one is in an odd position and the other is in an even position).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Positioning
- Since the person watching **romance** movies is on the left of the person driving the bus, we can deduce that the person watching **romance** movies must be in position 1 and the person driving the bus must be in position 2.

#### Step 2: Analyze Parity Positions
- The **american** and the person watching **romance** movies have different parity positions.
- If the person watching **romance** movies is in position 1 (odd), then the **american** must be in position 2 (even).
- Conversely, if the person watching **romance** movies is in position 2 (even), then the **american** must be in position 1 (odd).

#### Step 3: Determine Nationality and Movie Genre
- If the person watching **romance** movies is in position 1 (odd) and is **american**, then the person in position 2 (even) must be **colombian** and watching **mystery** movies.
- If the person watching **romance** movies is in position 2 (even) and is **colombian**, then the person in position 1 (odd) must be **american** and watching **mystery** movies.

#### Step 4: Determine Transport
- The person driving the bus is in position 2, so they must be using the **bus**.
- The person using the **quad-bike** must be in position 1.

### Final Table:

| Transport     | Quad-bike | Bus      |
```

### Explanation:
- Position 1 (odd): **American** watching **Mystery** movies, using **Quad-bike**
- Position 2 (even): **Colombian** watching **Romance** movies, using **Bus**

Thus, the final solution is:

Lv5-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
2. The person who's hobby is hiking is between the person who's hobby is board-games and the person who's hobby is photography.
3. The person who's hobby is board-games is between the person who's hobby is video-games and the person watching spy movies.
4. The person who's sport is rugby is in an even position.
5. The person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is photography.
6. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
7. The person who's sport is volleyball is in an even position.
8. The person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person watching spy movies.
9. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
10. The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies.
11. The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.
12. The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify positions for sports**:
   - Rugby (even position) can be in 2 or 4.
   - Volleyball (even position) can be in 2 or 4.
   - Swimming must be to the right of volleyball, so it can only be in 4 if volleyball is in 2.
   - Thus, Rugby and Volleyball can't both be in 2 or 4. Let's assume Rugby is in 2 and Volleyball is in 4.
   
2. **Determine the order of sports**:
   - Rugby (2)
   - Volleyball (4)
   - Swimming (4+1=5, but 5 is not possible since volleyball is in 4, so it must be 3).
   - Water Polo (odd position, remaining odd positions are 1 and 5, but we need to fit other constraints).

3. **Determine the order of hobbies**:
   - Board-games (B), Photography (P), Hiking (H), Video-games (V), Cooking (C).
   - B is between V and Spy movies (S).
   - P is to the left of C.
   - B is to the right of P.
   - H is between B and P.
   - B is to the right of P.
   - So, the sequence for hobbies must be: P, B, H, V, C.

4. **Movie genres**:
   - Fantasy (F) is on the left or right of Video-games (V).
   - Disaster (D) is on the left or right of Fantasy (F).
   - Spy (S) is to the right of Rugby (2), so it can be in 3, 4, or 5.
   - Superhero (SH) is to the right of Zombie (Z).
   - From clue 10, D is on the left or right of F, and from clue 3, B is between V and S, and from clue 1, F is on the left or right of V.
   - From clue 11, S is to the right of Climbing (Climb), so S can be in 3, 4, or 5.
   - Since S is to the right of Rugby (2), it can only be in 3 or 4 or 5, but B is between V and S, and V can only be in 1, so S must be in 3, 4, or 5.
   - If S is in 3, then B is in 2 and V is in 1, and F must be in 2 or 4, but F is on the left or right of V, so F must be in 4.
   - So, the sequence for movie genres could be: F, SH, Z, D, S.

### Verification:
1. The person watching fantasy movies (F) is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games (V).
2. The person who's hobby is hiking (H) is between the person who's hobby is board-games (B) and the person who's hobby is photography (P).

Lv7-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 8:** The project-manager is on the far left.
   - So, the first column is for the project-manager.

2. **Clue 4:** The Chinese is in the middle.
   - Therefore, the second column is for the Chinese.

3. **Clue 1:** The person eating onion is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the project-manager is already on the far left, the person eating onion must be on the far right (column 3).

4. **Clue 2:** The person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the manager.
   - The manager cannot be in the first or third column (since the project-manager is there and the person eating onion is there), so the manager must be in the second column (Chinese).

5. **Clue 6:** The person eating cabbage is somewhere between the fan of dubstep and the American.
   - Since the manager is in the second column (Chinese), the only remaining columns for the fan of dubstep and the American are the first and third columns.
   - The person eating cabbage cannot be in the first column (project-manager) or the third column (onion-eater), so it must be in the second column (Chinese). This means the fan of dubstep and the American must be in the first and third columns respectively.

6. **Clue 7:** The fan of folk is the American.
   - So, the American is in the third column and the fan of folk is in the third column.

7. **Clue 3 & 5:** The person whose hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the fan of folk, and the person whose hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the fan of folk.
   - Since the fan of folk is in the third column, the person with the hobby of dancing and the person with the hobby of fishing must be in the first or second column.
   - Given that the person eating cabbage is in the second column (Chinese) and the fan of folk is in the third column (American), the person with the hobby of dancing and the person with the hobby of fishing must be in the first column.

8. **Clue 9:** The journalist is on the left or right of the manager.
   - Since the manager is in the second column (Chinese), the journalist can be in the first or third column. However, the first column is taken by the fan of dubstep, so the journalist must be in the third column (American).

9. **Clue 10:** The person eating onion is on the left of the person whose hobby is fishing.
   - The person eating onion is in the third column, so the person whose hobby is fishing must be in the first column.

Now, let's summarize the findings:

- Project-manager (first column)
- Chinese (second column)
- American (third column)

- Onion-eater (third column)
- Cabbage-eater (second column - Chinese)
- Fan of dubstep (first column)
- Fan of folk (third column - American)
- Dancing (first column)
- Fishing (first column)

We need to fill in the remaining details (food, job, music genre, nationality):

- The remaining job for the Chinese is the manager.
- The remaining job for the American is the journalist.
- The remaining job for the person in the first column is the project-manager.

- The remaining music genre for the Chinese is electronic.
- The remaining music genre for the American is folk.
- The remaining music genre for the person in the first column is dubstep.

- The remaining food for the Chinese is onion.
- The remaining food for the American is spinach.
- The remaining food for the person in the first column is cabbage.

So, the final table looks like this:

4. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
5. The person watching musical movies is not to the left of the designer.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The designer cannot be the person with the hobby of video-games.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The project-manager must either be the person with the hobby of skydiving or the person watching musical movies, but not both.
- This means the project-manager cannot be the person with the hobby of video-games (since they can't be both).

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3 and Clue 4
- The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
- The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
- Therefore, the order must be: [sudoku, skydiving] or [skydiving, sudoku].

Lv5-2x3-2	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
1. The beverages are: cola, hot-chocolate, juice.
2. The movie genres are: family, satire, scientific.
3. Constraints:
   - The person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person drinking juice.
   - The person drinking juice is to the right of the person watching satire movies.
   - The person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - The person watching family movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Beverage Order
From constraint 3: ""the person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking cola.""
This means cola must be to the left of juice.

From constraint 1: ""the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person drinking juice.""
This means juice must be to the left of hot-chocolate.

From these two constraints, we can deduce the order of beverages:
- Cola (leftmost)
- Juice (middle)
- Hot-Chocolate (rightmost)

So, the beverage order is:
1. Cola
2. Juice
3. Hot-Chocolate

#### Step 2: Determine the Movie Genre Order
From constraint 2: ""the person drinking juice is to the right of the person watching satire movies.""
This means satire must be to the left of juice.

From constraint 4: ""the person watching family movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies.""
This means family must be to the left of scientific.

Given the order from beverage preferences, we can place the movie genres as follows:
- Since satire is to the left of juice, and juice is the second beverage, satire must be the first movie genre.
- Family must be to the left of scientific, and since satire is already placed, family must be the first movie genre, and scientific must be the last.

So, the movie genre order is:
1. Family
2. Satire
3. Scientific

### Final Table:

Lv1-1x4-2	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given conditions step by step to determine the correct arrangement of the pets.

1. The owner of the turtle is on the far right.
2. The owner of the bird is on the far left.
3. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the bird.

Given these conditions, we can deduce the following:

- The first column (position 1) must be the bird because the owner of the bird is on the far left.
- The fourth column (position 4) must be the turtle because the owner of the turtle is on the far right.
- The second or third column must be the mouse because it is on the right of the bird.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Bird
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: Turtle

Since the mouse must be to the right of the bird, it can only occupy position 2 or 3. However, if the mouse were in position 3, then the only remaining option for position 2 would be the guinea-pig. This would satisfy all the conditions.

So, let's place the pets in the appropriate positions:

- Position 1: Bird
- Position 2: Guinea-pig
- Position 3: Mouse
- Position 4: Turtle

Thus, the final solution table looks like this:

```

1. **Clue 6**: The person eating banana is on the far right.
   - Position 4: Banana

2. **Clue 7**: The person drinking water is on the left of the person eating banana.
   - Position 1: Water
   - Position 4: Banana

3. **Clue 10**: The person eating potato is on the left of the person driving the roller.
   - Since the person driving the roller is not at position 1 (because of clue 7), it must be at position 2 or 3.

4. **Clue 11**: The owner of the dog is on the far right.
   - Position 4: Dog

5. **Clue 5**: The owner of the dog is the person driving the bus.
   - Position 4: Bus

6. **Clue 2**: The person driving the roller is the owner of the horse.
   - Position 2 or 3: Roller
   - Position 4: Horse

7. **Clue 1**: The fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of country.
   - Gospel and Country are adjacent but Gospel is to the left.

8. **Clue 3**: The owner of the goat is between the person driving the roller and the person drinking soy-milk.
   - Goat is between Roller and Soy-milk.
   - If Roller is at position 2, Goat must be at position 3, and Soy-milk must be at position 3 or 4.
   - If Roller is at position 3, Goat must be at position 2, and Soy-milk must be at position 1 or 2.

9. **Clue 4**: The person driving the train is on the right of the fan of d&b.
   - Train is at position 4, d&b is at position 3.

10. **Clue 9**: The fan of d&b is on the left of the person drinking milk.
    - d&b is at position 3, Milk is at position 4.

Now let's summarize and place everything:

- Position 1: Water
- Position 2: Carrot (gospel fan)
- Position 3: Goat (between roller and soy-milk)
- Position 4: Banana (right of d&b)

From the remaining options:
- Soy-milk can only be at position 3.
- Dog is at position 4.
- Horse is at position 2.
- Country fan is at position 2 (since gospel is at 1).

So we have:
- Position 1: Water
- Position 2: Carrot (gospel fan)
- Position 3: Soy-milk
- Position 4: Banana (d&b fan)

And for the remaining:
- Horse is at position 2.
- Dog is at position 4.
- Goat is at position 3.

Let's fill in the rest of the table:

| Transport     |          | bus        |        | train    |

Now, let's confirm all clues:
1. Gospel is on the left of D&B.
2. Driver of roller is owner of horse (roller at 2, horse at 4).
3. Owner of goat is between roller and soy-milk (goat at 3, roller at 2, soy-milk at 3).
4. Driver of train is on the right of D&B (train at 4, d&b at 3).
5. Owner of dog is driver of bus (dog at 4, bus at 4).

Lv4-2x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information step-by-step into the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).**
2. **The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the australian.**
3. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the japanese.**
4. **The canadian is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade (3).**
5. **The japanese is on the far right (5).**
6. **The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the egyptian.**
7. **The brazilian is in an even position (2 or 4).**
8. **The person drinking mirinda is on the far right (5).**

From clue 8, we know:
- The person drinking mirinda is in position 5.
- Therefore, the Japanese must be in position 5 as well (clue 5).

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |          |          |            |           | mirinda  |
| Nationality   |          |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 6, since the Japanese is in position 5, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 4 (because they are on the right of the Egyptian).
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |          |          |            | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   |          |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 3, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the Japanese. Since the Japanese is in position 5, the soy-milk drinker must be in position 4, but that is already occupied by iced-tea. Thus, the soy-milk drinker must be in position 3.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |          |          | soy-milk   | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   |          |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 1, the person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position, and we have already placed iced-tea in position 4. So, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 1.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea |          | soy-milk   | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   |          |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 6, the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the Egyptian. Since the iced-tea drinker in position 1 cannot be on the right of the Egyptian, the Egyptian must be in position 2.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea |          | soy-milk   | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   | egyptian |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 7, the Brazilian is in an even position. Since position 4 is already taken by iced-tea, the Brazilian must be in position 2.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea | brazilian | soy-milk   | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   | egyptian |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 2, the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the australian. Since the Brazilian is in position 2 and the Japanese is in position 5, the only positions left for the australian and the lemonade drinker are 3 and 4 respectively.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea | brazilian | lemonade   | australian| mirinda  |
| Nationality   | egyptian |          |            |           | japanese |
```

Finally, from clue 4, the Canadian is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the lemonade drinker is in position 3, the Canadian must be in position 4.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea | brazilian | lemonade   | australian| mirinda  |
| Nationality   | egyptian | canadian |            |           | japanese |
```

Since all the clues are satisfied, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |

7. The owner of the pony is on the right of the Indian.
8. The owner of the goat is on the far left or far right (positions 1 or 5).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4:
The Indonesian is on the far right (position 5). Therefore:
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

```

#### Clue 2 & Clue 3:
The Indonesian is the owner of the horse.
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

```

#### Clue 5:
The Egyptian is the owner of the fish, and they must be in an even position (2 or 4). Since position 4 is already taken by the Indonesian, the Egyptian must be in position 2.
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

```

#### Clue 6:
The Indian is between the Egyptian and the Chinese. Given the positions, the Indian can only be in position 3, and the Chinese must be in position 4.
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

```

#### Clue 7:
The owner of the pony is on the right of the Indian. Since the Indian is in position 3, the pony must be in position 4.
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

| Pet           |      | Fish     | Pony       | Horse   |            |
```

#### Clue 8:
The owner of the goat is on the far left or far right. Position 1 is not occupied yet, so the goat must be in position 1.
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

| Pet           | Goat | Fish     | Pony       | Horse   |            |
```

Since all other positions for the remaining nationals and pets are filled, we can conclude the last pet, which is the guinea-pig, must be in position 5.
```

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
2. The person watching fantasy movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching time-travel movies.
3. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 2 Analysis:
- The person watching fantasy movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching time-travel movies.
- This means that the sequence must be: Comedy -> Fantasy -> Time-Travel.

#### Clue 1 Analysis:
- The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
- This aligns with the sequence from Clue 2: Comedy -> Fantasy -> Time-Travel.

#### Clue 3 Analysis:
- The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
- Since we already have Comedy -> Fantasy -> Time-Travel from Clue 2, and Comedy needs to be on the left of Disaster, we can place Disaster at the rightmost position.

### Final Sequence:
Combining all the clues, we get:
- Comedy (leftmost)
- Fantasy (middle)
- Time-Travel (second from the right)
- Disaster (rightmost)

So, the final order is:
- Comedy
- Fantasy
- Time-Travel
- Disaster

Lv2-4x3-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The bartender is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
2. The owner of the chinchilla is between the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies.
3. The person eating eggplant is on the far left.
4. The owner of the goldfish is the person eating kale.
5. The owner of the chinchilla is the person watching mystery movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions based on the given clues.

1. **Clue 3**: The person eating eggplant is on the far left.
   - So, position 1 (far left) must be ""eggplant"".

2. **Clue 4**: The owner of the goldfish is the person eating kale.
   - So, the person in position 3 (far right) must be eating kale and owning a goldfish.

3. **Clue 5**: The owner of the chinchilla is the person watching mystery movies.
   - So, the person in position 2 must be watching mystery movies and owning a chinchilla.

Now we have:
```
| Food          | Job          | Movie-Genre | Pet           |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| eggplant      |              |             |               |
| ?             |              | mystery     | chinchilla    |
| kale          |              |             | goldfish      |
```

4. **Clue 1**: The bartender is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
   - Since the person watching mystery movies is in position 2, the bartender must be in position 1 or 2. But since position 1 is already taken by the person eating eggplant, the bartender must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 2**: The owner of the chinchilla is between the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies.
   - We know the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2 and is watching mystery movies. Therefore, the paramedic must be in position 3 (since the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3).

So, we now have:
```
| Food          | Job          | Movie-Genre | Pet           |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| eggplant      | bartender    |             |               |
| bartender     | paramedic    | mystery     | chinchilla    |
| kale          |              |             | goldfish      |
```

6. **Determine the remaining job for position 1**:
   - Position 1 is already filled with ""eggplant"" and ""bartender"".
   - Position 2 is ""paramedic"" and watching ""mystery"".
   - Position 3 is ""kale"" and has a ""goldfish"".

Therefore, the only job left is ""doctor"", which must be in position 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
```
| Food          | Job          | Movie-Genre | Pet           |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| eggplant      | doctor       |             |               |
| bartender     | paramedic    | mystery     | chinchilla    |
| kale          |             |             | goldfish      |
```

7. **Determine the movie genre for each person**:
   - The person in position 1 (eating eggplant) cannot watch thriller movies because the bartender (position 2) is to the right of them and is watching thriller movies.
   - The person in position 2 (watching mystery) cannot watch disaster movies because they own the chinchilla.
   - Therefore, the person in position 3 (watching thriller) must be the one who is not watching mystery or disaster, so it must be watching thriller movies.

So, the final solution is:
```
| Food          | Job          | Movie-Genre | Pet           |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| eggplant      | doctor       | disaster    |               |
| bartender     | paramedic    | mystery     | chinchilla    |
| kale          |             | thriller    | goldfish      |
```

Lv1-1x3-9	"Sure, let's analyze the given information step-by-step to solve the puzzle.

We have three columns (1, 2, and 3) representing three different movie genres: comedy, disaster, and time-travel. We need to determine which genre each column represents based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.
2. The person watching disaster movies is in the middle.

### Analysis:

- From clue 2, we know that the person watching disaster movies must be in column 2.
- From clue 1, the person watching comedy movies must be on the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since disaster movies are in column 2, comedy movies must be in column 1.

Therefore, the only remaining genre, time-travel, must be in column 3.

   - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must also be in an odd position; if one is in an even position, the other must also be in an even position.

2. **Clue 2:** The fan of salsa is the person drinking water or the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the fan of salsa or both.
   - This implies that either the person drinking water is the fan of salsa, or the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is the fan of salsa, or both.

3. **Clue 3:** The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa.
   - This means the fan of hip-hop cannot be in the rightmost position, and the fan of salsa must be to the right of the fan of hip-hop.

4. **Clue 4:** The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.
   - This places the sports movies person in position 1 and the action movies person in position 2 or 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person drinking mirinda is the person who's hobby is writing.
   - This directly links the person drinking mirinda with the person whose hobby is writing.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is writing is not the fan of dubstep or the fan of dubstep is not the person drinking mirinda or both.
   - This means the person whose hobby is writing cannot be the fan of dubstep, or the fan of dubstep cannot be the person drinking mirinda, or both.

7. **Clue 7:** The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person watching action movies.
   - This places the person drinking water in position 1 or 2, and the person watching action movies in position 2 or 3.

3. **Action Movies Position:**
   - From Clue 4, the person watching action movies must be in position 2 or 3.
   - From Clue 7, the person drinking water is to the left of the person watching action movies.
   - Since the person drinking mirinda is already in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Therefore, the person watching action movies must be in position 3.

4. **Salsa and Hip-Hop:**
   - From Clue 3, the fan of hip-hop is to the left of the fan of salsa.
   - From Clue 2, the fan of salsa is either the person drinking water or the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
   - Since the person drinking water is in position 2 or 3, and the person watching action movies is in position 3, the person drinking water must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person drinking water is the fan of salsa, and the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is the fan of hip-hop.

5. **Parity Check for Comedy and Iced Tea:**
   - From Clue 1, the person watching comedy movies and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions.

1. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
2. The person driving the ship is on the far left.
3. The owner of the rat is the person driving the roller.
4. The owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the egyptian.
5. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the roller.
6. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in the middle.
7. The turkish is on the right of the colombian.
8. The mexican is on the far right.
9. The owner of the pony is the turkish.
10. The owner of the dog is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
11. The owner of the pony is on the right of the colombian.
12. The owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is fishing.
13. The owner of the horse is on the left of the mexican.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of Ship and Photography
From Clue 2, the person driving the ship is on the far left.
From Clue 1, this person is also to the left of the person with the hobby of photography. Therefore, the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 3 or 4.

#### Step 2: Position of Roller and Rat
From Clue 3, the owner of the rat is the person driving the roller.
From Clue 5, the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the roller. This means the person driving the roller cannot be in position 1 (since there is no position to the left).

#### Step 3: Position of Horse, Magic-Tricks, and Egyptian
From Clue 4, the owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the egyptian.
From Clue 13, the owner of the horse is on the left of the mexican. This implies the mexican cannot be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Position of Skydiving
From Clue 6, the person who's hobby is skydiving is in the middle, which is position 3.

#### Step 5: Position of Turkish and Colombian
From Clue 7, the turkish is on the right of the colombian.
From Clue 8, the mexican is on the far right (position 5).
From Clue 9, the owner of the pony is the turkish, so the turkish must be in position 4 and the colombian in position 3.

#### Step 6: Position of Dog, Fishing, and Taxi
From Clue 12, the owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is fishing.
From Clue 10, the owner of the dog is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
From Clue 11, the owner of the pony is on the right of the colombian, which we already know is position 3, so the pony owner (turkish) is in position 4.

#### Step 7: Position of Remaining People
From Clue 1, the person driving the ship (position 1) is to the left of the person with the hobby of photography (position 3). Since the skydiver is in position 3, the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 4.

From Clue 5, the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the roller. The roller is driven by the owner of the rat (position 4), so the skateboard driver must be in position 2.

From Clue 4, the owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the egyptian. Since the mexican is in position 5, the egyptian must be in position 2 (skateboard) or 3 (skydiving). But the owner of the horse must be in position 2 (skateboard) since the egyptian cannot be in position 3 (skydiving).

From Clue 4, the owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the egyptian. Since the egyptian is in position 2, the magic-tricks owner must be in position 1 (ship) and the person with the hobby of skydiving must be in position 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 14**: The person drinking juice is the person who's hobby is sudoku.
2. **Clue 8**: The person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the boat.
3. **Clue 9**: The person driving the boat is not the person who's hobby is collecting.

6. **Clue 2**: The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram.
7. **Clue 5**: The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
8. **Clue 3**: The owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person drinking cola.
9. **Clue 4**: The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
10. **Clue 7**: The person drinking sprite is in an odd position.
11. **Clue 6**: The person drinking cola is somewhere between the owner of the hedgehog and the owner of the frog.
12. **Clue 11**: The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the owner of the bird.
13. **Clue 12**: The owner of the chinchilla is not to the left of the person driving the tram.
14. **Clue 13**: The owner of the chinchilla is the person who's hobby is sudoku or the owner of the chinchilla is the person driving the tram, but not both.
15. **Clue 10**: The person drinking juice is the owner of the chinchilla or the owner of the chinchilla is the person who's hobby is card-games or both.

### Initial Assumptions and Deductions:
- From Clue 14, the person drinking juice has the hobby of sudoku.
- From Clue 16, the person who's hobby is card-games drinks cola.
- From Clue 8, the person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the boat.
- Since the person drinking cola has the hobby of card-games, the person driving the boat cannot have the hobby of collecting (Clue 9).

### Positioning and Clues:
- From Clue 7, the person drinking sprite is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
- From Clue 10, the person drinking juice (sudoku) can be the owner of the chinchilla, or the owner of the chinchilla is the person with the hobby of card-games (cola drinker), but not both.

### Let's try positioning:
1. If the person drinking sprite is in position 1, then:
   - Position 1: Sprite
   - Position 2: ?
   - Position 3: ?
   - Position 4: ?

### Trying Clue 14 and 16:
- Position 4: Juice (sudoku)
- Position 3: Cola (card-games)
- Position 2: ?
- Position 1: Sprite

### Applying Clue 1:
- The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (juice drinker). So, the person driving the tram could be in position 2 or 4.

### Applying Clue 2:
- The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram.
- Therefore, the person driving the tram must be in position 4, and the person driving the bus must be in position 2.

### Applying Clue 5:
- The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. This is already satisfied since cola is in position 3 and juice is in position 4.

### Applying Clue 3:
- The owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. So, the owner of the frog could be in position 2 or 4.

### Applying Clue 4:
- The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, the owner of the bird must be in position 1 or 2.

### Applying Clue 11:
- The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the owner of the bird. So, if the owner of the bird is in position 2, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 3, and the owner of the frog must be in position 4.

### Final Configuration:
- Position 1: Sprite
- Position 2: Bus
- Position 3: Cola (card-games)
- Position 4: Juice (sudoku)

Now, let's assign the remaining elements:

- The owner of the bird is in position 2 (since it is to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles, and position 1 is occupied by sprite).
- The owner of the hedgehog is in position 3 (since it is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the frog).
- The owner of the frog is in position 4 (since it is the only remaining position).

So, the final configuration is:

```
|             |     1      |    2     |     3      |    4    |

   - Clue 2: Coffee is in positions 1 or 3.
   - Clue 10: Coffee is on the left or right of the French.
   - Clue 8: The Polish is not to the left of the person drinking coffee.
   - Therefore, if coffee is in position 1, Polish must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

   - Therefore, the person driving the tram cannot have rowing as their sport.

5. **Position of Lacrosse Players:**
   - Clue 6: Lacrosse is on the right of the person driving the trike.
   - Therefore, the person driving the trike must be in position 1 or 2, and lacrosse must be in position 3 or 4.

   - Therefore, the person driving the trike must be in position 1 or 2.

6. **Position of Bikers:**
   - Clue 3: The person driving the bike is to the right of the person whose hobby is skydiving.
   - Therefore, skydiving cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since lacrosse is in position 4, skydiving must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person driving the bike must be in position 4, but this conflicts with the tram driver, so we need to adjust.

7. **Position of Taxi Drivers:**
   - Clue 15: The person driving the taxi is on the right of the Polish.
   - Therefore, the Polish must be in position 1 or 2, and the taxi driver must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Since skydiving is in position 3, the taxi driver must be in position 4.

8. **Position of Handball Players:**
   - Clue 14: The person whose sport is handball is not to the left of the German.
   - Therefore, the German cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since the French is not in position 1 (from clue 8), the French must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Since juice is in position 3, the French must be in position 4.
   - Therefore, the German must be in position 1 or 2.

9. **Position of Collectors:**
   - Clue 12: The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left of the French.
   - Therefore, the collector must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since the French is in position 4, the collector must be in position 1 or 2.

Lv3-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person driving the helicopter is the person drinking cola.
   - So, **Cola** is driven by **Helicopter**.

2. **Clue 6**: The chef is the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - So, **Hot-Chocolate** is drunk by **Chef**.

3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - From Clue 2, we know that **Cola** is driven by **Helicopter**. Therefore, **Helicopter** must be to the left of **Skateboard**.
   - So, **Helicopter** (driving cola) is in position 1, and **Skateboard** is in position 2.

4. **Clue 1**: The person watching drama movies is between the person driving the helicopter and the dancer.
   - From Clue 2, we know **Helicopter** is in position 1 (driving cola).
   - So, the person watching drama movies must be in position 2, which is **Skateboard**.
   - This also means the person driving the helicopter (position 1) is not the one watching drama, and the dancer is in position 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right.
   - Since **Skateboard** (position 2) is watching drama, the person watching satire must be in either position 1 or position 3.
   - Given that **Helicopter** (position 1) is driving cola, it cannot be watching satire.
   - Therefore, the person watching satire must be in position 3, which is the **Dancer**.

6. **Clue 7**: The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - Since **Dancer** is in position 3, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 1 or 2.
   - **Helicopter** (position 1) is driving cola, so the person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2, which is **Skateboard**.
   - This means the person with biathlon as their sport is in position 1, which is **Helicopter**.

7. **Clue 5**: The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - We already determined that the person watching mystery movies (position 2) is **Skateboard**.
   - And the person with biathlon as their sport is in position 1, which is **Helicopter**.
   - This clue is satisfied since **Skateboard** (position 2) is indeed to the right of **Helicopter** (position 1).

8. **Clue 8**: The person whose sport is basketball is the person drinking cola.
   - From Clue 2, we know **Helicopter** (position 1) is drinking cola.
   - Therefore, the person whose sport is basketball is **Helicopter**.

Lv1-2x5-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the correct order of hobbies and music genres for each position (1 through 5). Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
2. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
3. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right.
4. The person who's hobby is photography is on the far left.
5. The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of classical.
6. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the fan of classical.
7. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the fan of indie.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 3**: The person with the hobby of dancing is on the far right (position 5).
   - \( \text{Position 5: Dancing} \)

2. **From Clue 4**: The person with the hobby of photography is on the far left (position 1).
   - \( \text{Position 1: Photography} \)

3. **From Clue 6**: The person with the hobby of woodworking is the fan of classical.
   - \( \text{Position 5: Woodworking} \) (since it must be the far right)
   - \( \text{Position 1: Classical} \) (since it must be the far left)

4. **From Clue 1**: The fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - Since the fan of house cannot be in position 5 (because it would violate Clue 1), the fan of house must be in position 2 or 3.
   - The person with the hobby of camping must be in position 3 or 4.

5. **From Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - This means the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Since position 5 is already occupied by woodworking, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 4.
   - Therefore, the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 3.

6. **From Clue 5**: The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of classical.
   - Since position 1 is already occupied by classical, the fan of rock must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the fan of house must be in position 3.

7. **From Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the fan of indie.
   - Since position 1 is occupied by photography, the fan of indie must be in position 4.
   - This matches our previous deductions that the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is in position 4 and the fan of rock is in position 2.

So, the final arrangement is:

- Position 1: Photography (Classical)
- Position 2: Rock
- Position 3: House (Camping)
- Position 4: Indie (Magic-Tricks)
- Position 5: Woodworking (Dancing)

Lv2-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the taxi is between the nigerian and the russian.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking 7up is on the far left.
4. **Clue 4**: The person eating papaya is on the far left.
5. **Clue 5**: The indian is on the left of the person driving the bike.
6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the bike is the nigerian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3 & 4:
- From Clue 3: The person drinking 7up is on the far left.
- From Clue 4: The person eating papaya is on the far left.
  - This creates a conflict because there can only be one person on the far left. Hence, the person eating papaya must be the one drinking 7up.
  - Therefore, **Person 1** drinks 7up and eats papaya.

#### Clue 6:
- From Clue 6: The person driving the bike is the nigerian.
  - So, **Person 3** drives the bike and is the nigerian.

#### Clue 5:
- From Clue 5: The indian is on the left of the person driving the bike (nigerian).
  - Since Person 3 is the nigerian and drives the bike, **Person 1** must be the indian.

#### Clue 1:
- From Clue 1: The person driving the taxi is between the nigerian and the russian.
  - Since Person 3 (nigerian) is on the far right, the person driving the taxi must be Person 2.
  - Therefore, **Person 2** drives the taxi and is the russian.

#### Clue 2:
- From Clue 2: The person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
  - We know from Clue 3 that **Person 1** drinks 7up and eats papaya.
  - The remaining beverages are almond-milk and cola, and the remaining foods are carrot and peas.
  - Since **Person 2** is the russian and drives the taxi, and **Person 3** is the nigerian and drives the bike, we need to determine what **Person 1** is eating.
  - Given that **Person 2** (russian) is not eating peas (as **Person 1** eats papaya), and **Person 3** (nigerian) is also not eating peas, **Person 1** must be eating peas.
  - Therefore, **Person 2** must be drinking almond-milk and eating carrot (the remaining food).
