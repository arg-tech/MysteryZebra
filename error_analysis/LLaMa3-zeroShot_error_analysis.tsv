Lv1-1x5-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

This means that card-games is either between reading and filmmaking, or between reading and magic-tricks (since filmmaking is to the left of magic-tricks). Let's assume it's between reading and filmmaking for now.

2. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.

This means that reading is to the right of card-games.

3. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.

This means that card-games is to the right of skydiving.

4. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

This means that skydiving is to the right of magic-tricks.

5. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

This means that filmmaking is to the left of magic-tricks.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Card-games is between reading and filmmaking (from clue 1)
* Reading is to the right of card-games (from clue 2)
* Card-games is to the right of skydiving (from clue 3)
* Skydiving is to the right of magic-tricks (from clue 4)
* Filmmaking is to the left of magic-tricks (from clue 5)

The possible order is:

Skydiving -> Magic-tricks -> Card-games -> Reading -> Filmmaking

But wait, we can't have card-games between reading and filmmaking if it's to the right of skydiving! So, let's try again:

Magic-tricks -> Skydiving -> Card-games -> Reading -> Filmmaking

This order satisfies all the clues. Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know that the fan of folk music is either the person who eats avocado or the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the fan of folk music is in an even position (statement 8), and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position (statement 3), the fan of folk music must be the person who eats avocado.
2. From statement 6, we know that the fan of punk music is either the person who eats pomegranate or the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the fan of punk music is on the far left (statement 14), and the person who's hobby is drawing is not on the far left (statement 1), the fan of punk music must be the person who eats pomegranate.
3. From statement 7, we know that the person who eats avocado is either the fan of jazz music or the person who's hobby is photography. Since the person who eats avocado is already assigned to the fan of folk music, and the fan of jazz music is not the person who's hobby is photography (statement 1), the person who eats avocado must be the fan of jazz music.
4. From statement 12, we know that the fan of gospel music has the same parity position as the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the fan of gospel music is on the left of the person who eats pomegranate (statement 26), and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position, the fan of gospel music must be in an even position.
5. From statement 13, we know that the person who eats avocado (fan of jazz music) has the same parity position as the person who watches disaster movies. Since the person who watches disaster movies is in an odd position (statement 9), the person who eats avocado must be in an even position, which contradicts the previous conclusion. Therefore, the person who eats avocado must be the fan of jazz music, and the person who watches disaster movies must be the fan of gospel music.
6. From statement 15, we know that the person driving the scooter is not to the left of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the person who's hobby is photography is already assigned to the fan of jazz music, and the fan of punk music is on the far left, the person driving the scooter must be on the right side of the table.
7. From statement 16, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games and the fan of punk music have different parity positions. Since the fan of punk music is on the far left, the person who's hobby is card-games must be in an odd position.
8. From statement 17, we know that the person watching sports movies and the person driving the taxi have the same parity position. Since the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person eating plum (statement 10), and the person eating plum is on the left of the person eating lime (statement 27), the person watching sports movies must be in an even position.
9. From statement 18, we know that the person driving the van is either the fan of punk music or the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the fan of punk music is already assigned to the person who eats pomegranate, and the person who's hobby is card-games is in an odd position, the person driving the van must be the fan of punk music.
10. From statement 19, we know that the person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the right of the fan of folk music. Since the fan of folk music is in an even position, the person watching thriller movies must be in an odd position.
11. From statement 20, we know that the person watching sports movies is not to the left of the fan of jazz music. Since the fan of jazz music is already assigned to the person who eats avocado, and the person watching sports movies is in an even position, the person watching sports movies must be on the right side of the fan of jazz music.
12. From statement 21, we know that the person driving the roller is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in an odd position, the person driving the roller must be in an even position.
13. From statement 22, we know that the person driving the scooter is not to the left of the person watching sports movies. Since the person watching sports movies is in an even position, the person driving the scooter must be in an odd position.
14. From statement 23, we know that the person eating avocado is somewhere between the person eating plum and the person driving the van. Since the person eating avocado is already assigned to the fan of jazz music, and the person driving the van is the fan of punk music, the person eating plum must be on the left of the person eating avocado.
15. From statement 24, we know that the person driving the van is not the person eating pomegranate. Since the person eating pomegranate is already assigned to the fan of punk music, the person driving the van must be the fan of gospel music.
16. From statement 25, we know that the person eating pomegranate is not the fan of folk music. Since the fan of folk music is already assigned to the person who eats avocado, the person eating pomegranate must be the fan of gospel music.
17. From statement 26, we know that the fan of gospel music is on the left of the person eating pomegranate. Since the person eating pomegranate is the fan of gospel music, the fan of gospel music must be in an even position.
18. From statement 27, we know that the person eating lime is on the left of the person eating plum. Since the person eating plum is already assigned to the person eating avocado, the person eating lime must be on the left of the person eating avocado.

By combining these conclusions, we can fill in the entire table with the correct assignments."

1. The person driving the bus is somewhere between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the tram.
2. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

From clue 2, we know that the bus driver is to the right of the quad-bike driver. From clue 1, we know that the bus driver is also between the quad-bike driver and the tram driver.

7. The person who's sport is basketball is the person who's hobby is singing.
8. The fan of indie is on the far left.

From statement 1, we know the fan of dubstep is watching romance movies. From statement 8, we know the fan of indie is on the far left. Since there are only 3 music-genres, the fan of indie must be the person on the far left.

From statement 4, we know the electrician is the person who's sport is basketball. From statement 6, we know the person who's sport is basketball is watching scientific movies. Therefore, the electrician is watching scientific movies.

From statement 2, we know the electrician is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the electrician is watching scientific movies, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be watching animation movies.

From statement 3, we know the person watching romance movies is between the person who's sport is basketball and the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the electrician is watching scientific movies, the person who's hobby is collecting must be watching animation movies.

From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is basketball is the person who's hobby is singing. Since the electrician is the person who's sport is basketball, the electrician is also the person who's hobby is singing.

Lv1-1x4-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
This means that coffee cannot be in the first position, so it must be in either the second, third, or fourth position. Let's assume it's in the second position for now.

2. The person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
This means that water cannot be in the fourth position, as iced-tea would be on the far right, which is not allowed. So, water must be in either the first or second position. Let's assume it's in the first position for now.

3. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right.
This means that iced-tea cannot be in the second or third position, as it would not be on the far left or far right. So, iced-tea must be in either the first or fourth position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Water is in the first position (from clue 2).
* Coffee is in the second position (from clue 1).
* Iced-tea is in either the first or fourth position (from clue 3).

If iced-tea is in the first position, then fanta would be in the second position, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, iced-tea must be in the fourth position.

5. The Egyptian is the person drinking soy-milk.
6. The person driving the subway is on the left of the owner of the pony.
7. The person eating potato is on the right of the owner of the rat.

From statement 1, we know the Brazilian eats avocado.

From statement 4, we know the person driving the skateboard eats nectarine.

From statement 5, we know the Egyptian drinks soy-milk.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking lemonade is in the middle. Since the Brazilian eats avocado, the person drinking lemonade cannot be the Brazilian. Therefore, the person drinking lemonade must be the Egyptian (since they drink soy-milk).

From statement 2, we know the person drinking coffee is on the right of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian eats avocado, the person drinking coffee must be the person eating potato (since they are on the right of the Brazilian).

From statement 7, we know the person eating potato is on the right of the owner of the rat. Therefore, the person eating potato must be the person driving the subway (since they are on the right of the owner of the rat).

From statement 6, we know the person driving the subway is on the left of the owner of the pony. Therefore, the owner of the pony must be the person eating nectarine (since they drive the skateboard).

1. The person eating potato is on the right of the person eating plum.
This means that plum cannot be in the last position, as potato would be on the right of plum. So, plum must be in one of the first three positions.

2. The person eating strawberry is in the middle.
This means that strawberry must be in position 2 or 3.

3. The person eating strawberry is on the left of the person eating pomegranate.
This means that pomegranate cannot be in the first position, as strawberry would be on the left of pomegranate. So, pomegranate must be in position 4 or 5.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Plum is in one of the first three positions.
* Strawberry is in the middle (2 or 3).
* Pomegranate is in position 4 or 5.

The possible arrangements are:

| Food   | plum | strawberry |?         |?         | pomegranate |

We can try different combinations:

* If plum is in position 1, strawberry is in position 2, and pomegranate is in position 5, then potato would be in position 3, but there's no room for potato on the right of plum.
* If plum is in position 1, strawberry is in position 3, and pomegranate is in position 5, then potato would be in position 2, but strawberry is already in position 3.
* If plum is in position 2, strawberry is in position 3, and pomegranate is in position 5, then potato would be in position 1, which satisfies the condition.

Now we have a complete table, but we still need to fill in the job and music-genre columns. We know the nurse is in the third column, so the job column for the nurse is ""Nurse"". We also know the fan of punk is in the first column, so the music-genre column for the fan of punk is ""Punk"".

The only remaining cell is the job column for the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person eating lemon is in the second column, and the person drinking soy-milk is also in the second column, the person drinking soy-milk must be the security-guard.

2. From clue 2, we know the Brazilian owns the goldfish.
3. From clue 3, we know the person drinking cola likes lilac.
4. From clue 4, we know the Argentine drinks juice.
5. From clue 5, we know the person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes fuchsia. Since the Brazilian likes lilac (from clue 3), the Nigerian must like fuchsia.
6. From clue 6, we know the Aristoff-smoker owns the mouse. Since the Colombian is not the Aristoff-smoker (from clue 1), the Colombian must own the mouse.
7. From clue 7, we know the Oliveros-smoker likes coral. Since the Argentine drinks juice (from clue 4), the Argentine must like coral.
8. From clue 8, we know the person drinking soy-milk is in the middle. Since the German is on the far left (from clue 9), the German must drink soy-milk.
9. From clue 9, we know the German is on the far left.

| Pet           |           | gold     |       |         |

2. The Pakistani is on the left of the Nigerian, so the Pakistani must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the Pakistani is in position 1 for now.

|               | Pakistani |          |       |  Mexican |
| Nationality   |           |          |       |         |
| Pet           |           | gold     |       |         |

3. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the frog, so the mouse and frog cannot be in positions 1 and 2. This means the mouse and frog must be in positions 3 and 4, respectively.

|               | Pakistani |          | mouse |  Mexican |
| Nationality   |           |          |       |         |
| Pet           |           | gold     | frog  |         |

4. The owner of the fish is on the left of the Nigerian, so the fish must be in position 2.

|               | Pakistani | fish    | mouse |  Mexican |
| Nationality   |           |          |       |         |
| Pet           |           | gold     | frog  |         |

5. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the goldfish, so the mouse cannot be in position 2. This means the goldfish must be in position 2.

|               | Pakistani | gold    | mouse |  Mexican |
| Nationality   |           |          |       |         |
| Pet           |           | fish     | frog  |         |

Now we can fill in the nationalities:

* Pakistani is in position 1, so the Pakistani has the goldfish.
* The Nigerian is on the right of the Pakistani, so the Nigerian is in position 3.
* The Mexican is in position 4, so the Mexican has the frog.
* The remaining nationality, Dutch or Mexican, must be in position 2 and have the fish. Since the Mexican is already in position 4, the Dutch must be in position 2.

Here is the final solution:

1. The person who's sport is rowing is in an odd position.
This means that the rowing person is either in position 1 or position 3.

2. The person eating raspberry and the person who's sport is rowing have the same parity positions.
This means that both the raspberry-eater and the rowing person have the same position (either odd or even).

From the above statements, we can conclude that:

* The rowing person is in an odd position (1 or 3).
* The raspberry-eater is also in an odd position (1 or 3).
* The person eating grapes is in an even position (2).

1. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice.
This means that the order of soy-milk and juice is fixed, and the person drinking tea can be anywhere.

2. The person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking tea.

From statement 1, we know the fan pop and the person who's hobby is card-games have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the ferret is the fan pop, the person who's hobby is card-games must be on the same parity position as the ferret.

From statement 9, we know the italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the malaysian. This means the italian cannot be the fan metal (since the fan metal is either the owner of the goat or the malaysian, and the malaysian is already between the italian and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing).

From statement 3, we know the owner of the goat is the fan metal or the fan metal is the malaysian, but not both. Since the italian cannot be the fan metal, the malaysian must be the fan metal.

From statement 4, we know the fan pop is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the owner of the ferret is the fan pop, the owner of the pony must be on the opposite side of the fan pop.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the owner of the pony is not the fan pop, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be on the same side as the fan pop.

This means that the person drinking Mirinda is either in the 2nd or 3rd position.

2. The Canadian is in an even position.
This means that the Canadian is either in the 2nd or 4th position.

From clue 1, we know the person drinking Mirinda is in the 2nd or 3rd position. From clue 2, we know the Canadian is in the 2nd or 4th position. Since the Canadian is in an even position, they must be in the 2nd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Transport     |         |  Train     |         | Motorbike |

Since the Canadian is in the 2nd position, the person drinking Mirinda must be in the 3rd position. The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking Mirinda, so they must be in the 2nd position.

Now, let's determine the remaining information:

* The person driving the train is Canadian, since they are in the 2nd position and the Canadian is in the 2nd position.
* The person drinking Mirinda is not Canadian, since the Canadian is in the 2nd position and the person drinking Mirinda is in the 3rd position.
* The person drinking Sprite must be Turkish, since the person drinking Mirinda is not Canadian.
* The person driving the motorbike must be Turkish, since the person driving the train is Canadian.

From statement 1, we know the person drinking tea is in the middle. Let's assume the middle position is 3.

From statement 3, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking tea is in the middle, the person drinking almond-milk must be on the left of the middle position.

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already on the left, the person who's hobby is reading must be on the right of the middle position.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already on the left, the person drinking mirinda must be on the right of the middle position.

| Nationality   |           |            |          |             |

From the above deductions, we can start filling in the table:

* The doctor (Italian) drinks almond-milk.
* The Pakistani is on the left of the person eating broccoli.
* The scientist (eating raspberry) is somewhere to the right of the Pakistani.
* The journalist is on the left or right of the nurse.
* The nurse is between the person drinking tea and the doctor (almond-milk).

Now, let's try to figure out the remaining positions:

* The person eating broccoli is between the person eating spinach and the journalist. This means the journalist is on the right of the person eating broccoli.
* The Pakistani is on the left of the person eating broccoli, so the Pakistani is on the left of the journalist.
* The scientist (eating raspberry) is on the right of the Pakistani, so the scientist is on the right of the journalist.
* The nurse is between the person drinking tea and the doctor (almond-milk). This means the nurse is on the left of the doctor.

Now we can fill in the remaining positions:

| Nationality   |           |            |          |             |

* 1: Pakistani (broccoli) - Japanese (tea)
* 2: Journalist (spinach) - Scientist (raspberry)
* 3: Nurse (between tea and almond-milk) - Doctor (Italian, almond-milk)
* 4: Argentine (soy-milk) - Italian (doctor, almond-milk)
