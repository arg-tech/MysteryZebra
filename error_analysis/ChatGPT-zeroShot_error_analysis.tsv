The person who smokes Lucky Strikes drinks orange juice.

The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
The Japanese smokes Parliaments.

The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
House 2 must be blue because House 1 is the Norwegian’s house.

Step-by-step deductions:
House 1 (Norwegian's house):

The Norwegian lives in House 1 (clue 10).
The Norwegian lives next to the blue house (clue 15), so House 2 must be blue.
Since House 1 is next to House 2, it cannot be blue, red, or green. Thus, House 1 must be yellow.
House 2 (Ukrainian's house):

The Ukrainian drinks tea (clue 5), so House 2 must have tea as the beverage.
The only cigarette brand left for House 2 is Lucky Strikes (clue 13).
The person who smokes Lucky Strikes drinks orange juice (clue 13), so House 2 drinks orange juice.
House 3 (middle house):

The middle house drinks milk (clue 9), so House 3 drinks milk.
The green house is to the right of the ivory house (clue 6). So, House 3 must be ivory, and House 4 must be green.
House 4 (Green house):

The green house drinks coffee (clue 4).
The Japanese smokes Parliaments (clue 14). Therefore, the Japanese must live in House 4 and smoke Parliaments.
House 5 (Red house):

The Englishman lives in the red house (clue 2), so the Englishman must live in House 5.
The Spaniard owns the dog (clue 3), and since House 5 is occupied by the Englishman, the Spaniard must live in House 5 and own the dog.
Kools and Pets:

The Old Gold smoker owns snails (clue 7). Since the only place for Old Gold cigarettes left is House 3 (ivory house), the person in House 3 must own snails.
Kools are smoked in the yellow house (clue 8), so the Norwegian (who lives in House 1) must smoke Kools. The Norwegian must own the horse (clue 12), since the person who smokes Kools lives next to the house where the horse is kept.
The man with the fox and Chesterfields:

The man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox (clue 11). The only place left for Chesterfields is House 2, and since House 2 is next to House 1, House 1 must have the fox.

Step-by-Step Deduction:

The person who likes green drinks coffee (Clue 5), so the person in position 3 does not like green.
The person who likes green must be in position 2, and the person in position 1 must be Norwegian (Clue 9), so position 1 must not like green.
The green lover drinks coffee, so position 2 drinks coffee.

The person in position 3 drinks milk and cannot like green or coffee. The person in position 3 must therefore like white.
Position 1 (Norwegian) must like yellow (since only yellow is left), and the Norwegian smokes Dunhill (Clue 7). The Dunhill smoker must be in position 1.

The person who likes red is British (Clue 1). So, the person in position 4 must be British and like red.

The person who owns the dog is Swedish (Clue 2), and the Swedish person must be in position 5, so position 5 must own the dog.

The Pall-Mall smoker owns the bird (Clue 6). Given that position 4 must be British and has a red color, the bird owner must be in position 2.

The German smokes Prince cigars (Clue 13). Position 5 must be German, so position 5 smokes Prince.

The Bluemaster smoker drinks beer (Clue 12), so position 4 drinks beer.

The person who owns horses is next to the Dunhill smoker (Clue 11), so the horse owner must be in position 2.

The person who smokes Blend is next to the person who owns the cat (Clue 10), so position 3 must own the cat and must smoke Blend.

Chat-GPT_Zebra_orig_NL_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, I will analyze the clues and fill in the table step by step. Let's solve it:

Initial Information:
We need to determine:

Nationality for each house.
Color associated with each house.
Beverage for each house.
Cigar brand smoked in each house.
Pet kept in each house.
The table has 5 positions/houses (from 1 to 5).

Steps:
Clue 9: The Norwegian is on the far left.
Norwegian is in position 1.

Clue 14: The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
Therefore, position 2 has the blue house.

Clue 8: The person drinking milk is in the middle.
Milk is in position 3.

Clue 5: The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
Green is in position 4, and ivory is in position 3.

Clue 3: The person drinking coffee likes green.
Coffee is in position 4.

Clue 1: The English person likes red.
Red is associated with English. Since green and ivory are taken for positions 4 and 3, red must be in position 2. Therefore, the English person is in position 2.

Clue 2: The Spanish person owns the dog.
The Spanish person cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (occupied by Norwegian, English, and coffee/green, respectively). The Spanish person must be in position 5.

Clue 7: The kools-smoker likes yellow.
Since position 1 (Norwegian) is the only one left without a color, yellow is in position 1, and the kools-smoker is in position 1.

Clue 11: The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.
Therefore, the horse is in position 2.

Clue 10: The chesterfields-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the fox.
Since position 1 has kools and the horse is in position 2, the chesterfields-smoker must be in position 2 or 4, and the fox must be in position 3 or 5. Let’s hold this clue for now.

Clue 13: The Japanese is the parliaments-smoker.
Since position 5 is the only one left, the Japanese is in position 5, smoking parliaments.

Clue 12: The lucky-strike-smoker drinks orange juice.
Position 4 has coffee, position 3 has milk, and position 2 is red (English), so orange juice must be in position 5 with the Japanese, who smokes lucky strikes.

Clue 6: The old-gold-smoker owns snails.
The old-gold-smoker must be in position 3, leaving chesterfields for position 2.

Clue 4: The Ukrainian drinks tea.
The Ukrainian must be in position 2.

Now fill in the remaining details:

The fox (from clue 10) must be in position 4, and the zebra must be in position 5.

ChatGPT-Einstein-lexical-0	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step. We'll fill out the table as we go.

1. Clues Breakdown:
Clue 1: The Japanese person likes black.

The Japanese person must have black as their favorite color.
Clue 2: The Swedish owns the guinea-pig.

The person with the guinea-pig must be Swedish.
Clue 3: The Australian drinks almond-milk.

The Australian's beverage is almond-milk.

Clue 8: The person drinking Mirinda is in the middle.

The person in the middle (position 3) drinks Mirinda.
Clue 9: The Dutch is on the far left.

The Dutch person is in position 1 (far left).
Clue 10: The Chaman smoker is either left or right of the person with the ferret.

The Chaman smoker must be adjacent to the person with the ferret.
Clue 11: The person with the turtle is either left or right of the Game smoker.

The turtle owner must be adjacent to the Game smoker.
Clue 12: The Davidoff smoker drinks Fanta.

The Davidoff smoker's beverage is Fanta.
Clue 13: The French smokes Havana cigars.

The French person smokes Havana cigars.
Clue 14: The Dutch is either left or right of the person who likes chestnut.

The Dutch person is next to the person who likes chestnut.
Clue 15: The Chaman smoker is either left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

The Chaman smoker is adjacent to the person who drinks hot-chocolate.
Step-by-Step Deduction:
Position 1 (Far Left): The Dutch person is in position 1 (Clue 9).

Since the Dutch person is next to the person who likes chestnut (Clue 14), the person in position 2 must like chestnut.
Position 3 (Middle): The person drinking Mirinda is in the middle (Clue 8).

Position 2: The person in position 2 likes chestnut and must be adjacent to the Dutch person (Clue 14). Since the Dutch person is in position 1, the person in position 2 is the one who likes chestnut.

Grey and Aquamarine: From Clue 4 and Clue 5, the person who likes grey drinks 7up and must be to the left of the person who likes aquamarine.

Position 4 can be the one who likes aquamarine, and position 3 must like grey. The person who likes grey (position 3) drinks 7up.
The Japanese: The Japanese person likes black (Clue 1). Since the Japanese person is not in positions 1, 3, or 4, the Japanese person must be in position 5 and likes black.

The Australian: The Australian drinks almond-milk (Clue 3). The Australian must be in position 4 because position 3 is already taken by grey (7up), and position 2 is for chestnut.

The French: The French person smokes Havana cigars (Clue 13). Position 3 is taken by the grey person, so the French person must be in position 2 or 5. The French person can't be in position 5 (because of the Japanese person), so they must be in position 2.

Chinchilla and Baccarat: The Baccarat smoker owns the chinchilla (Clue 6). This person must be in position 4 because of the other clues.

Other Pets: From the remaining pets, the Swedish owns the guinea-pig (Clue 2). This must be in position 3.

Azure and Game: The person who likes azure smokes Game cigars (Clue 7). This must be the person in position 1, who likes azure.

The Chaman smoker: The Chaman smoker must be adjacent to the person who drinks hot-chocolate (Clue 15) and adjacent to the person with the ferret (Clue 10). This person must be in position 4, smoking Chaman cigars.

House 2 or house 4 must smoke Blend, and the neighbor keeps Cats. Since house 2 already has Tea and Horses, house 4 must smoke Blend, and house 3 must have Cats.
Clue 15: The owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water.

Since house 4 smokes Blend, house 3 must drink Water.
Clue 2: The Swede keeps Dogs as pets.

The Swede must live in house 5 and have Dogs.

Step-by-step deductions:
House 1 (Norwegian's house):

The Norwegian lives in House 1 (clue 10).
The Norwegian lives next to the blue house (clue 15), so House 2 must be blue.
Since House 1 is next to House 2, it cannot be blue, red, or green. Thus, House 1 must be yellow.
House 2 (Ukrainian's house):

The Ukrainian drinks tea (clue 5), so House 2 must have tea as the beverage.
The only cigarette brand left for House 2 is Lucky Strikes (clue 13).
The person who smokes Lucky Strikes drinks orange juice (clue 13), so House 2 drinks orange juice.
House 3 (middle house):

The middle house drinks milk (clue 9), so House 3 drinks milk.
The green house is to the right of the ivory house (clue 6). So, House 3 must be ivory, and House 4 must be green.
House 4 (Green house):

The green house drinks coffee (clue 4).
The Japanese smokes Parliaments (clue 14). Therefore, the Japanese must live in House 4 and smoke Parliaments.
House 5 (Red house):

The Englishman lives in the red house (clue 2), so the Englishman must live in House 5.
The Spaniard owns the dog (clue 3), and since House 5 is occupied by the Englishman, the Spaniard must live in House 5 and own the dog.
Kools and Pets:

The Old Gold smoker owns snails (clue 7). Since the only place for Old Gold cigarettes left is House 3 (ivory house), the person in House 3 must own snails.
Kools are smoked in the yellow house (clue 8), so the Norwegian (who lives in House 1) must smoke Kools. The Norwegian must own the horse (clue 12), since the person who smokes Kools lives next to the house where the horse is kept.
The man with the fox and Chesterfields:

The man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox (clue 11). The only place left for Chesterfields is House 2, and since House 2 is next to House 1, House 1 must have the fox.

Nationalities: British, Danish, German, Norwegian, Swedish
Pets: cat, bird, dog, fish, horse

The Swedish is the owner of the dog.

The person who owns the dog is Swedish.

The Norwegian is next to the person who likes blue.
The Blend smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water.

The Blend smoker must be next to the person who drinks water.
Step-by-Step Solution
Position 1 is Norwegian (Clue 9). The Norwegian must be next to the person who likes blue (Clue 14). Therefore, position 2 must like blue.

Position 3 drinks milk (Clue 8), and this person is neither the one who likes green nor blue. This means position 3 must like white (as it is the only option left). So, position 3 drinks milk and likes white.

The person who likes green drinks coffee (Clue 5), so position 2 likes green and drinks coffee.

The person who likes red is British (Clue 1), and since position 3 already likes white, the British must be in position 4 and likes red.

The person who owns the dog is Swedish (Clue 2), so the person in position 5 must be Swedish and owns the dog.

The person who likes yellow smokes Dunhill (Clue 7), and the only position left for the person who likes yellow is position 1, so the Norwegian in position 1 likes yellow and smokes Dunhill.

The Pall-Mall smoker owns the bird (Clue 6), so position 2 smokes Pall-Mall and owns the bird.

The Bluemaster smoker drinks beer (Clue 12), so position 4 smokes Bluemaster and drinks beer.

The German smokes Prince cigars (Clue 13), so position 5 smokes Prince.

The Blend smoker is on the left or right of the person who owns the cat (Clue 10), so position 3 owns the cat and smokes Blend.

The person who owns horses is next to the Dunhill smoker (Clue 11), so position 2 owns horses.

The Blend smoker is next to the person drinking water (Clue 15), so position 5 drinks water.
