Lv1-3x2-3	"Based on the given puzzle information:

1. The dressmaker is on the far left.
2. The person driving the tram is on the left of the owner of the mouse.

We can deduce the following:

- Dressmaker (Job) must be in the first column, either row 1 or row 2.
- Since the dressmaker is on the far left, Electrician (Job) will occupy the other two cells.
- Owner of Mouse (Pet) and Tram Driver (Transport) are related due to clue 2. The mouse owner will be one cell right from the tram driver.
- Owner of Pony (Pet) must be in the remaining cells.

Now, let's fill out the table accordingly:

The person eating carrot is driving the boat (rule 9).
The person eating garlic is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing, which means they are not in position 1 or 2 (rules 5 and 7).
The person eating papaya is on the right of the person whose hobby is board-games, which means they are not in positions 4 or 5 (rule 10).
The person eating spinach cannot be in position 1 because the person who's hobby is singing is on the far left (rules 1 and 7).
The person eating zucchini is between the person eating garlic and the person driving the train, which means they are in position 3 (rule 2).

| Transport      | bike         | train    | quad-bike  |

Now, applying the given clues:

1. The owner of the turtle (cranberry eater) is on the right of the person driving the bike. This means that the cranberry eater cannot be in position 2, as they would then be left of the bike driver.

2. The person eating watermelon is the person driving the train. This means that the watermelon eater must be in position 3.

With these clues, we can fill out the positions:

#############
Now, applying the remaining clues:

3. The person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since we already have the cranberry eater in position 2 and the bird owner in position 1, this clue does not affect our current table.

4. The person eating carrot is between the person watching adventure movies and the person driving the train. We can place the carrot eater (position 1) because the adventure movie watcher is in position 1 or 3, and the train driver is always in position 3.

Zebra_domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we'll use a process of elimination and logical deduction based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We have 5 columns (1 to 5) for each category.
   - We need to place one item from each category in each column.

2. **Clues Analysis:**

   - **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person watching mystery movies.
   - **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is water-polo is the social-worker.
   - **Clue 3:** The person drinking coffee is the person watching horror movies.
   - **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is snowboarding is the person drinking tea.
   - **Clue 5:** The person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies.
   - **Clue 6:** The person eating cranberry is the engineer.
   - **Clue 7:** The person eating spinach is the person watching western movies.
   - **Clue 8:** The person drinking milk is in the middle (column 3).
   - **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is cricket is on the far left (column 1).
   - **Clue 10:** The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the chef.
   - **Clue 11:** The person eating spinach is to the left or right of the bartender.
   - **Clue 12:** The person eating grapes is the person drinking orange-juice.
   - **Clue 13:** The person who's sport is biathlon is the person eating lime.
   - **Clue 14:** The person who's sport is cricket is to the left or right of the person watching drama movies.

3. **Step-by-Step Solution:**

   - **Column 3 (middle):**
     - From Clue 8, the person in column 3 drinks milk.
     - From Clue 4, the person drinking tea cannot be in column 3.
     - From Clue 7, the person eating spinach is watching western movies. Since spinach and western are often together, we can place them in column 3.

   - **Column 1 (far left):**
     - From Clue 9, the person who's sport is cricket is in column 1.
     - From Clue 2, the person who's sport is water-polo is the social-worker. Since cricket and water-polo cannot be in the same column, the social-worker must be in another column.

   - **Column 5 (far right):**
     - From Clue 13, the person who's sport is biathlon eats lime.
     - From Clue 6, the person eating cranberry is the engineer. Since biathlon and cranberry cannot be in the same column, the engineer must be in another column.

   - **Column 2:**
     - From Clue 5, the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies.
     - From Clue 3, the person drinking coffee watches horror movies. Therefore, the person in column 2 drinks coffee and watches horror movies.
     - The person in column 1 must watch adventure movies.

   - **Column 4:**
     - From Clue 5, the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since column 2 has horror, column 1 has adventure, and column 3 is already filled, column 4 must be the remaining genre.
     - From Clue 10, the person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the chef. Therefore, the chef must be in column 4.

   - **Remaining items:**
     - The person in column 2 drinks coffee and watches horror movies.
     - The person in column 3 drinks milk and eats spinach (western).
     - The person in column 4 is the chef.
     - The person in column 5 eats lime and does biathlon.

   - **Final placements:**
     - Column 1: Cricket, Adventure, Water, Lime, Engineer
     - Column 2: Lacrosse, Horror, Coffee, Grapes, Social Worker
     - Column 3: Snowboarding, Western, Milk, Spinach, Chef
     - Column 4: Water-Polo, Drama, Orange Juice, Cauliflower, Bartender

Lv9-3x2-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

1. Parity positions: There are two people with the same parity (either both even or both odd) in positions related to cola and romance movies.
2. Frog owner to the right of milk drinker: The person who owns a frog is positioned to the right of the person who drinks milk.

First, let's arrange the beverages based on the clue about the frog owner:

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     |          |

| Pet            |               |          |

Now, we know that the person drinking milk is in position 1. According to clue 2, the frog owner is to the right of this person. Therefore, the frog owner must be in position 2.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     |          |

| Pet            |               | **frog** |

Since there are only two beverages (cola and milk), the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     | **cola**|

| Pet            |               | **frog** |

Now let's deal with movie genres. We have two movie genres (martial-arts and romance). Since the person watching romance movies has the same parity position as the person drinking cola, they must both be in position 2.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     | **cola**| 
| Movie-Genre    |               | **romance**|
| Pet            |               | **frog** |

This leaves martial-arts for position 1.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     | **cola**| 
| Movie-Genre    | **martial-arts**| **romance**|
| Pet            |               | **frog** |

We haven't assigned pets yet. Since the frog owner is in position 2, the turtle must be in position 1.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     | **cola**| 
| Movie-Genre    | **martial-arts**| **romance**|
| Pet            | **turtle**   | **frog** |

Finally, let's put the '#############' around the final solution table.
