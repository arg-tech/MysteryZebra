#############

Explanation:

* The fan of blues is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski ( condition 1).
* The person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person drinking mirinda (condition 2).
* The person watching crime movies is the person driving the roller (condition 3).
* The fan of electronic is on the right of the person driving the car (condition 4).
* The person watching documentary movies is in an odd position (condition 5), so it's either in column 1, 3 or 5. Since condition 2 places thriller in column 1 and condition 8 says thriller is in an even position, documentary must be in column 3.
* The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (condition 6).
* The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee (condition 9).
* The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient (condition 10), and since condition 12 says roller is on the left of the fan of ambient, airplane must be in column 1.
* The person watching thriller movies is in an even position (condition 8), so it's either in column 2 or 4. Since condition 13 places milk to the right of thriller, and condition 14 says coffee is adventure, thrillers can't be in column 2, leaving column 4 as its only possible location.
* The person watching crime movies is on the right of the fan of country (condition 16).
* The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski (condition 17).

Combining all these conditions and their consequences leads us to this final solution."

| Music-Genre   | trance      | funk          | salsa        | dubstep |

 

Here's a brief explanation of the steps taken to arrive at this solution:


* From clue 1, almond-milk is on the left of hot-chocolate.
* Clue 5 places board-games to the left of fishing, and since hot-chocolate (clue 11) is also on the left of board-games, we can establish a partial order: almond-milk -> hot-chocolate -> board-games -> fishing. The remaining beverage, mirinda, goes to position 4.
* Clue 8 places salsa to the right of traveling, and clue 6 places reading between fishing and traveling. Since the person drinking fanta is not the fan of salsa (clue 2), we assign fanta to the reading hobbyist in position 2.
* The remaining hobbies are assigned: board-games to almond-milk, fishing to hot-chocolate, and traveling to mirinda.
* Clues 9-10 establish that funk has a parity position with reading. Since reading is at an even position (2), funk must also be at an even position (2). Trance is then placed on either side of funk; we choose the left side for now.
* Clue 7 places dubstep to the right of almond-milk, so it can't be at position 1. Since trance is already in position 1, and clue 12 states that dubstep is to the right of trance, we move trance to position 3 (even) and place dubstep in position 4.
* However, this placement would conflict with salsa being on the right of traveling (clue 8). To resolve this, we swap funk with salsa, moving funk to an odd position (3) and placing salsa at the even position (2), maintaining parity.


The final solution table is:

Lv3-1x3-3	"Let's break down the clues:


Clue 1: The person driving the tram is on the far left or far right.
This means the tram can be either in column 1 or column 3.


Clue 2: The person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the taxi.
This means the taxi cannot be on the far right, and the tram must be to the right of the taxi. Since the tram can only be in column 1 or column 3 (from Clue 1), this means:


* If the tram were in column 1 (far left), it would be impossible for the taxi to be to its left.
* Therefore, the tram must be in column 3 (far right).
* The taxi cannot be on the far right, so it must be either in column 1 or column 2.

Given this information, we can conclude that:


* Column 1: Taxi
* Column 2: Train (since the only remaining option is train)
* Column 3: Tram

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv4-2x4-3	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know the person eating pomegranate is in an even position. This means they can be in either position 2 or 4.

From clue 6, we know the person eating grapes is on the right of the person eating pomegranate. This means that if pomegranate is in position 2, grapes must be in position 3, and if pomegranate is in position 4, grapes cannot be on their right (since there's no position 5). Therefore, pomegranate must be in position 2, and grapes must be in position 3.

From clue 1, we know the person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since western movies can't be in position 3 (because grapes are there), western movies must be either in position 2 or 4. But pomegranate is already in position 2, so western movies must be in position 4.

From clue 3, we know the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person eating grapes. Since western movies are in position 4 and grapes are in position 3, this fits perfectly.

From clue 5, we know the person watching animation movies is in an odd position. This means they can be in either position 1 or 3. But position 3 is taken by grapes, so animation movies must be in position 1.

The only remaining positions are for spy and documentary movies. From clue 4, we know western movies are on the right of spy movies, which means spy movies must be in position 2 doesn't work (since pomegranate is there), but what if spy movies were before animation? That would make documentary movies fit perfectly in position 3's neighbor â€“ nope that also doesn't work since grapes are there. So the person watching spy can only fit on the left of western and so has to be at the end.

The completed table looks like this:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |      4      |
| Food          | carrot     | pomegranate | grapes    | watermelon  |
| Movie-Genre   | animation  | documentary | spy        | western       |

Wait a minute we still need to fit the carrots and documentary to their correct places

Since there's only one option for position of carrots left it is at 1.

 documentary can now only be at number 2 since all other positions are filled up.



So Final solution table looks like this:




|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |      4      |

| Movie-Genre   | animation  | documentary | spy        | western       |

Since there's only one option for position of spy left it is at 3.

Lv8-1x4-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 3, we know that rock-climbing is in an odd position, so it must be either position 1 or 3.

From clue 4, we know that rock-climbing is not to the right of baking. If rock-climbing were in position 3, then baking would have to be in position 1 or 2. But if baking were in position 1, it would be to the left of rock-climbing, which contradicts clue 4. Therefore, rock-climbing must be in position 1.

Now, from clue 1, we know that woodworking is between baking and chess. Since rock-climbing is already occupying position 1, this means that baking cannot be in position 2 (because there's no room for woodworking to fit between baking and chess). Therefore, baking must be in position 3 or 4.

From clue 2, we know that woodworking is not to the right of rock-climbing. This means that woodworking must be either in position 2 or 3.

Putting it all together:

- Rock-climbing is in position 1 (from clue 3 and 4)
- Woodworking is between baking and chess (from clue 1), so it must be in position 2
- Baking cannot be in position 2, so it must be in either position 3 or 4. But since woodworking is already occupying position 2, this means that baking must be in position 3.
- Chess must be to the right of woodworking (from clue 1), so it must be in position 4.

| Sport         | weightlifting | rowing  | soccer   | tennis        | cricket     |

Here's the explanation of how I got to this solution:

From clue 3, tea is on the left of the American. From clue 1, hiking is on the left or right of tea. 

From clue 4, the person drinking tea is Chinese.

From clue 5, the Dutch is skydiving.

From clue 2, cricket is on the right of photography.

From clue 11, tennis is the sport of the Chinese, who drinks tea.

From clue 7, board-games is on the far right.

From clue 10, American is on the right of cooking. 

From clue 14, cooking is on the right of skydiving.

From clue 6, hot-chocolate is on the left of Australian.

From clue 9, soy-milk is on the far left or far right. Since board-games is already on the far right (from clue 7), soy-milk must be on the far left.

From clue 8, rowing is on the left or right of fanta.

From clue 12, Japanese is between American and soy-milk.

Now that we have most of the clues solved, let's fill in the remaining blanks:

* Fanta can't go with skydiving (since it would leave no space for cooking), so it goes with cooking.
* Rowing goes with photography.
* Lemonade goes with Australian.
* Weightlifting goes with Dutch.

Now that we have all the pieces filled in, let's arrange them according to their respective columns:


|               |       1       |    2    |    3     |       4       |      5      |

Note: The numbers in the comments (e.g., ##3, ##5) are not part of the puzzle and were used for reference only.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clues 1 and 2, we know the Argentine is on the far left, and the fan of ambient is on the left or right of the skateboard.
* Clue 11 reveals that the Russian is the fan of ambient, so they must be in position 5 (the far right).
* Clues 4, 7, 8, and 9 help us place the Mexican and the fan of soul. The Mexican is to the right of the Polish, and the fan of soul is between the Argentine and the Russian.
* Clue 3 eliminates the Polish as a fan of ambient (which we already knew from clue 11), but it also tells us that the fan of ambient is not the one driving the skateboard.
* Clues 10 and 12 place the Polish to the left of the Mexican, with the fan of blues on their left. This means the Polish must be in position 2, and the Argentine (who loves blues) is in position 1.
* The remaining music-genres can be filled in using clues 6, 8, and 9: classical goes to the Mexican, soul to the Colombian, and R&B to the person between the Polish and the Mexican (who must be driving a roller).
* Finally, clue 13 places the snowmobile on the right of the fan of R&B, which means it's driven by the Mexican.

From statement 1, we know that almond-milk is in an even position. Since water is already occupying the middle (odd) position, almond-milk must be at either position 2 or 4.


From statement 7, we know that iced-tea is on the left of tea. Since there's no restriction on their positions yet, let's keep this information in mind for now.


From statement 5, we know that badminton is between iced-tea and swimming. This means iced-tea must be to the left of badminton, and swimming must be to the right of badminton.


Now, let's try to place almond-milk. From statement 2, we know that almond-milk is on the right of swimming. If almond-milk were at position 2, then swimming would have to be at position 1, which contradicts statement 5 (badminton being between iced-tea and swimming). Therefore, almond-milk must be at position 4.

Now, let's place the remaining beverages. Since iced-tea is on the left of tea (statement 7), and badminton is between iced-tea and swimming (statement 5), we can deduce that iced-tea must be at position 1.

From clue 1, we know that the German is to the right of the nurse.


From clue 2 and clue 3, we can deduce that the person driving the tram is to the left of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the tram driver cannot be to the right of the singer (clue 2), they must be in column 1, and the singer must be in column 2.


We also know from clue 3 that the tram driver is on the left of the singer.


Now we can start filling in the table:

| Nationality   |        |          |

From clue 1, we know that the German is to the right of the nurse. The only possible combination is:

Lv6-3x4-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:

| Movie-Genre   | fantasy  | martial-arts| spy     | superhero    |
| Nationality   | american | russian    | turkish | pakistani    |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 8, we know the person eating pepper is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since there are only two positions to the left (1 and 2), pepper must be in position 1.
* Clue 6 tells us that mango is somewhere to the right of pepper, so mango can't be in position 1 or 2. We'll place mango temporarily in position 3 or 4.
* Clue 2 states that the russian is between the person eating mango and the pakistani. This means russian must be in position 2 or 3. Let's put russian in position 2 for now.
* From clue 7, we know the person watching superhero movies is between the russian and the american. Since american can't be to the right of russian (due to clue 3), superhero movies must be in position 4, and american is in position 1 or 2. However, since pepper is already in position 1, american must be in position 1, which means we need to swap mango with another food.
* Clue 5 tells us that the person eating blueberry is not watching fantasy movies. Since blueberry can't be paired with fantasy (which is likely in position 1), let's pair blueberry with martial-arts in position 2.
* With russian in position 2 and blueberry in position 2, we need to move russian to position 3.
* Now that mango has been moved from position 3, clue 6 allows us to place carrot (the remaining food) in position 4.
* Clue 1 tells us the person watching spy movies is not turkish. With pakistani already in a possible position for spy movies, let's assign spy to pakistani and superhero to american.

Lv12-3x4-1	"After analyzing the given logic puzzle, I have derived a unique solution that satisfies all the conditions. Here's the solved table with the answers:

| Nationality   | Japanese | Spanish | French    | Brazilian |
| Transport     | Car      | Jet-ski | Quad-bike | Train     |

The explanation for the solution is as follows:

From clue 1, we know that either the person eating pepper is Japanese or they drive a car. Since there's no other information linking pepper to a specific nationality or transport, let's assume the person eating pepper drives a car.

Clue 2 tells us that avocado is to the right of pepper, and from clue 3, the person driving the car (pepper) is to the left of nectarine. This places the order as: pepper (car), ?, nectarine.

From clue 4, the person eating apple is also to the right of the person driving the car. Combining this with clue 14, which states that apple is to the right of avocado, we get: pepper (car), avocado, nectarine, apple.

Clue 5 tells us that train is not to the right of jet-ski, and from clue 6, quad-bike is not to the left of Japanese. Since pepper is already assigned to car, let's assign quad-bike to nectarine. This leaves jet-ski for avocado, which satisfies clue 7.

Clue 8 states that car (pepper) is to the left of Brazilian. Clues 9 and 10 tell us that French is not driving train and has a different parity position than train. The only remaining option for French is nectarine (quad-bike).

From clue 11, apple is not driven by jet-ski or Spanish. Since apple is already assigned to the rightmost column, we can assign Spanish to avocado (jet-ski).

Clue 12 tells us that Spanish (avocado) is between train and apple. Finally, clue 13 confirms that avocado is not to the left of pepper.

With all conditions satisfied, we arrive at the final solution table:

Lv6-2x4-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 1, we know the hedgehog is on the left of the snake.


From clue 2, the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the quad-bike.


From clue 3, the trike owner is not the guinea-pig owner.


From clue 4, the trike is to the right of the quad-bike.


From clue 5 (again!), the snake is to the left of the trike.


Now, let's combine the information:


Since the guinea-pig is to the left of the quad-bike and the hedgehog is to the left of the snake, and the snake is to the left of the trike, we can start building a possible order:


guinea-pig -> ? -> hedgehog -> snake -> ?


We know the quad-bike is to the right of the guinea-pig, so it's likely in the second position:


guinea-pig -> quad-bike -> hedgehog -> snake -> ?


The trike must be to the right of the quad-bike, and since the snake is to its left, the order becomes:


guinea-pig -> quad-bike -> hedgehog -> snake -> trike


Now we can add the last pet: goldfish. It's the only one left!


Since there are four means of transport (quad-bike, subway, train, trike), and the person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway (clue 5), we know the order for the second row:


subway -> ? -> train


The train must be to the right of the quad-bike (since the subway-train pair can't fit in the first two positions), so we have:


guinea-pig (quad-bike) -> hedgehog (subway) -> goldfish (?) -> snake (train) -> trike


But wait! We still need a pet for the second row, third column. It must be the goldfish!

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the subway is on the far left. From clue 1, we also know that this person watches adventure movies.

Clue 2 tells us that the person driving the taxi is to the right of the person driving the subway. This means the taxi driver must be in either column 2 or 3. Since the subway driver is watching adventure movies (column 1), and there are only three genres, the mystery movie watcher cannot be on the far left.

From clue 3, we know that the taxi driver is to the left or right of the person watching mystery movies. This means the mystery movie watcher must be in column 2, with the taxi driver in either column 1 or 3. However, since the subway driver (adventure) is already on the far left (column 1), and the taxi driver cannot also be in column 1, we conclude that the taxi driver must be in column 2 or 3.

Combining these insights, we can now place the mystery movie watcher in column 2 and the taxi driver in column 2 as well. This leaves only one option for the scientific movie watcher: column 3.

Since the snowmobile is the only remaining transportation option, it must be associated with the scientific movie watcher in column 3.

Lv4-4x3-8	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Transport     | quad-bike     | tram       | car          |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 2, we know soy-milk is on the far right (position 3).
* From clue 1, we know Russian is either on the far left or far right. Since soy-milk is already on the far right, Russian must be in position 2.
* From clue 6, we know car is in an odd position, which means it can only be in position 1 or 3. But since soy-milk is already in position 3, car must be in position 1.
* From clue 5, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the Pakistani. This means quad-bike cannot be in position 2 (since Russian is there), so it must be in position 1 or 3. But since car is already in position 1, quad-bike must be in position 3, which contradicts clue 5. Therefore, quad-bike must actually be in position 1.
* From clue 4, we know the person driving the quad-bike (in position 1) is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. This means dancing cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3.
* From clue 7, we know camping is between Pakistani and tram. Since Pakistani can't be in position 1 (quad-bike is there), Pakistani must be in either position 2 or 3. But since Russian is already in position 2, Pakistani must be in position 3, which means camping must be in position 2, and tram must be in position 3, but this contradicts the placement of soy-milk. Therefore, Pakistani must actually be in position 2, which means camping must be in position 1.
* From clue 6, we know hot-chocolate is in an odd position, which means it can only be in position 1 or 3. But since coffee is already in position 1 (deduced from the previous steps), and soy-milk is in position 3, hot-chocolate must be in position 2.
* From clue 7, we know camping is between Pakistani and tram. Since Pakistani is in position 2, and camping is in position 1, this means sudoku must be in position 2, which contradicts the placement of hot-chocolate. Therefore, sudoku must actually be in position 3.

After making these deductions, I arrived at the final solution table above."	E1 E10	{'beverage': ['coffee', 'hot-chocolate', 'soy-milk'], 'hobby': ['camping', 'sudoku', 'dancing'], 'nationality': ['german', 'russian', 'pakistani'], 'transport': ['quad-bike', 'tram', 'car']}	True	4	False

| Nationality   | italian    | dutch       | brazilian|
| Sport         | water-polo | parkour     | soccer    |
#############

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 6, we know the Brazilian is to the left of the person who likes soccer. Since there are only three positions, this means the Brazilian must be in position 2 or 1.

From clue 5 (which is a duplicate of clue 4), we know the salsa fan is to the right of the hip-hop fan.

From clue 2, we know the hip-hop fan is on either side of the writing hobbyist. Since the salsa fan is to the right of the hip-hop fan, this means the hip-hop fan must be in position 1 or 2, and the writing hobbyist must be in position 2.

Now, from clue 1, we know the person who likes soccer is to the left of the writing hobbyist. This means the soccer fan cannot be in position 3 (because then there would be no one to the right of them), so they must be in position 1 or 2. But if they were in position 1, the Brazilian would have to be to their left, which is impossible since there's no one to the left of position 1! Therefore, the soccer fan must be in position 2, and the writing hobbyist must be in position 3.

From clue 3, we know the woodworking hobbyist is between the Dutch person and the water-polo enthusiast. Since the Dutch person cannot be in position 1 (because then there would be no one to their left), they must be in position 2 or 3. But if they were in position 2, the soccer fan would have to be between them and the writing hobbyist, which is impossible! Therefore, the Dutch person must be in position 1 or 3.

Putting it all together, we get:

* Position 1: Italian (because Brazilian is to their right), hip-hop fan
* Position 2: Dutch (to satisfy clue 3), soccer fan, rock music fan
* Position 3: Brazilian (to satisfy clue 6), writing hobbyist, salsa fan

However, this doesn't quite work, because then the woodworking hobbyist would be on either side of the Italian and the water-polo enthusiast, which isn't possible.

Wait a minute... what if we swap positions 1 and 2?

* Position 1: Dutch (to satisfy clue 3), writing hobbyist, hip-hop fan
* Position 2: Italian (because Brazilian is to their right), woodworking hobbyist, rock music fan
* Position 3: Brazilian (to satisfy clue 6), filmmaking hobbyist, salsa fan

And then we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest:

* Water-polo enthusiast must be in position 1, because that's the only place left for them.
* Parkour enthusiast must be in position 2, because they're not in positions 1 or 3.
* Soccer fan must be in position 3, because that's the only place left for them.

| Sport         | cricket    | ice-hockey | volleyball | cycling     |

The steps to solve the puzzle are as follows:

1. From clue 2, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left or far right.
2. From clue 7, we know that the fan of folk is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Combining this with step 1, we can conclude that the fan of folk is on the far left (column 1).
3. From clue 10, we know that the person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the person eating potato.
4. From clue 9, we know that the person eating potato is on the left of the person eating cauliflower.
5. Combining steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that the order of food from left to right is: grapefruit, potato, cauliflower.
6. From clue 1, we know that the fan of indie is the person eating peach. Therefore, peach must be in column 4 (the only remaining spot).
7. From clue 5, we know that the owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of rock.
8. Combining steps 2 and 7, we can conclude that the order of pets from left to right is: turtle, ?, ?, hedgehog.
9. From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
10. Combining steps 8 and 9, we can conclude that the order of sports from left to right is: cricket, ice-hockey, volleyball, cycling.
11. From clue 3, we know that the person eating potato is on the left or right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
12. Combining steps 5 and 11, we can conclude that the person eating potato must be in column 2 (since potato is already known to be next to grapefruit).
13. From clue 4, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
14. Combining steps 10 and 13, we can conclude that the order of pets from left to right is: turtle, cat, dog, hedgehog.

Let me walk you through the reasoning:


From clue 2, we know the person eating tomato is on the left of the fisherman. So, tomato must be in column 1.


From clue 4, we know the person eating pear is the fan of rock. Since rock is on the right of punk (clue 1), pear must be in column 3.


Now, from clue 2 again, we can conclude that fisherman is in column 2.


Clue 5 tells us that the person watching drama movies is on the right of the analyst. Since there's only one space left for a job, analyst must be in column 1 and drama in column 3 (but we already have western in column 3, so drama must be in column 2). Therefore, the analyst is not in column 3.


From clue 5, we also know that the person watching drama movies is on the right of the analyst. So, drama can't be in column 1. Western must be in column 3 (because it's the only one left), and horror must be in column 1.


Now, from clue 3, we know the fan of classical is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Therefore, classical must be in column 1.


Punk is the only music genre left for column 2.


The lawyer is the only job left for column 2.

From statement 2, we know the fan rock is on the left or right of the fan classical.

From statement 10, we know the fan rock is the manager.

From statement 5, we know the manager is on the left of the chef.
From statement 7, we know the chef is on the right of the manager.

So, the order for these three people is: manager (fan rock), chef, ???

The project-manager can't be in position 1 or 3 (statements 4 and 11). Since the fan classical is in an odd position (statement 11), it must be in position 1. The project-manager is then in position 2 (even).

Lv5-2x3-10	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know the mechanic is either in column 1 or column 3.

From clue 4, we know the freelancer is to the left of the mechanic. Since the freelancer can't be on the far right (otherwise, there would be no one to the left of the mechanic), this means the freelancer must be in column 1 or 2, and the mechanic must be in column 2 or 3.

Now let's consider clue 2: ""the fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the fan of house"". This implies that the fan of salsa can't be on the far left. If they were, there would be no one to their left to satisfy this condition. Therefore, the fan of salsa must be in column 2 or 3.

From clue 3: ""the fan of house is between the fan of salsa and the fan of reggae"". We already know that the fan of salsa is not on the far left, so this implies that the fan of house must also be to the right of someone (since they are ""between"" two people). Therefore, the fan of house can't be in column 1.

Putting all these together:

* The freelancer is in column 1 or 2.
* The mechanic is in column 2 or 3.
* The fan of salsa is in column 2 or 3.
* The fan of house is not on the far left and must be between two people, so they can only be in column 2.

| Job           | Freelancer | Engineer  | Mechanic |
| Music-Genre   | House      | Salsa     | Reggae   |

 Wait, why did I put the engineer there?

The reason is that if we look at the constraints:

* The freelancer is in column 1.
* The mechanic is on the far left or far right (clue 1), so they must be in column 3 (because if they were in column 1, the freelancer would not be to their left as per clue 4).
* The fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the fan of house (clue 2). This means that salsa can't be in column 1.
* The fan of house is between the fan of salsa and the fan of reggae (clue 3).

If we put the freelancer in column 1, it satisfies all these conditions. Now the only remaining job for column 2 is the engineer.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv6-4x3-5	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table.


From clue 1, we know the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the lawyer.


From clue 3, we know the owner of the horse is on either side of the person eating spinach.


From clue 5, we know the person eating apple is on either side of the lawyer.


Now, let's look at clue 2: the person eating spinach is between the videographer and the fan of techno. This means the person eating spinach cannot be in position 1 (because there's no one to their left), so they must be in position 2 or 3.


If the person eating spinach is in position 2, then the owner of the horse would have to be in position 1 (to be on either side of the person eating spinach). But this contradicts clue 5, because there's no one for the person eating apple to be on either side of.


So, the person eating spinach must be in position 3. This means the owner of the horse is in position 2 or 4 (but since there are only three positions, it must be 2).


Now we can use clue 6: the fan of blues is to the right of the videographer. Since the person eating spinach is in position 3, the videographer must be in position 1.


From clue 4, we know the fan of dubstep isn't eating apple. Let's assume they're eating grapes or spinach (we'll come back to this later).


The only job left for position 2 is the lawyer, and from clue 1, we know the owner of the chinchilla is to their left. So, the videographer owns a pet other than the horse (which is in position 2), so they must own the goat.


We also know the person eating apple isn't the fan of dubstep, so it's either grapes or techno for them. But if they're eating techno, then that would mean the spinach-eater has to be on either side of the techno fan (from clue 2), which is impossible since they're in position 3 already.


So, we have:


|               |      1       |    2    |      3       |
| Food          |              |         |              |
| Job           | videographer | lawyer  |              |
| Music-Genre   |              |         |              |
| Pet           | goat         | horse   |              |

Now, let's go back to the person eating grapes or spinach. If they're eating spinach, then from clue 2, the techno fan is in position 1 or 3, but since the videographer is already in position 1, it must be position 3.


This would mean the person eating apple has to eat it in position 2 (the only spot left), which contradicts clue 5.


So, the person eating grapes or spinach can't be eating spinach. This means they're eating grapes.


Also, since there's no one for the blues fan to be on either side of, we know that techno and dubstep must be in positions 1 and 3 respectively (so that the blues fan can be on their right).


We also know from clue 5 that apple has to be next to lawyer, which is position 2.


Lastly, since the chinchilla owner has to be on the left of lawyer and there's no other pet left for them except chinchilla itself, we get:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 2, we know the person watching sports movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing. Combining this with clue 12, we can conclude that the person watching sports movies must be the person who's hobby is traveling.
* Clue 6 tells us the person who's hobby is chess is between the owner of the turtle and the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching animation movies cannot be in position 1 (due to clue 5), we can place the person who's hobby is chess in position 1, with the owner of the turtle in position 2.
* Clue 14 places the owner of the lizard between the owner of the turtle and the British. Therefore, the British must be in position 4, and the owner of the lizard in position 3.
* Clue 9 tells us the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the Nigerian. Since the person watching sports movies (traveling) is already placed, we can place the person who's hobby is singing in position 3, with the Nigerian in position 2 or 4. However, due to clue 7, the Nigerian cannot be in position 4, so they must be in position 2.
* Clue 10 places the Egyptian and the owner of the ferret in the same parity positions (even). Since the person watching disaster movies is already placed in an even position (due to clue 1), we can place the Egyptian in position 4, with the owner of the ferret in position 2 or 4. However, due to clue 11, the Nigerian and the person who's hobby is fishing have the same parity positions, so the owner of the ferret must be in position 3.
* Clue 8 tells us the British is not to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the British is already placed in position 4, we can confirm that the person who's hobby is traveling is indeed in position 2.

The rest of the puzzle falls into place using the remaining clues."

Lv8-3x4-9	"Here is the step-by-step solution:

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the far left.

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already occupied by the helicopter driver, drawing must be on the far right.

From clue 8, we know that the german is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. This means that the german cannot be on the far left (already occupied by the helicopter) and must be in one of the middle positions (2 or 3).

From clue 13, we know that the german is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Combining this with clue 8, we can conclude that the german must be in position 2, and the person who's hobby is drawing (which is also on the far right) must be in a position that allows the german to be to their left.

The current state of the table is:

From clue 14, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Combining this with clue 12, which states that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person driving the subway, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is fishing must be in position 3.

From clue 11, we know that the german is not to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This means that the german must be on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

The current state of the table is:

From clue 7, we know that the pakistani is on the left or right of the german. Combining this with clue 2, which states that the pakistani is somewhere between the person driving the subway and the malaysian, we can conclude that the pakistani must be in position 3 (since the german is already occupied by position 2).

However, this creates a conflict with our previous conclusion that the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 3. To resolve this, let's re-evaluate clue 7 and clue 2.

From clue 6, we know that the german is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Combining this with clue 8, which states that the german is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be on the left of the german.

From clue 10, we know that the person driving the ship is not to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Combining this with clue 9, which states that the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the left of the person driving the car, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is fishing must be on the right of the person driving the ship.

The current state of the table is:

From clue 12, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Combining this with our previous conclusion that the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 3, we can conclude that the person driving the subway must be in either position 2 or 4.

However, since position 2 is already occupied by woodworking (and the german), the person driving the subway must be in position 4.

* Clue 9 tells us that the lizard is between the ship and van. Since lizard can't be in column 3, it must be in either column 2 or 4.
* From clue 10, we know guinea-pig is right of hedgehog. If hedgehog were in column 1, there would be no space for turtle (from clue 5). So, hedgehog must be in column 2, and lizard in column 4.
* Using clues 3 and 8, we can determine that the beverage order is ""almond-milk"" -> ""soy-milk"" (right of lemonade).

|               |   1   |     2      |   3    |   4   |  5   |
| Food          | Pear  |            |        |       |      |
| Music-Genre   |       |            |        |       |      |
| Pet           |       |            |        |       |      |

From clue 6, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person eating pear:


|               |   1   |     2      |   3    |   4   |  5   |
| Food          | Pear  |            |        |       |      |
| Music-Genre   |       |            |        |       |      |
| Pet           |       | Guinea-pig |        |       |      |

From clue 2, we know the owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is already in position 2, the owner of the mouse must be in position 1:


|               |   1   |     2      |   3    |   4   |  5   |
| Food          | Pear  |            |        |       |      |
| Music-Genre   | Disco |            |        |       |      |
| Pet           | Mouse | Guinea-pig |        |       |      |

From clue 10, we know the owner of the mouse is the fan of disco.


Now, from clue 1, we know the person eating apple is on the right of the person eating potato. We can't place them yet, but we'll come back to this later.


From clue 3, we know the person eating potato is the owner of the ferret:


|               |   1   |     2      |   3    |   4   |  5   |
| Food          | Pear  |            |        |       |      |
| Music-Genre   | Disco |            |        |       |      |
| Pet           | Mouse | Guinea-pig | Ferret |       |      |

We can place the person eating potato in position 3, as it's the only remaining spot for the owner of the ferret.


Now, from clue 1, we know the person eating apple is on the right of the person eating potato. So, the person eating apple must be in position 4:


|               |   1   |     2      |   3    |   4   |  5   |
| Food          | Pear  |            | Potato | Apple |      |
| Music-Genre   | Disco |            |        |       |      |
| Pet           | Mouse | Guinea-pig | Ferret |       |      |

From clue 7, we know the fan of salsa is the person eating zucchini. This person can only be in position 5:


|               |   1   |     2      |   3    |   4   |  5   |
| Food          | Pear  |            | Potato | Apple | Zucchin|
| Music-Genre   | Disco |            |        |       | Salsa |
| Pet           | Mouse | Guinea-pig | Ferret |       |      |

From clue 9, we know the owner of the frog is on the left of the person eating peas. Since the person eating zucchini (salsa fan) is in position 5, the owner of the frog must be in position 4 or earlier.


However, from clue 4, we know the owner of the frog is on the right of the fan of punk. This means the fan of punk cannot be in position 5 (already occupied by salsa fan), and the owner of the frog cannot be in position 1 or 2 (as there's no space to place the fan of punk).


The only possible arrangement for the fan of punk and the owner of the frog is:


|               |   1   |     2      |   3    |   4   |  5   |
| Food          | Pear  |            | Potato | Apple | Zucchin|
| Music-Genre   | Disco | Punk       |        |       | Salsa |
| Pet           | Mouse | Guinea-pig | Ferret | Frog  |      |

From clue 8, we know the fan of r&b is on the left of the owner of the pony. Since the fan of salsa (zucchini) is in position 5, the fan of r&b must be in an earlier position.


The only remaining music-genre spot is for jazz or r&b. If we place r&b in position 2 (already occupied by punk), we'll have no space to place jazz. So, we can conclude that r&b must be in a different position, and the fan of r&b is already in position 2 with punk.


Therefore, we can swap positions 3 and 4:


|               |   1   |     2      |   3    |   4   |  5   |
| Food          | Pear  | Peas       | Potato | Apple | Zucchin|
| Music-Genre   | Disco | Punk       | R&B     | Jazz  | Salsa |
| Pet           | Mouse | Guinea-pig | Ferret | Frog  | Pony  |

The final solution is:

Einstein_domain_replacements_0	"Here's the solved puzzle:


|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| blue  | green | white| yellow| red   |
| Nationality	| norwegian | british | german| danish | swedish|
| Food		| lemon  | eggplant| onion | lime   | strawberry|
| House	| cottage| townhouse| palace| tower  | modern |
| Cigar		| bluemaster | pall-mall| blend | dunhill| prince |


Here's how the puzzle was solved:


From (9), norwegian is on the far left.
From (14), the person who likes blue must be on either side of the norwegian, so it can't be in 4 or 5. Since the palace house is in the middle (8), and the bluemaster-smoker has a cottage house (12), it's likely that the person who likes blue is on the far left, with the norwegian. So, color for column 1 is blue.


From (7), yellow is associated with dunhill. From (11), eggplant must be on either side of the dunhill-smoker. Since lemon is on one end (10), and strawberry is already given to swedish in (2), lime and onion are left for columns 3 or 4, so it's more likely that the dunhill-smoker is column 4. This also puts yellow as the color for column 4.


From (6), onion must be associated with pall-mall, but since blend-smoker has a lemon-eater on one side and modern house on the other (15), blend can't be in column 5, so it's likely that pall-mall is column 3. From (10), this puts lemon as column 1.


From (4) green must be to the left of white, but since there are no more colors for column 2, and since townhouse house is associated with green (5), we can safely put green in column 2.


From (13), german is prince-smoker. Since norwegian has a blue color on one end, the only option left for german is column 3, putting white as the color for column 3.


From (1) and (2) red is british, strawberry is swedish, so the remaining columns are filled with danish in tower house, giving red to column 5."

Let's fill in the table step by step:

From clue 6, we know the chef is on the far right. From clue 9, we also know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the far right. Since there can only be one person on the far right, this means the chef and the person who's sport is climbing are the same person.

From clue 7, we know the person eating banana is driving the ship. We'll come back to this later.


Now, from clue 3 and 4, we know the person driving the van is in the middle. From clue 5, we also know that the person who's sport is tennis is between the owner of the mouse and the entrepreneur. Since there are only three positions, this means the person driving the van must be the entrepreneur.

From clue 8, we know the person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person driving the van (entrepreneur) is in the middle, this means the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1.

| Transport   |Quad-bike     | Van      |          |

Now, let's look at clue 1: the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since there is no one to the right of the person who's sport is tennis (they're in position 2), this means the owner of the horse must be in position 1.

Lv6-3x3-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|             |   1   |     2     |     3     |
| Beverage    | cola  | water    | fanta    |
| Food        | banana| onion    | pear     |
| Transport   | quad-bike| car      | motorbike |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, the person driving the motorbike is on the far left or far right. Let's assume it's on the far right for now.

From clue 4, the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the person drinking water. Since there are only three columns, the person driving the quad-bike must be in column 1.

Clue 3 states that the person drinking cola is to the left of the person driving the motorbike. If the motorbike is on the far right (column 3), then cola must be in column 1 or 2. But since the quad-bike is already in column 1, cola must be in column 2 doesn't work because then it would be to the left of water, not motorbike). So, let's put cola in column 1.

Now we have:

|             |   1   |     2     |     3     |
| Beverage    | cola  | ?        | ?        |
| Food        | ?      | ?        | ?        |
| Transport   | quad-bike| ?       | motorbike |

From clue 5, the person eating onion is not drinking cola. And from clue 6, the person eating onion is not drinking fanta. So, the person eating onion must be drinking water.

Clue 2 states that the person eating pear is not driving the quad-bike. But we already have someone driving the quad-bike in column 1, so pear can go in either column 2 or 3.

Now we have:

|             |   1   |     2     |     3     |
| Beverage    | cola  | water    | ?        |
| Food        | banana| onion    | pear     |
| Transport   | quad-bike| car      | motorbike |

The only remaining beverage is fanta, which goes in column 3.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clues 8 and 11, we know the egyptian is in an odd position (1 or 3) and on the left of the french. Since the american is between the fan of punk and the owner of the goat (clue 5), and the egyptian is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the ferret (clue 7), I placed the egyptian in position 1.


Clue 4 implies that the person driving the bike is on the left of the owner of the bird. Given the constraint from clue 10, I placed the bike in position 1, which means the bird must be in position 3.


From clues 2 and 12, we know the cat's owner is in an even position (2 or 4), and the person driving the scooter is on the right of the skateboarder. Since the van is on the far right (clue 9), I placed the scooter-skateboard pair in positions 3-4.


With clue 6, we know the owner of the fish is not driving the scooter, so I assigned the fish to position 2.


The remaining animals and modes of transport fell into place based on the other constraints. The music-genres were then filled in according to clues 3, 5, 13-16.

| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Fantasy | Romance |

| Transport     | Roller      | Bus     | Scooter  |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

1. From clue 2, we know the Egyptian watches documentary movies.
2. From clue 3, we know the Egyptian is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies.
3. From clue 5, we know the person driving the roller is in position 1 (since there's no other information about the roller).
4. Combining clues 2 and 3, the Egyptian must be in position 1, watching documentary movies, with the person watching fantasy movies on their right.
5. Clue 6 tells us the Chinese is between the Egyptian and the person driving the scooter. Since the Egyptian is in position 1, the Chinese must be in position 3, with the person driving the scooter also in position 3 (but we'll get to that later).
6. From clue 4, we know the Egyptian (in an odd-numbered position) has the same parity as the person driving the scooter (which means the person driving the scooter is also in an odd-numbered position). This confirms our previous conclusion that the Chinese and the scooter are in position 3.
7. Clue 7 tells us the person watching romance movies and the person driving the roller have different parity positions. Since the roller is in position 1 (an odd number), the romance movie watcher must be in an even-numbered position, which means they're in position 2.
8. Finally, from clue 1, we know the Mexican isn't to the left of the fantasy movie watcher, so the Mexican must be watching fantasy movies.

And that's how we arrive at the final solution!

Here's how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 9, we know that the helicopter is on the far left. From clue 14, we can deduce that the person whose birthday is in September must be either to the right or left of the helicopter driver. Since there are only two options for this position (left and right), we can conclude that the person whose birthday is in September is also on the far left.


From clue 1, we know that the quad-bike driver's birthday is in May. This means that the person whose birthday is in July must be to the right of the person whose birthday is in January (clue 5). Therefore, the order for birthdays from left to right is: September, May, July, January, June.


Clue 4 states that the van driver travels to Berlin. Clue 2 tells us that the ship driver owns a dog. Since the person whose birthday is in January travels to Hannover (clue 3), we can conclude that this person must own a pet other than the dog. The only option left for the person whose birthday is in January is to travel by van to Berlin.


The skateboard driver smokes parliaments (clue 13). Since the kools-smoker's birthday is in June, and they are either to the left or right of the horse owner (clue 11), we can conclude that the kools-smoker must be in column 5. The only pet left for this person is the zebra.


The old-gold smoker owns snails (clue 6). Since the chesterfields-smoker is either to the left or right of the fox owner (clue 10), we can conclude that the chesterfields-smoker must be in column 1. The only option left for this person is to own a horse.


The lucky-strike smoker travels to Colone (clue 12). Since this is the only remaining city, and the van driver already has a pet assigned, we can assign the fox to this person.

The remaining options fall into place:

From clue 2, we know that blueberry is to the left of watermelon.

From clue 13, we know that the british is in an odd position.


From clue 14, we can deduce that dancing (skateboarding) is to the left of rugby.


From clue 15, we know that the nigerian is somewhere to the left of the british.


From clue 16, we know that watermelon is watching comedy movies.


From clue 17, we can deduce that dancing is on the left or right of watermelon.


From clue 18 and 19, we can deduce that skydiving (disaster) is to the left of mystery.

| Hobby   |           |            |
| Job     |           | Analyst    |
| Sport   |           |            |

Now, let's consider clue 1: ""the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball"". This means that:

* The person who sings must be in column 1.
* The person whose sport is basketball must be in column 2.

So, we can fill in the hobby for column 1 and the sport for column 2:

|         |     1     |     2      |
| Hobby   | Singing  |            |
| Job     |           | Analyst    |
| Sport   |           | Basketball |

Now, let's think about the remaining options. The person who sings cannot have basketball as their sport (since singing is on the left of basketball), so they must prefer skiing. Similarly, the analyst in column 2 cannot have hiking as their hobby (since that would leave no room for the other hobby), so the bartender must be in column 1 and have hiking as their hobby.

From clue 2, we know the Colombian is in an odd position. Since there are only three positions, this means the Colombian must be either in position 1 or 3. But since the Indian is already in position 3, the Colombian must be in position 1:

| Movie-Genre   | Romance   | Satire | Superhero |
| Nationality   | Colombian |        | Indian    |

From clue 4 again, we know the person drinking milk is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching superhero movies. This means the person drinking milk must be in position 2 or 3. But since Fanta is already in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 3:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Fanta  | Milk      |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance   | Satire | Superhero |
| Nationality   | Colombian |        | Indian    |

The only nationality left is German, which must be in position 2:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Fanta  | Milk      |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance   | Satire | Superhero |
| Nationality   | Colombian | German | Indian    |

The final solution is:
