We will label the columns 1 to 5, where each column represents one of the people. We'll fill in the table based on the clues.

7. The person who likes yellow is the Dunhill smoker.

The Norwegian is next to the person who likes blue.
15. The Blend smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water.

The Blend smoker is next to the person who drinks water.
Now we will fill in the table based on the deductions:

The Norwegian is in position 1, and since the Norwegian is next to the person who likes blue (Clue 14), the person in position 2 likes blue.
The person in position 3 drinks milk (Clue 8), so the person in position 3 must be the one who likes green, drinks coffee, and is to the left of the white lover (Clue 4 and 5).
The person who likes red is British (Clue 1), and the only person left who could fit is in position 4.
The person in position 5 likes white.
The Swedish person owns the dog, so they must be in position 2 or 5, and position 5 is the only viable place.
The Danish person drinks tea (Clue 3), so they must be in position 2.
Based on these deductions, the final table is:

Step-by-Step Deduction:
Position 3 drinks milk (Clue 8).

The person who likes green drinks coffee (Clue 5), so the person in position 3 does not like green.
The person who likes green must be in position 2, and the person in position 1 must be Norwegian (Clue 9), so position 1 must not like green.
The green lover drinks coffee, so position 2 drinks coffee.

The person in position 3 drinks milk and cannot like green or coffee. The person in position 3 must therefore like white.
Position 1 (Norwegian) must like yellow (since only yellow is left), and the Norwegian smokes Dunhill (Clue 7). The Dunhill smoker must be in position 1.

The person who likes red is British (Clue 1). So, the person in position 4 must be British and like red.

The person who owns the dog is Swedish (Clue 2), and the Swedish person must be in position 5, so position 5 must own the dog.

The Pall-Mall smoker owns the bird (Clue 6). Given that position 4 must be British and has a red color, the bird owner must be in position 2.

The German smokes Prince cigars (Clue 13). Position 5 must be German, so position 5 smokes Prince.

The Bluemaster smoker drinks beer (Clue 12), so position 4 drinks beer.

The person who owns horses is next to the Dunhill smoker (Clue 11), so the horse owner must be in position 2.

The person who smokes Blend is next to the person who owns the cat (Clue 10), so position 3 must own the cat and must smoke Blend.

The Blend smoker is next to the person drinking water (Clue 15), so position 5 drinks water.

Final Table:
Based on the clues and deductions, we can now fill out the table:

Step-by-Step Solution
Position 1 is Norwegian (Clue 9). The Norwegian must be next to the person who likes blue (Clue 14). Therefore, position 2 must like blue.

Position 3 drinks milk (Clue 8), and this person is neither the one who likes green nor blue. This means position 3 must like white (as it is the only option left). So, position 3 drinks milk and likes white.

The person who likes green drinks coffee (Clue 5), so position 2 likes green and drinks coffee.

The person who likes red is British (Clue 1), and since position 3 already likes white, the British must be in position 4 and likes red.

The person who owns the dog is Swedish (Clue 2), so the person in position 5 must be Swedish and owns the dog.

The person who likes yellow smokes Dunhill (Clue 7), and the only position left for the person who likes yellow is position 1, so the Norwegian in position 1 likes yellow and smokes Dunhill.

The Pall-Mall smoker owns the bird (Clue 6), so position 2 smokes Pall-Mall and owns the bird.

The Bluemaster smoker drinks beer (Clue 12), so position 4 smokes Bluemaster and drinks beer.

The German smokes Prince cigars (Clue 13), so position 5 smokes Prince.

The Blend smoker is on the left or right of the person who owns the cat (Clue 10), so position 3 owns the cat and smokes Blend.

The person who owns horses is next to the Dunhill smoker (Clue 11), so position 2 owns horses.

The Blend smoker is next to the person drinking water (Clue 15), so position 5 drinks water.
