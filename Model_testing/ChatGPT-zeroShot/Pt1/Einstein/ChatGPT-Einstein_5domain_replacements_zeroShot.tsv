The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house.
The librarian is next to the futuristic house.

Step 2: Fill out the table with deductions
Letâ€™s summarize our deductions:

Folk must be the person on the far left (position 1). This person is next to the person with the motorbike. Therefore, the person in position 2 must be driving the motorbike.

Trance is the person driving the train, so this person must be in a different position from the motorbike person.

The architect has a birthday in May, which means they are not in position 1 (because that person likes folk), and thus must be in position 3 (the middle).

The gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 3), so the architect must have the gothic-revival house.

The mechanic drives the quad-bike, and this person is next to the person whose birthday is in July.

The person driving the subway is next to the person with the snowmobile. We know the subway driver lives in a wooden house.

The palace house belongs to the person who likes rock, so this person must be in position 5, and this person must like rock.

The futuristic house must be in position 4 because the librarian is next to it, and the only open positions for the librarian are 1 or 5. The futuristic house is thus in position 4, and the librarian must be in position 1.

The person whose birthday is in September likes reggae, and they cannot be in position 1 because that person likes folk, so they must be in position 5.

After making all these deductions, we fill the table:
