Chat-GPT_Einstein_3domain_1	"To solve the puzzle, I will systematically apply the constraints to fill out the table.

Key Observations:
Each column represents one person.
Each row corresponds to one attribute: Color, City, Job, Birthday, and Cigar.
The logical deductions need to ensure all constraints are satisfied.
Solving Step by Step:

Setting Initial Constraints
Constraint 9: The person traveling to Prague is on the far left (column 1).

Column 1: City = Prague.
Constraint 8: The person whose birthday is in July is in the middle (column 3).

Column 3: Birthday = July.
Constraint 14: The person traveling to Prague is on the left or right of the person who likes blue.

Column 2 or 3: Color = Blue.
Constraint 10: The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the nurseerman.

These two must be adjacent.
Constraint 15: The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in May.

These two must also be adjacent.
Filling Colors

Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5).
Constraint 5: The person who likes green is the one whose birthday is in March.

Green: Birthday = March.
Green must be in column 2 (only open slot to the left of July).
Green (March) is in column 2. White must be in column 3.

Constraint 1: The person traveling to New York is the one who likes red.

New York: Color = Red.
Red cannot be in columns 2 or 3. Place it in column 4.
Remaining colors are Yellow and Blue. From Constraint 14, Blue must be in column 3. Thus:

Column 1: Yellow.
Filling Cigars
Constraint 7: The person who likes yellow is the Dunhill-smoker.

Column 1: Cigar = Dunhill.
Constraint 12: The Bluemaster-smoker is the person whose birthday is in November.

Column 5: Birthday = November, Cigar = Bluemaster.
