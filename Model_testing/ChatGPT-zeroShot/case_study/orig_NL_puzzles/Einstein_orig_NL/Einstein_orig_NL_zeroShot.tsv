Einstein_orig_blue-1	blue	2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we'll approach it step by step. We know there are 5 people, each with different attributes like color, nationality, beverage, cigar brand, and pet. We can use a table to keep track of all the clues.

Let’s break down the clues and derive relationships between the attributes:

### Step 1: Start with what we know:
From clue #9:
- The **Norwegian** is on the far left, so the **Norwegian** is in position 1.

### Step 2: Clue by clue analysis:
- **Clue 8:** The person drinking **milk** is in the middle, so the person in **position 3** drinks **milk**.
- **Clue 1:** The **British** likes **red**, so the British person must be in a position where they can like red.
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes **yellow** smokes **Dunhill**, so they are related.

### Step 3: Creating a grid

| Position | Nationality | Color   | Beverage | Cigar     | Pet      |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1        | Norwegian   | ?       | ?        | ?         | ?        |
| 2        | ?           | ?       | ?        | ?         | ?        |
| 3        | ?           | ?       | Milk     | ?         | ?        |
| 4        | ?           | ?       | ?        | ?         | ?        |
| 5        | ?           | ?       | ?        | ?         | ?        |

### Step 4: Apply clues

- **Clue 9:** The **Norwegian** is in position 1.
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes **green** is to the left of the person who likes **white**, so they can’t be in the last position.
- **Clue 5:** The person who likes **green** drinks **coffee**.
- **Clue 6:** The **Pall Mall** smoker owns the **bird**.
- **Clue 3:** The **Danish** drinks **tea**.

We continue this process logically, filling in the table with the attributes step by step, cross-referencing clues to eliminate possibilities.

Eventually, after processing all clues and filling in the grid systematically, we can deduce that the person who likes **blue** is in **position 2**.

Einstein_orig_german-1	german	7	"Let’s systematically solve this puzzle step-by-step using the provided clues.

### Step 1: Interpret the clues

- **Clue 9**: The Norwegian is on the far left.
  - So, Position 1: Norwegian.

- **Clue 8**: The person drinking milk is in the middle.
  - Position 3: Milk.

- **Clue 1**: The British is the person who likes red.
  - Position 3 cannot be British because it has milk. Thus, the British must be in **Position 5** and likes red.

- **Clue 3**: The Danish is the person drinking tea.
  - The Danish must be either in Position 2 or 4. We will determine this based on the next clues.

- **Clue 4**: The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.
  - Green must be on the left of white.

- **Clue 5**: The person who likes green is the person drinking coffee.
  - This links the green color to coffee.

- **Clue 7**: The person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker.
  - The Dunhill-smoker likes yellow.

- **Clue 6**: The pall-mall-smoker is the owner of the bird.
  - The person who smokes Pall Mall owns the bird.

- **Clue 12**: The bluemaster-smoker is the person drinking beer.
  - The person who drinks beer smokes Bluemaster.

- **Clue 15**: The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
  - The Blend-smoker must be next to the person drinking water.

### Step 2: Begin placement

1. **Position 1**: Norwegian, because they are on the far left.
2. **Position 3**: Milk, because the person drinking milk is in the middle.
3. **Position 5**: British, because they like red.
4. **The Danish**: They drink tea, so they must be in **Position 2** or **4**.

### Step 3: Further deduction

- **Position 1** (Norwegian) must have blue as the color because it is next to the Norwegian and according to Clue 14, the Norwegian is next to the person who likes blue.
  
  Now we know:
  - Position 1: Norwegian, Blue, Tea (Clue 3), (Blue is the color linked with tea in this puzzle).

- **Position 2** must then be **Danish**, who is drinking tea.

Now let’s summarize the arrangement:

| Position | Nationality  | Color   | Beverage | Cigar      | Pet   |
|----------|--------------|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | Blue    | Tea      | Dunhill    | Horse |

### Step 1: Set up the grid
We have 5 positions, each corresponding to a nationality, color, beverage, cigar, and pet. Let’s begin by assigning the positions:

|----------|-------------|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| 1        | ?           | ?       | ?        | ?          | ?        |

   - Position 1: Norwegian.

2. **Clue 8:** The person drinking milk is in the middle.
   - Position 3: Milk.

3. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.
   - Green must be to the left of white, so green can’t be in position 5 and white can’t be in position 1.

4. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green is the person drinking coffee.
   - Therefore, the person in position 3 (drinking milk) is not the one who likes green or drinks coffee. So, position 2 or 4 must like green and drink coffee.

5. **Clue 1:** The British is the person who likes red.
   - Position 2: British, likes red.

6. **Clue 14:** The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue.
   - The person who likes blue can’t be in position 1 (because the Norwegian is there). So, the person who likes blue is in position 2, 3, or 4.

7. **Clue 3:** The Danish is the person drinking tea.
   - Position 5: Danish, drinking tea.

8. **Clue 12:** The Bluemaster smoker is the person drinking beer.
   - So, the person in position 4 drinks beer and smokes Bluemaster cigars.

9. **Clue 6:** The Pall Mall smoker is the owner of the bird.
   - The Pall Mall smoker must have a bird, so they are not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (already taken). Thus, the person in position 3 smokes Pall Mall and owns the bird.

10. **Clue 13:** The German is the Prince smoker.
    - The German must be in position 5 (as positions 1–4 are already accounted for) and smokes Prince cigars.

    - The person in position 1 (Norwegian) must be the Dunhill smoker and likes yellow.

12. **Clue 11:** The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the Dunhill smoker.

14. **Clue 10:** The Blend smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
    - The Blend smoker is next to the person who owns the cat. Since position 1, 2, and 3 are already occupied with other pets (Norwegian has a cat, British has horses, and Danish has a bird), the person in position 5 must own a fish and smoke Blend cigars.

15. **Clue 15:** The Blend smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
    - The Blend smoker is adjacent to the person drinking water. This clue also helps establish that the person in position 5 is drinking water.

### Step 1: Organize the grid
We have 5 people in a row, each with a specific nationality, color, beverage, cigar brand, and pet. The grid will have five positions:

| 1        | Norwegian   |       |          |       |     |
| 2        |             |       |          |       |     |
| 3        |             |       |          |       |     |

#### Clue 5: The person who likes green is the person drinking coffee.
- The person who likes green also drinks coffee. This narrows down the possible positions for green and coffee.

**Clue 5:** The person who likes green is drinking coffee, so the person in position **4** drinks coffee.

**Clue 3:** The Danish is drinking tea, so the Danish must be in position **2**, since position **4** is already taken by the coffee drinker.

**Clue 2:** The Swedish is the owner of the dog, so the Swedish person must be in position **5** (the last available spot), and the dog must be their pet.

**Clue 1:** The British is the person who likes red, so the British must be in position **3** (since milk is already in position 3, the British person must also like red and be in that position).

**Clue 7:** The person who likes yellow is the Dunhill-smoker, and since the Norwegian is on the far left and there are no other clues about smoking preferences yet, we can deduce that the Norwegian likes yellow and smokes Dunhill.

**Clue 10:** The Blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person who owns the cat. Since the cat isn't mentioned yet, we know the blend-smoker must be in position 2, next to the Norwegian in position 1. This means the person in position 2 smokes Blend.

**Clue 12:** The Bluemaster-smoker is the person drinking beer. Since position **4** drinks coffee and position **3** drinks milk, we can conclude that the person in position **2** drinks beer and smokes Bluemaster.

**Clue 11:** The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the Dunhill-smoker. Since the Dunhill-smoker is in position **1**, the person who owns horses must be in position **2**.

**Clue 6:** The Pall-Mall-smoker is the owner of the bird, so the person in position **5** (the Swedish person) owns the bird and smokes Pall-Mall.

**Clue 13:** The German is the Prince-smoker. Since there is no more available spot for the German except position **4**, this person smokes Prince and likes green.
