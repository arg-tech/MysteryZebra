### Final Answer:
**blue:4**"	blue:2
Einstein_orig_english-2	english	8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

We will create a grid with 5 columns, each representing one position. Each position will have:
- Nationality
- Color
- Cigar brand
- Beverage
- Pet

The columns are labeled **1** to **5**, with **Position 1** being the far left and **Position 5** being the far right.

### Step 2: Apply Clue #9
- **The Norwegian is on the far left.**
  - **Position 1**: Norwegian

### Step 3: Apply Clue #8
- **The person drinking milk is in the middle.**
  - **Position 3**: Milk

### Step 4: Apply Clue #5
- **The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.**
  - This means **ivory** must be to the left of **green**, so **ivory** cannot be in **Position 5**.
  - We will fill this in after more deductions.

### Step 5: Apply Clue #3
- **The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green.**
  - So the person who likes green must also be drinking coffee. We will assign this information once we know which positions are available.

### Step 6: Apply Clue #7
- **The Kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow.**
  - This person must like **yellow** and smoke **Kools**. We will assign this person to a position once we know where yellow fits.

### Step 7: Apply Clue #8 (the milk clue) again
- The person in **Position 3** drinks **milk**. We'll finalize other associations in a moment.

### Step 8: Apply Clue #10
- **The Chesterfield-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.**
  - We don’t know the exact position yet, but we can use this clue later.

### Step 9: Apply Clue #12
- **The Lucky-Strike-smoker is the person drinking orange-juice.**
  - We don’t know who this is yet, but once we have a few positions filled, we can place them.

### Step 10: Apply Clue #1
- **The English is the person who likes red.**
  - We know the English person likes red. So, **English** must be in one of the positions that like red.

### Step 11: Apply Clue #4
- **The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea.**
  - The Ukrainian must be in the position where **tea** is being drunk.

### Step 12: Apply Clue #6
- **The Old Gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.**
  - This person smokes **Old Gold** and owns **snails**.

### Step 13: Apply Clue #13
- **The Japanese is the Parliament-smoker.**
  - The Japanese person smokes **Parliament**.

### Step 14: Apply Clue #14
- **The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.**
  - This gives us a relationship between the Norwegian and the person who likes **blue**.

Now, let's fill out the positions systematically:

### Final Answer:

After going through all the clues and filling in the grid, the **English** person is in **Position 3**.

**english:3**"	english:3
Einstein_orig_spanish-2	spanish	8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step. We'll use the following structure for the 5 positions:

| Position | Nationality | Color | Beverage | Cigar | Pet |
|----------|-------------|-------|----------|-------|-----|
| 1        | Norwegian   |       |          |       |     |
| 2        |             |       |          |       |     |
| 3        |             |       | Milk     |       |     |
| 4        |             |       |          |       |     |
| 5        |             |       |          |       |     |

### Step-by-step deductions based on clues:

1. **The English is the person who likes red**.
   - The English person likes **red**. So, the English person is not in Position 1 (Norwegian), but somewhere else.

2. **The Spanish is the owner of the dog**.
   - The Spanish person owns the **dog**. The person who owns the dog isn't the Norwegian or English, so they must be in Position 5 (since the dog has to be placed later in the sequence).

3. **The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green**.
   - The person who drinks **coffee** also likes **green**. So this person isn’t in Position 1 (since milk is being drunk in the middle position).

4. **The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea**.
   - The person drinking **tea** is the **Ukrainian**. 

5. **The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory**.
   - The person who likes **green** must be in a position to the right of the person who likes **ivory**.

6. **The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails**.
   - The person smoking **Old Gold** owns **snails**.

7. **The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow**.
   - The person who smokes **Kools** likes **yellow**.

8. **The person drinking milk is in the middle**.
   - **Position 3** is the person who drinks **milk**.

9. **The Norwegian is on the far left**.
   - The **Norwegian** is in **Position 1**.

10. **The chesterfield-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox**.
    - **Chesterfield** is smoked by a person next to the person who owns the **fox**.

11. **The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse**.
    - **Kools** is smoked by someone next to the person who owns the **horse**.

12. **The lucky-strike-smoker is the person drinking orange-juice**.
    - The person drinking **orange-juice** smokes **Lucky Strike**.

13. **The Japanese is the parliament-smoker**.
    - The **Japanese** smokes **Parliament**.

14. **The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue**.
    - The **Norwegian** is next to the person who likes **blue**.

### Now let's apply the information:

- **Position 1**: The **Norwegian** is on the far left. From clue 14, the Norwegian is next to the person who likes **blue**. So **Position 2** must be the person who likes **blue**.

- **Position 3**: The person in the middle drinks **milk** (from clue 8). Based on the other clues, this person is likely the one who smokes **Old Gold** and owns **snails**.

- **Position 4**: The **English** person likes **red** (from clue 1). They are in **Position 4**, as the other positions are occupied.

- **Position 5**: The **Spanish** person owns the **dog** (from clue 2). Thus, **Position 5** is occupied by the **Spanish**.

### Conclusion:

The **Spanish** person is in **Position 5**.

### Final Answer

After filling in the grid, we conclude that the **Norwegian** is in **Position 1**.

**norwegian:1**"	norwegian:1
Einstein_orig_japanese-2	japanese	8	"Let's work through the logic puzzle step by step to figure out the positions of all the elements and find where the **Japanese** person is.

### Step 1: Organize the table
We need to fill the table with the following categories for 5 positions:
- Nationality
- Color

- **Position 2** must be the person who likes blue because Clue 14 says the Norwegian is next to the person who likes blue.
- **Position 4** is the person who likes green (since Clue 5 says the green person is to the right of the ivory person, and Clue 3 says the coffee drinker likes green). 
- **Position 5** must be the English person, as they are the only one left who could like red (Clue 1).

### Step 4: Assign the remaining information
- **Clue 3** tells us the person drinking coffee likes green, so the person in position 4 must be drinking coffee.
- **Clue 4** says the Ukrainian drinks tea, so the Ukrainian must be in **Position 2** (because Position 1 is the Norwegian, and Position 3 is already taken by milk).

- **Clue 12** tells us the Lucky-Strike smoker drinks orange juice, so the Lucky-Strike smoker must be in **Position 5**, and they drink orange juice.
- **Clue 13** tells us the Japanese smokes Parliament, so the Japanese person must be in **Position 5**.

### Final Table:

| 1        | Norwegian   | Blue   | Water         | Chesterfield| Fox    |

### Step 1: Set up the grid
We have 5 positions, each corresponding to a person. We will assign the following characteristics:
- Nationality
- Favorite color
- Favorite beverage
- Cigar smoked

We label the positions **1** to **5**, with **Position 1** being the far left and **Position 5** being the far right.

Einstein_orig_chesterfield-3	chesterfield	9	"Let's break down the clues step by step and solve the puzzle. We'll make a grid for the 5 positions, and use the clues to eliminate and assign each piece of information.

### Step 1: Organize the Grid
We have the following categories:
- **Colors**: Red, Green, Ivory, Yellow, Blue

   - Green is to the right of Ivory.

6. **The Old Gold smoker is the owner of the snails.**
   - Old Gold → Snails

7. **The Kools smoker is the person who likes yellow.**
   - Kools → Yellow

8. **The person drinking milk is in the middle.**

### Step 3: Set Up the Grid

We have these constraints:
- Position 1 is **Norwegian**.

- The **Spanish** person owns the **dog** (Clue 2), and the **Kools** smoker likes **yellow** (Clue 7). This gives us specific placements for cigars, colors, and pets.
- From here, we can deduce the rest of the positions and fill out the details.

1. **Position 1 (Norwegian)**:
