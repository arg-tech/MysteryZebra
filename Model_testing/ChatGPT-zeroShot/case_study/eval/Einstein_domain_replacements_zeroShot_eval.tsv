### Solving the puzzle:

We can use the clues to gradually assign each characteristic to the correct position. Let’s start by considering the fixed positions and relationships between the clues.

- **House 3 (middle)** is gothic-revival (Clue 8).
- **House 1** is the far-left position, and the fan of folk must live here (Clue 9).
- The fan of trance drives the train (Clue 1), and since the fan of trance is not in House 1 (folk fan), they must be in House 2 or House 3.

### **Step 2: Transport Assignments**
Now let's assign the modes of transport based on the clues.

1. **Clue 7**: The person driving the **quad-bike** is the **mechanic**. This means **Position 2** or **Position 5** must be the **mechanic**. Since **Position 2** already has the **subway** driver, the **mechanic** must be in **Position 5** and drive the **quad-bike**.
2. **Clue 4**: The person driving the **subway** is on the left of the person driving the **snowmobile**. This means **Position 2** must be the **subway** driver, and **Position 3** must be the **snowmobile** driver.
3. **Clue 1**: The **fan of trance** is the person driving the **train**. So **Position 3** must be the **train** driver, and the **fan of trance** is also in **Position 3**.
4. **Clue 9**: The **fan of folk** is on the far left. This means **Position 1** must be the **fan of folk** and the person driving the **motorbike** is in **Position 1**.

### **Step 3: Music Preferences and Birthdays**
Now let's fill in the music preferences and birthdays.

1. **Clue 2**: The person with a **birthday in September** is the **fan of reggae**. This means the person with a birthday in **September** is in **Position 4** and is the **fan of reggae**.
2. **Clue 6**: The **architect** has a birthday in **May**. So, the **architect** must be in **Position 2**, and their birthday is in **May**.

1. **House 1**:
   - Clue 9 tells us the fan of **folk** is in **House 1**.
   - The person who likes **folk** is next to the person driving the **motorbike** (Clue 14). So, the **motorbike** driver is in **House 2**.

2. **House 2**:
   - Since the **motorbike** driver is in **House 2**, we can start by assigning **House 2** to the **motorbikemaster**.
   - **House 2** must be next to **House 1**, and the person in **House 1** likes **folk**.

3. **House 3**:
   - **House 3** is the **gothic-revival** house (Clue 8).
   - **House 3** must be occupied by the person whose birthday is in **July** (Clue 11) and must also match one of the remaining jobs or music genres.

4. **House 4**:

   - The person in **House 4** likes **rock**.

5. **House 5**:
   - The **futuristic** house must be in **House 5** (based on the librarian being next to it, Clue 15).
   - The person in **House 5** must be the **librarian** (Clue 10).

### Step-by-step deduction:

Let's build a grid with 5 positions (1 to 5), where we will fill in information for each person based on the clues.

| Position | Transport  | Music  | House        | Job            | Birthday  |
|----------|------------|--------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1        |            |        |              |                |           |
| 2        |            |        |              |                |           |
| 3        |            |        |              |                |           |
| 4        |            |        |              |                |           |
| 5        |            |        |              |                |           |

#### From Clue 9, the **fan of folk** is in position 1 (the far left). So, position 1 must be the fan of **folk**.

#### From Clue 14, the fan of **folk** is next to the person driving the **motorbike**, so position 2 must be the person driving the **motorbike**.

#### From Clue 12, the **motorbikemaster** lives in the **ranch-style** house, so the **motorbikemaster** is in position 2 and lives in the **ranch-style** house.

#### From Clue 13, the fan of **ambient** is the **bartender**. The **bartender** cannot be in position 1 (because they're the fan of **folk**), and they can't be in position 2 (the motorbikemaster), so the **bartender** must be in position 4.

#### From Clue 5, the person driving the **subway** lives in the **wooden** house. The **subway** driver must be in position 3, because position 3 is the only open space for a house to be identified, and the **wooden** house must be there.

#### From Clue 4, the person driving the **subway** is to the left of the person driving the **snowmobile**, so the person driving the **snowmobile** must be in position 5.

#### From Clue 8, the **gothic-revival** house is in the middle (position 3), so the person in position 3 lives in the **gothic-revival** house.

#### From Clue 7, the person driving the **quad-bike** is the **mechanic**, so the **mechanic** must be in position 3, driving the **quad-bike**.

#### From Clue 6, the **architect** has a birthday in **May**, and the **architect** must be the person in position 3 (because they are the **mechanic** and driving the **quad-bike**).

#### From Clue 2, the **fan of reggae** has a birthday in **September**, so the person in position 5 must be the **fan of reggae** with a **birthday in September**.

#### From Clue 3, the **fan of rock** lives in the **palace**. The only remaining position for the **palace** is position 4, so the person in position 4 must be the **fan of rock**.

#### From Clue 15, the **librarian** is on the left or right of the **futuristic** house. The **futuristic** house must be in position 5 (since all other positions are filled), so the **librarian** must be in position 2.

### Final Grid:

| Position | Transport    | Music    | House            | Job             | Birthday   |

### **Clue 8**: The **gothic-revival house** is in the middle.  
So, **Position 3** is the **gothic-revival house**.

### **Clue 12**: The **motorbikemaster** lives in the **ranch-style house**.  
So, **Position 1** is the **ranch-style house**, and the **motorbikemaster** is in **Position 1**.

### **Clue 5**: The person driving the **subway** is the **wooden house**.  
So, **Position 2** is the **wooden house**, and the person driving the **subway** is in **Position 2**.

### **Clue 3**: The **fan of rock** is the person in the **palace house**.  
So, **Position 4** is the **palace house**, and the **fan of rock** is in **Position 4**.

### **Clue 15**: The **librarian** is on the left or right of the **futuristic house**.  
The **futuristic house** must be in **Position 5** or **Position 2**. Since **Position 2** is already assigned to the **subway** driver (wooden house), **Position 5** is the **futuristic house**, and the **librarian** must be in **Position 4** or **Position 3**.

### **Step 2: Transport Assignments**
1. **Clue 4**: The person driving the **subway** is on the left of the person driving the **snowmobile**.  
So, **Position 2** must be the **subway** driver, and **Position 3** must be the **snowmobile** driver.

2. **Clue 1**: The **fan of trance** is the person driving the **train**.  
So, the person driving the **train** is in **Position 3**, and their music preference is **trance**.

Since **Position 3** is already occupied by the **snowmobile** driver, **Position 5** must be the **mechanic** driving the **quad-bike**.

4. **Clue 9**: The **fan of folk** is on the far left.  
This means **Position 1** is the **fan of folk**.

### **Step 3: Assign Jobs and Music**
Now, let's assign the jobs and music preferences based on what we know.

1. **Clue 6**: The **architect** has a birthday in **May**.  
So, the **architect** must be in **Position 2**, and their birthday is in **May**.

2. **Clue 2**: The **fan of reggae** is the person with a birthday in **September**.  
So, the **fan of reggae** is in **Position 4**, and their birthday is in **September**.

3. **Clue 13**: The **fan of ambient** is the **bartender**.  
The **bartender** must be in **Position 5** (since **Position 5** is the **mechanic** and driving the **quad-bike**).

4. **Clue 10**: The **librarian** is on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in **June**.  
This means the **librarian** is in **Position 4** or **Position 3**. Since **Position 4** already has the **fan of reggae** and the **birthday in September**, the **librarian** must be in **Position 3**.

### **Step 4: Final Summary of Positions**
