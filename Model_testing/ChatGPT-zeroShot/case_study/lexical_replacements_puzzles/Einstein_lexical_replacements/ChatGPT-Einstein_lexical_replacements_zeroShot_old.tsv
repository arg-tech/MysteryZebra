#### Position 1 (The Dutch):
- **The Dutch is on the far left** (Clue 9), so the Dutch person is in position 1.
- The Dutch person must be **adjacent to the person who likes chestnut** (Clue 14), so position 2 likes chestnut.
- The Dutch person is also **drinking hot-chocolate**, based on the other clues. This person smokes **Davidoff** cigars (Clue 12).
- Therefore, position 1 drinks hot-chocolate and smokes Davidoff cigars.

#### Position 3 (The middle):
- **The person drinking mirinda is in the middle** (Clue 8), so position 3 drinks mirinda.
- The person in position 3 must also smoke **Baccarat** cigars, as per Clue 6, because the Baccarat smoker owns the chinchilla.
- **The person who likes grey drinks 7up** (Clue 5), so the person in position 2 likes grey and drinks 7up.
- **The person who likes aquamarine is on the right of the person who likes grey** (Clue 4), so position 3 likes aquamarine and drinks mirinda.
  
#### Other deductions:
- **The person who likes azure smokes game cigars** (Clue 7), so the person in position 4 must like azure and smoke game cigars.
- **The person with turtles is adjacent to the game-smoker** (Clue 11), so the person in position 5 owns the turtles.

15. **The chaman-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
    - The chaman-smoker is adjacent to the person drinking hot-chocolate.

### Step 3: Start solving the grid

- **Position 1 (Dutch)**: The Dutch is on the far left (Clue 9). The Dutch person is in position 1.
- **Position 3 (Mirinda)**: The person in the middle drinks mirinda (Clue 8). So, the person in position 3 drinks mirinda.
- **Position 2 (Grey and 7up)**: The person who likes grey drinks 7up (Clue 5). The person who likes grey is on the left of the person who likes aquamarine (Clue 4). This person must be in position 2.
- **Position 3 (Aquamarine)**: The person who likes aquamarine is in position 3 (from Clue 4). Therefore, the person in position 3 must drink mirinda and like aquamarine.
- **Position 5 (Japanese)**: The Japanese person likes black (Clue 1). So, the Japanese person must be in position 5, and they like black.
- **Position 4 (Spanish)**: The Spanish person owns the guinea-pig (Clue 2). So, the Spanish person must be in position 4, and they own the guinea-pig.

Now, based on this arrangement, we can deduce the pets:

- **Position 1 (Dutch)**: The Dutch person is adjacent to the person who likes chestnut (Clue 14), so the person in position 1 likes chestnut. They do not have a guinea-pig, lizard, or turtle. The only remaining pet is the ferret. Thus, the Dutch person has the **ferret**.
- **Position 2 (Grey and 7up)**: The baccarat-smoker is the owner of the chinchilla (Clue 6), so the person who likes grey smokes baccarat and owns the chinchilla.
- **Position 3 (Aquamarine and Mirinda)**: The person in position 3 must own the **lizard**, since all other pets are assigned.
- **Position 4 (Spanish)**: The Spanish person owns the guinea-pig (Clue 2).
- **Position 5 (Japanese)**: The Japanese person owns the **turtle**, as it is the last remaining pet.

### Final Grid:

| Position | Nationality | Color        | Beverage     | Cigar       | Pet         |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1        | Dutch       | Chestnut     | Fanta        | Davidoff    | Ferret      |

| 3        | Australian  | Aquamarine   | Mirinda      | Game        | Lizard      |
| 4        | Spanish     | Azure        | Almond-milk  | Havana      | Guinea-pig |
| 5        | Japanese    | Black        | Hot-chocolate| Chaman      | Turtle      |

So far, we have:

| Position | Nationality | Color        | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet         |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1        | Dutch       |              |               |             |             |

- **Clue 4** tells us that the person who likes **grey** is to the left of the person who likes **aquamarine**.
- **Clue 5** tells us that the person who likes **grey** drinks **7up**.
- **Clue 8** tells us that the person drinking **mirinda** is in the **middle** (Position 3).

Since the person in **Position 3** drinks **mirinda**, that person must like **azure** and smoke **game** cigars (Clue 7). Thus, the person in **Position 3** must be the **game-smoker**, and they like **azure**.

We now know that the person in **Position 1** must like **grey** and drink **7up**, because the person who likes **grey** is to the left of the person who likes **aquamarine**.

So far:

- **Clue 6** tells us that the **baccarat-smoker** owns the **chinchilla**. The only person left who can smoke **baccarat** is the **French** person, who must therefore be in **Position 4**, and they must own the **chinchilla**.

- **Clue 12** tells us that the **davidoff-smoker** drinks **fanta**. This person must be in **Position 5**. Thus, the **Japanese** person must be in **Position 5**, drinking **fanta** and smoking **davidoff** cigars, and they must own the **turtle**.

So now:

| Position | Nationality | Color        | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet         |

- The Dutch person must be in **Position 1**.

#### **Clue 14:** The Dutch is on the left or right of the person who likes chestnut.

#### **Clue 4:** The person who likes grey is on the left of the person who likes aquamarine.
- The person who likes grey must be placed in **Position 2** (next to Position 3, where the aquamarine person will be placed). So, the person in **Position 2** likes **grey**, and the person in **Position 3** likes **aquamarine**.

#### **Clue 5:** The person who likes grey drinks 7up.
- The person in **Position 2** drinks **7up**.

#### **Clue 8:** The person drinking mirinda is in the middle.
- The person drinking **Mirinda** must be in **Position 3**, which matches with the person who likes aquamarine.

#### **Clue 3:** The Australian drinks almond-milk.
- The person drinking **almond-milk** must be in **Position 4** (since Positions 1, 2, and 3 are already taken by other drinks).

#### **Clue 12:** The Davidoff-smoker is the person drinking fanta.
- The person drinking **Fanta** must be in **Position 5**, and they must also smoke **Davidoff**.

#### **Clue 13:** The French smokes Havana cigars.
- The person who is French must be in **Position 4** and must smoke **Havana** cigars.

#### **Clue 7:** The person who likes azure smokes game cigars.
- The person who likes **azure** must be in **Position 5**, and they must smoke **Game** cigars.

#### **Clue 6:** The Baccarat-smoker is the owner of the chinchilla.

### Step 3: Start solving the grid

- **Position 1 (Dutch)**: The Dutch person is in position 1 (Clue 9). We know that the Dutch person is adjacent to the person who likes chestnut (Clue 14), so the Dutch person must like a color other than chestnut. Let’s assign **chestnut** to Position 2.
- **Position 3 (Mirinda)**: The person in the middle drinks mirinda (Clue 8). Therefore, the person in position 3 drinks **mirinda**.
- **Position 2 (Grey and 7up)**: The person who likes grey drinks 7up (Clue 5). This person must be in position 2, so the person who likes **grey** drinks **7up**.

|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch        |            |              |              |            |

| 4        |              |            |              |              |            |

---

### Analyzing clues:

- **Clue 9**: The **Dutch** is on the far left (Position 1).
- **Clue 14**: The **Dutch** is next to the person who likes **chestnut**, so the person who likes **chestnut** is in Position 2.
- **Clue 8**: The person drinking **mirinda** is in the middle (Position 3).
- **Clue 3**: The **Australian** is the person drinking **almond-milk**, which must be in Position 4 or 5.
- **Clue 7**: The person who likes **azure** is the **game**-smoker.
- **Clue 5**: The person who likes **grey** is the person drinking **7up**, and **grey** is to the left of **aquamarine**. This means **grey** must be in Position 2 and **aquamarine** in Position 3.

---

### Deductions:
- **Position 1 (Dutch)**: The **Dutch** is in Position 1 and must like **chestnut** (from Clue 14). They could drink **7up** or **hot-chocolate**, but given the logic, they must drink **7up** because **grey** drinks **7up** (Clue 5).
- **Position 2**: The person drinking **7up** likes **grey**, so they must be the **Japanese**. They smoke **baccarat** cigars (from Clue 6) and own a **chinchilla**.
- **Position 3 (Australian)**: The **Australian** drinks **almond-milk** and must be next to the person who drinks **mirinda**. They smoke **chaman** cigars and own a **ferret**.
- **Position 4 (Spanish)**: The **Spanish** person drinks **hot-chocolate** and smokes **havana** cigars. They own **turtles** (Clue 11).
- **Position 5 (French)**: The **French** likes **azure**, drinks **fanta**, and smokes **davidoff** cigars.

- **Position 1 (Dutch):**  
   - The Dutch is on the far left (Clue 9).  
   - From Clue 14, the Dutch is next to the person who likes chestnut. So, the Dutch doesn't like chestnut, but is next to someone who does.

- **Position 3 (Mirinda):**  
   - The person drinking mirinda is in the middle (Clue 8), so the person in position 3 drinks mirinda.

- **Person who likes grey and 7up:**  
   - From Clue 4 and Clue 5, the person who likes grey drinks 7up. They must be in position 2 since the person who likes grey is to the left of the person who likes aquamarine.

- **Person who likes aquamarine:**

| 5        |             |            |              |             |             |

### Step 2: Analyze the clues

1. **The Japanese is the person who likes black.**
   - The Japanese person likes **black**.

2. **The Spanish is the owner of the guinea-pig.**
   - The **Spanish** person owns the **guinea-pig**.

3. **The Australian is the person drinking almond-milk.**
   - The **Australian** drinks **almond-milk**.

4. **The person who likes grey is on the left of the person who likes aquamarine.**
   - The person who likes **grey** is to the left of the person who likes **aquamarine**.

5. **The person who likes grey is the person drinking 7up.**
   - The person who likes **grey** drinks **7up**.

6. **The baccarat-smoker is the owner of the chinchilla.**
   - The **baccarat-smoker** owns the **chinchilla**.

7. **The person who likes azure is the game-smoker.**
   - The person who likes **azure** smokes **game** cigars.

8. **The person drinking mirinda is in the middle.**
   - The person in the middle (position 3) drinks **mirinda**.

9. **The Dutch is on the far left.**
   - The **Dutch** person is in position 1.

10. **The chaman-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret.**
    - The **chaman-smoker** is adjacent to the person who owns the **ferret**.

11. **The owner of the turtles is on the left or right of the game-smoker.**
    - The **turtle** owner is adjacent to the **game-smoker**.

    - The **Dutch** person is adjacent to the person who likes **chestnut**.

15. **The chaman-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
    - The **chaman-smoker** is adjacent to the person drinking **hot-chocolate**.

### Step 3: Fill in the grid based on the clues

- **Position 1**: The **Dutch** person is on the far left (Clue 9). The Dutch person is also adjacent to the person who likes **chestnut** (Clue 14). Therefore, the Dutch person must like a color other than chestnut. 
  - The Dutch person must have **chestnut** in Position 2.
  - Since **grey** is left of **aquamarine** (Clue 4), the Dutch person must like **grey** and drink **7up**.

- **Position 3**: The person drinking **mirinda** is in the middle (Clue 8). The person in position 3 drinks **mirinda**. This person must have a color that isn't assigned to anyone else yet, so they must like **azure** and smoke **game** cigars (Clue 7).

- **Position 5**: The Japanese person likes **black** (Clue 1), and they are in position 5.

- **Position 2**: The Spanish person owns the **guinea-pig** (Clue 2), so they must be in position 2.

- **Position 4**: The **French** person smokes **havana** cigars (Clue 13), and they are in position 4. They must drink **fanta** and smoke **davidoff** cigars (Clue 12).

### Step 4: Deduce the pets and cigars

- The **chinchilla** is owned by the **baccarat-smoker** (Clue 6). The person who smokes baccarat cigars is in position 3 and owns the **chinchilla**.

- The **chaman-smoker** is adjacent to the owner of the **ferret** (Clue 10). The **chaman-smoker** must be in position 2 or 4. Since position 2 has the **Spanish** person, they must be the **chaman-smoker**. Therefore, the ferret is owned by the person in position 1.

- The **turtle** owner must be adjacent to the **game-smoker** (Clue 11). The person in position 3 smokes **game** cigars, so the **turtle** is owned by the person in position 5.
