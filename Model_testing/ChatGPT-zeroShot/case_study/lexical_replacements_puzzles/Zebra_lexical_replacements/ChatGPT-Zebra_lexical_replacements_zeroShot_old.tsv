   - The German is next to the person who likes coral (clue 14), so the person who likes coral is in position 2.

2. **Person in position 3**: The person in the middle drinks **lemonade** (clue 8). From clue 5, the person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**, meaning the person in position 3 likely drinks **lemonade** and has the color **aquamarine**.

3. **Position of the colors**: By carefully analyzing the placement of the colors, the final table is as follows:

| Position | Color      | Nationality | Cigar     | Beverage    | Pet      |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1        | **aquamarine** | **German**    | **Baccarat** | **iced-tea** | **lizard** |

- **Colors**: Orange, Black, Aquamarine, Chestnut, Coral
- **Nationalities**: Malaysian, Italian, Dutch, German, Mexican
- **Cigars**: Fonseca, Havana, Pall-mall, Baccarat, Tiparillo
- **Beverages**: Cola, Almond-lemonade, Lemonade, Iced-tea, Hot-chocolate
- **Pets**: Goldfish, Lizard, Cat, Mouse, Bird

### Step 2: Apply the clues

#### Clue 9: The German is on the far left.
- The **German** is in **Position 1**.

#### Clue 8: The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.
- The person in **Position 3** is drinking **lemonade**.

#### Clue 1: The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.
- The **Malaysian** likes **orange**. So, the **Malaysian** is not in **Position 1** (German's position), not in **Position 3** (lemonade drinker), and not in **Position 2** (as it would violate the other clues). The **Malaysian** must be in **Position 4** and likes **orange**.

#### Clue 4: The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.
- The **Dutch** person drinks **almond-lemonade**. Since **Position 3** is already occupied by someone drinking **lemonade**, the **Dutch** person must be in **Position 2** and drinking **almond-lemonade**.

#### Clue 3: The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.
- The person who likes **black** drinks **cola**. This person can’t be the **German** or the **Malaysian**, as we already know their preferences. Therefore, the person in **Position 5** must like **black** and drink **cola**.

#### Clue 5: The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.
- The person who likes **black** must be in **Position 5** and the person who likes **aquamarine** must be to the left, so the person who likes **aquamarine** must be in **Position 4**. Therefore, the person in **Position 4** (the **Malaysian**) must like **aquamarine**.

#### Clue 2: The Italian is the owner of the goldfish.
- The **Italian** owns the **goldfish**. Since **Position 4** is already occupied by the **Malaysian**, the **Italian** must be in **Position 3** and the **goldfish** must be the pet of the person in **Position 3**.

#### Clue 7: The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.
- The **Havana** smoker likes **chestnut**. Therefore, the person in **Position 2** (the **Dutch**) must be smoking **Havana** and like **chestnut**.

#### Clue 6: The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.
- The **Fonseca** smoker owns the **bird**. The only remaining smoker in **Position 5** (the **Mexican**) must smoke **Fonseca** and own the **bird**.

#### Clue 12: The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.
- The **Baccarat** smoker is the person drinking **iced-tea**. The person in **Position 1** (the **German**) must drink **iced-tea** and smoke **Baccarat**.

#### Clue 13: The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**. Since **Position 5** is already the **Mexican**, they must smoke **Tiparillo**.

#### Clue 10: The Coral-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.
- The **Coral** smoker is next to the person who owns the **lizard**. Based on the remaining assignments, the **Coral** smoker must be in **Position 2** and own the **lizard**.

#### Clue 11: The Havana-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse.
- The **Havana** smoker is next to the person who owns the **mouse**. Therefore, the **owner of the mouse** must be in **Position 3**.

#### Clue 14: The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.
- The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**. Since **Position 1** is occupied by the **German**, the person who likes **coral** must be in **Position 2**.

#### Step 1: Position of the German
- **Clue 9** tells us the **German** is on the far left (Position 1).
- **Clue 14** tells us the **German** is to the left or right of the person who likes **coral**. So, the person who likes **coral** must be in Position 2.

#### Step 2: Position of the Middle Person
- **Clue 8** tells us the person drinking **lemonade** is in the middle (Position 3). This person must have a favorite color other than **coral** or **black**.

#### Step 3: Assigning Colors to Positions
- **Clue 1** tells us the **Malaysian** likes **orange**, so the **Malaysian** can only be in Position 4 or 5.
- **Clue 5** tells us the person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. This means the person in Position 2 likes **aquamarine**, and the person in Position 3 must like **black**.

- **Clue 2** tells us the **Italian** owns the **goldfish**. This person must be in Position 3 because of the **lemonade** clue.
- The **Dutch** is the person drinking **almond-lemonade** (Clue 4), so the **Dutch** must be in Position 2.
- The **Mexican** is the **Tiparillo**-smoker (Clue 13), so the **Mexican** must be in Position 5.

#### Step 5: Assigning Pets
- **Clue 6** tells us the **Fonseca**-smoker owns the **bird**, so the **Fonseca**-smoker must be in Position 4.
- **Clue 11** tells us the **Havana**-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the **mouse**, so the **Havana**-smoker cannot be in Position 3 (the middle person already drinks lemonade). Thus, the **Havana**-smoker is in Position 2, and the owner of the **mouse** is in Position 1.
- This leaves the **lizard** and **cat** for the remaining positions. The **lizard** must be owned by the **person in Position 5**, and the **cat** must be owned by the person in Position 4.

#### Step 6: Assigning Cigar Brands
- **Clue 12** tells us the **Baccarat**-smoker drinks **iced-tea**, so the **Baccarat**-smoker must be in Position 1.
- **Clue 7** tells us the **Havana**-smoker likes **chestnut**, so the **Havana**-smoker is the **Dutch** in Position 2.
- **Clue 6** tells us the **Fonseca**-smoker owns the **bird**, so the **Fonseca**-smoker is in Position 4.
- The **Tiparillo**-smoker is the **Mexican** in Position 5.

- **Clue 14**: The **German** is to the left or right of the person who likes **coral**. So, the person who likes **coral** must be in Position 2.

#### Step 2: Beverage in the Middle
- **Clue 8**: The person drinking **lemonade** is in the middle (Position 3).

#### Step 3: Position of the Malaysian
- **Clue 1**: The **Malaysian** is the person who likes **orange**. So, the **Malaysian** must be in Position 4 or 5.

#### Step 4: Assigning Colors
- **Clue 5**: The person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. So, the person in Position 2 must like **aquamarine**, and the person in Position 3 must like **black**.
  
- Therefore, **Position 1** (the **German**) must like **chestnut**, because that is the remaining color for the German.

#### Step 5: Assigning Nationalities and Beverages
- **Clue 4**: The **Dutch** is drinking **almond-lemonade**, so the **Dutch** must be in Position 2.

#### Step 6: Assigning Pets and Cigar Brands
- **Clue 6**: The **Fonseca**-smoker is the owner of the **bird**. Since the **Fonseca**-smoker cannot be in Position 1 (the **German** already owns the **mouse**), the **Fonseca**-smoker must be in Position 4.
  
- The **Malaysian** must be in Position 4, so the **Malaysian** is the **Fonseca**-smoker and owns the **bird**.

- **Clue 10**: The **Coral-master** smoker is next to the owner of the **lizard**, so the person who likes **coral** (Position 2, **Dutch**) is the **Coral**-master-smoker, and the owner of the **lizard** must be in Position 5.

- **Clue 13**: The **Mexican** is the **Tiparillo**-smoker, so the **Mexican** must be in Position 5.

- **Person drinking lemonade in the middle (Position 3)**: From **Clue 8**, we know that **Position 3** drinks **lemonade**.
  
- **Black is to the right of aquamarine**: From **Clue 5**, the person who likes **black** must be to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. This tells us that **Position 4** must like **black**, and **Position 3** must like **aquamarine**.

- **Position 3 drinks lemonade, so the person who drinks cola must be in Position 4** (Clue 3), and since **Position 4** likes black, the **cola-drinker** must like black.

- **Position 4 (Havana-smoker)**: From **Clue 7**, the **Havana-smoker** likes **chestnut**. So, **Position 4** is the **Havana-smoker**, and their color is **black**, and they like **chestnut**. This leaves **Position 5** for **the Malaysian**, who likes **orange**.

- **Position 2 (Dutch)**: From **Clue 4**, the **Dutch** person drinks **almond-lemonade**. **Position 2** is therefore the **Dutch**, who drinks **almond-lemonade**.

- **Fonseca-smoker and the bird**: From **Clue 6**, the **Fonseca-smoker** owns the **bird**, and this can only be **Position 2** because **Position 1** is already taken by the German.

- **Position 5 (Mexican)**: From **Clue 13**, the **Mexican** smokes **tiparillo**. The **Mexican** must be in **Position 5**, and **Position 5** has already been determined to like **orange**, so they are the **tiparillo-smoker**.

- **Position 1 (Coral and Lizard)**: From **Clue 10** and **Clue 14**, the **coral-smoker** is next to the person who owns the **lizard**, and the **German** is in **Position 1**, meaning **Position 1** owns the **lizard** and smokes **coral**.

- **Final pets and cigars**: **Position 1** owns the **lizard** and smokes **coral**, **Position 2** owns the **bird** and smokes **Fonseca**, **Position 3** owns the **goldfish** and smokes **baccarat** (from Clue 12), and **Position 4** owns the **mouse** and smokes **Havana**.

- **Position 2**: **Italian**, **Goldfish**, **?**, **?**, **Coral**
- **Position 3**: **?**, **?**, **Lemonade**, **?**, **?**
- **Position 4**: **Dutch**, **?**, **Cola**, **Black**, **?**

   - The **German** cannot like **orange** (since the Malaysian likes orange), so **Position 1** must like **aquamarine**.

2. **Position 3**: The person in the middle drinks **lemonade** (Clue 8). This person cannot be the one who likes **orange** (because the Malaysian already likes orange). So, **Position 3** must be the person who likes **chestnut**.
   - The **Havana** smoker must like **chestnut** (Clue 7), so the **Havana** smoker is in **Position 3**.

3. **Position 5**: The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo** (Clue 13). This leaves **Position 5** for the **Mexican**. Therefore, **Position 5** is the **Tiparillo** smoker and has a pet **cat** (since the cat hasn’t been placed yet).

---

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Position 1**: The **German** is on the far left (Clue 9).
   - The **German** could be next to the person who likes **coral** (Clue 14). 
   - The **German** cannot drink **lemonade** (since that's in the middle), so the **German** must drink **iced-tea** (Clue 12), and smoke **Baccarat**.
   - Therefore, the **German** in position 1 drinks **iced-tea**, smokes **Baccarat**, and does not own the **lizard** or **goldfish**.

2. **Position 3**: The person drinking **lemonade** is in the middle (Clue 8). This person is the **Italian** who owns the **goldfish** (Clue 2).
   - The **Italian** must also like **coral** since the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral** (Clue 14).
   - Therefore, the **Italian** is in position 3, drinks **lemonade**, smokes **Pall-Mall**, and owns the **goldfish**.

3. **Position 5**: The person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine** (Clue 5). This suggests the person who likes **black** is in position 5, and the person who likes **aquamarine** is in position 4.
   - The person in position 5 drinks **cola** (Clue 3) and smokes **Tiparillo** (Clue 13), so this person is the **Mexican**.
   - Therefore, the **Mexican** is in position 5, drinks **cola**, and smokes **Tiparillo**.

4. **Position 2**: The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade** (Clue 4), so the **Dutch** must be in position 2.
   - The **Dutch** smokes **Havana** and owns the **lizard** (Clue 6 and Clue 10).

5. **Position 4**: The person in position 4 likes **aquamarine** and owns the **bird** (Clue 6). This person smokes **Fonseca**.
   - Therefore, the person in position 4 smokes **Fonseca**, owns the **bird**, and likes **aquamarine**.

### Final Answer:

- **Position 1**: **German**, drinks **iced-tea**, smokes **Baccarat**, owns **mouse**, likes **chestnut**.
- **Position 2**: **Dutch**, drinks **almond-lemonade**, smokes **Havana**, owns **lizard**, likes **black**.
- **Position 3**: **Italian**, drinks **lemonade**, smokes **Pall-Mall**, owns **goldfish**, likes **coral**.
- **Position 4**: **Malaysian**, drinks **hot-chocolate**, smokes **Fonseca**, owns **bird**, likes **orange**.

Einstein_orig_fonseca-3	fonseca	8	"Let's carefully solve the puzzle step by step, as we know that there are five people with different characteristics (nationalities, colors, cigars, beverages, pets). We’ll work through the clues to deduce who fits where.

### Step 1: Set Up
We have five positions (1 to 5). Each person in these positions has:
- A **nationality** (malaysian, italian, dutch, german, mexican)
- A **favorite color** (orange, black, aquamarine, chestnut, coral)
- A **cigar brand** (fonseca, havana, pall-mall, baccarat, tiparillo)
- A **favorite beverage** (cola, almond-lemonade, lemonade, iced-tea, hot-chocolate)
- A **pet** (goldfish, lizard, cat, mouse, bird)

We’ll fill in the positions based on the clues.

### Step 2: Apply the Clues

#### **Clue 9**: ""The German is on the far left.""
- This means the **German** is in Position 1.

#### **Clue 8**: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""
- The person drinking **lemonade** is in Position 3.

#### **Clue 5**: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""
- So, the person who likes **black** must be to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. Therefore, the person who likes **aquamarine** must be in Position 2 and the person who likes **black** must be in Position 3.

#### **Clue 3**: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""
- From Clue 5, we already know the person who likes **black** is in Position 3, so the person in Position 3 drinks **cola**.

#### **Clue 4**: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""
- From Clue 8, we know that **lemonade** is in the middle (Position 3), so **almond-lemonade** must be the drink of the person in Position 2. Therefore, the **Dutch** is in Position 2.

#### **Clue 1**: ""The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.""
- This means the **Malaysian** must be in Position 5, as it's the only position left for him.

#### **Clue 2**: ""The Italian is the owner of the goldfish.""
- The **Italian** must own the **goldfish**. Since the **Malaysian** is in Position 5 and the **Dutch** is in Position 2, the **Italian** must be in Position 3.

#### **Clue 7**: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""
- The **Havana-smoker** must be the person who likes **chestnut**. Since the **German** is in Position 1 and the **Italian** in Position 3, the person who likes **chestnut** must be in Position 4. Therefore, the **Havana**-smoker is in Position 4.

#### **Clue 6**: ""The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.""
- The **Fonseca**-smoker must own the **bird**, so the person in Position 5 must be the **Fonseca**-smoker. This is the **Malaysian** in Position 5.

#### **Clue 12**: ""The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""
- The **Baccarat**-smoker drinks **iced-tea**. The person who drinks **iced-tea** is in Position 1, so the **German** must be the **Baccarat**-smoker.

#### **Clue 13**: ""The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.""
- The **Mexican** is in Position 4 and must be the **Tiparillo**-smoker.

#### **Clue 10**: ""The Coral-master-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.""
- The person who likes **coral** must be on the left or right of the person who owns the **lizard**. Since the **Havana**-smoker is in Position 4, the **Coral**-master smoker must be in Position 3.

#### **Clue 11**: ""The Havana-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse.""
- The **Havana**-smoker in Position 4 must be next to the person who owns the **mouse**. Therefore, the **mouse** must be in Position 5.

### Step 3: Final Assignments
- **Position 1**: **German**, drinks **iced-tea**, smokes **Baccarat**, owns **mouse**, likes **chestnut**.
- **Position 2**: **Dutch**, drinks **almond-lemonade**, smokes **Havana**, owns **lizard**, likes **aquamarine**.

- **Clue 9**: The **German** is on the **far left**, so the **German** is in **Position 1**.
- **Clue 8**: The **person drinking lemonade is in the middle**, so **Position 3** drinks **lemonade**.
- **Clue 5**: The person who likes **black** is to the **right** of the person who likes **aquamarine**, meaning **black** cannot be in **Position 1** (since it's at the far left), and **black** is in **Position 4**, with **aquamarine** in **Position 3**.

- **Position 4**: The person drinks **cola** and likes **black** (Clue 3). This person must smoke **Havana** (since Clue 7 says the Havana-smoker likes **chestnut**), and owns the **mouse** (Clue 11).
