We have five houses, each with different characteristics (color, nationality, pet, drink, cigarette brand). The goal is to deduce the positions of these houses and answer where the **red** house is.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Clue Summary:
- There are five houses, and they are in a specific order from left to right.
- **House 1**: Norwegian
- **House 3**: Milk is drunk here.
- **Green house**: Coffee is drunk here.
- **Ivory house**: Green house is immediately to the right.
- **Spanish**: Owns a dog.
- **Ukrainian**: Drinks tea.
- **Lucky Strike smoker**: Drinks orange juice.
- **Kools smoker**: Lives in the yellow house.
- **Old Gold smoker**: Owns snails.
- **Chesterfield smoker**: Lives next to the person with the fox.
- **Parliament smoker**: The Japanese.

### Start with the known facts:
1. **House 1 (Norwegian)**: 
   - The Norwegian lives in the first house (Clue 10).
   - The Norwegian lives next to the blue house (Clue 15), so House 2 must be blue.

2. **House 3**: 
   - The middle house drinks milk (Clue 9), so House 3 must be the house that drinks milk.

3. **Green House**: 
   - Coffee is drunk in the green house (Clue 4), and the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (Clue 6). So, House 4 is green and House 3 is ivory.

4. **Yellow House**: 
   - The Kools smoker lives in the yellow house (Clue 8), so House 1 must be yellow.

5. **Pets**: 
   - The Spaniard owns the dog (Clue 3). So, the Spaniard lives in House 5 (since House 4 is already taken by the green house).
   - The Old Gold smoker owns snails (Clue 7), so the person in House 2 owns snails.
   - The man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the person with the fox (Clue 11), so House 2 has the fox and House 1 smokes Chesterfields.

6. **Drinks**:
   - The Ukrainian drinks tea (Clue 5), so the Ukrainian must live in House 2.
   - The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice (Clue 13), so House 5 drinks orange juice.
   - The green house drinks coffee (Clue 4), so House 4 drinks coffee.

7. **Smokers**:
   - The Japanese smokes Parliaments (Clue 14), so the Japanese lives in House 4.

### Summary of the houses:

| House | Nationality  | Color   | Pet   | Drink        | Cigarette    |

| 1     | Norwegian    | Yellow  | Fox   | Water        | Chesterfield |

### Step 1: Organize the known information
We have 5 houses, each with:
- A different color
- A different nationality
- A different pet
- A different drink
- A different cigarette brand

We also have 15 clues to use. We’ll fill out a table to track each piece of information.

### Step 2: Set up the initial table
We know the following from the clues:
1. There are 5 houses: **House 1, House 2, House 3, House 4, House 5**.
2. The colors of the houses are **red, green, ivory, yellow, blue**.
3. The nationalities are **English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese**.
4. The pets are **dog, fox, zebra, horse, snails**.
5. The drinks are **coffee, tea, milk, orange-juice, water**.
6. The cigarette brands are **old-gold, kools, chesterfields, lucky-strike, parliaments**.

This places the **Norwegian** in **House 1**.

#### Clue 15: The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
This places the **blue house** in **House 2**.

#### Clue 2: The Englishman lives in the red house.
This places the **Englishman** in the **red house**, which must be **House 5**.

#### Clue 9: Milk is drunk in the middle house.
This places **milk** in **House 3**.

#### Clue 6: The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
This means the **green house** is **House 4**, and the **ivory house** is **House 3**.

#### Clue 4: Coffee is drunk in the green house.

| Nationality | Norwegian | ? | ? | ? | English |
| Pet | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Drink | ? | ? | Milk | Coffee | ? |
| Cigarette | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |

#### Clue 7: The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
We don’t yet know where the **Old Gold** smoker is, but this person owns **snails**.

#### Clue 8: Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
This places the **Kools** smoker in **House 1** (the **yellow house**).

#### Clue 12: Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
This means **House 2** must have the **horse** (since it’s next to **House 1**, where the **Kools** smoker lives).

Now, we know:

| House | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Color | Yellow | Blue | Ivory | Green | Red |
| Nationality | Norwegian | ? | ? | ? | English |
| Pet | ? | Horse | ? | ? | ? |
| Drink | ? | ? | Milk | Coffee | ? |
| Cigarette | Kools | ? | ? | ? | ? |

#### Clue 13: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
This means the person who smokes **Lucky Strike** drinks **orange juice**, and since **House 4** drinks **coffee**, the **Lucky Strike** smoker must be in **House 5**. The person in **House 5** drinks **orange juice**.

#### Clue 3: The Spaniard owns the dog.
The **Spaniard** must live in the remaining house where the **dog** is kept, and based on elimination, the **Spaniard** must live in **House 2** (where the **dog** is).

#### Clue 11: The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
The person who smokes **Chesterfields** lives next to the person who owns the **fox**. This means the person who smokes **Chesterfields** must live in **House 3** (the only place left for the **fox** owner to be in **House 4**).

#### Clue 14: The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
Since **House 5** and **House 1** are already filled, the **Japanese** must live in **House 4** and smokes **Parliaments**.

Now, we know the complete setup:

| House | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Color | Yellow | Blue | Ivory | Green | Red |
| Nationality | Norwegian | Spanish | Ukrainian | Japanese | English |
| Pet | ? | Dog | Fox | Zebra | ? |

- **Pets**: Dog, Fox, Zebra, Horse, Snails
- **Drinks**: Coffee, Tea, Milk, Orange Juice, Water

### Step 2: Use the clues to start filling in information

We know there are five houses, so let's label them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (left to right).

#### **Clue 10**: The Norwegian lives in the first house.
This means House 1 is the Norwegian’s house.

#### **Clue 15**: The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
Therefore, House 2 must be blue.

#### **Clue 2**: The Englishman lives in the red house.
Thus, House 3 must be red, and the Englishman lives there.

#### **Clue 6**: The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
This means that House 4 is ivory, and House 5 is green.

Now, we know the following:

| House # | 1 (Norwegian) | 2 (Blue)  | 3 (Red)  | 4 (Ivory)  | 5 (Green)  |
|---------|---------------|-----------|----------|------------|------------|
| Color   | Yellow        | Blue      | Red      | Ivory      | Green      |

#### **Clue 9**: Milk is drunk in the middle house.
So, House 3 (Red house) drinks milk.

#### **Clue 4**: Coffee is drunk in the green house.
Therefore, House 5 (Green house) drinks coffee.

#### **Clue 5**: The Ukrainian drinks tea.
Therefore, House 2 (Blue house) drinks tea.

#### **Clue 13**: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
Thus, House 4 (Ivory house) must drink orange juice, and the Lucky Strike smoker lives there.

#### **Clue 1**: The remaining drink is water, so the Norwegian in House 1 drinks water.

Now we know the drinks:

| House # | 1 (Norwegian) | 2 (Blue)  | 3 (Red)  | 4 (Ivory)  | 5 (Green)  |
|---------|---------------|-----------|----------|------------|------------|
| Drink   | Water         | Tea       | Milk     | Orange Juice| Coffee     |

#### **Clue 8**: Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
So House 1 (Yellow house) smokes Kools.

#### **Clue 12**: Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
Thus, House 2 (Blue house) must have the horse.

#### **Clue 11**: The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
So House 3 (Red house) must have the fox, and the man who smokes Chesterfields must live in House 4 (Ivory house).

#### **Clue 7**: The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
Thus, House 3 (Red house) must smoke Old Gold and own snails.

#### **Clue 14**: The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
Therefore, House 5 (Green house) is occupied by the Japanese, and they smoke Parliaments.

#### **Clue 3**: The Spaniard owns the dog.
So, House 4 (Ivory house) is occupied by the Spaniard, and they own the dog.

#### **Remaining pet**: The only remaining pet is the zebra, which must be in House 2 (Blue house), where the Ukrainian lives.

**japanese:4**"	japanese:5
Einstein_orig_dog-2	dog	8	"Let's work through the logic puzzle systematically and solve for **dog**.

### Step 1: Set up the table
We have 5 houses. Each house has:
- A color (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue)
- A nationality (English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese)
- A pet (dog, fox, zebra, horse, snails)
- A drink (coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, water)
- A cigarette brand (Old Gold, Kools, Chesterfields, Lucky Strike, Parliaments)

### Step 2: Use the clues

We will begin by applying the clues and updating our table step by step.

#### Clue 10: The Norwegian lives in the first house.
This places the **Norwegian** in **House 1**.

#### Clue 15: The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
This means the **blue house** is **House 2**.

#### Clue 2: The Englishman lives in the red house.
This places the **Englishman** in the **red house**, which must be **House 5** (since House 1 is already occupied by the Norwegian, and House 2 is blue).

#### Clue 9: Milk is drunk in the middle house.
This places **milk** in **House 3**.

#### Clue 6: The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
So, the **ivory house** is **House 3**, and the **green house** is **House 4**.

#### Clue 4: Coffee is drunk in the green house.
This places **coffee** in **House 4**.

Now we know:

| House  | 1 | 2  | 3   | 4    | 5   |

| Drink  | ? | ?  | Milk | Coffee | ?   |
| Cigarette | ? | ? | ?   | ?    | ?   |

#### Clue 7: The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
This gives us information about the **Old Gold** smoker owning **snails**.

#### Clue 8: Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
The **yellow house** must be **House 1**, where the **Norwegian** lives, and therefore the **Kools** smoker is in **House 1**.

#### Clue 12: Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
This means **House 2** must have the **horse**.

#### Clue 3: The Spaniard owns the dog.
The **Spanish** person owns the **dog**, and by elimination, **House 2** (the **blue house**) must be the **Spanish** house.

#### Clue 11: The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
The man who smokes **Chesterfields** must live next to the man with the **fox**. So, **House 4** must have the **fox**.

#### Clue 13: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
This means the person in **House 5** smokes **Lucky Strike** and drinks **orange juice**.

#### Clue 14: The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
Since **House 5** is already occupied, the **Japanese** must live in **House 4**, and smokes **Parliaments**.

Now we have:

| House  | 1   | 2     | 3    | 4    | 5     |
|--------|-----|-------|------|------|-------|
| Color  | Yellow | Blue  | Ivory | Green | Red   |

| Drink   | Water | Tea | Milk | Orange Juice | Coffee |
| Cigarettes | Kools | Chesterfields | Old Gold | Lucky Strike | Parliaments |
| Pet     | Horse | Zebra | Fox | Dog | Snails |

### Step 1: Assign Nationalities

**Clue 10**: The Norwegian lives in the first house.  
So, House 1 is Norwegian.

**Clue 2**: The Englishman lives in the red house.  
So, House 3 is the red house and is occupied by the Englishman.

**Clue 15**: The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.  
Thus, House 2 must be blue.

**Clue 3**: The Spaniard owns the dog.  
This means House 4 must be occupied by the Spaniard.

**Clue 5**: The Ukrainian drinks tea.  
Therefore, House 2 (Blue house) is occupied by the Ukrainian and drinks tea.

**Clue 14**: The Japanese smokes Parliaments.  
Thus, House 5 is occupied by the Japanese and smokes Parliaments.

### Step 2: Assign Drinks

**Clue 9**: Milk is drunk in the middle house.  
So, House 3 (Red house) drinks milk.

**Clue 4**: Coffee is drunk in the green house.  
Thus, House 5 (Green house) drinks coffee.

**Clue 13**: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.  
Thus, House 4 (Ivory house) drinks orange juice.

**Remaining drink**: Water must be drunk in House 1 (Yellow house), as all other drinks are assigned.

### Step 3: Assign Cigarettes

**Clue 8**: Kools are smoked in the yellow house.  
Therefore, House 1 (Yellow house) smokes Kools.

**Clue 7**: The Old Gold smoker owns snails.  
Thus, House 3 (Red house) smokes Old Gold and owns snails.

### House 1: 
- The Norwegian lives here (Clue 10).  
- The Norwegian must live in the first house, and based on Clue 15, House 2 is blue.
- The drink in House 1 must be water (because Clue 9 states that milk is drunk in the middle house).

- The person in the blue house is Ukrainian, and according to Clue 5, the Ukrainian drinks tea.  

### House 3 (Middle House): 
- From Clue 9, we know that milk is drunk in the middle house, so House 3 must drink milk.  
- From Clue 6, we know the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, meaning House 4 must be green and House 3 must be ivory. 

### House 4 (Green House): 
- The green house drinks coffee (Clue 4).  
- According to Clue 13, the person who drinks coffee in the green house must smoke Lucky Strike. So, this person smokes Lucky Strike and drinks coffee.

### House 5 (Red House):

**Answer**: **norwegian:1**"	norwegian:1
Einstein_orig_japanese-3	japanese	8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We have 5 houses, each with a different color, and 5 residents of different nationalities, each with a unique pet, drink, and cigarette brand. Our goal is to determine the location of each resident based on the clues provided.

### Step 1: Interpret the clues

1. **There are five houses.**  
   So we have 5 positions: House 1, House 2, House 3, House 4, House 5.

2. **The Englishman lives in the red house.**  
   The **Englishman** lives in the **red house**.

3. **The Spaniard owns the dog.**  
   The **Spaniard** owns the **dog**.

4. **Coffee is drunk in the green house.**

6. **The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.**  
   The **green house** is immediately to the right of the **ivory house**.

7. **The Old Gold smoker owns snails.**  
   The person who smokes **Old Gold** owns **snails**.

8. **Kools are smoked in the yellow house.**  
   The person in the **yellow house** smokes **Kools**.

9. **Milk is drunk in the middle house.**  
   The person in **House 3** drinks **milk** (since it’s in the middle).

10. **The Norwegian lives in the first house.**  
    The **Norwegian** lives in **House 1**.

11. **The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.**  
    The person who smokes **Chesterfields** lives next to the person who owns the **fox**.

12. **Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.**  
    The person who smokes **Kools** lives next to the person who owns the **horse**.

13. **The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.**  
    The person who smokes **Lucky Strike** drinks **orange juice**.

14. **The Japanese smokes Parliaments.**  
    The **Japanese** smokes **Parliaments**.

15. **The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.**  
    The **blue house** is next to **House 1** (where the **Norwegian** lives).

### Step 2: Make deductions

From clue 10, the **Norwegian** must live in **House 1**.  
Clue 15 tells us that the **blue house** is next to the **Norwegian**'s house, so **House 2** must be the **blue house**.

From clue 6, the **green house** is immediately to the right of the **ivory house**, so the **ivory house** must be **House 3** and the **green house** must be **House 4**.

Now we know the layout of the houses so far:

| House | 1          | 2        | 3       | 4         | 5         |
|-------|------------|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Color | Yellow     | Blue     | Ivory   | Green     | Red       |
| Nationality | Norwegian | ? | ? | ? | English  |
| Pet   | ?          | ?        | ?       | ?         | ?         |
| Drink | ?          | ?        | Milk    | Coffee    | ?         |
| Cigarette | Kools     | ?        | ?       | ?         | ?         |

### Step 3: Fill in the grid

- **Clue 9** tells us that **Milk** is drunk in the middle house, so **House 3** drinks **Milk**.  
- **Clue 4** tells us that **Coffee** is drunk in the **green house** (House 4).
  
Now, the **red house** (House 5) must be the house where the **Englishman** lives (from Clue 2), and the **Ukrainian** must live in **House 2** (because the **Ukrainian drinks tea**, Clue 5, and **House 2** is next to the **Norwegian**). Therefore, **House 1** drinks **water**, and **House 2** drinks **tea**.

The remaining drink is **orange juice**, which must be drunk in **House 5** (the **Lucky Strike** smoker drinks it, Clue 13).

Now, we can fill out the pets:

- **Clue 3** tells us the **Spaniard** owns the **dog**, so the **Spaniard** must live in **House 5**.  
- **Clue 12** tells us that **Kools** are smoked in a house next to the house where the **horse** is kept, so the person in **House 1** owns the **horse**.
- The person who smokes **Chesterfields** lives next to the person who owns the **fox**, so the person in **House 2** must own the **fox**, and the person in **House 3** smokes **Chesterfields**.
- **Clue 7** tells us the person who smokes **Old Gold** owns **snails**, so the person in **House 3** smokes **Old Gold** and owns **snails**.
- The **Japanese** must live in **House 4** because they smoke **Parliaments**, and the only remaining cigarette brand for **House 4** is **Parliaments**.

### Final Layout

| House | 1          | 2        | 3       | 4         | 5         |
|-------|------------|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
