### Step 1: Set up the grid

We have 5 houses, and we’ll organize each house based on their attributes: House type, music genre, food, game, and flowers.

| House # | House Type       | Music      | Food     | Flower      | Game        |

- Pop → Azalea

#### Clue 3: **The person playing go is the person eating zucchini**
- Go → Zucchini

#### Clue 4: **The fan of techno is the person playing domino**
- Techno → Domino

#### Clue 5: **The person eating zucchini is to the right of the person eating carrot**

- **House 1** must be the fan of **electronic** (Clue 9), and it is adjacent to the person eating **lettuce** (Clue 14). So, **House 2** is eating **lettuce**.
- **House 1** is also eating **onion** (because the fan of indie is eating onion, Clue 1). So, **House 1** is the fan of **indie** and eats **onion**.
- **House 2** is the person playing **go** and eating **zucchini** (Clue 3).
- **House 5** must be the **townhouse** (since **House 4** is **futuristic** and playing **trance**).
- **House 5** is the person playing **mah-jongg** (Clue 12).
- The **gothic-revival** house is adjacent to the person who grows **marigold** (Clue 10), so **House 2** must be growing **marigold**.

We now have the following:

- **House 1** is the fan of **electronic**, eating **onion**, and playing **chess** (based on the remaining unassigned game).

### Setup:
We have 5 positions, and we need to figure out where each food, music genre, house type, game, and flower go.

### Step-by-Step Deductions:
1. **Clue 9**: The fan of electronic is on the far left.
   - So, the person who likes electronic music is in **position 1**.

   - The person playing monopoly is in **position 3**.

3. **Clue 3**: The person playing go is the person eating zucchini.

8. **Clue 13**: The fan of trance is the futuristic house.
   - The person in the **futuristic house** likes **trance**. The futuristic house cannot be in position 1 or 3 (those are already taken), so it must be in position 4.

9. **Clue 4**: The fan of techno is the person playing domino.
   - The person who plays **domino** likes **techno**. Therefore, the person playing domino must be in position 2 or 5. Since position 5 is taken by the person in the townhouse, the person playing domino must be in position 2.

10. **Clue 10**: The gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold.
    - The person in the **gothic-revival** house must be next to the person growing **marigold**.

The **futuristic** house is the **trance** fan.

**Clue 14**: The fan of **electronic** is to the left or right of the person eating **lettuce**.  
The **electronic** fan is next to the person eating **lettuce**.

### Step 3: Fill in the grid

From the above clues, we know:

- **House #1**: **electronic** fan, next to the person eating **lettuce**, so they are likely eating **onion** (because of Clue 1).
- **House #2**: Since **house #1** is the **electronic** fan and they are next to the person eating **lettuce**, **house #2** must be the one eating **lettuce**.
- **House #3**: The person playing **monopoly** is in the middle, so this person eats **radish** (because of Clue 7). This person must be in the **victorian** house.
- **House #4**: **go** is the person eating **zucchini**, so **house #4** plays **go** and eats **zucchini**. 
- **House #5**: The **futuristic** house is the **trance** fan, so **house #5** must be the **futuristic** house and the person eating **carrot**. This person plays **domino** (Clue 4).
