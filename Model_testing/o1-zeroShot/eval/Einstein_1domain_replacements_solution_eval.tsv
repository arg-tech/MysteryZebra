Step 2: Assign neighbors based on Clues 14 and 4.
Clue 14: Norwegian is next to the person eating Peas. Therefore, Peas must be in Position 2.
Clue 4: Artichoke is to the left of Kale. This means Artichoke cannot be in Position 5 and must be in Position 4, with Kale in Position 5.
Step 3: Fill in beverages and cigars based on Clues 5, 12, and 15.
Clue 5: The person eating Artichoke drinks Coffee. Thus, Position 4 → Coffee.
Clue 12: The Davidoff smoker drinks Beer. Therefore, Position 2 → Davidoff and Beer.
Clue 15: The Blend smoker is next to the person drinking Water. Since Milk (Position 3) and Coffee (Position 4) are taken, Water must be in Position 5. This means Blend is in Position 4 or Position 5.
