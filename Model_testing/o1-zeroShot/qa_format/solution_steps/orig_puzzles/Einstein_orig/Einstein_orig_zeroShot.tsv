### Step 1: Assigning House Positions

We number the houses from **1 to 5**, left to right.

#### Given Clues:
1. **Norwegian** lives in **House 1** (Clue 9).
2. **Norwegian's house is next to the Blue house** (Clue 14).  
   - **House 2 must be Blue**.
3. **The Brit lives in the Red house** (Clue 1).
4. **The Green house is to the left of the White house** (Clue 4).
5. **The Green house owner drinks Coffee** (Clue 5).
6. **The house in the center (House 3) drinks Milk** (Clue 8).
7. **The Yellow house owner smokes Dunhill** (Clue 7).  
   - Since House 1 is Norwegian and must be next to Blue (House 2), **House 1 must be Yellow**.
8. That means the remaining colors must be:  
   - **House 3 = Red** (Brit lives there).  
   - **House 4 = Green** (Left of White).  
   - **House 5 = White**.

Thus, the house colors are:
1. **Yellow**  
2. **Blue**  
3. **Red**  
4. **Green**  
5. **White**

---

### Step 2: Assigning Beverages

- **House 5 drinks Beer, so they must smoke Bluemaster** (Clue 12).
- **House 3 smokes Pall Mall** because they keep Birds (Clue 6).
- The only remaining cigar is **Blend**, which must be House 2.

Thus, the cigars are:
1. **Dunhill**  
2. **Blend**  
3. **Pall Mall**  
4. **Prince**  
5. **Bluemaster**  

---

### Step 5: Assigning Pets

2. **The Norwegian's house is next to the Blue house** (Clue 14).  
   - **House 2 must be Blue**.
3. **The Brit lives in the Red house** (Clue 1).

5. **The Green house owner drinks Coffee** (Clue 5).
6. **The Yellow house owner smokes Dunhill** (Clue 7).  
   - Since House 1 is Norwegian and must be next to Blue (House 2), **House 1 must be Yellow**.
7. That means the remaining colors are:  
   - **House 3 = Red** (Brit lives there).  
   - **House 4 = Green** (Left of White).  
   - **House 5 = White**.

Thus, the house colors are:
1. **Yellow**

Thus, the nationalities are:
1. **Norwegian**  
2. **Dane**  
3. **Brit**  
4. **German**  
5. **Swede**  

---

### **Step 3: Assign Beverages**

- House **2 (Dane) drinks Tea** (Clue 3).
- From Clue 15, **the Blend smoker has a neighbor who drinks Water**.
- The remaining drinks are **Beer and Water**.
- From Clue 12, **Bluemaster smoker drinks Beer**.
- That means **House 5 drinks Beer**.
- The only drink left for House 1 is **Water**.

Thus, the beverages are:
1. **Water**  
2. **Tea**  
3. **Milk**  
4. **Coffee**  
5. **Beer**  

---

### **Step 4: Assign Cigars**

Thus, the cigars are:
1. **Dunhill**

### Step 1: Assigning the Norwegian (Clue 9)
- The **Norwegian** must be in **House 1**.
- From Clue 14, House 2 must be **Blue**.

---

### Step 2: Assigning Colors
- From Clue 7, the **Yellow** house owner smokes **Dunhill**. Since House 1 is **Norwegian**, it must be **Yellow**.
- House 2 is **Blue**.
- From Clue 4, **Green** is left of **White**.
- From Clue 5, **Green** drinks **Coffee**.
- The only way this fits is if **House 3 is Red (Brit)**, **House 4 is Green**, and **House 5 is White**.

Thus, the colors are:
1. **Yellow**
2. **Blue**
3. **Red**
4. **Green**
5. **White**

---

### Step 3: Assigning Beverages
- House 3 (Middle) drinks **Milk** (Clue 8).
- House 4 (Green) drinks **Coffee** (Clue 5).
- The **Dane** drinks **Tea** (Clue 3). Since **Norwegian is in House 1**, **Dane must be in House 2**.
- From Clue 15, the **Blend smoker** has a neighbor who drinks **Water**.
- Since we only have **Beer and Water left**, and Clue 12 states **Bluemaster smoker drinks Beer**, then Water must be in House 1.

Thus, the beverages are:
1. **Water**
2. **Tea**
3. **Milk**
4. **Coffee**
5. **Beer**

---

### Step 4: Assigning Nationalities
- **House 1 is Norwegian** (Clue 9).
- **House 2 is Dane** (Drinks Tea, Clue 3).
- **House 3 is Brit** (Clue 1).
- **House 5 must be Swede** (since Swede has Dogs, Clue 2).
- **House 4 must be German**.

Thus, the nationalities are:
1. **Norwegian**
2. **Dane**
3. **Brit**
4. **German**
5. **Swede**

---

### Step 5: Assigning Cigars
- House 1 (Yellow) smokes **Dunhill** (Clue 7).
- House 4 (German) smokes **Prince** (Clue 13).
- House 5 drinks **Beer** → must smoke **Bluemaster** (Clue 12).
- House 3 smokes **Pall Mall** because he has **Birds** (Clue 6).
- That leaves House 2 smoking **Blend**.

Thus, the cigars are:
1. **Dunhill**
2. **Blend**
3. **Pall Mall**
4. **Prince**
5. **Bluemaster**

---

### Step 6: Assigning Pets
- House 3 (Pall Mall) has **Birds** (Clue 6).
- House 5 (Swede) has **Dogs** (Clue 2).
- House 2 (Blend smoker) has a neighbor with **Cats** (Clue 10). House 1 or 3 must have Cats.
- House 1 (Dunhill) has a neighbor with **Horses** (Clue 11), meaning House 2 has **Horses**.
- That leaves House 1 with **Cats**.

Thus, the pets are:
1. **Cats**
2. **Horses**
3. **Birds**
4. **Fish** (by elimination)
5. **Dogs**

7. That means the remaining colors are:  
   - **House 3 = Red** (Brit lives there).  
   - **House 4 = Green** (Left of White).  
   - **House 5 = White**.

Thus, the house colors are:
1. **Yellow**

### Step 1: Assigning Known Positions

We number the houses from left to right: **1 to 5**.

#### Given Clues:
1. **Norwegian** lives in **House 1** (Clue 9).
2. **Norwegian's house is next to the Blue house** (Clue 14).  
   - **House 2 must be Blue**.
3. **The Brit lives in the Red house** (Clue 1).
4. **The Green house is to the left of the White house** (Clue 4).
5. **The Green house owner drinks Coffee** (Clue 5).
6. **The house in the center (House 3) drinks Milk** (Clue 8).
7. **The Yellow house owner smokes Dunhill** (Clue 7).  
   - Since House 1 is Norwegian and must be next to Blue (House 2), **House 1 must be Yellow**.
8. That means the remaining colors must be:  
   - **House 3 = Red** (Brit lives there).  
   - **House 4 = Green** (Left of White).  
   - **House 5 = White**.

Thus, the house colors are:
1. **Yellow**

Thus, the drinks are:
1. **Water**
