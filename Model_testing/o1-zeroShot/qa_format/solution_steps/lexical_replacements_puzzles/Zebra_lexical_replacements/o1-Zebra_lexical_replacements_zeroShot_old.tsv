| 5   |       |             |          |                |          |

Now, let's use the clues.

### Solving:

We know the German is in position **1** (Clue 9). Based on Clue 14, the person who likes **coral** must be in position **2** (adjacent to the German). So:

- **Position 1**: **German**, color unknown, cigar unknown, beverage unknown, pet unknown.
- **Position 2**: Person who likes **coral**.

From Clue 8, the person drinking **lemonade** is in position **3**. So:

- **Position 3**: Drinks **lemonade**, person likes **aquamarine** or **chestnut** or **black**.

From Clue 5, the person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**, so **aquamarine** must be in position **2**, and **black** must be in position **4**. Therefore:

- **Position 2**: Likes **aquamarine**.
- **Position 4**: Likes **black**, drinks **cola** (Clue 3).

From Clue 6, the **Fonseca** smoker owns the **bird**. We don't know the exact positions yet, but we can start filling in other details as we move forward.

The **Italian** is the owner of the **goldfish** (Clue 2), so the **Italian** isn't in position 1 or 3 (since position 1 is the **German** and position 3 is already drinking lemonade).

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person drinking **lemonade** is in **position 3**.

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person in **position 4** drinks **cola** and likes **black**.

### **Final Answer:**

**chestnut:5**"	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and use the clues to deduce the correct placements for each person, their pet, favorite color, beverage, and cigar.

### **Step 1: Set up the initial grid.**

We know we have 5 positions to fill, from 1 to 5. Let's denote them as:

1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  
---|---|---|---|---  
Color | | | |  
Nationality | | | |  
Cigar | | | |  
Beverage | | | |  
Pet | | | |  

### **Step 2: Analyze the clues.**

#### **Clue 9: ""The German is on the far left.""**
- The **German** is in **position 1**.

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person drinking **lemonade** is in **position 3**.

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**
- **Aquamarine** must be in **position 2**, and **black** must be in **position 4**.

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person in **position 4** drinks **cola** and likes **black**.

#### **Clue 4: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade**, and since the person drinking **lemonade** is in the middle (position 3), the **Dutch** must be in **position 3**, and therefore the person in **position 3** drinks **almond-lemonade**.

#### **Clue 7: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** likes **chestnut**. This person must be in **position 5**.

#### **Clue 12: ""The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""**
- The **Baccarat** smoker drinks **iced-tea**. This person must be in **position 3**.

#### **Clue 13: ""The Mexican is the tiparillo-smoker.""**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo** and must be in **position 5**.

#### **Clue 6: ""The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.""**

#### **Clue 2: ""The Italian is the owner of the goldfish.""**
- The **Italian** owns the **goldfish** and must be in **position 2**.

#### **Clue 10: ""The coralmaster-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.""**
- The **coralmaster**-smoker is next to the owner of the **lizard**. This clue will help place the remaining details once we know where **coral** and **lizard** are.

#### **Clue 14: ""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- Since the **German** is in **position 1**, the person who likes **coral** must be in **position 2**.

---

### **Step 3: Fill in the details.**

We now have the following positions:

| Position | 1         | 2         | 3           | 4        | 5        |  
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|----------|  
| **Color**     | ? (orange)   | Coral  | ? (aquamarine) | Black   | ? (chestnut) |  
| **Nationality**| German      | Italian   | Dutch      | Malaysian | Mexican |  
| **Cigar**      | Fonseca     | Pall-Mall  | Baccarat   | Havana   | Tiparillo |  
| **Beverage**   | Hot-chocolate | Lemonade   | Almond-lemonade | Cola    | Iced-tea |  
| **Pet**        | Bird       | Goldfish  | Lizard     | Mouse    | Cat     |  

#### **Step 4: Double-check each clue.**

- **Clue 1: ""The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.""**  
  The **Malaysian** likes **orange**, so the **Malaysian** must be in **position 4**.

- **Clue 11: ""The Havana-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse.""**  
  Since the **Havana** smoker is in **position 4** (and smokes **Havana**) and the **Mouse** owner is in **position 4**, this matches perfectly.

- **Clue 10: ""The coralmaster-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.""**  
  The **coralmaster-smoker** is in **position 2** and is adjacent to the **lizard** owner in **position 3**.

### **Final Answer:**

The **chestnut** color is liked by the **Mexican** in **position 5**.

**chestnut:5**"	3
Einstein_orig_coral:2-1	coral:2	"Let's work through this puzzle systematically. We need to assign each person to a position and deduce the colors, nationalities, cigars, beverages, and pets they have.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

We have 5 positions to fill. We will work through the clues step by step and use logical deduction.

| Position | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Color** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Nationality** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Cigar** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Beverage** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Pet** |       |       |       |       |       |

### Step 2: Process the clues

#### **Clue 9: ""The German is on the far left.""**
- The **German** must be in **position 1**.

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person in **position 3** must be drinking **lemonade**.

#### **Clue 1: ""The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.""**
- The **Malaysian** must like **orange**, so the **Malaysian** cannot be in position 1 (where the **German** is). We will place the **Malaysian** later.

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person who drinks **cola** must be the person who likes **black**. We can place them later.

#### **Clue 4: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** must be drinking **almond-lemonade**. We know the person in position 3 is drinking **lemonade**, so the **Dutch** must be in position 2 (where the only other beverage option is **almond-lemonade**).

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**
- The person who likes **black** must be to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. Therefore, **aquamarine** must be in **position 2**, and **black** must be in **position 4**. (Note that position 2 is already occupied by the Dutch person drinking **almond-lemonade**, so we will revisit this later).

#### **Clue 6: ""The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.""**
- The **Fonseca-smoker** must own a **bird**. We will place them in the correct position later.

#### **Clue 7: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** must like **chestnut**. We need to place them correctly.

#### **Clue 12: ""The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""**
- The **Baccarat-smoker** drinks **iced-tea**. We will figure out where this person belongs.

#### **Clue 13: ""The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.""**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**. We can figure out where the **Mexican** belongs later.

#### **Clue 14: ""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**. This gives us a hint about where **coral** must be placed.

### Step 3: Deduce positions and complete the table

Using the clues systematically:

- **Position 1:** The **German** must be on the far left. The **German** must like **aquamarine** (since the person to the right of them likes black, and **black** is in position 4).
- **Position 2:** The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade** and likes **coral** (from Clue 14, as the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**).
- **Position 3:** The person in the middle drinks **lemonade**. This person must be the **Italian**, and the Italian owns the **goldfish** (from Clue 2).
- **Position 4:** The person drinking **cola** likes **black** (from Clue 3). This person smokes **Pall-Mall**, owns a **cat**, and must be the **Malaysian** (from Clue 1, as the **Malaysian** likes **orange**, but we place them last).
- **Position 5:** The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**, drinks **iced-tea**, and likes **chestnut** (from Clue 7).

Now let’s fill in the complete table:

| Position | 1          | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Color** | aquamarine | coral         | orange        | black         | chestnut      |
| **Nationality** | German    | Dutch         | Italian       | Malaysian     | Mexican       |
| **Cigar** | Fonseca    | Pall-Mall     | Baccarat      | Havana        | Tiparillo     |
| **Beverage** | hot-chocolate | almond-lemonade | lemonade | cola          | iced-tea      |
| **Pet** | bird       | goldfish      | lizard        | cat           | mouse         |

### Final Answer:
**coral:2**"	"Let's approach the puzzle systematically step by step.

### Step 1: Setup the grid for 5 positions

We have five positions (1 through 5), which correspond to different characteristics such as **color**, **nationality**, **cigar brand**, **beverage**, and **pet**. We will use the clues to fill in the table.

| Position | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Color** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Nationality** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Cigar** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Beverage** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Pet** |       |       |       |       |       |

### Step 2: Analyze the clues

#### Clue 1: **""The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.""**
- **Malaysian** likes **orange**.

#### Clue 2: **""The Italian is the owner of the goldfish.""**
- **Italian** owns the **goldfish**.

#### Clue 3: **""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person who drinks **cola** likes **black**.

#### Clue 4: **""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade**.

#### Clue 5: **""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**
- The person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. So, the person who likes **aquamarine** must be in a position left of the person who likes **black**.

#### Clue 6: **""The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.""**
- The **Fonseca-smoker** owns a **bird**.

#### Clue 7: **""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** likes **chestnut**.

#### Clue 8: **""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person in **position 3** drinks **lemonade**.

#### Clue 9: **""The German is on the far left.""**
- The **German** is in **position 1**.

#### Clue 10: **""The coralmaster-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.""**
- The **coralmaster-smoker** is next to the person who owns the **lizard**.

#### Clue 11: **""The Havana-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** is next to the person who owns the **mouse**.

#### Clue 12: **""The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""**
- The **Baccarat-smoker** drinks **iced-tea**.

#### Clue 13: **""The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.""**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**.

#### Clue 14: **""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**.

### Step 3: Place the information in the grid

1. **Position 1**: From Clue 9, the **German** is in position 1.
   - Since Clue 14 says the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**, the **German** must be next to **coral**, so the **German** cannot like **coral**. We will place **coral** in position 2.

2. **Position 3**: From Clue 8, the person in **position 3** drinks **lemonade**.
   - This person must be the **Italian**, who owns the **goldfish** (Clue 2).
   - Therefore, **position 3**: **Italian**, **goldfish**, **lemonade**.

3. **Position 5**: Clue 7 tells us the **Havana-smoker** likes **chestnut**. We know the **Havana-smoker** must be in **position 5** because positions 1 through 4 are already filled. 
   - Therefore, **position 5**: **Havana**, **chestnut**.

4. **Position 4**: From Clue 3, the person drinking **cola** likes **black**. The only available person to drink **cola** and like **black** is in **position 4**.
   - Therefore, **position 4**: **black**, **cola**.

5. **Position 2**: Since **position 1** is filled by the **German**, and Clue 5 states the person who likes **black** is to the right of **aquamarine**, **position 2** must be where the person likes **aquamarine**.
   - Therefore, **position 2**: **Dutch**, **aquamarine**, **almond-lemonade**.

6. **Position 3**: The person in **position 3** must own a **lizard** based on the remaining pet choices. Therefore:
   - **Position 3**: **Italian**, **goldfish**, **lemonade**, **lizard**.

7. **Position 1**: The **German** in **position 1** cannot have a **lizard** or **goldfish**, and since the **Fonseca-smoker** owns the **bird**, the **German** must own the **bird**.
   - **Position 1**: **German**, **bird**, **hot-chocolate**, **Fonseca**.

8. **Position 5**: The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo** (Clue 13), and the only remaining position for the **Mexican** is position 5.
   - **Position 5**: **Mexican**, **tiparillo**, **chestnut**, **iced-tea**, **mouse**.

### Step 4: Fill in the remaining details

Now that we have filled out most of the table, here’s the final layout:

| Position | 1           | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Color** | aquamarine  | coral         | orange        | black         | chestnut      |
| **Nationality** | German    | Dutch         | Italian       | Malaysian     | Mexican       |
| **Cigar** | Fonseca     | Pall-Mall     | Baccarat      | Havana        | Tiparillo     |
| **Beverage** | hot-chocolate | almond-lemonade | lemonade | cola          | iced-tea      |
| **Pet** | bird        | lizard        | goldfish      | cat           | mouse         |

   - **Position 3**: **Italian**, **goldfish**, **lemonade**, **?**, **?**

3. **Position 5**: The **Mexican** is the **tiparillo-smoker** (Clue 13), and they cannot be in **Position 1** (because the **German** is there), so the **Mexican** must be in **Position 5**. The **Mexican** owns the **mouse** (Clue 11), and drinks **iced-tea** (Clue 12).

   - **Position 4**: **?**, **chestnut**, **?**, **Havana**, **cat**

5. **Position 2**: The **Fonseca-smoker** owns the **bird** (Clue 6), and the only person left in **Position 2** must be the **Fonseca-smoker**. Since **Position 2** already has **coral** as the color, this person must drink **almond-lemonade** and be the **Dutch**.
   - **Position 2**: **Dutch**, **coral**, **almond-lemonade**, **Fonseca**, **bird**

6. **Position 1**: The **Malaysian** is the person who likes **orange** (Clue 1), and since **Position 1** is occupied by the **German**, **Position 1** must be the **Malaysian**. The **Malaysian** must smoke **pall-mall** (since the other cigars are taken) and drink **hot-chocolate**.
   - **Position 1**: **Malaysian**, **orange**, **hot-chocolate**, **Pall-mall**, **lizard**

"	8
Einstein_orig_fonseca:3-1	fonseca:3	"Let's solve this step by step to find the position of **Fonseca**. We'll use the clues to fill in the information about the pets, colors, cigars, beverages, and nationalities.

### Step 1: Set up the 5 positions.
We have 5 positions (1 to 5), with the following categories to assign: colors, nationalities, cigars, pets, and beverages.

### Step 2: Work through the clues

#### Fixed Positions (Clue 8, Clue 9):
- **Clue 8**: The person drinking **lemonade** is in the middle, so **Position 3** must be the person drinking **lemonade**.

| **Position** | **Nationality** | **Color**     | **Cigar**      | **Pet**      | **Beverage**   |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1            | **German**       | **Aquamarine**| **Pall-Mall**  | **Cat**      | **Hot-Chocolate** |
| 2            | **Dutch**        | **Coral**     | **Coral-Master** | **Lizard**  | **Almond-Lemonade** |

### Step 4: Answer
From the table above, we can see that the **Fonseca**-smoker is in **Position 3**.

**fonseca:3**"	"Let's solve this step by step.

We are given a 5x5 grid and need to figure out the correct arrangement of the following:

- **Nationalities**: Malaysian, Italian, Dutch, German, Mexican
- **Colors**: Orange, Black, Aquamarine, Chestnut, Coral
- **Cigars**: Fonseca, Havana, Pall-Mall, Baccarat, Tiparillo
- **Beverages**: Cola, Almond-lemonade, Lemonade, Iced-tea, Hot-chocolate
- **Pets**: Goldfish, Lizard, Cat, Mouse, Bird

### Step 1: Analyze the Clues

#### Clue 1:
- The **Malaysian** is the person who likes **orange**.

#### Clue 2:
- The **Italian** is the owner of the **goldfish**.

#### Clue 3:
- The person drinking **cola** is the person who likes **black**.

#### Clue 4:
- The **Dutch** is the person drinking **almond-lemonade**.

#### Clue 5:
- The person who likes **black** is to the **right** of the person who likes **aquamarine**.

#### Clue 6:
- The **Fonseca**-smoker is the owner of the **bird**.

#### Clue 7:
- The **Havana**-smoker is the person who likes **chestnut**.

#### Clue 8:
- The person drinking **lemonade** is in the middle.

#### Clue 9:
- The **German** is on the far left.

#### Clue 10:
- The **coralmaster**-smoker is on the **left or right** of the owner of the **lizard**.

#### Clue 11:
- The **Havana**-smoker is to the **left or right** of the owner of the **mouse**.

#### Clue 12:
- The **Baccarat**-smoker is the person drinking **iced-tea**.

#### Clue 13:
- The **Mexican** is the **Tiparillo**-smoker.

#### Clue 14:
- The **German** is to the **left or right** of the person who likes **coral**.

### Step 2: Make Initial Deductions

#### Fixed Positions (Clue 8, Clue 9):
- **Position 3** is the person drinking **lemonade** (Clue 8).
- The **German** is on the far left, so **Position 1** is the **German** (Clue 9).

#### From Clue 5:
- The person who likes **black** is to the **right** of the person who likes **aquamarine**. So, the person who likes **aquamarine** must be in **Position 2**, and the person who likes **black** must be in **Position 4** or **Position 5**.

#### From Clue 1:
- The **Malaysian** is the person who likes **orange**, so the **Malaysian** can’t be in **Position 3** (since that person is drinking lemonade). The **Malaysian** must be in **Position 2** or **Position 4**. Since **Position 2** is already taken by the person who likes **aquamarine**, the **Malaysian** must be in **Position 4**.

#### From Clue 3:
- The person drinking **cola** is the person who likes **black**, so **Position 4** or **Position 5** must be the person drinking **cola**. Since **Position 4** is occupied by the **Malaysian** who likes **orange**, the **person in Position 5** must be the one drinking **cola** and liking **black**.

#### From Clue 4:
- The **Dutch** is the person drinking **almond-lemonade**, so the **Dutch** must be in **Position 3** (the only remaining spot for the lemonade drinker).

#### From Clue 6:
- The **Fonseca**-smoker is the owner of the **bird**. This person is likely in **Position 2** (as **Position 2** is the only spot left that is not already occupied by a cigar smoker or a pet owner). So, **Position 2** must be the **Fonseca**-smoker, and their pet is a **bird**.

### Step 3: Fill the Grid

Now we know the following:

| Position | Nationality | Color       | Cigar     | Pet        | Beverage        |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1        | German      | Aquamarine  | Pall-Mall | Cat        | Hot-chocolate   |

#### **Positioning the Mexican (Clue 13)**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**. Since **Position 1** is taken by the **German**, and **Position 5** is taken by the **Italian**, the **Mexican** must be in **Position 3**.

#### **Positioning the Color Preferences (Clue 5)**
- The person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. This means **black** cannot be in **Position 1** (since **German** is there and must like **aquamarine**). Thus, the **German** must like **aquamarine** in **Position 1**. **Black** must be in **Position 2**, and the person who likes **black** drinks **cola** (Clue 3).

#### **Positioning the Pets (Clue 6, 10, 11)**
- The **Fonseca**-smoker owns the **bird**. This must be the **Malaysian** in **Position 4**, as **Malaysian** owns the bird.
- The **Havana**-smoker likes **chestnut** and must be next to the **mouse** (Clue 11). The **Havana**-smoker must be the **Dutch** in **Position 2**, and therefore, the **mouse** must be in **Position 3**.

#### **Positioning the Cigars (Clue 7, 12)**
- The **Havana**-smoker is in **Position 2** and smokes **Havana**.
- The **Baccarat**-smoker drinks **iced-tea** (Clue 12). Since **Position 3** is drinking **lemonade**, the **Baccarat**-smoker must be in **Position 5**, leaving the **Fonseca**-smoker in **Position 4**.

- **Position 1** must be the **German** (Clue 9), and since **Clue 14** says the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**, **Position 2** must be the person who likes **coral**.
  
- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade** (Clue 8), and since the person drinking **cola** is the person who likes **black** (Clue 3), **Position 4** must be the person who likes **black** and drinks **cola**.

| 5   |       |             |          |                |          |

Now, let's use the clues.

### Clue Breakdown:

---

### Solving:

We know the German is in position **1** (Clue 9). Based on Clue 14, the person who likes **coral** must be in position **2** (adjacent to the German). So:

- **Position 1**: **German**, color unknown, cigar unknown, beverage unknown, pet unknown.
- **Position 2**: Person who likes **coral**.

From Clue 8, the person drinking **lemonade** is in position **3**. So:

- **Position 3**: Drinks **lemonade**, person likes **aquamarine** or **chestnut** or **black**.

From Clue 5, the person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**, so **aquamarine** must be in position **2**, and **black** must be in position **4**. Therefore:

- **Position 2**: Likes **aquamarine**.
- **Position 4**: Likes **black**, drinks **cola** (Clue 3).

From Clue 6, the **Fonseca** smoker owns the **bird**. We don't know the exact positions yet, but we can start filling in other details as we move forward.

The **Italian** is the owner of the **goldfish** (Clue 2), so the **Italian** isn't in position 1 or 3 (since position 1 is the **German** and position 3 is already drinking lemonade).

### Final Answer:

After considering all the constraints, the **Malaysian** who likes **orange** must be in **position 5**.

Thus:

**orange:5**."	"Let’s break down the logic puzzle step by step and use the given clues to fill out the table.

We have 5 positions for 5 people, each with a different color, nationality, cigar, beverage, and pet. Our goal is to determine the placement of each person based on the clues, specifically to find the position where **orange** is.

### Initial Setup

- **Position 2**: The person who likes **aquamarine** must be in position 2, because the person who likes **black** must be to the right of them, which would place the person who likes **black** in position 4.

#### Clue 3: **The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.**
- **Position 4**: The person who drinks **cola** must be in position 4 (since they like **black**).

#### Clue 4: **The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.**

#### Clue 6: **The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.**
- The person who smokes **Fonseca** must own the **bird**. This information will come in handy later.

#### Clue 7: **The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.**

#### Clue 11: **The Havana-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse.**
- The **Havana**-smoker must be adjacent to the person who owns the **mouse**.

---

### Solving Step-by-Step:

#### Position 1: **The German** is in position 1 (Clue 9). The German is next to the person who likes **coral** (Clue 14), so the **coral**-liker must be in **position 2**.

#### Position 2: The **Dutch** is in **position 2**, drinks **almond-lemonade** (Clue 4), and likes **aquamarine** (Clue 5). Therefore, **position 2** is **Dutch**, drinks **almond-lemonade**, and likes **aquamarine**.

#### Position 3: The person in **position 3** drinks **lemonade** (Clue 8), and they are the **Italian** (Clue 2). The **Italian** owns the **goldfish**. So, **position 3** is **Italian**, drinks **lemonade**, and owns the **goldfish**.

#### Position 4: The person who likes **black** is in **position 4** (Clue 5) and drinks **cola** (Clue 3). This person smokes **Havana** (Clue 7) and likes **chestnut**.

### **Final Answer:**

**chestnut:5**"	"Let's solve this puzzle step by step and figure out where **chestnut** is located.

### Step 1: Set up the initial grid

We have five people, so let’s create a table with five positions to fill. Each position will have a color, nationality, cigar, beverage, and pet:

| Position | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Color** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Nationality** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Cigar** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Beverage** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Pet** |       |       |       |       |       |

### Step 2: Analyze the clues

#### **Clue 9: ""The German is on the far left.""**
- The **German** must be in **position 1**.

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person drinking **lemonade** is in **position 3**.

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**
- **Aquamarine** must be in **position 2** and **black** in **position 4**.

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person who likes **black** and drinks **cola** must be in **position 4**.

#### **Clue 4: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** is drinking **almond-lemonade**. Since the person in position 3 is drinking lemonade, the **Dutch** must be in **position 2**.

#### **Clue 7: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** likes **chestnut**. This person must be in **position 5**.

#### **Clue 12: ""The baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""**
- The **Baccarat** smoker drinks **iced-tea**. The person in **position 3** is drinking lemonade, so the **Baccarat** smoker must be in **position 5**, but the **Havana-smoker** must also be in **position 5**. This implies that **position 5** has both the **Havana-smoker** and the person drinking iced-tea.

#### **Clue 13: ""The Mexican is the tiparillo-smoker.""**
- The **Mexican** smokes **tiparillo**. This person is in **position 5**.

#### **Clue 14: ""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**.

### Step 3: Fill in the table

We can now use the above clues to fill in the table:

| Position | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4        | 5        |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|

| **Cigar** | Fonseca | Pall-Mall | Baccarat | Havana | Tiparillo |
| **Beverage** | hot-chocolate | almond-lemonade | lemonade | cola | iced-tea |

### **Final Answer:**
**chestnut:5**"	3
Einstein_orig_coral:2-2	coral:2	"Let's work through this puzzle systematically. We need to assign each person to a position and deduce the colors, nationalities, cigars, beverages, and pets they have.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

We have 5 positions to fill. We will work through the clues step by step and use logical deduction.

| Position | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Color** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Nationality** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Cigar** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Beverage** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Pet** |       |       |       |       |       |

### Step 2: Process the clues

#### **Clue 9: ""The German is on the far left.""**
- The **German** must be in **position 1**.

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person in **position 3** must be drinking **lemonade**.

#### **Clue 1: ""The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.""**
- The **Malaysian** must like **orange**, so the **Malaysian** cannot be in position 1 (where the **German** is). We will place the **Malaysian** later.

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person who drinks **cola** must be the person who likes **black**. We can place them later.

#### **Clue 4: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** must be drinking **almond-lemonade**. We know the person in position 3 is drinking **lemonade**, so the **Dutch** must be in position 2 (where the only other beverage option is **almond-lemonade**).

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**
- The person who likes **black** must be to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. Therefore, **aquamarine** must be in **position 2**, and **black** must be in **position 4**. (Note that position 2 is already occupied by the Dutch person drinking **almond-lemonade**, so we will revisit this later).

#### **Clue 6: ""The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.""**
- The **Fonseca-smoker** must own a **bird**. We will place them in the correct position later.

#### **Clue 7: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** must like **chestnut**. We need to place them correctly.

#### **Clue 12: ""The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""**
- The **Baccarat-smoker** drinks **iced-tea**. We will figure out where this person belongs.

#### **Clue 13: ""The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.""**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**. We can figure out where the **Mexican** belongs later.

#### **Clue 14: ""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**. This gives us a hint about where **coral** must be placed.

### Step 3: Deduce positions and complete the table

Using the clues systematically:

- **Position 1:** The **German** must be on the far left. The **German** must like **aquamarine** (since the person to the right of them likes black, and **black** is in position 4).
- **Position 2:** The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade** and likes **coral** (from Clue 14, as the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**).
- **Position 3:** The person in the middle drinks **lemonade**. This person must be the **Italian**, and the Italian owns the **goldfish** (from Clue 2).
- **Position 4:** The person drinking **cola** likes **black** (from Clue 3). This person smokes **Pall-Mall**, owns a **cat**, and must be the **Malaysian** (from Clue 1, as the **Malaysian** likes **orange**, but we place them last).
- **Position 5:** The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**, drinks **iced-tea**, and likes **chestnut** (from Clue 7).

Now let’s fill in the complete table:

| Position | 1          | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             |

| **Cigar** | Fonseca    | Pall-Mall     | Baccarat      | Havana        | Tiparillo     |
| **Beverage** | hot-chocolate | almond-lemonade | lemonade | cola          | iced-tea      |
| **Pet** | bird       | goldfish      | lizard        | cat           | mouse         |

   - **Position 3**: **Italian**, **goldfish**, **lemonade**.

3. **Position 5**: The **Mexican** is the **tiparillo-smoker** (Clue 13). The **Mexican** must be in **Position 5**.

8. **Position 3**: The **Coralmaster-smoker** is next to the owner of the **lizard** (Clue 10). Since **Position 2** likes **coral**, the person in **Position 3** must smoke **Pall-mall** and own the **lizard**.
   - **Position 3**: **Italian**, **Pall-mall**, **goldfish**, **lemonade**, **lizard**.

9. **Position 5**: The **Baccarat-smoker** drinks **iced-tea** (Clue 12). Since the **Mexican** is in **Position 5**, they must smoke **Baccarat** and drink **iced-tea**.
   - **Position 5**: **Mexican**, **Baccarat**, **tiparillo**, **iced-tea**, **mouse**.

### Step 4: Final Grid

  - The **German** must be in **Position 1**. We don't know their color, beverage, or pet yet.
  
- **Position 3**: The person drinking **lemonade** is in the middle (Clue 8).  
  - This person must be in **Position 3** and drinking **lemonade**.

#### **Position 3 (Black)**:
- The person in **Position 3** likes **black** and drinks **cola**.
- The **Havana** smoker likes **chestnut** (Clue 7), and they must be the person in **Position 5**.

### Step 3: Start placing the information

- **Position 1** must be the **German** (Clue 9), and since **Clue 14** says the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**, **Position 2** must be the person who likes **coral**.
  
- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade** (Clue 8), and since the person drinking **cola** is the person who likes **black** (Clue 3), **Position 4** must be the person who likes **black** and drinks **cola**.

- **Position 5** must be the **Malaysian**, as the **Malaysian** is the person who likes **orange** (Clue 1).

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker who likes **chestnut** (Clue 7). This means **Position 4** likes **chestnut** and smokes **Havana**.

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and must be the **Dutch** (Clue 4). The **Dutch** also smokes **Fonseca** and owns the **bird** (Clue 6).

- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade**, so this person must be the **Italian**, who owns the **goldfish** (Clue 2).

- **Position 5** drinks **hot-chocolate** because **Position 4** is already assigned **iced-tea** (Clue 12).

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and is assigned **Fonseca** (Clue 6).

- **Position 1** must be the **German** and the **German** is next to the person who owns the **lizard** (Clue 10). Thus, **Position 1** has **aquamarine** as the color (Clue 5), and **Position 2** must own the **lizard**.

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker and must be next to the person who owns the **mouse** (Clue 11). So, **Position 5** owns the **mouse**.

- **Position 1** must be the **German** (Clue 9). From Clue 14, we know the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**, so **Position 2** must be the person who likes **coral**.

- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade** (Clue 8), so **Position 3** must be the person who drinks **lemonade**. This person also cannot be the **German** or the **Malaysian** (as those are already assigned), so this person must be the **Italian**, who owns the **goldfish** (Clue 2).

- **Position 5** must be the **Malaysian**, who likes **orange** (Clue 1). This person must be the **Tiparillo** smoker (Clue 13).

- The **German** must be in **position 1**.

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person drinking **lemonade** is in **position 3**.

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person in **position 4** drinks **cola** and likes **black**.

#### **Clue 4: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade**, which means the **Dutch** is in **position 2** and drinks **almond-lemonade**.

#### **Clue 7: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana** smoker likes **chestnut**. Therefore, the **Havana** smoker must be in **position 5**.

#### **Clue 14: ""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- Since the **German** is in **position 1**, the person who likes **coral** must be in **position 2**.

### **Final Answer:**

**chestnut:5**"		3
Einstein_orig_coral:2-3	coral:2	"Let's work through this puzzle systematically. We need to assign each person to a position and deduce the colors, nationalities, cigars, beverages, and pets they have.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

We have 5 positions to fill. We will work through the clues step by step and use logical deduction.

| Position | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Color** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Nationality** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Cigar** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Beverage** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Pet** |       |       |       |       |       |

### Step 2: Process the clues

#### **Clue 9: ""The German is on the far left.""**
- The **German** must be in **position 1**.

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person in **position 3** must be drinking **lemonade**.

#### **Clue 1: ""The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.""**
- The **Malaysian** must like **orange**, so the **Malaysian** cannot be in position 1 (where the **German** is). We will place the **Malaysian** later.

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person who drinks **cola** must be the person who likes **black**. We can place them later.

#### **Clue 4: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** must be drinking **almond-lemonade**. We know the person in position 3 is drinking **lemonade**, so the **Dutch** must be in position 2 (where the only other beverage option is **almond-lemonade**).

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**
- The person who likes **black** must be to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. Therefore, **aquamarine** must be in **position 2**, and **black** must be in **position 4**. (Note that position 2 is already occupied by the Dutch person drinking **almond-lemonade**, so we will revisit this later).

#### **Clue 6: ""The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.""**
- The **Fonseca-smoker** must own a **bird**. We will place them in the correct position later.

#### **Clue 7: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** must like **chestnut**. We need to place them correctly.

#### **Clue 12: ""The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""**
- The **Baccarat-smoker** drinks **iced-tea**. We will figure out where this person belongs.

#### **Clue 13: ""The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.""**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**. We can figure out where the **Mexican** belongs later.

#### **Clue 14: ""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**. This gives us a hint about where **coral** must be placed.

### Step 3: Deduce positions and complete the table

Using the clues systematically:

- **Position 1:** The **German** must be on the far left. The **German** must like **aquamarine** (since the person to the right of them likes black, and **black** is in position 4).
- **Position 2:** The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade** and likes **coral** (from Clue 14, as the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**).
- **Position 3:** The person in the middle drinks **lemonade**. This person must be the **Italian**, and the Italian owns the **goldfish** (from Clue 2).
- **Position 4:** The person drinking **cola** likes **black** (from Clue 3). This person smokes **Pall-Mall**, owns a **cat**, and must be the **Malaysian** (from Clue 1, as the **Malaysian** likes **orange**, but we place them last).
- **Position 5:** The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**, drinks **iced-tea**, and likes **chestnut** (from Clue 7).

Now let’s fill in the complete table:

| Position | 1          | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Color** | aquamarine | coral         | orange        | black         | chestnut      |
| **Nationality** | German    | Dutch         | Italian       | Malaysian     | Mexican       |
| **Cigar** | Fonseca    | Pall-Mall     | Baccarat      | Havana        | Tiparillo     |
| **Beverage** | hot-chocolate | almond-lemonade | lemonade | cola          | iced-tea      |
| **Pet** | bird       | goldfish      | lizard        | cat           | mouse         |

2. **The person drinking lemonade is in the middle** (Clue 8), so **Position 3** drinks **lemonade**.

3. **The Malaysian is the person who likes orange** (Clue 1). Since **Position 3** is already drinking lemonade, the **Malaysian** must be in **Position 5**, and **Position 5** likes **orange**.

4. **The Italian is the owner of the goldfish** (Clue 2). So, the **Italian** must be in **Position 4**, and their pet is the **goldfish**.

5. **The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade** (Clue 4). The **Dutch** must be in **Position 2**, drinking **almond-lemonade**.

6. **The person drinking cola is the person who likes black** (Clue 3). The person who likes **black** must be in **Position 2** (since **Position 1** is occupied by the **German**, and **Position 3** is already drinking lemonade). Therefore, **Position 2** likes **black**.

    - The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**.

---

### Step 3: Start placing the information

- **Position 1** must be the **German** (Clue 9), and since **Clue 14** says the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**, **Position 2** must be the person who likes **coral**.
  
- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade** (Clue 8), and since the person drinking **cola** is the person who likes **black** (Clue 3), **Position 4** must be the person who likes **black** and drinks **cola**.

- **Position 5** must be the **Malaysian**, as the **Malaysian** is the person who likes **orange** (Clue 1).

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker who likes **chestnut** (Clue 7). This means **Position 4** likes **chestnut** and smokes **Havana**.

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and must be the **Dutch** (Clue 4). The **Dutch** also smokes **Fonseca** and owns the **bird** (Clue 6).

- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade**, so this person must be the **Italian**, who owns the **goldfish** (Clue 2).

- **Position 5** drinks **hot-chocolate** because **Position 4** is already assigned **iced-tea** (Clue 12).

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and is assigned **Fonseca** (Clue 6).

- **Position 1** must be the **German** and the **German** is next to the person who owns the **lizard** (Clue 10). Thus, **Position 1** has **aquamarine** as the color (Clue 5), and **Position 2** must own the **lizard**.

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker and must be next to the person who owns the **mouse** (Clue 11). So, **Position 5** owns the **mouse**.
