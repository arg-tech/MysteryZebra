---

### Solving:

We know the German is in position **1** (Clue 9). Based on Clue 14, the person who likes **coral** must be in position **2** (adjacent to the German). So:

- **Position 1**: **German**, color unknown, cigar unknown, beverage unknown, pet unknown.
- **Position 2**: Person who likes **coral**.

From Clue 8, the person drinking **lemonade** is in position **3**. So:

- **Position 3**: Drinks **lemonade**, person likes **aquamarine** or **chestnut** or **black**.

From Clue 5, the person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**, so **aquamarine** must be in position **2**, and **black** must be in position **4**. Therefore:

- **Position 2**: Likes **aquamarine**.
- **Position 4**: Likes **black**, drinks **cola** (Clue 3).

From Clue 6, the **Fonseca** smoker owns the **bird**. We don't know the exact positions yet, but we can start filling in other details as we move forward.

The **Italian** is the owner of the **goldfish** (Clue 2), so the **Italian** isn't in position 1 or 3 (since position 1 is the **German** and position 3 is already drinking lemonade).

### **Final Answer:**

**chestnut:5**"	chestnut:1
Einstein_orig_coral:2-1	coral	2	"Let's work through this puzzle systematically. We need to assign each person to a position and deduce the colors, nationalities, cigars, beverages, and pets they have.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

We have 5 positions to fill. We will work through the clues step by step and use logical deduction.

| Position | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Color** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Nationality** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Cigar** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Beverage** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Pet** |       |       |       |       |       |

### Step 2: Process the clues

#### **Clue 9: ""The German is on the far left.""**
- The **German** must be in **position 1**.

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person in **position 3** must be drinking **lemonade**.

#### **Clue 1: ""The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.""**
- The **Malaysian** must like **orange**, so the **Malaysian** cannot be in position 1 (where the **German** is). We will place the **Malaysian** later.

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person who drinks **cola** must be the person who likes **black**. We can place them later.

#### **Clue 4: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** must be drinking **almond-lemonade**. We know the person in position 3 is drinking **lemonade**, so the **Dutch** must be in position 2 (where the only other beverage option is **almond-lemonade**).

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**
- The person who likes **black** must be to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. Therefore, **aquamarine** must be in **position 2**, and **black** must be in **position 4**. (Note that position 2 is already occupied by the Dutch person drinking **almond-lemonade**, so we will revisit this later).

#### **Clue 6: ""The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.""**
- The **Fonseca-smoker** must own a **bird**. We will place them in the correct position later.

#### **Clue 7: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** must like **chestnut**. We need to place them correctly.

#### **Clue 12: ""The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""**
- The **Baccarat-smoker** drinks **iced-tea**. We will figure out where this person belongs.

#### **Clue 13: ""The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.""**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**. We can figure out where the **Mexican** belongs later.

#### **Clue 14: ""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**. This gives us a hint about where **coral** must be placed.

### Step 3: Deduce positions and complete the table

Using the clues systematically:

- **Position 1:** The **German** must be on the far left. The **German** must like **aquamarine** (since the person to the right of them likes black, and **black** is in position 4).
- **Position 2:** The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade** and likes **coral** (from Clue 14, as the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**).
- **Position 3:** The person in the middle drinks **lemonade**. This person must be the **Italian**, and the Italian owns the **goldfish** (from Clue 2).
- **Position 4:** The person drinking **cola** likes **black** (from Clue 3). This person smokes **Pall-Mall**, owns a **cat**, and must be the **Malaysian** (from Clue 1, as the **Malaysian** likes **orange**, but we place them last).
- **Position 5:** The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**, drinks **iced-tea**, and likes **chestnut** (from Clue 7).

Now let’s fill in the complete table:

| Position | 1          | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Color** | aquamarine | coral         | orange        | black         | chestnut      |
| **Nationality** | German    | Dutch         | Italian       | Malaysian     | Mexican       |
| **Cigar** | Fonseca    | Pall-Mall     | Baccarat      | Havana        | Tiparillo     |
| **Beverage** | hot-chocolate | almond-lemonade | lemonade | cola          | iced-tea      |
| **Pet** | bird       | goldfish      | lizard        | cat           | mouse         |

### Step 3: Start placing the information

- **Position 1** must be the **German** (Clue 9), and since **Clue 14** says the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**, **Position 2** must be the person who likes **coral**.
  
- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade** (Clue 8), and since the person drinking **cola** is the person who likes **black** (Clue 3), **Position 4** must be the person who likes **black** and drinks **cola**.

- **Position 5** must be the **Malaysian**, as the **Malaysian** is the person who likes **orange** (Clue 1).

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker who likes **chestnut** (Clue 7). This means **Position 4** likes **chestnut** and smokes **Havana**.

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and must be the **Dutch** (Clue 4). The **Dutch** also smokes **Fonseca** and owns the **bird** (Clue 6).

- **Position 5** drinks **hot-chocolate** because **Position 4** is already assigned **iced-tea** (Clue 12).

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and is assigned **Fonseca** (Clue 6).

- **Position 1** must be the **German** and the **German** is next to the person who owns the **lizard** (Clue 10). Thus, **Position 1** has **aquamarine** as the color (Clue 5), and **Position 2** must own the **lizard**.

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker and must be next to the person who owns the **mouse** (Clue 11). So, **Position 5** owns the **mouse**.

    - The **Baccarat-smoker** drinks **iced-tea**.

13. **The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.**
    - The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**.

14. **The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.**
    - The **German** is adjacent to the person who likes **coral**.

---

### Solving:

We know the German is in position **1** (Clue 9). Based on Clue 14, the person who likes **coral** must be in position **2** (adjacent to the German). So:

- **Position 1**: **German**, color unknown, cigar unknown, beverage unknown, pet unknown.
- **Position 2**: Person who likes **coral**.

From Clue 8, the person drinking **lemonade** is in position **3**. So:

- **Position 3**: Drinks **lemonade**, person likes **aquamarine** or **chestnut** or **black**.

From Clue 5, the person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**, so **aquamarine** must be in position **2**, and **black** must be in position **4**. Therefore:

- **Position 2**: Likes **aquamarine**.
- **Position 4**: Likes **black**, drinks **cola** (Clue 3).

From Clue 6, the **Fonseca** smoker owns the **bird**. We don't know the exact positions yet, but we can start filling in other details as we move forward.

The **Italian** is the owner of the **goldfish** (Clue 2), so the **Italian** isn't in position 1 or 3 (since position 1 is the **German** and position 3 is already drinking lemonade).

### **Final Answer:**

**chestnut:5**"	chestnut:1
Einstein_orig_coral:2-2	coral	2	"Let's work through this puzzle systematically. We need to assign each person to a position and deduce the colors, nationalities, cigars, beverages, and pets they have.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

We have 5 positions to fill. We will work through the clues step by step and use logical deduction.

| Position | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Color** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Nationality** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Cigar** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Beverage** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Pet** |       |       |       |       |       |

### Step 2: Process the clues

#### **Clue 9: ""The German is on the far left.""**
- The **German** must be in **position 1**.

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person in **position 3** must be drinking **lemonade**.

#### **Clue 1: ""The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.""**
- The **Malaysian** must like **orange**, so the **Malaysian** cannot be in position 1 (where the **German** is). We will place the **Malaysian** later.

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person who drinks **cola** must be the person who likes **black**. We can place them later.

#### **Clue 4: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** must be drinking **almond-lemonade**. We know the person in position 3 is drinking **lemonade**, so the **Dutch** must be in position 2 (where the only other beverage option is **almond-lemonade**).

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**
- The person who likes **black** must be to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. Therefore, **aquamarine** must be in **position 2**, and **black** must be in **position 4**. (Note that position 2 is already occupied by the Dutch person drinking **almond-lemonade**, so we will revisit this later).

#### **Clue 6: ""The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.""**
- The **Fonseca-smoker** must own a **bird**. We will place them in the correct position later.

#### **Clue 7: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** must like **chestnut**. We need to place them correctly.

#### **Clue 12: ""The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""**
- The **Baccarat-smoker** drinks **iced-tea**. We will figure out where this person belongs.

#### **Clue 13: ""The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.""**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**. We can figure out where the **Mexican** belongs later.

#### **Clue 14: ""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**. This gives us a hint about where **coral** must be placed.

### Step 3: Deduce positions and complete the table

Using the clues systematically:

- **Position 1:** The **German** must be on the far left. The **German** must like **aquamarine** (since the person to the right of them likes black, and **black** is in position 4).
- **Position 2:** The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade** and likes **coral** (from Clue 14, as the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**).
- **Position 3:** The person in the middle drinks **lemonade**. This person must be the **Italian**, and the Italian owns the **goldfish** (from Clue 2).
- **Position 4:** The person drinking **cola** likes **black** (from Clue 3). This person smokes **Pall-Mall**, owns a **cat**, and must be the **Malaysian** (from Clue 1, as the **Malaysian** likes **orange**, but we place them last).
- **Position 5:** The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**, drinks **iced-tea**, and likes **chestnut** (from Clue 7).

Now let’s fill in the complete table:

| Position | 1          | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Color** | aquamarine | coral         | orange        | black         | chestnut      |
| **Nationality** | German    | Dutch         | Italian       | Malaysian     | Mexican       |
| **Cigar** | Fonseca    | Pall-Mall     | Baccarat      | Havana        | Tiparillo     |
| **Beverage** | hot-chocolate | almond-lemonade | lemonade | cola          | iced-tea      |
| **Pet** | bird       | goldfish      | lizard        | cat           | mouse         |

- **Position 1** must be the **German** (Clue 9), and since **Clue 14** says the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**, **Position 2** must be the person who likes **coral**.
  
- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade** (Clue 8), and since the person drinking **cola** is the person who likes **black** (Clue 3), **Position 4** must be the person who likes **black** and drinks **cola**.

- **Position 5** must be the **Malaysian**, as the **Malaysian** is the person who likes **orange** (Clue 1).

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker who likes **chestnut** (Clue 7). This means **Position 4** likes **chestnut** and smokes **Havana**.

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and must be the **Dutch** (Clue 4). The **Dutch** also smokes **Fonseca** and owns the **bird** (Clue 6).

- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade**, so this person must be the **Italian**, who owns the **goldfish** (Clue 2).

- **Position 5** drinks **hot-chocolate** because **Position 4** is already assigned **iced-tea** (Clue 12).

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and is assigned **Fonseca** (Clue 6).

- **Position 1** must be the **German** and the **German** is next to the person who owns the **lizard** (Clue 10). Thus, **Position 1** has **aquamarine** as the color (Clue 5), and **Position 2** must own the **lizard**.

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker and must be next to the person who owns the **mouse** (Clue 11). So, **Position 5** owns the **mouse**.

We know the German is in position **1** (Clue 9). Based on Clue 14, the person who likes **coral** must be in position **2** (adjacent to the German). So:

- **Position 1**: **German**, color unknown, cigar unknown, beverage unknown, pet unknown.
- **Position 2**: Person who likes **coral**.

From Clue 8, the person drinking **lemonade** is in position **3**. So:

- **Position 3**: Drinks **lemonade**, person likes **aquamarine** or **chestnut** or **black**.

From Clue 5, the person who likes **black** is to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**, so **aquamarine** must be in position **2**, and **black** must be in position **4**. Therefore:

- **Position 2**: Likes **aquamarine**.
- **Position 4**: Likes **black**, drinks **cola** (Clue 3).

From Clue 6, the **Fonseca** smoker owns the **bird**. We don't know the exact positions yet, but we can start filling in other details as we move forward.

The **Italian** is the owner of the **goldfish** (Clue 2), so the **Italian** isn't in position 1 or 3 (since position 1 is the **German** and position 3 is already drinking lemonade).

### **Final Answer:**

**chestnut:5**"	chestnut:1
Einstein_orig_coral:2-3	coral	4	"Let's work through this puzzle systematically. We need to assign each person to a position and deduce the colors, nationalities, cigars, beverages, and pets they have.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

We have 5 positions to fill. We will work through the clues step by step and use logical deduction.

| Position | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Color** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Nationality** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Cigar** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Beverage** |       |       |       |       |       |
| **Pet** |       |       |       |       |       |

### Step 2: Process the clues

#### **Clue 9: ""The German is on the far left.""**
- The **German** must be in **position 1**.

#### **Clue 8: ""The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.""**
- The person in **position 3** must be drinking **lemonade**.

#### **Clue 1: ""The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.""**
- The **Malaysian** must like **orange**, so the **Malaysian** cannot be in position 1 (where the **German** is). We will place the **Malaysian** later.

#### **Clue 3: ""The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.""**
- The person who drinks **cola** must be the person who likes **black**. We can place them later.

#### **Clue 4: ""The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.""**
- The **Dutch** must be drinking **almond-lemonade**. We know the person in position 3 is drinking **lemonade**, so the **Dutch** must be in position 2 (where the only other beverage option is **almond-lemonade**).

#### **Clue 5: ""The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.""**
- The person who likes **black** must be to the right of the person who likes **aquamarine**. Therefore, **aquamarine** must be in **position 2**, and **black** must be in **position 4**. (Note that position 2 is already occupied by the Dutch person drinking **almond-lemonade**, so we will revisit this later).

#### **Clue 6: ""The Fonseca-smoker is the owner of the bird.""**
- The **Fonseca-smoker** must own a **bird**. We will place them in the correct position later.

#### **Clue 7: ""The Havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.""**
- The **Havana-smoker** must like **chestnut**. We need to place them correctly.

#### **Clue 12: ""The Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.""**
- The **Baccarat-smoker** drinks **iced-tea**. We will figure out where this person belongs.

#### **Clue 13: ""The Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.""**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**. We can figure out where the **Mexican** belongs later.

#### **Clue 14: ""The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.""**
- The **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**. This gives us a hint about where **coral** must be placed.

### Step 3: Deduce positions and complete the table

Using the clues systematically:

- **Position 1:** The **German** must be on the far left. The **German** must like **aquamarine** (since the person to the right of them likes black, and **black** is in position 4).
- **Position 2:** The **Dutch** drinks **almond-lemonade** and likes **coral** (from Clue 14, as the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**).
- **Position 3:** The person in the middle drinks **lemonade**. This person must be the **Italian**, and the Italian owns the **goldfish** (from Clue 2).
- **Position 4:** The person drinking **cola** likes **black** (from Clue 3). This person smokes **Pall-Mall**, owns a **cat**, and must be the **Malaysian** (from Clue 1, as the **Malaysian** likes **orange**, but we place them last).
- **Position 5:** The **Mexican** smokes **Tiparillo**, drinks **iced-tea**, and likes **chestnut** (from Clue 7).

Now let’s fill in the complete table:

| Position | 1          | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Color** | aquamarine | coral         | orange        | black         | chestnut      |
| **Nationality** | German    | Dutch         | Italian       | Malaysian     | Mexican       |
| **Cigar** | Fonseca    | Pall-Mall     | Baccarat      | Havana        | Tiparillo     |
| **Beverage** | hot-chocolate | almond-lemonade | lemonade | cola          | iced-tea      |
| **Pet** | bird       | goldfish      | lizard        | cat           | mouse         |

### Step 3: Deduce the Positions

- The **German** must be next to the person who likes **coral** (Clue 14), so the person in **Position 2** likes **coral**.
- The **German** cannot own the **goldfish**, so they must own either a **cat** or a **mouse**. Since the **mouse** is owned by the **Havana** smoker (Clue 11), the **German** owns the **cat**.
- The **German** drinks **hot-chocolate** (since they can’t drink **cola** or **lemonade**).

#### **Position 2: Dutch**

- The **Malaysian** drinks **iced-tea** (since the **Baccarat** smoker drinks iced-tea — Clue 12).

#### **Position 5: Mexican**
- The **Mexican** smokes **Havana** (Clue 7) and likes **chestnut**.
- The **Mexican** must own the **mouse** (since the **Havana** smoker is next to the owner of the mouse — Clue 11).
- The **Mexican** drinks **cola** (since they can’t drink **almond-lemonade** or **lemonade**).

### Step 3: Start placing the information

- **Position 1** must be the **German** (Clue 9), and since **Clue 14** says the **German** is next to the person who likes **coral**, **Position 2** must be the person who likes **coral**.
  
- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade** (Clue 8), and since the person drinking **cola** is the person who likes **black** (Clue 3), **Position 4** must be the person who likes **black** and drinks **cola**.

- **Position 5** must be the **Malaysian**, as the **Malaysian** is the person who likes **orange** (Clue 1).

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker who likes **chestnut** (Clue 7). This means **Position 4** likes **chestnut** and smokes **Havana**.

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and must be the **Dutch** (Clue 4). The **Dutch** also smokes **Fonseca** and owns the **bird** (Clue 6).

- **Position 3** drinks **lemonade**, so this person must be the **Italian**, who owns the **goldfish** (Clue 2).

- **Position 5** drinks **hot-chocolate** because **Position 4** is already assigned **iced-tea** (Clue 12).

- **Position 2** drinks **almond-lemonade** and is assigned **Fonseca** (Clue 6).

- **Position 1** must be the **German** and the **German** is next to the person who owns the **lizard** (Clue 10). Thus, **Position 1** has **aquamarine** as the color (Clue 5), and **Position 2** must own the **lizard**.

- **Position 4** is the **Havana** smoker and must be next to the person who owns the **mouse** (Clue 11). So, **Position 5** owns the **mouse**.
