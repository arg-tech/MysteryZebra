### **Step 1: Create a Table**
We set up a table to track our progress.

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage     | Cigar   | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?         | ?           | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | Grey      | 7up         | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?         | Mirinda     | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | Aquamarine| ?           | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?         | ?           | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Step 2: Apply Given Clues**
1. **Clue 9: The Dutch is on the far left**  
   - Dutch is in **Position 1**.

2. **Clue 4: The person who likes Grey is on the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**  
   - If **Aquamarine is Position 4**, then **Grey must be Position 2**.

3. **Clue 5: The person who likes Grey drinks 7up**  
   - Position **2** drinks **7up**.

4. **Clue 8: The person drinking Mirinda is in the middle**  
   - Position **3** drinks **Mirinda**.

5. **Clue 1: The Japanese is the person who likes Black**  
   - This means **Black belongs to the Japanese person**.

---

### **Step 3: Identify Position of Black**
Since we already know:
- **Grey is Position 2**
- **Aquamarine is Position 4**
- **There are only five colors (Chestnut, Grey, Black, Aquamarine, Azure)**  
- **Grey (2) and Aquamarine (4) are set, so Black must be in either 1, 3, or 5**

We also know:
- **The person drinking Mirinda is in Position 3.**
- **Black belongs to the Japanese (Clue 1).**

Now, let’s check nationalities:
- **Clue 9: Dutch is in Position 1.**
- **Clue 3: Australian drinks Almond Milk, so not Position 3.**
- **Clue 8: Position 3 drinks Mirinda, so not Australian.**
- **Clue 13: French smokes Havana.**
- **Clue 2: Spanish owns Guinea Pig.**

From these, the **Japanese person must be in Position 5** (as it is the only spot left).

---

### **Final Answer**
Since **Japanese likes Black and is in Position 5**:

**black:5**"	black:3	black:5	True	False
Einstein_orig_aquamarine-1	aquamarine	3	"We will solve this step by step using logical deduction.

---

### **Step 1: Organizing the Information**
We have five categories, each with five different values:

| Position | Nationality | Color  | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?      | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Step 2: Assigning What We Know**
1. **(9)** The Dutch is in position **1**.
2. **(8)** The person drinking **Mirinda is in the middle**, so **position 3**.
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black**, so **Japanese = Black**.
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**.
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk**.
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The Dutch is next to the person who likes **Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

After assigning **Chestnut in position 2**, and knowing **Grey is to the left of Aquamarine**, the only possible placement for these two is:
- Grey must be in **Position 3**.
- Aquamarine must be in **Position 4**.

---

### **Step 3: Verifying**
Now, we can confirm:
- **Position 3**: Drinks **Mirinda** and likes **Grey**.
- **Position 4**: Likes **Aquamarine**.

**Final Answer:**
**aquamarine:4**"	aquamarine:5	aquamarine:4	True	False
Einstein_orig_azure-1	azure	4	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Organizing the Information**
We need to assign five attributes (**Nationality, Color, Beverage, Cigar, and Pet**) to **five positions (1 to 5)**.

| Position | Nationality | Color  | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?      | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Step 2: Assigning What We Know**
1. **(9)** The Dutch is in **position 1**.
2. **(8)** The person drinking **Mirinda is in position 3**.
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black**, so **Japanese = Black**.
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**.
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk**.
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The Dutch is next to the person who likes **Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

From clues **(4) and (5)**:
- **Grey drinks 7up**.
- **Grey is left of Aquamarine**.
- Since **Mirinda is in position 3**, and **Grey must drink 7up**, then **Grey must be in position 2**.
- **Aquamarine must be in position 4**.

Now we update the table:

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | Chestnut  | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | Grey      | 7up        | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | Aquamarine | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | Japanese   | Black     | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?         | ?          | ?       | ?          |

From **(7)**: ""The person who likes **Azure** is the Game-smoker.""

- The only color left unassigned is **Azure**.
- **Position 5 must be Azure**.

Thus, **Azure is in position 5**.

---

### **Final Answer:**
**azure:5**"	azure:1	azure:5	True	False
Einstein_orig_japanese-1	japanese	4	"Let's systematically solve the puzzle.

---

### **Step 1: Organizing the Information**
We have 5 people and need to assign **Nationality, Color, Beverage, Cigar, and Pet** to positions **1 to 5**.

| Position | Nationality | Color  | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?      | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Step 2: Assigning Known Information**
1. **(9)** The Dutch is in **position 1**.
2. **(8)** The person drinking **Mirinda is in position 3**.
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black**, so **Japanese = Black**.
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**.
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk**.
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The Dutch is next to the person who likes **Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

From **(4) and (5)**:
- **Grey drinks 7up**.
- **Grey is left of Aquamarine**.
- Since **Mirinda is in position 3**, and **Grey must drink 7up**, then **Grey must be in position 2**.
- **Aquamarine must be in position 4**.

Updating our table:

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | Chestnut  | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | Grey      | 7up        | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | Aquamarine | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | Japanese   | Black     | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?         | ?          | ?       | ?          |

Since the only remaining color is **Azure**, **Position 5 must be Azure**.

From clue **(3)**, the **Australian drinks Almond-milk**, so **Australian is in position 5**.

From clue **(2)**, the **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**. Since the only open position for Spanish is **position 3**, **Spanish must be in position 3**.

Now, we also know:
- **The only remaining nationality is French**, which must be in **position 2**.

Updating the table:

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | Chestnut  | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | French     | Grey      | 7up        | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | Spanish    | Aquamarine | Mirinda    | ?       | Guinea Pig |
| 4        | Japanese   | Black     | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | Australian | Azure     | Almond-milk | ?       | ?          |

Thus, **the Japanese is in position 4**.

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Grid**
There are **5 positions (1 to 5)**, each having:
- A **Nationality**
- A **Favorite Color**
- A **Favorite Beverage**
- A **Cigar Brand**
- A **Pet**

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage    | Cigar     | Pet         |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?         | ?          | ?         | ?          |

### **Step 2: Filling in Given Clues**
1. **(9)** The **Dutch is in position 1**.
2. **(8)** The **person drinking Mirinda is in position 3**.
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black**.
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**.
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk**.
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The **Dutch is next to the person who likes Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

From **(4) and (5)**:
- **Grey drinks 7up**.
- **Grey is left of Aquamarine**.
- Since **Mirinda is in position 3**, and **Grey must drink 7up**, then **Grey must be in position 2**.
- **Aquamarine must be in position 4**.

Updating the table:

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage    | Cigar     | Pet         |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | Chestnut  | ?          | ?         | ?          |
| 2        | French     | Grey      | 7up        | ?         | ?          |
| 3        | Spanish    | Aquamarine | Mirinda    | ?         | Guinea Pig |

**Final Answer:**  
**spanish:4**"	spanish:5	spanish:4	True	False
Einstein_orig_fanta-1	fanta	6	"Let's go through the clues one by one and systematically solve the puzzle.

### Clues:
1. The **Japanese** is the person who likes **black**.
2. The **Spanish** is the owner of the **guinea-pig**.
3. The **Australian** is the person drinking **almond-milk**.
4. The person who likes **grey** is on the left of the person who likes **aquamarine**.
5. The person who likes **grey** is the person drinking **7up**.
6. The **baccarat-smoker** is the owner of the **chinchilla**.
7. The person who likes **azure** is the **game-smoker**.
8. The person drinking **mirinda** is in the middle.
9. The **Dutch** is on the far left.
10. The **chaman-smoker** is on the left or right of the owner of the **ferret**.
11. The owner of the **turtles** is on the left or right of the **game-smoker**.
12. The **davidoff-smoker** is the person drinking **fanta**.
13. The **French** is the **havana-smoker**.
14. The **Dutch** is on the left or right of the person who likes **chestnut**.
15. The **chaman-smoker** is on the left or right of the person drinking **hot-chocolate**.

---

### Solution Process:

1. We know **5 people** are placed in a sequence of 5 positions, numbered 1 to 5. The **Dutch** is on the far left, so they must be in position 1.
2. The person drinking **mirinda** is in the middle, which means the person in position 3 is drinking **mirinda**.
3. The **Japanese** likes **black**, so the person who likes **black** is not the one in position 3 (who drinks **mirinda**), but it can be in position 2, 4, or 5.
4. The **Spanish** owns the **guinea-pig**, which eliminates them from the **baccarat-smoker** or **game-smoker** clues since those require specific pets.
5. The **person who likes grey** is to the left of the **person who likes aquamarine**, and the person who likes **grey** drinks **7up**. So, we can place **grey** in position 2, and **aquamarine** in position 3 (since **mirinda** is already being drunk there).
6. The **baccarat-smoker** owns the **chinchilla**, and based on the placement so far, this fits with the person in position 5. So, **position 5** smokes **baccarat** and owns the **chinchilla**.
7. The **game-smoker** likes **azure**, and since **position 3** is drinking **mirinda** and **position 5** owns the **chinchilla**, **position 4** is the **game-smoker** who likes **azure**.
8. The **person drinking **almond-milk** is **Australian**, so the **Australian** must be in **position 2**, drinking **almond-milk**.
9. We now know the **davidoff-smoker** is the person drinking **fanta**. This person must be in **position 1**, as they are the only one left who can have **fanta**.
10. Finally, **French** is the **havana-smoker**, meaning they must be in **position 4**.

---

### Final Solution:
- Position 1: **Dutch**, drinks **fanta**, smokes **davidoff**, pet is **turtle**, likes **chestnut**.
- Position 2: **Australian**, drinks **almond-milk**, smokes **chaman**, pet is **lizard**, likes **grey**.
- Position 3: **Spanish**, drinks **mirinda**, smokes **game**, pet is **guinea-pig**, likes **aquamarine**.
- Position 4: **French**, drinks **7up**, smokes **havana**, pet is **chinchilla**, likes **azure**.
- Position 5: **Japanese**, drinks **hot-chocolate**, smokes **baccarat**, pet is **ferret**, likes **black**.

From **Clue 12**, **Davidoff smoker drinks Fanta**.
- We still need to determine where Fanta is.

From **Clue 15**, **Chaman smoker is left/right of the Hot-chocolate drinker**.
- This helps in positioning.

Now, for pets:
- **Clue 2**: Spanish owns **Guinea Pig**.

#### Clue 7: The person who likes **azure** is the **game**-smoker.
- The person who likes **azure** smokes **Game** cigars. Let's place **azure** in **Position 1** (since it must be one of the remaining colors) and assign **Game** cigars to **Position 1**.

| Position | Color       | Nationality  | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet        |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| 1        | **Azure**   | **Dutch**     |               | **Game**    |            |

| 5        |             | **Australian**| **Almond-milk**|             |            |

#### Clue 6: The **Baccarat**-smoker is the owner of the **chinchilla**.
- The **Baccarat**-smoker owns the **chinchilla**. Since **Position 3** already has **Davidoff**, **Position 4** must be the **Baccarat**-smoker with the **chinchilla**.

| Position | Color       | Nationality  | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet        |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| 1        | **Azure**   | **Dutch**     |               | **Game**    |            |

| 5        |             | **Australian**| **Almond-milk**|             |            |

#### Clue 11: The owner of the **turtles** is on the left or right of the **game**-smoker.
- The person who owns the **turtles** must be adjacent to the **Game**-smoker in **Position 1**. So, the **turtle** must be in **Position 2**.

| Position | Color       | Nationality  | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet        |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------|

**Final Answer: chestnut:2**"	chestnut:2	chestnut:2	True	True
Einstein_orig_grey-2	grey	3	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

### **Step 1: Establish Positions**
There are **five positions**, and we organize them into a table.

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage     | Cigar   | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?         | ?           | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | Grey      | 7up         | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?         | Mirinda     | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | Aquamarine| ?           | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?         | ?           | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Step 2: Apply Given Clues**
1. **Clue 9: The Dutch is on the far left**  
   - Dutch is **Position 1**.

2. **Clue 4: Grey is on the left of Aquamarine**  
   - If Aquamarine is **Position 4**, then Grey must be **Position 2**.

3. **Clue 5: The person who likes Grey drinks 7up**  
   - Position **2** drinks **7up**.

4. **Clue 8: The person drinking Mirinda is in the middle**  
   - Position **3** drinks **Mirinda**.

---

### **Final Answer**
Since **Grey is in Position 2**, we conclude:

**grey:2**"	grey:4	grey:2	True	False
Einstein_orig_black-2	black	4	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.  

---

### **Step 1: Create a Grid**
We set up a table to track the information.

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage     | Cigar   | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?         | ?           | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | Grey      | 7up         | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?         | Mirinda     | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | Aquamarine| ?           | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?         | ?           | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Step 2: Apply Clues**
1. **Clue 9: The Dutch is in Position 1.**  
2. **Clue 4: The person who likes Grey is on the left of the person who likes Aquamarine.**  
   - **Grey must be Position 2**, and **Aquamarine must be Position 4**.
3. **Clue 5: The person who likes Grey drinks 7up.**  
   - This confirms **Position 2 drinks 7up**.
4. **Clue 8: The person drinking Mirinda is in the middle.**  
   - This means **Position 3 drinks Mirinda**.
5. **Clue 1: The Japanese likes Black.**  
6. **Clue 2: The Spanish owns the Guinea Pig.**  
7. **Clue 3: The Australian drinks Almond Milk.**  
8. **Clue 13: The French smokes Havana.**  
9. **Clue 7: The person who likes Azure is the Game-smoker.**  
10. **Clue 14: The Dutch is on the left or right of the person who likes Chestnut.**  
    - Since Dutch is **Position 1**, **Chestnut must be in Position 2 or 3**.

---

### **Step 3: Determine Nationalities**
- **Dutch is Position 1** (from Clue 9).  
- **Japanese is the person who likes Black (Clue 1).**  
- **Since Black is still unknown, let's place it logically.**  
- **French smokes Havana (Clue 13).**  
- **Australian drinks Almond Milk (Clue 3).**  
- **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig (Clue 2).**  

Since **Mirinda is in Position 3**, and it's neither Almond Milk (Australian) nor Hot Chocolate (by elimination), the **Spanish must be Position 3** because it's still missing a beverage.  

Thus, **Spanish is in Position 3, and the Guinea Pig is there too**.  

Now, **Australian must be in Position 4** because they drink Almond Milk.  

That leaves **French in Position 2** and **Japanese in Position 5** (since they like Black).  

Now the table looks like:

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage     | Cigar   | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | Chestnut  | ?           | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | French     | Grey      | 7up         | Havana  | ?          |
| 3        | Spanish    | ?         | Mirinda     | ?       | Guinea Pig |
| 4        | Australian | Aquamarine| Almond Milk | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | Japanese   | Black     | ?           | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Final Answer**
Since **Black is in Position 5 (Japanese)**:  

**black:5**"	black:3	black:5	True	False
Einstein_orig_aquamarine-2	aquamarine	3	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Organizing the Information**
We have five attributes: **Nationality, Color, Beverage, Cigar, and Pet** for **five positions** (1 to 5).

| Position | Nationality | Color  | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?      | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Step 2: Assigning What We Know**
1. **(9)** The Dutch is in **position 1**.
2. **(8)** The person drinking **Mirinda is in position 3**.
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black**, so **Japanese = Black**.
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**.
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk**.
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The Dutch is next to the person who likes **Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

Since **Grey is to the left of Aquamarine** (**clue 4**) and **Grey drinks 7up** (**clue 5**),  
- Grey must be **Position 3** (as Mirinda is already there and it's the middle seat).
- Aquamarine must be **Position 4**.

---

### **Step 3: Verifying**
Now, we can confirm:
- **Position 3**: Drinks **Mirinda** and likes **Grey**.
- **Position 4**: Likes **Aquamarine**.

---

### **Final Answer:**
**aquamarine:4**"	aquamarine:5	aquamarine:4	True	False
Einstein_orig_azure-2	azure	4	"Let's systematically solve the puzzle.

---

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Grid**
We have **5 attributes** to assign across **5 positions**.

| Position | Nationality | Color  | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?      | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Step 2: Filling in Given Information**
1. **(9)** The Dutch is in **position 1**.
2. **(8)** The person drinking **Mirinda is in position 3**.
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black**, so **Japanese = Black**.
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**.
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk**.
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The Dutch is next to the person who likes **Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

From **(4) and (5)**:
- **Grey drinks 7up**.
- **Grey is left of Aquamarine**.
- Since **Mirinda is in position 3**, **Grey must be in position 2**.
- **Aquamarine must be in position 4**.

Updating our table:

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | Chestnut  | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | Grey      | 7up        | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | Aquamarine | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | Japanese   | Black     | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?         | ?          | ?       | ?          |

From **(7)**: ""The person who likes **Azure** is the Game-smoker.""

- The only remaining color is **Azure**, which must be in **position 5**.

Thus, **Azure is in position 5**.

### **Step 2: Assigning Known Information**
1. **(9)** The **Dutch is in position 1**.
2. **(8)** The **person drinking Mirinda is in position 3**.
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black**, so **Japanese = Black**.
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**.
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk**.
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The Dutch is next to the person who likes **Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

From **(4) and (5)**:
- **Grey drinks 7up**.
- **Grey is left of Aquamarine**.
- Since **Mirinda is in position 3**, and **Grey must drink 7up**, then **Grey must be in position 2**.
- **Aquamarine must be in position 4**.

---

### **Final Answer**
From our deductions, **Grey is in Position 2**.

**grey:2**"	grey:4	grey:2	True	False
Einstein_orig_black-3	black	4	"We will use a logical approach to solve this puzzle step by step.

### Step 1: Set up a grid
We have five people in five positions (1 to 5) with five different attributes:
- **Color**: Chestnut, Grey, Black, Aquamarine, Azure  
- **Nationality**: Japanese, Australian, French, Dutch, Spanish  
- **Beverage**: Fanta, 7up, Mirinda, Almond-milk, Hot-chocolate  
- **Cigar**: Davidoff, Game, Baccarat, Havana, Chaman  
- **Pet**: Ferret, Chinchilla, Guinea-pig, Lizard, Turtle  

### Step 2: Process the clues

1. **(9)** The Dutch is on the far left → **Dutch is in position 1**.  
2. **(8)** The person drinking **Mirinda is in the middle** → **Mirinda is in position 3**.  
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black** → **Black is in some position** with Japanese.  
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig** → Spanish owns Guinea Pig.  
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk** → Australian drinks Almond-milk.  
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.  
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.  
8. **(14)** The Dutch is next to the person who likes **Chestnut** → Chestnut must be in **position 2**.  
9. **(13)** The **French smokes Havana** → French smokes Havana.  
10. **(12)** The **Davidoff-smoker drinks Fanta**.  

### Step 3: Assign what we can

| Position | Nationality | Color  | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | Chestnut | ?         | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?      | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |

From (6), **Baccarat-smoker owns Chinchilla**.  
From (7), **Azure → Game-smoker**.  
From (10), **Chaman-smoker is next to Ferret-owner**.  
From (11), **Turtle-owner is next to Game-smoker**.  
From (15), **Chaman-smoker is next to Hot-chocolate drinker**.  

From (5), Grey drinks **7up**, and from (4), Grey is left of Aquamarine.  

### Step 4: Identify the position of Black

- Since **Japanese likes Black (1)**, we assign **Black to Japanese**.
- We need to check which position fits this.
- Looking at the constraints, the logical position that satisfies all is **Position 4**.

**Final Answer:**  
**black:4**"	black:3	black:4	True	False
Einstein_orig_aquamarine-3	aquamarine	3	"Let's solve the logic puzzle systematically.

### **Step 1: Organizing the Information**
We need to assign five attributes (**Nationality, Color, Beverage, Cigar, and Pet**) to **five positions**.

| Position | Nationality | Color  | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|---------|------------|

1. **(9)** The Dutch is in **position 1**.
2. **(8)** The person drinking **Mirinda is in position 3**.
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black**, so **Japanese = Black**.
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**.
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk**.
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The Dutch is next to the person who likes **Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

From clues **(4) and (5)**:
- **Grey drinks 7up**.
- **Grey is left of Aquamarine**.
- Since **Mirinda is in position 3**, and **Grey must drink 7up**, then **Grey must be in position 2**.
- **Aquamarine must be in position 3**.

Thus, **Aquamarine is in position 3**.

**aquamarine:3**"	aquamarine:5	aquamarine:3	True	False
Einstein_orig_azure-3	azure	4	"Let's solve this logic puzzle step by step.

### **Step 1: Organizing the Information**
We need to assign five attributes (**Nationality, Color, Beverage, Cigar, and Pet**) to **five positions (1 to 5)**.

| Position | Nationality | Color  | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | ?      | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?      | ?          | ?       | ?          |

---

### **Step 2: Assigning What We Know**
1. **(9)** The Dutch is in **position 1**.
2. **(8)** The person drinking **Mirinda is in position 3**.
3. **(1)** The **Japanese likes Black**, so **Japanese = Black**.
4. **(2)** The **Spanish owns the Guinea Pig**.
5. **(3)** The **Australian drinks Almond-milk**.
6. **(4)** The person who likes **Grey is to the left of the person who likes Aquamarine**.
7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The Dutch is next to the person who likes **Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

From clues **(4) and (5)**:
- **Grey drinks 7up**.
- **Grey is left of Aquamarine**.
- Since **Mirinda is in position 3**, and **Grey must drink 7up**, then **Grey must be in position 2**.
- **Aquamarine must be in position 4**.

Now we update the table:

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage    | Cigar    | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | Chestnut  | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 2        | ?          | Grey      | 7up        | ?       | ?          |
| 3        | ?          | Aquamarine | Mirinda    | ?       | ?          |
| 4        | Japanese   | Black     | ?          | ?       | ?          |
| 5        | ?          | ?         | ?          | ?       | ?          |

From **(7)**: ""The person who likes **Azure** is the Game-smoker.""

- The only color left unassigned is **Azure**.
- **Position 5 must be Azure**.

Thus, **Azure is in position 5**.

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Grid**
There are **5 positions (1 to 5)**, each having:
- A **Nationality**
- A **Favorite Color**
- A **Favorite Beverage**
- A **Cigar Brand**
- A **Pet**

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage    | Cigar     | Pet         |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | ?         | ?          | ?         | ?          |

7. **(5)** The person who likes **Grey drinks 7up**.
8. **(14)** The **Dutch is next to the person who likes Chestnut**, so **Chestnut is in position 2**.

From **(4) and (5)**:
- **Grey drinks 7up**.
- **Grey is left of Aquamarine**.
- Since **Mirinda is in position 3**, and **Grey must drink 7up**, then **Grey must be in position 2**.
- **Aquamarine must be in position 4**.

Updating the table:

| Position | Nationality | Color     | Beverage    | Cigar     | Pet         |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1        | Dutch      | Chestnut  | ?          | ?         | ?          |
| 2        | French     | Grey      | 7up        | ?         | ?          |
| 3        | Spanish    | Aquamarine | Mirinda    | ?         | Guinea Pig |

Einstein_orig_fanta-3	fanta	6	"Let's work through this puzzle systematically, organizing all the information we have:

We have 5 positions, each representing a person. The goal is to figure out where each person fits based on the clues. Each person has a unique combination of **color**, **nationality**, **beverage**, **cigar**, and **pet**.

---

### Step 1: Organize the known information.

- There are 5 positions (1 to 5).
- We have 5 colors: chestnut, grey, black, aquamarine, azure.
- We have 5 nationalities: japanese, australian, french, dutch, spanish.
- We have 5 beverages: fanta, 7up, mirinda, almond-milk, hot-chocolate.
- We have 5 cigars: davidoff, game, baccarat, havana, chaman.
- We have 5 pets: ferret, chinchilla, guinea-pig, lizard, turtle.

---

### Step 2: Start filling out the positions based on the clues.

**Clue 9**: The **Dutch** is on the far left — so **Position 1** is the **Dutch**.

**Clue 8**: The person drinking **mirinda** is in the middle — so **Position 3** drinks **mirinda**.

**Clue 1**: The **Japanese** is the person who likes **black** — so the **Japanese** likes **black**, and they are not in **Position 1** (the **Dutch** is there). This means the **Japanese** must be in **Position 4** or **Position 5**.

**Clue 2**: The **Spanish** is the owner of the **guinea-pig** — so the **Spanish** must own the **guinea-pig**, and they cannot be in **Position 1** or **Position 3** (those are already assigned). The **Spanish** must therefore be in **Position 2** or **Position 5**.

**Clue 3**: The **Australian** is the person drinking **almond-milk** — the **Australian** must be the person drinking **almond-milk**. They are also not in **Position 1** (the **Dutch** is there) or **Position 3** (they drink **mirinda**). Therefore, the **Australian** must be in **Position 2** or **Position 5**.

**Clue 4**: The person who likes **grey** is on the left of the person who likes **aquamarine** — **grey** must be to the left of **aquamarine**, so the person who likes **grey** must be in **Position 2** and the person who likes **aquamarine** in **Position 3** or **Position 4**.

**Clue 5**: The person who likes **grey** is the person drinking **7up** — so **Position 2** drinks **7up**.

**Clue 6**: The **baccarat-smoker** is the owner of the **chinchilla** — so the person in **Position 5** (who must be the **baccarat-smoker**) must own the **chinchilla**.

**Clue 7**: The person who likes **azure** is the **game-smoker** — so the person who likes **azure** is the **game-smoker**. This must be in **Position 3** (since the person in **Position 4** likes **black**, and the **Spanish** must own the **guinea-pig**).

**Clue 10**: The **chaman-smoker** is on the left or right of the owner of the **ferret** — so the **chaman-smoker** must be in **Position 4** or **Position 5**.

**Clue 11**: The owner of the **turtles** is on the left or right of the **game-smoker** — the person in **Position 3** is the **game-smoker**, and they must be adjacent to the owner of the **turtles**. This means the person in **Position 2** must own the **turtles**.

**Clue 12**: The **davidoff-smoker** is the person drinking **fanta** — so the **davidoff-smoker** drinks **fanta**. This must be the person in **Position 1**, since they are the only one left who hasn’t been assigned a drink yet.

**Clue 13**: The **French** is the **havana-smoker** — so the **French** must be in **Position 4** or **Position 5**, smoking **havana**.

**Clue 14**: The **Dutch** is on the left or right of the person who likes **chestnut** — the person in **Position 2** must like **chestnut**, since the **Dutch** is in **Position 1** and the person in **Position 3** likes **grey**.

**Clue 15**: The **chaman-smoker** is on the left or right of the person drinking **hot-chocolate** — the person in **Position 5** must drink **hot-chocolate**, and therefore be adjacent to the **chaman-smoker**.

---

### Step 3: Final solution

Based on the clues, the positions should be filled out as follows:

- **Position 1**: **Dutch**, drinks **fanta**, smokes **davidoff**, owns **lizard**, likes **chestnut**.
- **Position 2**: **Australian**, drinks **7up**, smokes **chaman**, owns **turtles**, likes **grey**.
- **Position 3**: **Spanish**, drinks **mirinda**, smokes **havana**, owns **guinea-pig**, likes **aquamarine**.
- **Position 4**: **French**, drinks **almond-milk**, smokes **game**, owns **ferret**, likes **azure**.
- **Position 5**: **Japanese**, drinks **hot-chocolate**, smokes **baccarat**, owns **chinchilla**, likes **black**.

Einstein_orig_7up-3	7up	3	"Let's solve this logic puzzle step by step. We need to figure out where each person, their favorite color, beverage, cigar, and pet are located.

### Step 1: Set up the positions
We have 5 positions (1-5), each associated with a person. Each person will have a favorite color, nationality, beverage, cigar brand, and pet.

### Step 2: Use the clues to deduce placements.

#### Clue 9: The **Dutch** is on the far left.
- **Position 1** must be the **Dutch**.

#### Clue 8: The person drinking **Mirinda** is in the middle.
- **Position 3** must be the person drinking **Mirinda**.

#### Clue 1: The **Japanese** is the person who likes **black**.
- The **Japanese** likes **black**. This means the **Japanese** must be in **Position 5** because positions 1-4 are already associated with other clues.

#### Clue 2: The **Spanish** is the owner of the **guinea-pig**.
- The **Spanish** has the **guinea-pig**. This means the **Spanish** must be in **Position 2** or **Position 4**. Since **Position 5** is already occupied by the **Japanese**, **Position 2** must be the **Spanish**.

#### Clue 3: The **Australian** is the person drinking **almond-milk**.
- The **Australian** drinks **almond-milk**. The **Australian** must be in **Position 4**, as **Position 2** is already occupied by the **Spanish**.

#### Clue 5: The person who likes **grey** is the person drinking **7up**.
- The person who likes **grey** drinks **7up**. So, **Position 1** must be the person who likes **grey** and drinks **7up**.

#### Clue 4: The person who likes **grey** is on the left of the person who likes **aquamarine**.
- Since the person in **Position 1** likes **grey**, the person in **Position 2** must like **aquamarine**.

#### Clue 7: The person who likes **azure** is the **game-smoker**.
- The person who likes **azure** is the **game-smoker**. This means the **game-smoker** must be in **Position 3**, which leaves the **game-smoker** with the **azure** color.

#### Clue 6: The **baccarat-smoker** is the owner of the **chinchilla**.
- The **baccarat-smoker** owns the **chinchilla**. Since **Position 4** is taken by the **Australian** and **Position 2** has already been allocated to the **Spanish**, **Position 5** must be the **baccarat-smoker** who owns the **chinchilla**.

#### Clue 13: The **French** is the **havana-smoker**.
- The **French** smokes **havana**, so **Position 3** must be the **French**, who smokes **havana**.

#### Clue 12: The **davidoff-smoker** is the person drinking **fanta**.
- The **davidoff-smoker** drinks **fanta**. The **Davidoff-smoker** must be in **Position 1**, and therefore, **Position 1** drinks **fanta**.

#### Clue 10: The **chaman-smoker** is on the left or right of the owner of the **ferret**.
- The **chaman-smoker** is next to the owner of the **ferret**. The **chaman-smoker** must be in **Position 4**, and **Position 3** must be the owner of the **ferret**.

#### Clue 11: The owner of the **turtles** is on the left or right of the **game-smoker**.
- The **owner of the turtles** is next to the **game-smoker**. Since the **game-smoker** is in **Position 3**, the **owner of the turtles** must be in **Position 2**.

#### Clue 15: The **chaman-smoker** is on the left or right of the person drinking **hot-chocolate**.
- The **chaman-smoker** is next to the person drinking **hot-chocolate**. This means **Position 4** drinks **hot-chocolate**.

- The **Dutch** is either in **Position 1** or **Position 2**. Since **Position 2** is already taken by the person drinking **7up**, the **Dutch** must be in **Position 1**. Therefore, **Position 2** must be the person who likes **chestnut**.

| Position | Color      | Nationality | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet        |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| 1        | **Chestnut**| **Dutch**    |               |             |            |
| 2        | **Grey**   |             | **7up**       |             |            |

| 4        | **Black**  | **Japanese** |               |             |            |
| 5        |            | **Australian**| **Almond-milk**|             |            |

#### Final deduction:
- **Lizard** must be the pet of the **French**, since all other pets are assigned.
  
So, **Lizard** is in **Position 2**.
