There are 5 houses. We need to assign them colors, nationalities, drinks, cigarette brands, and pets.

#### Houses:
1. **Color**: red, green, ivory, yellow, blue  
2. **Nationality**: English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese  
3. **Drink**: coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, water  
4. **Cigarettes**: old gold, kools, chesterfields, lucky strike, parliaments  
5. **Pet**: dog, fox, zebra, horse, snails

### Step 2: Use clues to fill in the grid

#### Clue 10: The Norwegian lives in the first house.
- **House 1**: Norwegian

#### Clue 15: The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
- **House 2**: Blue (since House 1 is occupied by the Norwegian, House 2 must be blue)

#### Clue 9: Milk is drunk in the middle house.
- **House 3**: Milk

#### Clue 2: The Englishman lives in the red house.
- **House 3**: Red (since the Englishman lives in the red house, and House 3 drinks milk, the red house must be House 3)

#### Clue 6: The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
- **House 4**: Green  
- **House 5**: Ivory (green must be to the right of ivory)

### Step 3: Assign nationalities and drinks

- **Clue 5**: The Ukrainian drinks tea.
   - **House 2**: Ukrainian (House 2 is blue, and the Ukrainian must drink tea)

- **Clue 3**: The Spaniard owns the dog.
   - **House 4**: Spaniard (since House 4 is green, the Spaniard must live here and own the dog)

- **Clue 4**: Coffee is drunk in the green house.
   - **House 4**: Coffee (House 4 is green, and coffee is drunk here)

- **Clue 13**: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
   - **House 5**: Lucky Strike smoker (the remaining person must be the Lucky Strike smoker, and this person drinks orange juice)

- **Clue 14**: The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
   - **House 5**: Japanese (the only remaining option for the Japanese)

### Step 4: Assign the cigarettes and pets

- **Clue 7**: The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
   - **House 3**: Old Gold smoker (since House 3 is the red house and the Englishman lives there, the Old Gold smoker must be in House 3, which means the Englishman owns snails)

- **Clue 8**: Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
   - **House 1**: Kools smoker (since House 1 is yellow, the Norwegian must smoke Kools)

- **Clue 12:** Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
   - **House 2**: Horse (since House 2 is next to House 1, where Kools are smoked, the horse must be in House 2)

- **Clue 11**: The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
   - **House 2**: Chesterfields smoker (since House 2 is next to House 3, the person in House 2 must smoke Chesterfields, meaning the person in House 3 has the fox)

### Step 5: Fill the remaining pets

- **House 2**: Fox (since House 2 is next to House 3, the Englishman in House 3 has the fox)
- **House 5**: Zebra (the only remaining pet for House 5)
- **House 4**: Dog (the Spaniard owns the dog)

### Step 6: Final grid

Now, let's summarize the completed grid:

| House | 1         | 2         | 3         | 4         | 5         |

We'll label the houses from left to right as House 1, House 2, House 3, House 4, House 5.

### Step 2: Assign the facts that are given clearly

- **Clue 10:** The Norwegian lives in the first house.  
  - **House 1** is Norwegian.

- **Clue 15:** The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.  
  - So, **House 2** is blue.

  - **House 1** is Norwegian, and must be next to the house with the fox. So, **House 2** (Ukrainian) has the **fox**, and the person in **House 1** (Norwegian) smokes **Chesterfields**.

- **Clue 12:** Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.  
  - **House 1** (Norwegian) smokes **Kools**, so **House 2** (Ukrainian) must have the **horse**.

- **Clue 7:** The Old Gold smoker owns snails.  
  - The **Englishman** in **House 3** must smoke **Old Gold** and own **snails**.

- **Clue 13:** The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.

We know the following facts:

- **House 1**: Norwegian lives here (Clue 10).
- **House 2**: The blue house is next to the Norwegian’s house (Clue 15), so House 2 is blue.
- **House 3**: The middle house drinks milk (Clue 9), so House 3 drinks milk.
- **House 4**: The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (Clue 6). Therefore, House 4 is ivory, and House 5 is green.

At this point, we have:
- **House 1**: Norwegian

Now, let's assign the pets.

- **Clue 3**: The Spaniard owns the dog, so the Spaniard (House 4) has the dog.
- **Clue 12**: Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept, so the horse must be kept in House 2 (blue) because House 1 (Norwegian) smokes Kools.
- **Clue 11**: The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox. The man with the fox must be in House 1 (Norwegian), so the person in House 2 (Ukrainian) must smoke Chesterfields.
- **Clue 7**: The Old Gold smoker owns snails, so the Englishman in House 3 (red) must own snails.

### **Step 4: Assigning Drinks**
- **Clue 4**: Coffee is drunk in the green house, so House 5 (green) drinks coffee.
- **Clue 13**: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice, so the Japanese in House 5 (green) smokes Lucky Strike and drinks orange juice.
- **Clue 5**: The Ukrainian drinks tea, so House 2 drinks tea.
- **Clue 9**: Milk is drunk in the middle house, so House 3 (red) drinks milk.
- **Clue 10**: The Norwegian drinks water, so House 1 (Norwegian) drinks water.

### **Step 5: Assigning Cigarettes**
- **Clue 8**: Kools are smoked in the yellow house, so House 1 (Norwegian) smokes Kools and lives in the yellow house.
- **Clue 13**: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice, so House 5 (Japanese) smokes Lucky Strike.
