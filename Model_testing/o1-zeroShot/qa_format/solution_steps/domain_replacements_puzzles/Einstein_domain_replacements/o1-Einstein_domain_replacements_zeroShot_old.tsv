### Let's Start Assigning Values:

#### Step 1: Fill out some obvious positions
- From Clue 8, the **gothic-revival house** is in the **middle** (position 3).
- From Clue 9, the **fan of folk** is in position 1 (far left).
- From Clue 6, the **architect** has a birthday in **May**, so they are in position 2 (as only position 2 is available for May).
- The **librarian** is either in position 1 or 5 (from Clue 10). Since the person in position 1 likes folk and can't be the librarian, the **librarian** is in position 5.

#### Step 2: Work with adjacent relations
- From Clue 4, the **subway driver** is to the left of the **snowmobile driver**. The subway driver must be in position 2 or 3, and the snowmobile driver must be in position 3 or 4. However, position 3 is already occupied by the **gothic-revival house**, so the subway must be in position 2 and the snowmobile must be in position 4.
  
- From Clue 5, the **subway driver** is in the **wooden house**, so position 2 must be the **wooden house**.
  
- From Clue 12, the **motorbikemaster** is in the **ranch-style house**. The only available position for the **ranch-style house** is position 1 (since positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are occupied).

#### Step 3: Deduce the rest
- From Clue 7, the **mechanic** drives the **quad-bike**, and the mechanic is in position 4.
- From Clue 14, the **fan of folk** is next to the **motorbike driver**, so the motorbike must be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Assigning music and jobs
- From Clue 3, the **fan of rock** is in the **palace house**. Since position 5 is the only available position for the **palace**, the person in position 5 likes rock music.
- From Clue 13, the **bartender** likes **ambient**, and the only available person to be the bartender is in position 4 (who also drives the snowmobile).
- From Clue 2, the person whose birthday is in **September** likes **reggae**, so the person in position 5 must have a **September** birthday.
- The **train driver** likes **trance** (Clue 1), so the person in position 3 is the train driver and likes trance.
- The **librarian** in position 5 must have a **June** birthday.

### Final Table:

| Position | 1               | 2               | 3               | 4               | 5               |

### Step 2: Start assigning houses, transport, jobs, and birthdays based on the clues

- **House 3** is the **gothic-revival** house (Clue 8). It can't be the **motorbikemaster** or **architect**.
- **House 1** must be the **fan of folk** (Clue 9).
  - The person in **House 1** must also be next to the person driving the **motorbike** (Clue 14).
- The **person driving the subway** is in the **wooden** house (Clue 5), so **House 2** must be the **wooden** house, and it has the person driving the **subway**.
- The **palace** house is the **fan of rock** (Clue 3). So **House 4** is the **palace** house, and the **fan of rock** is in **House 4**.
- **House 5** must be the **futuristic** house, based on Clue 15 (since the **librarian** is adjacent to it).
- **House 1** is **fan of folk**, which is next to the person driving the **motorbike** (Clue 14). So, the **motorbikemaster** is in **House 1**.

---

### Step 3: Further deductions based on transport, job, and birthday

- The **person driving the **quad-bike** is the **mechanic** (Clue 7).
  - The **mechanic** must be in **House 2** (the **wooden** house), based on all other clues.
  - The **architect** is in **House 3**, whose birthday is in **May** (Clue 6).
  - **House 4** has the **fan of rock** (Clue 3) and is the **palace** house.
  - The **person whose birthday is in **July** is on the left or right of the **mechanic** (Clue 11). Since **House 2** is occupied by the **mechanic**, the person whose birthday is in **July** must be in **House 1**.

---

### Step 4: Assign jobs and music preferences

- The **fan of ambient** is the **bartender** (Clue 13). The **bartender** must be in **House 5**, since they have no other place.
- The **fan of trance** is the person driving the **train** (Clue 1), so **House 5** is still **bartender**.

- **Clue 9** tells us that the **fan of folk** is on the **far left** (position 1).
- **Clue 12** tells us that the **motorbikemaster** is in the **ranch-style house** (position 5).
- **Clue 5** tells us that the **subway driver** is in the **wooden house** (position 2).
- **Clue 15** tells us that the **librarian** is next to the **futuristic house**, so the **futuristic house** must be in position 4, and the **librarian** must be in position 4.

#### **Step 2: Assign Transport and Jobs**
- **Clue 7** says that the **mechanic** drives the **quad-bike**, so the **mechanic** must be in position 3 (since position 3 is the **gothic-revival house**).
- **Clue 1** says the **fan of trance** is the person driving the **train**, so the **train driver** must be in position 3, and their music is **trance**.

#### **Step 3: Assign Music Genres**
- **Clue 2** says the **fan of reggae** has a **September** birthday. Since position 5 has the **motorbikemaster** and a **September** birthday, the **motorbikemaster** must like **reggae**.
- **Clue 3** says the **fan of rock** is in the **palace** house. So the person in position 4 (the **snowmobile** driver, who is also the **librarian**) must like **rock**.

#### **Step 4: Assign Jobs**
- **Clue 6** says the **architect** has a **May** birthday. The **architect** must be in position 2.
- The **librarian** is in position 4, as already mentioned.

| **Birthday**   | ?       | ?       | ?         | ?         | ?         |

### Step 1: Apply the Clues

#### Clue 4: ""The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.""
- This means **House 3** must drive the **snowmobile** (since it's to the right of the subway).

#### Clue 6: ""The architect is the person whose birthday is in May.""
- The **architect** has a **May** birthday. We don't know the exact house yet, but this must be assigned.

#### Clue 7: ""The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic.""

### Step 2: Build the Grid

From the clues, we start to fill out the grid:

- **House 1** is the **ranch-style** house, and it must be the **motorbikemaster** and the **fan of folk**.
- **House 2** is the **wooden house**, and it drives the **subway**.
- **House 3** is the **gothic-revival** house, and it drives the **snowmobile**.
- **House 4** must be the **palace** house, and it is the **fan of rock**.
- **House 5** must be the **futuristic** house.

Next, let's add the jobs, transport, and birthdays:

- **The mechanic** drives the **quad-bike**, and since House 3 is already the snowmobile, House 2 must drive the **quad-bike** and be the **mechanic**.
- **The librarian** is on the left or right of the **futuristic house**, so **House 4** is the **librarian** and **House 5** is the **futuristic** house.
- The **architect** has a **May** birthday, and since **House 4** has the **birthday in September** (from the **fan of reggae**), **House 3** must be the **architect**, with a **May** birthday.

Now, let's summarize the grid:

| House #  | 1                 | 2           | 3                 | 4             | 5             |

| **House**      | Ranch-style       | Wooden      | Gothic-revival    | Palace        | Futuristic    |
| **Job**        | Motorbikemaster   | Mechanic    | Architect         | Librarian     | Bartender     |
| **Birthday**   | July              | February    | May               | September     | June          |

#### Step 1: Fill in the houses and positions:
- From Clue 8, we know the **gothic-revival house** is in **position 3**.
- From Clue 9, the **fan of folk** is in the **far-left** position, which is **position 1**.
- The **motorbikemaster** is in the **ranch-style house** (Clue 12), and the only remaining position for the **ranch-style house** is **position 5**.
- The **subway** driver must be in the **wooden house** (Clue 5). Thus, the **subway driver** must be in **position 2**.
- The **futuristic house** must be in **position 4**, and the **librarian** must be next to it (Clue 15), so the **librarian** must be in **position 4**.
  
#### Step 2: Assigning jobs:
- From Clue 7, the **mechanic** drives the **quad-bike**, so the **mechanic** must be in **position 3** and drives the **quad-bike**.
- From Clue 6, the **architect** has a birthday in **May**, and they must be in **position 2** (the only available position for May).
- From Clue 10, the **librarian** is next to the person whose birthday is in **June**, and since **position 4** has the **librarian**, **position 2** must have the **person with a June birthday**. Therefore, the **subway driver** is the person with a **June** birthday.
  
#### Step 3: Fill out the remaining music genres and birthdays:
- The **train driver** likes **trance** (Clue 1), so the **train driver** must be in **position 3** and likes **trance**.
- The **person with a birthday in September** likes **reggae** (Clue 2), so **position 5** must be the person with a **September** birthday and who likes **reggae**.
- The **person driving the motorbike** must like **folk** (Clue 14). Since the **fan of folk** is next to the person driving the **motorbike**, **position 1** (which is the **fan of folk**) must drive the **motorbike**.

#### Step 4: Final assignments:
- **Position 1**: The **fan of folk**, who drives the **motorbike** and has a **July** birthday.
- **Position 2**: The **subway driver**, who has a **June** birthday and likes **ambient** (since the **bartender** likes **ambient** - Clue 13).
- **Position 3**: The **mechanic**, who drives the **quad-bike**, likes **trance**, and has a **February** birthday.
- **Position 4**: The **librarian**, who lives in the **futuristic house**, likes **reggae**, and has a **September** birthday.

### **Step-by-Step Deductions**

#### **Position 3: Gothic-revival house**
- From Clue 8, the **gothic-revival house** is in **position 3**. 
- Since this person is not the **fan of trance** or **reggae** (those clues are already assigned), this person is likely the **architect**, as Clue 6 states the **architect** has a birthday in **May**.
- Therefore, **position 3** is the **architect**, driving the **train** and a **fan of trance**.

#### **Position 1: Fan of Folk**
- From Clue 9, the **fan of folk** is in **position 1**.
- **Position 1** must be next to the person driving the **motorbike** (Clue 14), so **position 2** is where the person driving the **motorbike** must be.
- The **fan of folk** cannot be the **motorbikemaster** (because the **motorbikemaster** is in the **ranch-style house**), so **position 1** must have a different job.
  
#### **Position 2: Motorbikemaster**
- From Clue 12, the **motorbikemaster** lives in the **ranch-style house**. 
- Therefore, the person in **position 2** is the **motorbikemaster**, driving the **motorbike**.

#### **Position 5: Futuristic House**
- From Clue 15, the **librarian** is next to the **futuristic house**. 
- Thus, **position 5** must be the **futuristic house**.
- The person in **position 5** must be the **librarian**, since they are next to the **futuristic house** (Clue 15).
- The **librarian** is also next to the person with a **birthday in June** (Clue 10). Therefore, **position 4** must be the person with a **birthday in June**, and **position 5** must be the **librarian**.

#### **Position 4: Birthday in June**
- From Clue 10, **position 4** is the person whose birthday is in **June**. 
- Since the **librarian** is in **position 5**, the person in **position 4** must be the **bartender**, who is also the **fan of ambient** (Clue 13).

#### **Position 1: Fan of Folk**
- The **fan of folk** is in **position 1**, and they are next to the **motorbikemaster** (Clue 14), confirming **position 1** is the **fan of folk**. 
- This person must be the **mechanic**, driving the **quad-bike** (Clue 7).

#### **Position 3: Architect**
- The **architect** is in **position 3**, with a **birthday in May** (Clue 6). 
- This person is driving the **train**, and the **fan of trance**.

### Step 3: Deduction

Let's proceed step-by-step to build the configuration:

1. **Position 1**: The **fan of folk** must be in position 1 (Clue 9). Since **folk** is on the far left, **Position 1** has **Folk** as the music genre, and the **motorbike** as the transport (Clue 14).
   - **Position 1**: **Folk** (Music), **Motorbike** (Transport)

2. **Position 3**: The **gothic-revival house** is in the middle (Clue 8), so **Position 3** has the **gothic-revival house**.
   - The **fan of trance** is driving the **train** (Clue 1), so **Position 3** must have **Trance** and the **train**.
   - **Position 3**: **Gothic-revival House**, **Trance**, **Train**

3. **Position 5**: The **fan of reggae** has the birthday in **September** (Clue 2). Thus, **Position 5** has **September** as the birthday and **Reggae** as the music genre.
   - **Position 5**: **September**, **Reggae**, **Futuristic House**

4. **Position 2**: The **subway** is in **Position 2** (Clue 5), and the **subway** person is in the **wooden house** (Clue 5). The **librarian** is next to the person whose birthday is in **June** (Clue 10). Since the only remaining option for the **June** birthday is **Position 2**, this person must have the **wooden house**, and the job is the **librarian**.
   - **Position 2**: **Wooden House**, **Subway**, **Librarian**, **June**

5. **Position 4**: The **palace house** has the **fan of rock** (Clue 3), and the **mechanic** is driving the **quad-bike** (Clue 7). The **person whose birthday is in July** is next to the mechanic (Clue 11), so **Position 4** is the **palace house**, with the **quad-bike** and **mechanic**.
   - **Position 4**: **Palace House**, **Rock**, **Quad-bike**, **Mechanic**, **July**
