### Step 1: Assign Positions
We have 5 people in 5 positions from **1 to 5** (left to right).

---
| Position | Food   | Music    | House          | Game    | Flower   |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------|---------|----------|

| 5        |        | Trance   | Futuristic    |         |          |

### Step 2: Use Given Hints
1. **(Rule 9)**: ""The fan of electronic is on the far left.""
   - So, position **1** has **Electronic music**.

2. **(Rule 13)**: ""The fan of trance is the futuristic house.""
   - So, position **5** has **Trance music** and **Futuristic house**.

3. **(Rule 8)**: ""The person playing monopoly is in the middle.""
   - So, position **3** has **Monopoly**.

4. **(Rule 14)**: ""The fan of electronic is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce.""
   - Position 1 (electronic) must be next to lettuce.
   - So, **Position 2 has lettuce**.

5. **(Rule 5)**: ""The person eating zucchini is to the right of the person eating carrot.""
   - So, carrot must be before zucchini.

6. **(Rule 3)**: ""The person playing go is the person eating zucchini.""
   - This means that **whoever eats zucchini also plays go**.

7. **(Rule 1)**: ""The fan of indie is the person eating onion.""
   - So, someone eating **onion = Indie music**.

8. **(Rule 2)**: ""The fan of pop is the person who grows azalea.""
   - So, pop music is with **azalea flowers**.

9. **(Rule 6)**: ""The colonial house is the person who grows bellflower.""
   - So, **colonial house = bellflower**.

10. **(Rule 7)**: ""The victorian house is the person eating radish.""
   - So, **Victorian house = Radish food**.

11. **(Rule 11)**: ""The victorian house is to the left or right of the person who grows orchid.""
   - This means orchid must be adjacent to Victorian.

12. **(Rule 12)**: ""The townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg.""
   - So, **townhouse = Mah-jongg game**.

13. **(Rule 4)**: ""The fan of techno is the person playing domino.""
   - **Whoever plays domino listens to techno music**.

14. **(Rule 10)**: ""The gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold.""
   - Gothic-revival must be adjacent to **Marigold flower**.

### Step 3: Solve for **Domino**
- We already placed **monopoly at position 3**.
- **Techno = Domino (rule 4)**.
- The person with techno must have domino.

From arranging everything, **Domino is at position 2**.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

We have 5 positions (1 through 5) for each of the categories: **food, music, house, game, and flower**.

| Position | Food     | Music     | House         | Game       | Flower     |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------------|------------|------------|
| 1        |          |           |               |            |            |

#### Clue 3: The person playing **go** is the person eating **zucchini**.
- The person eating **zucchini** is playing **go**.

#### Clue 5: The person eating **zucchini** is to the right of the person eating **carrot**.
- The person eating **zucchini** must be to the right of the person eating **carrot**. This means they cannot both be in positions 4 and 5, as position 5 is already taken by **trance**. Therefore, the person eating **carrot** must be in position 2, and the person eating **zucchini** must be in position 3.

#### Clue 1: The fan of **indie** is the person eating **onion**.
- The person eating **onion** is a fan of **indie** music.

#### Clue 4: The fan of **techno** is the person playing **domino**.
- The person playing **domino** is a fan of **techno** music.

#### Clue 8: The person playing **monopoly** is in the middle.
- So, position 3 is occupied by the person playing **monopoly**.

#### Clue 12: The **townhouse** house is the person playing **mah-jongg**.
- The person playing **mah-jongg** lives in a **townhouse**, so this person must be in position 5.

#### Clue 13: The fan of **trance** is the **futuristic** house.
- The fan of **trance** music lives in the **futuristic** house, so position 5 must be the **futuristic** house, with the fan of **trance**.

#### Clue 7: The **victorian** house is the person eating **radish**.
- The person eating **radish** lives in a **victorian** house, so the **victorian** house is in position 4, and this person must be eating **radish**.

#### Clue 6: The **colonial** house is the person who grows **bellflower**.
- The person in the **colonial** house grows **bellflower**, so position 2 must be the **colonial** house with **bellflower**.

#### Clue 10: The **gothic-revival** house is on the left or right of the person who grows **marigold**.
- The **gothic-revival** house is next to the person who grows **marigold**, so the **gothic-revival** house must be in position 4 (with **radish**) and the person growing **marigold** must be in position 3.

#### Clue 11: The **victorian** house is to the left or right of the person who grows **orchid**.
- The **victorian** house (position 4) is next to the person who grows **orchid** (position 3).

#### Clue 2: The fan of **pop** is the person who grows **azalea**.
- The person who likes **pop** music grows **azalea**, so the person in position 2 must be eating **carrot**, playing **go**, and growing **azalea**.

### Step 3: Fill in the grid

Now, let's place all the details based on the clues.
