o1-Einstein-orig-NL-1	"This puzzle is known as the ""Einstein's Riddle"" or ""Zebra Puzzle."" To solve it, we methodically use the given clues to deduce the relationships between the categories (color, nationality, pet, beverage, and cigar) for each of the five houses.

Let's begin step-by-step:

Initial Setup
We have a table with five positions (houses) and need to assign:

Colors: Blue, Green, Red, White, Yellow
Nationalities: British, Danish, German, Norwegian, Swede
Pets: Bird, Cat, Dog, Fish, Horse
Beverages: Beer, Coffee, Milk, Tea, Water
Cigars: Bluemaster, Blend, Dunhill, Pall-Mall, Prince
We will solve this using the clues.

Solution Steps
Step 1: Start with direct clues
The Norwegian is on the far left (house 1).
House 1, Nationality: Norwegian

The person drinking milk is in the middle (house 3).
House 3, Beverage: Milk

The British likes red.
House: ?, Nationality: British, Color: Red

The Norwegian is next to the person who likes blue (Clue 14).
House 2, Color: Blue

Step 2: Relation between green and white (Clue 4)
The person who likes green is immediately to the left of the person who likes white.
Thus, Green is in house 3 or house 4, and White is in house 4 or house 5.
The person who likes green drinks coffee (Clue 5).
Combine with clue 4, Green: House 3 and White: House 4.
House 3, Color: Green, Beverage: Coffee

House 1, Color: Yellow, Cigar: Dunhill

The owner of horses is next to the Dunhill smoker (Clue 11).
House 2, Pet: Horse

The Pall-Mall smoker owns the bird (Clue 6).
House ?, Cigar: Pall-Mall, Pet: Bird

Step 4: Beverage and cigars
The Blend smoker is next to the owner of the cat (Clue 10).

The Blend smoker is next to the person drinking water (Clue 15).

The Bluemaster smoker drinks beer (Clue 12).
House ?, Cigar: Bluemaster, Beverage: Beer

The German smokes Prince (Clue 13).
House ?, Nationality: German, Cigar: Prince

The Danish drinks tea (Clue 3).
