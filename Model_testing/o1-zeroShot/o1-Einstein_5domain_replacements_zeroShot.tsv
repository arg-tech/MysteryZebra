o1_Einstein_5domain_0	"To solve the puzzle, we will use logical deduction step by step to fill in the table based on the clues provided.

Steps to Solve
Initialize a table with placeholders. Assign the positions (1–5) for Transport, Music-Genre, Birthday, House, and Job as unknown initially.

Apply direct clues:

Clues that specify exact matches or direct placement are prioritized first.
Apply relational clues:

Clues that describe left/right relationships, in the middle, or adjacency are used to refine placements.
Iterate until the table is filled completely and consistently.
