Lv8-2x4-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the information into the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is drawing is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's sport is rowing.
   - This means the order must be: Rugby, Drawing, Rowing or Rowing, Drawing, Rugby.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby.
   - This means Reading can be adjacent to Rugby but not necessarily directly next to it.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
   - This seems redundant as it's always true unless there's a typo; we'll assume it's meant to indicate that Rugby cannot be the first sport.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is rowing is not the person who's hobby is drawing.
   - This means the person with the hobby of drawing and the person with the sport of rowing are different individuals.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - This means Camping cannot be in position 4 (the last one), and Drawing must be to its right.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - This means Biathlon cannot be in position 4, and Camping must be to its right.

### Placing the Information:

Let's start placing the clues into the table:

- From **Clue 6**, we know that the person with the hobby of camping is to the right of the person with the sport of biathlon. So, if Biathlon is in position 1, then Camping must be in position 2 or 3, but since Drawing is to the right of Camping (Clue 5), Camping must be in position 2, and Biathlon in position 1.
- From **Clue 3**, Rugby cannot be in position 1.
- From **Clue 1**, we need to place Drawing between Rugby and Rowing. Since Drawing is to the right of Camping, and Rugby cannot be in position 1, we can infer the following:
  - If Rugby is in position 2, then Drawing must be in position 3, and Rowing in position 4.
  - Or if Rugby is in position 3, then Drawing must be in position 4, and Rowing in position 2.

Considering these constraints, let's try the first possibility where Rugby is in position 2, Drawing in position 3, and Rowing in position 4.

- From **Clue 2**, Reading must be either in position 1 or 4. Since Rugby is in position 2, Reading cannot be in position 2, so Reading must be in position 1 or 4. Since Rowing is in position 4, Reading must be in position 1.
- From **Clue 4**, the person with the hobby of drawing (Drawing) is not the same as the person with the sport of rowing (Rowing). This is consistent with our placement.
- From **Clue 5**, the person with the hobby of camping (Camping) is to the right of the person with the sport of biathlon (Biathlon). We already placed Biathlon in position 1 and Camping in position 2, which satisfies this condition.
- From **Clue 7** (implied from the structure), the person with the hobby of reading (Reading) is not the same as the person with the sport of rugby (Rugby). This is consistent with our placement.

### Final Table:

```
|         |    1     |    2    |    3    |   4    |
| Hobby   |  Reading |  Chess  |  Drawing|  Camp  |
| Sport   | Biathlon |  Rugby  |  Tennis | Rowing |
```

### Explanation:

- Position 1: Reading (from Clue 2)
- Position 2: Chess (to satisfy all conditions and avoid conflicts)
- Position 3: Drawing (from Clue 1 and Clue 5)
- Position 4: Camping (from Clue 6)

- Position 1: Biathlon (from Clue 6)
- Position 2: Rugby (from Clue 1)
- Position 3: Tennis (to avoid conflicts with other sports)
- Position 4: Rowing (from Clue 1)

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|         |    1     |    2    |    3    |   4    |
| Hobby   |  Reading |  Chess  |  Drawing|  Camp  |
| Sport   | Biathlon |  Rugby  |  Tennis | Rowing |

Lv8-2x4-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The project-manager is not to the left of the project-manager**:
   - This clue is redundant as it states the same thing twice, so we can ignore it.

2. **The person eating grapes is somewhere to the right of the person eating zucchini**:
   - Grapes (G) > Zucchini (Z)

3. **The person eating grapes is the journalist**:
   - Journalist (J) = Grapes (G)

4. **The person eating zucchini is between the person eating grapes and the person eating tomato**:
   - If G is to the right of Z, and T is to the right of G, then the order must be Z, G, T.
   - Z < G < T

5. **The person eating tomato is somewhere between the person eating watermelon and the designer**:
   - If T is between W and D, then the order must be W, T, D or D, T, W.

6. **The nurse is somewhere to the left of the person eating tomato**:
   - Nurse (N) < Tomato (T)

7. **The designer is not to the left of the designer**:
   - This clue is redundant as it states the same thing twice, so we can ignore it.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 3, we know that the person eating grapes (G) is the journalist (J).
2. From clue 4, since J = G, the order is Z < G < T.
3. From clue 5, since T is between W and D, the order could be W, T, D or D, T, W.
4. From clue 6, N < T.
5. From clue 2, G is to the right of Z, and from clue 4, G is the journalist, so Z cannot be the journalist.
6. Since there are only four positions and four jobs, and each job and food is unique, let's assign the jobs and foods accordingly.

### Assigning Jobs and Foods:

- **Position 1**: Z (Zucchini), N (Nurse)
- **Position 2**: G (Grapes), J (Journalist)
- **Position 3**: T (Tomato)
- **Position 4**: W (Watermelon), D (Designer)

So, the final arrangement is:

- **Food**:
  - Position 1: Zucchini
  - Position 2: Grapes
  - Position 3: Tomato
  - Position 4: Watermelon

- **Job**:
  - Position 1: Nurse
  - Position 2: Journalist
  - Position 3: Tomato (this position does not directly correspond to a job, but we need to place the designer and watermelon)
  - Position 4: Designer

Given the constraints, the designer must be in position 4, and the watermelon must be in position 3.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|        |     1      |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Food   | Zucchini   | Grapes         | Tomato   | Watermelon |
| Job    | Nurse      | Journalist     | Designer | Designer   |
```

This solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv8-2x4-3	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step by step.

1. **Person watching adventure movies is not to the left of the nurse**.
2. **Person watching comedy movies is on the far left (position 1)**.
3. **Electrician is on the right of the bartender**.
4. **Electrician is in an even position (positions 2 or 4)**.
5. **Paramedic is on the far left or far right (positions 1 or 4)**.
6. **Bartender is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies**.
7. **Paramedic is the person watching family movies**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1 (Comedy)**
   - The person in position 1 watches comedy movies.
   - From point 5, the paramedic must be in position 1 or 4. Since position 1 is comedy, the paramedic is in position 4.

2. **Position 4 (Paramedic/Family)**
   - The paramedic is in position 4 and watches family movies.
   - From point 5, the paramedic is on the far right.

3. **Position 2 (Even Position for Electrician)**
   - The electrician is in an even position (positions 2 or 4).
   - Since position 4 is occupied by the paramedic, the electrician must be in position 2.

4. **Position 3 (Bartender/Not Adventure or Comedy)**
   - The electrician is to the right of the bartender (point 3).
   - Therefore, the bartender cannot be in position 2 (electrician) or 4 (paramedic). So, the bartender must be in position 3.

5. **Position 1 (Comedy)**
   - We already determined that the person in position 1 is watching comedy movies.
   - The remaining job for position 1 is the nurse (since the paramedic is the person watching family movies).

6. **Position 4 (Family)**
   - The paramedic is in position 4 and watching family movies.

7. **Position 2 (Adventure or Superhero)**
   - The electrician is in position 2 and we need to determine what they watch.
   - The bartender is to the left of the person watching superhero movies (point 6).
   - The only remaining genre for the electrician is adventure since the bartender is in position 3 and can watch either adventure or superhero. However, since the bartender is to the left of the superhero, the bartender must be watching adventure, and the electrician must be watching superhero.

8. **Position 3 (Bartender/Adventure)**
   - The bartender is in position 3 and watching adventure movies.

9. **Position 1 (Nurse/Comedy)**
   - The nurse is in position 1 and watching comedy movies.

So, the final arrangement is:

| Job           |     1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Movie-Genre   | Nurse/Comedy | Superhero   | Bartender/Adventure | Paramedic/Family |

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
| Job           |     1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Movie-Genre   | Nurse/Comedy | Superhero   | Bartender/Adventure | Paramedic/Family |

Lv8-2x4-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
   - This means parkour and weightlifting must be in positions 1 and 2 respectively (since 1 < 2).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the left of the person who's sport is parkour.
   - This means lacrosse cannot be in position 1 or 2 if parkour is in position 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the fan of disco.
   - This means soccer and disco must be in positions 3 and 4 respectively (since 3 > 4).

4. **Clue 4:** The fan of rock is not to the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
   - This means rock cannot be in position 4 if soccer is in position 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The fan of blues is the person who's sport is lacrosse.
   - This means the person in position 2 (who does parkour) is also the fan of blues.

6. **Clue 6:** The fan of blues is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
   - Since the fan of blues is in position 2 (parkour), soccer must be in position 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The fan of metal is somewhere to the left of the fan of rock.
   - This means the fan of metal cannot be in position 4 if the fan of rock is in position 4.

### Putting it all together:

- From Clue 1, we know parkour (blues fan) is in position 1 and weightlifting is in position 2.
- From Clue 5, we know lacrosse (blues fan) is in position 2, so the blues fan is parkour.
- From Clue 3, soccer is in position 3 and disco is in position 4.
- From Clue 4, rock cannot be in position 4, so rock must be in position 1 or 2, but since blues (parkour) is in position 1, rock must be in position 2.
- From Clue 7, metal must be in position 1 or 2, but blues (parkour) is in position 1, so metal must be in position 3.
- From Clue 6, the blues fan (parkour) is on the right of soccer, which is already in position 3, so this is consistent.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Weightlifting (metal fan)
- Position 2: Parkour (blues fan)
- Position 3: Soccer (disco fan)
- Position 4: Rock

### Final Solution Table:

Lv8-2x4-5	"Let's analyze the given constraints step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. The person watching scientific movies is somewhere between the person watching epic movies and the person watching family movies.
2. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is handball.
3. The person watching scientific movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching epic movies.
4. The person watching romance movies is not to the left of the person whose sport is rugby.
5. The person whose sport is rugby is somewhere between the person watching family movies and the person whose sport is cycling.
6. The person whose sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies.
7. The person whose sport is cycling is not to the left of the person watching epic movies.
8. The person whose sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.

First, let's summarize the constraints related to the movie genres and sports:

### Constraints Analysis:
1. Scientific (S) is between Epic (E) and Family (F).
2. Romance (R) is to the left of Handball (H).
3. S is also between R and E.
4. R is not to the left of Rugby (Rg).
5. Rg is between Family and Cycling (C).
6. C is to the right of S.
7. C is not to the left of E.
8. C is either to the left or right of S.

From these constraints, we can deduce the following:
- Since S is between R and E, and also between F and E, we need to place S, R, E, and F in a sequence where S fits in both sequences.
- R is to the left of H, and Rg is between Family and Cycling.
- C is to the right of S and not to the left of E.
- C is either to the left or right of S.

Given that R is not to the left of Rg, and Rg is between Family and Cycling, we can infer the following possible positions for R and Rg:
- If R is to the left of Rg, then R must be before Family and Rg must be before Cycling.
- C is to the right of S and not to the left of E, so C must be after S and before E.

Let's try to fit all pieces together:

1. Since S is between R and E, and also between F and E, and considering the other constraints:
   - S could be in position 2.
   - R could be in position 1.
   - E could be in position 3.
   - F could be in position 4.

2. Given R is to the left of H, and Rg is between Family and Cycling:
   - R must be in position 1.
   - H must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Rg must be in position 2.
   - C must be in position 4.

3. Given C is to the right of S and not to the left of E:
   - S is in position 2.
   - C is in position 4.
   - E is in position 3.

4. Given R is not to the left of Rg, and Rg is between Family and Cycling:
   - R is in position 1.
   - Rg is in position 2.
   - Family is in position 4.
   - Cycling is in position 3.

Therefore, the final arrangement should be:
- Position 1: Rugby (Rg)
- Position 2: Scientific (S)
- Position 3: Cycling (C)
- Position 4: Family (F)

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |    1     |    2    |     3      |    4    |
| Movie-Genre   | Rugby   | Scientific | Cycling   | Family  |
| Sport         |         |           |           |         |
```

This satisfies all the given constraints."
Lv8-2x4-6	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The fan of pop is on the left of the fan of indie.
2. The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the person eating cauliflower.
3. The person eating lettuce is on the right of the fan of indie.
4. The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of indie.
5. The person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the left of the person eating kiwi.
6. The person eating pineapple is not to the left of the fan of dubstep.
7. The person eating pineapple is the fan of dubstep.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 7:
- The person eating pineapple is the fan of dubstep.

This means:
- **Pineapple** (Food) -> **Dubstep** (Music-Genre)

#### Clue 2:
- The fan of dubstep (Pineapple) is somewhere to the left of the person eating cauliflower.
- Therefore, **Pineapple** must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 6:
- The person eating pineapple (Pineapple) is not to the left of the fan of dubstep.
- Since Pineapple is already the fan of dubstep, this clue doesn't provide new information but confirms the position of Pineapple as the fan of dubstep.

#### Clue 1:
- The fan of pop is on the left of the fan of indie.
- This means Pop and Indie must be in adjacent positions with Pop to the left of Indie.

#### Clue 4:
- The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of indie.
- This means Ambient can be either directly before or after Indie.

#### Clue 5:
- The person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the left of the person eating kiwi.
- This means Cauliflower and Kiwi must be in adjacent positions with Cauliflower to the left of Kiwi.

#### Clue 3:
- The person eating lettuce is on the right of the fan of indie.
- This means Lettec cannot be in position 1 or 2 if Indie is in position 1 or 2, respectively.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements step-by-step:

1. **Pineapple (Dubstep)** must be in position 1 or 2.
2. If Pineapple is in position 1, then:
   - Pop and Indie must be in positions 2 and 3 (since Pop is to the left of Indie).
   - Lettec must be in position 4 (since it is to the right of Indie).
   - Cauliflower and Kiwi must be in positions 2 and 3 (but since Pop and Indie are already there, this is not possible).

Therefore, Pineapple must be in position 2.

So:
- Position 1: Pop
- Position 2: Pineapple (Dubstep)
- Position 3: Indie
- Position 4: Lettec

Now we need to place Cauliflower and Kiwi:
- Cauliflower and Kiwi must be in positions 1 and 4 with Cauliflower to the left of Kiwi.
- Since Pop is in position 1, Cauliflower and Kiwi must be in positions 3 and 4.

Thus:
- Position 1: Pop
- Position 2: Pineapple (Dubstep)
- Position 3: Indie
- Position 4: Lettec (Cauliflower/Kiwi)

Since Lettec is the only one left and it must be in position 4, and it can be either Cauliflower or Kiwi, we need to check the remaining constraints:
- The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of indie.
- Since Indie is in position 3, Ambient can be in position 1 or 4.

Since Pop is in position 1 and Lettec is in position 4, Ambient must be in position 4 (Kiwi) and the other one in position 1 (Cauliflower).

Thus:
- Position 1: Pop (Cauliflower)
- Position 2: Pineapple (Dubstep)
- Position 3: Indie
- Position 4: Lettec (Kiwi)

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |   3   |    4    |
| Food          | Cauliflower |     Pineapple | Indie |   Lettec (Kiwi) |
| Music-Genre   |     Pop    |        Dubstep |    Indie |     Lettec (Ambient) |

Lv8-2x4-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the information in the correct positions.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The entrepreneur is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
2. The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby.
3. The dressmaker is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
4. The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the dressmaker.
5. The entrepreneur is not to the right of the project-manager.
6. The project-manager is somewhere between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the entrepreneur.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place Rugby
From Clue 3, we know the dressmaker is on the left of the rugby player. This means the rugby player cannot be in position 1 or 2 because there must be someone to the left of them.

#### Step 2: Place Tennis
From Clue 2, the tennis player is to the right of the rugby player. This means the tennis player cannot be in position 1 or 2 either.

#### Step 3: Place Ice-Hockey
From Clue 4, the rugby player is between the ice-hockey player and the dressmaker. This means the rugby player cannot be in position 4 because there would be no space for the ice-hockey player and the dressmaker.

#### Step 4: Determine Positions
Given that the rugby player is between the ice-hockey player and the dressmaker, and considering the restrictions from Clues 1 and 5, we can start placing the individuals.

- If the rugby player is in position 2, then the ice-hockey player must be in position 1, and the dressmaker in position 3 (since the rugby player is to the right of the dressmaker).
- The tennis player must be in position 4 (since it is to the right of the rugby player).

So far, we have:
```
|         |     1      |      2       |        3        |     4      |
| Job     |            |              |                 |            |
| Sport   | Ice-Hockey | Rugby        | Dressmaker      | Tennis     |
```

#### Step 5: Place Entrepreneur and Project-Manager
From Clue 5, the entrepreneur is not to the right of the project-manager. From Clue 6, the project-manager is between the ice-hockey player and the entrepreneur.

This means the project-manager must be in position 1, and the entrepreneur must be in position 3.

Lv8-2x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and place the information into the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of classical is between the fan of pop and the person driving the boat.**
   - This means the order could be: Pop, Classical, Boat or Boat, Classical, Pop.

2. **The person driving the trike is on the far left.**
   - This places the trike driver in position 1.

3. **The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the fan of classical.**
   - Since the trike driver is in position 1, the fan of classical cannot be in position 1 (already taken by the trike driver).

4. **The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.**
   - This means the boat cannot be in position 4, as there would be no room for dubstep to the right.

5. **The person driving the bus is the person driving the bus.**
   - This is a tautology and doesn't provide new information.

6. **The fan of indie is not the person driving the taxi.**
   - The fan of indie cannot be in the same position as the taxi driver.

7. **The fan of pop is not to the right of the fan of indie.**
   - This means the fan of indie must be to the right of the fan of pop.

8. **The person driving the boat is not to the left of the person driving the bus.**
   - This means the boat cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the bus is in position 3 or 4.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Place the trike driver in position 1.
2. Since the fan of classical cannot be in position 1, we need to consider the possible positions for the fan of classical based on clue 1.
3. The boat must be to the left of the bus (clue 8), so the boat can only be in position 1 or 2.
4. The trike driver is on the far left (position 1), so the fan of classical must be in position 2 or 3.
5. The fan of dubstep must be to the right of the boat (clue 4).
6. The fan of pop cannot be to the right of the fan of indie (clue 7).

Let's start placing the elements:

- **Position 1:** Trike Driver
- **Position 2:** Fan of Classical (since it needs to be between the fan of pop and the person driving the boat)
- **Position 3:** Fan of Pop (to ensure the fan of indie is to the right of the fan of pop)
- **Position 4:** Fan of Indie (the only remaining position)

Now, let's determine the transport modes:

- The person driving the boat must be in position 2 or 3 (since the boat cannot be to the left of the bus and the trike is in position 1).
- The person driving the bus must be in position 3 or 4.
- The person driving the taxi must be in the remaining position (position 4).

Since the fan of pop is in position 3, the person driving the boat must be in position 2. Therefore, the person driving the bus must be in position 4, and the person driving the taxi must be in position 3.

So, the final arrangement is:

- **Position 1:** Trike Driver
- **Position 2:** Fan of Classical
- **Position 3:** Fan of Pop
- **Position 4:** Fan of Indie

And the transport modes:

- **Position 1:** Trike
- **Position 2:** Boat
- **Position 3:** Taxi
- **Position 4:** Bus

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1   |     2     |   3   |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | Indie | Dubstep   | Pop   | Classical |
| Transport     | Trike | Boat      | Taxi  | Bus      |
```

| Transport     | Trike | Boat      | Taxi  | Bus      |

Lv8-2x4-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the jobs and means of transport in the correct order. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The writer is between the person driving the motorbike and the person driving the snowmobile.**
   - This means the order could be: Motorbike, Writer, Snowmobile or Snowmobile, Writer, Motorbike.

2. **The person driving the airplane is not the librarian.**
   - The librarian cannot drive the airplane.

3. **The person driving the airplane is on the right of the chef.**
   - This means the chef must be to the left of the person driving the airplane.

4. **The manager is not to the right of the chef.**
   - The manager must be to the left of the chef.

5. **The person driving the airplane is on the left or right of the chef.**
   - This reaffirms that the person driving the airplane is either next to or directly to the right of the chef.

6. **The person driving the motorbike is not to the right of the person driving the airplane.**
   - This means the person driving the motorbike must be to the left of the person driving the airplane.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 3 and Clue 5:**
   - The chef and the person driving the airplane must be adjacent.
   - Possible positions for the chef and the person driving the airplane: (1,2), (2,3), or (3,4).

2. **From Clue 4:**
   - The manager must be to the left of the chef.

3. **From Clue 6:**
   - The person driving the motorbike must be to the left of the person driving the airplane.

4. **From Clue 1:**
   - The writer is between the person driving the motorbike and the person driving the snowmobile.
   - This means the order could be: Motorbike, Writer, Snowmobile or Snowmobile, Writer, Motorbike.

5. **Combining all clues:**
   - If the chef and the person driving the airplane are in positions (1,2) or (2,3):
     - If (1,2): Chef in position 1, Airplane in position 2.
       - Then the manager must be in position 3 or 4.
       - The person driving the motorbike must be to the left of the person driving the airplane, so it can only be in position 3 if the person driving the airplane is in position 2.
       - The writer and the snowmobile must fit into positions 3 and 4, but the manager cannot be in position 4.
     - If (2,3): Chef in position 2, Airplane in position 3.
       - Then the manager must be in position 1 or 4.
       - The person driving the motorbike must be to the left of the person driving the airplane, so it can only be in position 1 if the person driving the airplane is in position 3.
       - The writer and the snowmobile must fit into positions 1 and 4, but the manager cannot be in position 1.

6. **Final arrangement:**
   - The only feasible arrangement that fits all clues is:
     - Position 1: Manager
     - Position 2: Chef
     - Position 3: Person driving the airplane
     - Position 4: Person driving the motorbike

7. **Assigning jobs:**
   - Since the librarian cannot drive the airplane (Clue 2), and the person driving the airplane is on the right of the chef (Clue 3), the librarian must be the writer.
   - Therefore, the remaining jobs are assigned as follows:
     - Position 1: Manager
     - Position 2: Chef
     - Position 3: Airplane
     - Position 4: Motorbike

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |
| Job         | Manager | Chef      | Airplane | Motorbike  |
| Transport   | Taxi    | Snowmobile| Airplane | Motorbike  |
```

### Explanation:
- **Manager** is in position 1.
- **Chef** is in position 2.
- **Airplane** is in position 3.
- **Motorbike** is in position 4.
- **Writer** is the librarian, which is not driving the airplane or motorbike.

This satisfies all the given clues."
