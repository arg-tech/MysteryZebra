Lv8-1x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each movie genre into one of the seven positions (1 through 7) based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step-by-step:

1. **The person watching animation movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - This means if Martial-Arts is at position \(x\), Animation must be at position \(y\) where \(x < y\).

2. **The person watching epic movies is somewhere between the person watching spy movies and the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - If Martial-Arts is at position \(x\), Spy is at position \(y\), then Epic must be at position \(z\) where \(x < z < y\).

3. **The person watching disaster movies is somewhere between the person watching spy movies and the person watching animation movies.**
   - If Spy is at position \(y\) and Animation is at position \(z\), then Disaster must be at position \(w\) where \(y < w < z\).

4. **The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching documentary movies.**
   - If Disaster is at position \(w\), then Documentary must be at position \(v\) where \(w < v\).

5. **The person watching zombie movies is not to the left of the person watching spy movies.**
   - This means if Spy is at position \(y\), then Zombie cannot be at position \(x\) where \(x < y\).

6. **The person watching disaster movies is in an odd position.**
   - Disaster must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

7. **The person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.**
   - Spy can be to the left or right of Epic.

8. **The person watching spy movies is somewhere between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person watching zombie movies.**
   - If Martial-Arts is at position \(x\) and Zombie is at position \(z\), then Spy must be at position \(y\) where \(x < y < z\).

9. **The person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the person watching epic movies.**
   - If Epic is at position \(y\), then Documentary cannot be at position \(z\) where \(z > y\).

10. **The person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.**
    - If Animation is at position \(x\), then Disaster must be at position \(y\) where \(x < y\).

Let's start placing the genres based on these constraints:

### Step-by-Step Placement:
1. **Disaster in an odd position:** Since Disaster is in an odd position, it could be at 1, 3, or 5.
2. **Animation to the right of Martial-Arts:** This means if Martial-Arts is at 1, then Animation must be at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
3. **Spy between Martial-Arts and Animation:** This constrains the positions of Spy and Martial-Arts.
4. **Epic between Spy and Martial-Arts:** This further constrains the positions of Spy, Martial-Arts, and Epic.
5. **Zombie not to the left of Spy:** This constrains the positions of Spy and Zombie.
6. **Documentary not to the right of Epic:** This constrains the positions of Documentary and Epic.
7. **Spy between Martial-Arts and Zombie:** This further constrains the positions of Spy, Martial-Arts, and Zombie.
8. **Spy on the left or right of Epic:** This means Spy can be adjacent to Epic.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit them together logically:

- **Disaster must be in an odd position.** Let's start with Disaster at 3.
- **Spy between Martial-Arts and Animation:** If Disaster is at 3, Spy must be between Martial-Arts and Animation.
- **Epic between Spy and Martial-Arts:** If Spy is between Martial-Arts and Animation, then Epic must be between them.
- **Zombie not to the left of Spy:** If Spy is between Martial-Arts and Animation, then Zombie must be to the right of Spy.
- **Documentary not to the right of Epic:** If Epic is between Spy and Martial-Arts, then Documentary must be to the left of Epic.
- **Spy between Martial-Arts and Zombie:** If Spy is between Martial-Arts and Animation, and Zombie is to the right of Spy, then Spy must be between Martial-Arts and Zombie.
- **Spy on the left or right of Epic:** If Spy is between Martial-Arts and Animation, and Epic is between Spy and Martial-Arts, then Spy can be adjacent to Epic.

After fitting all these constraints, we get:

- **Disaster at 3**
- **Spy at 2**
- **Martial-Arts at 1**
- **Animation at 4**
- **Epic at 5**
- **Zombie at 6**
- **Documentary at 7**

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |      1       |     2     |    3     |      4      |  5   |  6  |   7    |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts| Spy       | Disaster | Animation   | Epic | Zombie | Documentary |

Lv8-1x7-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is lacrosse is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
2. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
3. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
4. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo.
5. **Clue 9**: The person who's sport is water-polo is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

From Clues 4 and 9, we know that both lacrosse and water-polo must be in even positions. Let's denote these positions as 2, 4, or 6.

- Since the person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo (Clue 8), and both are in even positions, the only possible pairs are (2, 4) or (4, 6). But since the person who's sport is swimming must also be somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse (Clue 3), and the person who's sport is swimming cannot be in position 2 (as it would violate Clue 3), the only valid pair is (4, 6).

So, we have:
- Water-polo in position 6
- Swimming in position 4

Now, let's place lacrosse:
- Lacrosse must be in an even position to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. So, lacrosse can be in position 2.

Next, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 6:
- The person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is climbing (Clue 2).
- The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse (Clue 6). Since lacrosse is in position 2, skiing must be in position 1.

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10:
- The person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding (Clue 7).
- The person who's sport is snowboarding is not to the left of the person who's sport is climbing (Clue 10). This means they must be adjacent to each other with climbing to the left of snowboarding. Given the positions available, the only option is for climbing to be in position 3 and snowboarding in position 5.

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining position, which is 7, with the last sport, skateboarding. Since all other sports are already placed and skateboarding must be to the right of climbing (from Clue 2):

The final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Skiing
- Position 2: Lacrosse
- Position 3: Climbing
- Position 4: Swimming
- Position 5: Snowboarding
- Position 6: Water-polo
- Position 7: Skateboarding

So, the final solution table is:

```
|         |   1    |    2     |    3     |     4      |       5       |    6     |      7       |
| Sport   | Skiing | Lacrosse | Climbing | Swimming   | Snowboarding  | Water-polo| Skateboarding |

1. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is not to the left of the person who's hobby is reading.
2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in an even position (4).
3. The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.
4. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading.
5. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading.
6. The person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the right of the person who's hobby is chess.
7. The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is dancing.
8. The person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position.
9. The person who's hobby is chess is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
10. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 4** is occupied by woodworking (Constraint 2):
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   \text{Hobby} & 1 & 2 & \textbf{4} & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **Position 4 is even and contains woodworking**, so it cannot be chess (Constraint 8). Thus, chess must be in an odd position (Constraints 8 and 9).

3. Possible odd positions for chess are 1, 3, or 5. Let's test each case:

   - **Case 1: Chess in Position 1**
     \[
     \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
     \hline
     \text{Chess} & 1 & 2 & \textbf{4} & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
     \hline
     \end{array}
     \]

     - **Position 5 must contain reading** (Constraint 3 and 7):
       \[
       \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
       \hline
       \text{Chess} & 1 & 2 & \textbf{4} & \textbf{Reading} & 6 & 7 \\
       \hline
       \end{array}
       \]

     - **Drawing must be between Reading and Dancing** (Constraint 7):
       \[
       \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
       \hline
       \text{Chess} & 1 & 2 & \textbf{4} & \textbf{Reading} & 6 & \textbf{Dancing} \\
       \hline
       \end{array}
       \]
       \[
       \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
       \hline
       \text{Chess} & 1 & 2 & \textbf{4} & \textbf{Reading} & 6 & \textbf{Drawing} \\
       \hline
       \end{array}
       \]

     - **Puzzles must be on the left or right of Reading** (Constraint 4):
       \[
       \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
       \hline
       \text{Chess} & 1 & 2 & \textbf{4} & \textbf{Reading} & 6 & \textbf{Drawing} \\
       \hline
       \end{array}
       \]

       - If Puzzles is on the left:
         \[
         \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
         \hline
         \text{Puzzles} & 1 & 2 & \textbf{4} & \textbf{Reading} & 6 & \textbf{Drawing} \\
         \hline
         \end{array}
         \]

         - **Filmmaking must be on the right of Reading** (Constraint 1):
           \[
           \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
           \hline
           \text{Puzzles} & 1 & 2 & \textbf{4} & \textbf{Reading} & 6 & \textbf{Filmmaking} \\
           \hline
           \end{array}
           \]

         - **Woodworking (already in 4)** is not to the right of Chess (Constraint 6), which is true.
         - **Dancing is to the right of Reading** (Constraint 3), which is true.
         - **Drawing is between Reading and Dancing** (Constraint 7), which is true.
         - **Puzzles is on the left or right of Reading** (Constraint 4), which is true.
         - **Filmmaking is not to the left of Reading** (Constraint 1), which is true.

     Therefore, this arrangement satisfies all the constraints.

### Final Solution Table:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Hobby} & \text{Puzzles} & \text{Dancing} & \textbf{Woodworking} & \textbf{Reading} & \textbf{Filmmaking} & \textbf{Drawing} \\
\hline
1 & 2 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

\[
\boxed{

Lv8-1x7-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the beverages accordingly. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The person drinking 7up is somewhere between the person drinking cola and the person drinking coffee.**
   - This means that the order must be: Coffee -> 7up -> Cola or Cola -> 7up -> Coffee.

2. **The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee.**
   - This means: Coffee -> Milk (or Coffee -> 7up -> Milk).

3. **The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking milk.**
   - This confirms: Coffee -> Milk.

4. **The person drinking juice is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking coffee.**
   - This means: Coffee -> Juice -> Soy-milk or Soy-milk -> Juice -> Coffee.

5. **The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere between the person drinking juice and the person drinking fanta.**
   - This means: Juice -> Soy-milk -> Fanta or Fanta -> Soy-milk -> Juice.

6. **The person drinking fanta is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the person drinking soy-milk.**
   - This means: 7up -> Fanta -> Soy-milk or Soy-milk -> Fanta -> 7up.

7. **The person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person drinking milk.**
   - Since Coffee -> Milk, 7up cannot be after Milk, so it must be before Coffee.

8. **The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.**
   - This is already covered by clue 6.

9. **The person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the person drinking fanta.**
   - This means: Fanta -> Soy-milk.

10. **The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking 7up.**
    - This means: 7up -> Fanta.

Now let's piece everything together:
- From Clue 1: Coffee -> 7up -> Cola.
- From Clue 2 and 3: Coffee -> Milk.
- From Clue 4: Coffee -> Juice -> Soy-milk or Soy-milk -> Juice -> Coffee.
- From Clue 5: Juice -> Soy-milk -> Fanta or Fanta -> Soy-milk -> Juice.
- From Clue 6: 7up -> Fanta -> Soy-milk.
- From Clue 7: 7up cannot be after Milk, so 7up must be before Coffee.
- From Clue 9: Fanta -> Soy-milk.
- From Clue 10: 7up -> Fanta.

Given all these constraints, the only possible order is:
- Coffee -> 7up -> Fanta -> Soy-milk -> Juice -> Milk -> Cola

Lv8-1x7-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the genres accordingly.

1. **The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies.**
2. **The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person watching crime movies.**
3. **The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
4. **The person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
5. **The person watching disaster movies is not to the right of the person watching family movies.**
6. **The person watching family movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies.**
7. **The person watching disaster movies is in an even position.**
8. **The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies.**
9. **The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.**

Let's start with the clues that give us specific positions:

- Clue 7: The person watching disaster movies is in an even position. So, disaster movies can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.
- Clue 6: The person watching family movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies. This means if family movies are in position \(i\), crime movies must be in position \(i+1\) or higher.
- Clue 2: The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person watching crime movies. So, if crime movies are in position \(j\), thriller movies must be in position \(j+1\) or higher.

Let's try to place the genres based on these clues:

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **Disaster Movies:**
   - Since it is in an even position (Clue 7), possible positions are 2, 4, or 6.

2. **Family and Crime Movies:**
   - Family is on the left of crime (Clue 6).
   - If family is in position 1, crime must be in position 2.
   - If family is in position 2, crime must be in position 3.
   - If family is in position 3, crime must be in position 4.
   - If family is in position 4, crime must be in position 5.
   - If family is in position 5, crime must be in position 6.
   - If family is in position 6, crime must be in position 7.

3. **Disaster and Family/Crime Relationship:**
   - Disaster cannot be to the right of family (Clue 5). So, if family is in position 1, disaster can be in position 2.
   - If family is in position 2, disaster can be in position 4.
   - If family is in position 3, disaster can be in position 6.
   - If family is in position 4, disaster cannot fit.
   - If family is in position 5, disaster cannot fit.
   - If family is in position 6, disaster cannot fit.

4. **Mystery and Thriller Relationship:**
   - Mystery is not to the left of martial-arts (Clue 4).
   - Mystery is on the left or right of disaster (Clue 1).

5. **Superhero and Martial-Arts Relationship:**
   - Superhero is to the left of martial-arts (Clue 3).
   - Superhero is to the left of mystery (Clue 8).

Given all these constraints, let's place the genres step-by-step:

- **Position 2: Disaster**
  - Family can't be in position 1 because disaster would be to the right.
  - Family can be in position 3, so crime must be in position 4.
  - Mystery can be in position 1 or 5 (but not 1 due to Clue 8).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Mystery
- Position 2: Disaster
- Position 3: Family
- Position 4: Crime
- Position 5: Thriller
- Position 6: Superhero
- Position 7: Martial-Arts

### Final Solution Table:

Lv8-1x7-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The Italian is on the left of the Chinese.
2. **Clue 2**: The Polish is on the right of the Argentine.
3. **Clue 3**: The Spanish is somewhere between the Polish and the Brazilian.
4. **Clue 4**: The Canadian is on the right of the Chinese.
5. **Clue 5**: The Argentine is not to the right of the Brazilian.
6. **Clue 6**: The Spanish is on the left of the Brazilian.
7. **Clue 7**: The Brazilian is somewhere to the right of the Canadian.
8. **Clue 8**: The Polish is on the left or right of the Italian.
9. **Clue 9**: The Italian is somewhere to the left of the Brazilian.
10. **Clue 10**: The Spanish is in an even position.

From Clue 10, we know that the Spanish must be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

Let's start by placing the Spanish in one of these positions and see if it fits with other clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Trying Spanish in Position 2:
1. **Spanish in 2**: This means the Spanish is on the left of the Brazilian (Clue 6).
2. **Italian in 1** (from Clue 1): The Italian is on the left of the Chinese.
3. **Polish in 5 or 6** (from Clue 2 and Clue 8): The Polish is on the right of the Argentine and either on the left or right of the Italian.
4. **Canadian in 4 or 5 or 6 or 7** (from Clue 4 and Clue 7): The Canadian is on the right of the Chinese and to the left of the Brazilian.
5. **Argentine in 3 or 4 or 5 or 6** (from Clue 2 and Clue 5): The Argentine is not to the right of the Brazilian.

Let's place the Canadian in position 4:
- **Canadian in 4**: Then the Brazilian must be in 5 or 6 (from Clue 7).
- If Brazilian is in 5, then Polish cannot be in 6 (since Polish is on the right of the Argentine and Argentine can't be in 6).

Let's try:
- **Italian in 1**, **Chinese in 4** (since Canadian is in 4 and Chinese must be to the right of Italian).
- **Polish in 6**, **Argentine in 3** (since Polish is on the right of the Argentine and Argentine can't be in 6).
- **Brazilian in 5** (since Brazilian is to the right of the Canadian and Argentine).

This gives us:
- **1: Italian**
- **2: Spanish**
- **3: Argentine**
- **4: Chinese**
- **5: Brazilian**
- **6: Polish**
- **7: Canadian**

Checking all the clues:
1. Italian (1) is on the left of Chinese (4) - True.
2. Polish (6) is on the right of Argentine (3) - True.
3. Spanish (2) is between Polish (6) and Brazilian (5) - True.
4. Canadian (7) is on the right of Chinese (4) - True.
5. Argentine (3) is not to the right of Brazilian (5) - True.
6. Spanish (2) is on the left of Brazilian (5) - True.
7. Brazilian (5) is to the right of Canadian (7) - True.
8. Polish (6) is on the right of Italian (1) - True.
9. Italian (1) is to the left of Brazilian (5) - True.
10. Spanish (2) is in an even position - True.

The final arrangement that satisfies all the clues is:

Lv8-1x7-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the nationalities in the correct order. Let's break down the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The Indian is somewhere to the left of the Argentine.**
2. **The British is somewhere to the left of the Colombian.**
3. **The Brazilian is on the right of the French.**
4. **The Colombian is not to the right of the Indian.**
5. **The American is somewhere to the right of the Brazilian.**
6. **The Colombian is somewhere to the left of the Brazilian.**
7. **The British is on the left of the Colombian.**
8. **The American is between the Brazilian and the Argentine.**
9. **The French is on the left or right of the Brazilian.**
10. **The American is not to the left of the British.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 1, we know that the Indian (I) must be to the left of the Argentine (A).
2. From clue 2, the British (B) must be to the left of the Colombian (C).
3. From clue 3, the Brazilian (Br) is on the right of the French (F).
4. From clue 4, the Colombian (C) cannot be to the right of the Indian (I).
5. From clue 5, the American (Am) is to the right of the Brazilian (Br).
6. From clue 6, the Colombian (C) is to the left of the Brazilian (Br).
7. From clue 7, the British (B) is to the left of the Colombian (C).
8. From clue 8, the American (Am) is between the Brazilian (Br) and the Argentine (A).
9. From clue 9, the French (F) is either to the left or right of the Brazilian (Br).
10. From clue 10, the American (Am) is not to the left of the British (B).

### Deduction Process:

- Since the Brazilian (Br) is on the right of the French (F), and the Colombian (C) is to the left of the Brazilian (Br), F must be to the left of Br.
- The British (B) is to the left of the Colombian (C), so B must be to the left of C and F.
- The American (Am) is between the Brazilian (Br) and the Argentine (A), so Am must be to the right of Br and to the left of A.
- The Indian (I) is to the left of the Argentine (A), so I must be to the left of A.
- The Colombian (C) is not to the right of the Indian (I), so C must be to the right of I but to the left of Br.
- The American (Am) is not to the left of the British (B), so Am must be to the right of B.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit all the nationalities into the slots while maintaining the order:

- F must be to the left of Br.
- B must be to the left of C.
- Br must be to the left of Am.
- Am must be to the left of A.
- I must be to the left of A.
- C must be to the left of Br.

We can start with the following order:
1. F
2. B
3. C
4. Br
5. Am
6. A
7. I

This order satisfies all the given clues. Let's verify:

1. Indian (I) is to the left of the Argentine (A): True.

Lv8-1x7-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to arrange the nationalities based on the given clues. Let's go through each clue step-by-step:

1. **The French is not to the left of the Spanish.**
2. **The Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the French.**
3. **The Spanish is not to the left of the Nigerian.**
4. **The Nigerian is on the far left.**
5. **The French is somewhere to the left of the British.**
6. **The British is on the left of the Chinese.**
7. **The Brazilian is somewhere between the British and the Spanish.**
8. **The Dutch is somewhere between the French and the British.**

Let's start placing the nationalities based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Nigerian is on the far left:**
   - Nigerian (1)

2. **French is not to the left of the Spanish:**
   - This means Spanish cannot be at position 2 if French is at position 1.

3. **Spanish is not to the left of the Nigerian:**
   - Since the Nigerian is at position 1, the Spanish cannot be at position 2 or any position to the left of the Nigerian.

4. **Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the French:**
   - The Brazilian must be positioned before the French.

5. **French is somewhere to the left of the British:**
   - The French must be positioned before the British.

6. **British is on the left of the Chinese:**
   - The British must be positioned before the Chinese.

7. **Brazilian is between the British and the Spanish:**
   - The Brazilian must be positioned such that it is between the British and the Spanish.

8. **Dutch is between the French and the British:**
   - The Dutch must be positioned such that it is between the French and the British.

### Arranging the Clues:

1. **Nigerian (1)**
2. **Spanish (2)** (since Spanish cannot be to the left of the Nigerian)
3. **British (3)** (since British must be after the Nigerian and before the Chinese)
4. **Chinese (4)** (since British must be before the Chinese)
5. **French (5)** (since French must be after the British and before the Dutch)
6. **Dutch (6)** (since Dutch must be between the French and the British)
7. **Brazilian (7)** (since Brazilian must be between the British and the Spanish, and also to the left of the French)

### Final Solution Table:

Lv8-1x7-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

1. **Clue 2:** The owner of the turtle is on the far right (Position 7).
2. **Clue 5:** The owner of the horse is in an even position (Positions 2, 4, or 6).
3. **Clue 4:** The owner of the rat is on the left of the owner of the horse.
4. **Clue 3:** The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
5. **Clue 1:** The owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
6. **Clue 7:** The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.
7. **Clue 9:** The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the left of the owner of the frog.
8. **Clue 6:** The owner of the lizard is not to the left of the owner of the frog.
9. **Clue 8:** The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the owner of the turtle.
10. **Clue 3:** The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
11. **Clue 8:** The owner of the lizard is on the left of the owner of the turtle.

Let's start placing the known positions:

- **Turtle** must be in Position 7.
- **Horse** must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
- **Lizard** must be to the left of the turtle (so Lizard can be in Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).

### Step-by-step placement:

1. **Place Turtle:**
   - Position 7: Turtle

2. **Horse in an Even Position:**
   - Possible positions for Horse: 2, 4, 6

3. **Rat on the Left of Horse:**
   - If Horse is in Position 2, Rat can be in Position 1.
   - If Horse is in Position 4, Rat can be in Positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - If Horse is in Position 6, Rat can be in Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. **Hedgehog to the Right of Horse:**
   - If Horse is in Position 2, Hedgehog can be in Positions 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
   - If Horse is in Position 4, Hedgehog can be in Positions 5, 6, or 7.
   - If Horse is in Position 6, Hedgehog can be in Positions 7.

5. **Hedgehog and Chinchilla Relationship:**
   - Hedgehog is not to the left of Chinchilla.

6. **Frog and Lizard Relationship:**
   - Lizard is not to the left of Frog.
   - Lizard is to the left of Turtle (already placed in Position 7).

7. **Hedgehog and Frog Relationship:**
   - Hedgehog is on the left or right of Frog.
   - Hedgehog is to the left of Frog.

8. **Lizard and Turtle Relationship:**
   - Lizard is to the left of Turtle (already placed in Position 7).

Given these constraints, let's try placing the animals:

- **Position 1:** Rat (since it needs to be to the left of the horse)
- **Position 2:** Horse (since it needs to be in an even position and Rat is already placed)
- **Position 3:** Hedgehog (to the right of Horse)
- **Position 4:** Lizard (to the left of Turtle)
- **Position 5:** Frog (Hedgehog is to the left of Frog)
- **Position 6:** Chinchilla (since Hedgehog is not to the left of Chinchilla)

So, the final arrangement is:

```
|       |  1  |   2   |     3      |    4     |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Pet   | Rat | Horse | Hedgehog   | Lizard   | Frog | Chinchilla | Turtle |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv8-1x7-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each beverage into one of the seven positions while adhering to all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints step-by-step:

1. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.
2. The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.
3. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
4. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.
5. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far right.
6. The person drinking milk is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
7. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking lemonade.
8. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda.
9. The person drinking almond-milk is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking milk.
10. The person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
11. The person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda.

Let's start placing the beverages based on these constraints:

- From constraint 5, we know that iced-tea is in position 7.
- From constraint 8, almond-milk must be to the right of mirinda.
- From constraint 9, almond-milk must be between lemonade and milk.
- From constraint 1, the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.
- From constraint 2, the person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.
- From constraint 3, mirinda is to the left of lemonade.
- From constraint 4, hot-chocolate is to the right of mirinda.
- From constraint 10, juice is to the left of mirinda.
- From constraint 11, juice is not to the right of mirinda.

Let's place the beverages step-by-step:

1. Position 7: iced-tea (from constraint 5)
2. Since almond-milk must be between lemonade and milk (constraint 9), and it must also be to the right of mirinda (constraint 8) and between lemonade and milk (constraint 9), let's try to place them:
   - If we assume mirinda is in position 1, then almond-milk must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If we assume lemonade is in position 5 or 6, then almond-milk must be in position 4 or 5.
   - This means mirinda must be in position 1, almond-milk in position 3, lemonade in position 5, and milk in position 6.

3. This arrangement satisfies:
   - Constraint 1: milk is to the right of almond-milk.
   - Constraint 2: lemonade is to the right of almond-milk.
   - Constraint 3: mirinda is to the left of lemonade.
   - Constraint 4: hot-chocolate is to the right of mirinda (position 4 for mirinda, so hot-chocolate in position 6).
   - Constraint 10: juice is to the left of mirinda (position 1 for mirinda, so juice in position 2).

So, the final arrangement is:

|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |
| Beverage   | juice | lemonade | almond-milk   | hot-chocolate | mirinda | milk | iced-tea |

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |
| Beverage   | juice | lemonade | almond-milk   | hot-chocolate | mirinda | milk | iced-tea |
