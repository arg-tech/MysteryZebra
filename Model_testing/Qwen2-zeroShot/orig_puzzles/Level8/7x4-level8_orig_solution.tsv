Let's start by placing the known positions and then fill in the gaps based on the remaining clues.

### Initial Placement:
- **Clue 13:** The person who's sport is surfing is the argentine. So, Argentine -> Surfing.
- **Clue 11:** The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the person who's sport is surfing is the Argentine, Traveling must be on the left of the Argentine.

- **Clue 4:** The malaysian is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the person who's hobby is photography is on the right of the malaysian, and since the malaysian can't be on the far right, let's assume the malaysian is on position 2 and photography on position 3.

Now we have:

- **Clue 22:** The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person eating mango. So, Mango -> 1st, Fanta -> 2nd.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 11:** The Indonesian drinks soy-milk.
2. **From Clue 9:** The person eating cauliflower is on the far right (position 4).
3. **From Clue 15:** The person whose sport is basketball is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk (Indonesian). This means the basketball person is in position 3.
4. **From Clue 14:** The person whose sport is biathlon is not to the left of the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the biathlon person must be in position 3, but that conflicts with the previous step. Therefore, the biathlon person must be in position 2.
5. **From Clue 12:** The owner of the pony watches animation movies. Since the person eating cauliflower is in position 4, the pony owner cannot be in position 4.
6. **From Clue 8:** The Canadian is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the pony owner watches animation movies and is in position 2 or 3, the Canadian must be in position 1.
7. **From Clue 7:** The Canadian is not to the left of the French. So the French can only be in position 2, 3, or 4.
8. **From Clue 6:** The owner of the pony is between the fan of house and the Argentine. Since the pony owner is in position 2, the Argentine must be in position 3 or 4.

11. **From Clue 17:** The Argentine is on the right of the person watching animation movies. Since the pony owner watches animation movies and is in position 2, the Argentine must be in position 3.
12. **From Clue 18:** The owner of the turtle is somewhere between the person eating onion and the owner of the pony. Since the onion eater is in position 2 and the pony owner is in position 2, there is no space for the turtle owner.
13. **From Clue 19:** The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since the comedy person can only be in position 1 or 2, the bird owner must be in position 1.
14. **From Clue 20:** The fan of R&B is on the left or right of the person eating carrot. Since the carrot eater cannot be in position 4 (cauliflower) and must be in position 1, 2, or 3, the R&B fan must be in position 3.
15. **From Clue 21:** The person watching comedy movies is on the far left or far right. Since the comedy person can only be in position 1 or 4, and the bird owner is in position 1, the comedy person must be in position 4.
16. **From Clue 22:** The fan of R&B is on the far left or far right. Since the R&B fan is in position 3, it must be in position 1 or 4. But since the comedy person is in position 4, the R&B fan must be in position 1.
17. **From Clue 23:** The fan of soul is not to the left of the owner of the pony. Since the pony owner is in position 2, the soul fan must be in position 3 or 4. But since the R&B fan is in position 1 and the comedy person is in position 4, the soul fan must be in position 3.
18. **From Clue 24:** The person eating cauliflower is not to the right of the fan of R&B. Since the R&B fan is in position 1 and the cauliflower eater is in position 4, this is consistent.
19. **From Clue 25:** The fan of R&B is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies. Since the R&B fan is in position 1 and the pony owner watches animation movies and is in position 2, this is consistent.
20. **From Clue 26:** The Canadian is on the left or right of the French. Since the Canadian is in position 1 and the French can be in position 2, 3, or 4, this is consistent.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the Colombian and the person drinking water.
- From Clue 2: The Colombian is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
- From Clue 28: The fan of hip-hop is on the far right.
- Therefore, the Colombian cannot be in position 4, so he must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The person drinking water cannot be in position 1, so he must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- From Clue 26: The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the Colombian.
- From Clue 25: The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.
- This implies that the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1 or 2.
- If the Colombian is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 2 or 3.
- If the Colombian is in position 2, the person drinking water must be in position 3 or 4.
- If the Colombian is in position 3, the person drinking water must be in position 4.
- Given Clue 26, if the Colombian is in position 1, the person drinking iced-tea is also in position 1, which is impossible.
- Therefore, the Colombian must be in position 2, and the person drinking water must be in position 3 or 4.
- Given Clue 25, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the Colombian is in position 2, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1.
- Thus, the person drinking water must be in position 4.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Iced-tea
- Position 2: Colombian
- Position 3: Water
- Position 4: Hip-hop

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of the person driving the boat and the person driving the tram.
- From Clue 20: The person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the Spanish.
- From Clue 13: The person driving the tram is the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
- From Clue 12: The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is the Spanish.
- Therefore, the Spanish is in position 4, and the person driving the tram is in position 4.
- From Clue 20: The person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the Spanish.
- Therefore, the person driving the boat must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 3: Boat
- Position 4: Tram, Spanish, Hip-hop

#### Step 3: Determine the positions of the person drinking coffee and the person driving the tram.
- From Clue 15: The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person driving the tram.
- Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 4, and the person driving the tram must be in position 3.
- But we already have the person driving the tram in position 4, so this must be a contradiction.
- Re-evaluate: The person drinking coffee must be in position 4, and the person driving the tram must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the person drinking coffee is in position 4.

So, we have:
- Position 2: Tram, Spanish, Hip-hop
- Position 4: Coffee

#### Step 4: Determine the positions of the person driving the trike and the person watching zombie movies.
- From Clue 19: The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.
- From Clue 19: The person driving the trike is not in position 4.
- Therefore, the person driving the trike must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- From Clue 19: The person watching zombie movies is in position 3 or 4.
- Since the person driving the tram is in position 2, the person driving the trike must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Trike
- Position 3: Zombie

#### Step 5: Determine the positions of the person driving the subway and the person watching drama movies.
- From Clue 23: The photographer is on the right of the person driving the subway.
- From Clue 23: The photographer is not in position 1 or 2.
- Therefore, the photographer must be in position 3 or 4.
- From Clue 23: The person driving the subway is not in position 4.
- Therefore, the person driving the subway must be in position 1 or 2.
- From Clue 23: The photographer is on the right of the person driving the subway.
- Therefore, the person driving the subway must be in position 1, and the photographer must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Subway
- Position 2: Photographer

#### Step 6: Determine the positions of the person watching epic movies and the person driving the boat.
- From Clue 3: The person watching epic movies is on the right of the accountant.
- From Clue 4: The person driving the boat is not the chef.
- From Clue 11: The chef is on the right of the photographer.
- Therefore, the photographer is in position 2, and the chef is in position 3 or 4.
- From Clue 11: The chef is not to the left of the person whose hobby is camping.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is camping must be in position 1 or 2.
- From Clue 6: The person whose hobby is camping is in an odd position.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is camping must be in position 1.
- From Clue 6: The freelancer is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.
- Therefore, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 3, and the freelancer must be in position 4.
- From Clue 5: The freelancer is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.
- Therefore, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 3, and the freelancer must be in position 4.
- From Clue 3: The person watching epic movies is on the right of the accountant.
- Therefore, the accountant must be in position 1, and the person watching epic movies must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Camping
- Position 2: Epic
- Position 3: Zombie, Freelancer
- Position 4: Coffee, Tram, Spanish, Hip-hop

#### Step 7: Determine the positions of the remaining categories.
- From Clue 16: The fan of country is somewhere between the fan of d&b and the person watching drama movies.
- From Clue 16: The person watching drama movies is in position 2.
- Therefore, the fan of country must be in position 1, and the fan of d&b must be in position 3.
- From Clue 17: The Spanish is somewhere between the person drinking coffee and the person whose hobby is camping.
- Therefore, the Spanish must be in position 3.
- From Clue 17: The person whose hobby is camping is in position 1.
- Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 4.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Camping, Spanish
- Position 2: Epic, Drama
- Position 3: Zombie, Freelancer
- Position 4: Coffee, Tram, Spanish, Hip-hop
