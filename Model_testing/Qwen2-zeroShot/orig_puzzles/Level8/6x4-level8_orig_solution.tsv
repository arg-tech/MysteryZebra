2. From **Clue 14**, the person watching animation movies (rock) must be in position 4.
3. From **Clue 17**, the person whose hobby is writing (sprite) must be in position 3 because it’s on the right of the person drinking water (sudoku).
4. From **Clue 10**, the person drinking coffee (writing) is to the left of the person whose hobby is writing (sprite), so the person drinking coffee is in position 1.
5. From **Clue 12**, the person watching satire movies must be in position 4 (already occupied by rock), so it must be in position 3.
6. From **Clue 8**, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1.
7. From **Clue 16**, the Argentine is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is puzzles. Since the person drinking water is in position 2, the person whose hobby is puzzles must be in position 1 (coffee) or 3 (sprite). Since the person drinking coffee is in position 1, the person whose hobby is puzzles must be in position 3.
8. From **Clue 15**, the Russian must be in position 4 (superhero) or 3 (satire). Since position 4 is occupied by superhero, the Russian must be in position 3 (satire).
9. From **Clue 3**, the Argentine is on the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles (puzzles in position 3), so the Argentine must be in position 4 (superhero).
10. From **Clue 18**, the fan of blues (blues) must be to the left of the American (indie), so the fan of blues must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is occupied by coffee, the fan of blues must be in position 2.
11. From **Clue 21**, the fan of indie (indie) must be to the right of the person drinking soy-milk (soy-milk), so the fan of indie must be in position 4 (superhero), but that is already taken. So, the fan of indie must be in position 3 (satire).
12. From **Clue 22**, the person driving the airplane (airplane) is not the person whose hobby is puzzles (puzzles in position 3), so the person driving the airplane must be in position 1 (coffee) or 2 (blues). Since position 1 is occupied by coffee, the person driving the airplane must be in position 2 (blues).
13. From **Clue 7**, the fan of blues (blues) is the person driving the ship, so the person driving the ship must be in position 2.
14. From **Clue 19**, the person drinking water (sudoku) is on the left or right of the fan of rock (rock), which is in position 4, so the person drinking water must be in position 3.
15. From **Clue 9**, the fan of rock (rock) is not to the right of the fan of indie (indie), so the fan of rock must be in position 1.
16. From **Clue 6**, the person watching drama movies (drama) is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane (airplane), which is in position 2, so the person watching drama must be in position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is occupied by coffee, the person watching drama must be in position 3.
17. From **Clue 20**, the person whose hobby is writing (sprite) is not to the left of the person drinking water (sudoku), which is true since sprite is in position 3 and water is in position 2.
18. From **Clue 23**, the fan of blues (blues) is not to the left of the person drinking water (sudoku), which is true since blues is in position 2 and water is in position 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the positions for the fans of music genres:**
   - From clue 13, the fan of Pop must be in an even position (2 or 4).
   - From clue 18 and 21, the person with Sudoku must be on both sides of the fan of Pop. Thus, the fan of Pop can only be in position 4.
   - The fan of Punk (Traveling) is on the right of the fan of Punk, so it cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the fan of Punk must be in position 3.
   - The fan of Funk is on the left of the person with Sudoku, and the person with Sudoku is on the right of the fan of Funk. This means the fan of Funk can be in position 1 or 2.

2. **Determine the nationality of the fan of Pop:**
   - From clue 9, the Dutch is the fan of Pop, so the Dutch must be in position 4.

3. **Determine the position of the sport:**
   - From clue 19, the person with Soccer is on the far left or far right. Since the Dutch is in position 4, the person with Soccer must be in position 1 or 3.
   - From clue 17, the Russian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is Parkour. If the person with Soccer is in position 1, then the Russian cannot be in position 2 because the Dutch is in 4. So, the person with Soccer must be in position 3.
   - From clue 7, the person with Parkour is to the left of the person with Gardening. Since the person with Soccer is in position 3, the person with Parkour must be in position 2.
   - From clue 17, the Russian is on the left or right of the person with Parkour. Since the person with Parkour is in position 2, the Russian must be in position 1.

4. **Determine the position of the nationality:**
   - The Russian is in position 1, so the Dutch is in position 4.
   - From clue 15, the Musician is not to the right of the Dutch, so the Musician must be in position 2 or 3. Since the person with Parkour is in position 2, the Musician must be in position 3.
   - From clue 14, the Dancer is on the left of the fan of Funk. Since the fan of Funk is in position 1 or 2, and the Dancer cannot be in position 1 (Russian), the Dancer must be in position 1.
   - From clue 16, the Canadian is not to the left of the Bartender. Since the Canadian is in position 1, the Bartender must be in position 3 or 4. But since the Musician is in position 3, the Bartender must be in position 4.

5. **Determine the position of the hobby:**
   - From clue 1, the person with Sudoku is somewhere to the right of the Australian. Since the Australian cannot be in position 4 (Dutch), the Australian must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Dancer is in position 1, the Australian must be in position 2.
   - From clue 4, the person with Sudoku is not the Russian, so the person with Sudoku must be in position 3 or 4. Since the Musician is in position 3, the person with Sudoku must be in position 4.
   - From clue 22, the Russian is on the left of the Musician, so the Russian must be in position 1.
   - From clue 21, the person with Sudoku is on the right of the fan of Funk. Since the fan of Funk is in position 1, the person with Sudoku must be in position 2.

Lv8-6x4-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and deduce information from each clue. Let's go through the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking iced-tea is not the Brazilian.
2. **Clue 2**: The person whose sport is handball is the Brazilian.

4. **Clue 15**: The person driving the tram is the person drinking tea.

From Clues 2 and 19, we know:

- The Brazilian is watching time-travel movies.

From Clues 1 and 15, since the Brazilian is the one driving the tram and drinking tea, we have:
- The Brazilian drinks tea.
- The Brazilian drives the tram.

Since the Brazilian drinks tea and drives the tram, we can start filling in the table:
```
|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |        4        |
| Beverage      |    tea   |             |              |                 |

23. **Clue 24**: The person driving the tram is the person whose sport is soccer.
24. **Clue 25**: The person drinking coffee is not the person watching sports movies.

From Clue 23, the architect is not to the right of the project-manager, so the project-manager must be before the architect in the sequence. From Clue 22, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking tea, and from Clue 24, the person driving the tram is the person whose sport is soccer.

Let's continue with the remaining deductions:
