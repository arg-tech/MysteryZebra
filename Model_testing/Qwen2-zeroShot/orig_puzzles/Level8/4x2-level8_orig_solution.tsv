Lv8-4x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and determine the correct placement for each category (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre).

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person watching action movies is not to the right of the person eating spinach.**
   - This means that if someone eats spinach, they must be in a position to the left of the person who watches action movies.

2. **The person eating spinach is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.**
   - This means that the person who likes board games must be to the right of the person who eats spinach.

3. **The person drinking coffee is in an even position.**
   - The even positions are 2. So, the person drinking coffee is in position 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 2 (even) for coffee:**
   - Since the person drinking coffee is in position 2, we can place ""coffee"" in position 2.
   
2. **Spinach and Action Movies:**
   - From Clue 1, the person watching action movies cannot be to the right of the person eating spinach.
   - From Clue 2, the person eating spinach must be to the left of the person who likes board games.
   - Therefore, the person eating spinach must be in position 1 (the only position to the left of position 2 where coffee is placed).
   - Position 2 (coffee) is now confirmed.
   - The person who eats spinach is in position 1.
   - The person who watches action movies must be in position 2 or 3 (since position 1 is spinach and position 2 is coffee). But since position 2 is coffee, it must be position 3.
   
3. **Board Games:**
   - From Clue 2, the person who likes board games must be to the right of the person who eats spinach.
   - The person who eats spinach is in position 1, so the person who likes board games must be in position 3 (action movies) or position 4.
   - Since position 3 is action movies, the person who likes board games must be in position 4.
   
4. **Remaining Categories:**
   - The only remaining food is spinach, which is already placed in position 1.
   - The only remaining beverage is tea, which must be in position 2 (coffee is already there).
   - The only remaining hobby is chess, which must be in position 4 (board games are already there).
   - The only remaining movie genre is sports, which must be in position 1 (action movies are already there).

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      |   tea   |    coffee   |
| Food          | spinach |     -      |
| Hobby         | chess   |    -       |
| Movie-Genre   | sports  |    action   |

### Final Solution:

```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      |   tea   |    coffee   |
| Food          | spinach |            |
| Hobby         | chess   |            |

Lv8-4x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each category (Beverage, Hobby, Job, Transport) into the appropriate cells based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues one by one and deduce the correct placements.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person drinking iced-tea is on the far right.**
   - This means the 2nd column must be for the person who drinks iced-tea.
   
2. **The person whose hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the librarian.**
   - This means the hobby of filmmaking cannot be in the 2nd column and must be in the 1st column because the librarian can only be in the 2nd column.

3. **The software-developer is not to the right of the librarian.**
   - Since the librarian is in the 2nd column, the software-developer cannot be in the 2nd column. Therefore, the software-developer must be in the 1st column.

4. **The person driving the boat is not the person whose hobby is woodworking.**
   - This means the person who drives the boat and the person who has woodworking as a hobby cannot be in the same row.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the categories:

- From clue 1, iced-tea is in the 2nd column.
- From clue 2, filmmaking must be in the 1st column.
- From clue 3, the software-developer must be in the 1st column.
- From clue 4, the person driving the boat cannot have woodworking as a hobby.

Since the software-developer is in the 1st column, the only remaining option for the 1st column is filmmaking. Thus, the 2nd column must be for the software-developer.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|             |         1          |      2      |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Beverage    | iced-tea           | almond-milk  |
| Hobby       | filmmaking         | woodworking |
| Job         | software-developer | librarian   |
| Transport   | snowmobile         | boat        |

### Final Solution Table:

Lv8-4x2-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and fill in the table step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The Australian is in an odd position.
2. The Japanese is not to the right of the owner of the ferret.
3. The fan of folk is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The Australian is in an odd position.
This means the Australian must be either in position 1 or 2 (but since it's odd, only position 1).

Let's place ""Australian"" in position 1 for now:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   |            |          |
| Music-Genre   |            |          |
| Nationality   | Australian |          |
| Pet           |            |          |
```

#### Clue 2: The Japanese is not to the right of the owner of the ferret.
This means if the Japanese is in position 2, the owner of the ferret cannot be in position 1.

Since we have placed the Australian in position 1, the Japanese can only be in position 2, and the owner of the ferret cannot be in position 1. This means the ferret owner must be in position 2.

Let's place ""Japanese"" in position 2 and ""Ferret"" in position 2:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   |            |          |
| Music-Genre   |            |          |
| Nationality   | Australian | Japanese |
| Pet           |            | Ferret   |
```

#### Clue 3: The fan of folk is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies.
Since the Australian is in position 1 and the Japanese is in position 2, the only positions left for the genres are 1 and 2.

Given that the fan of folk is to the left of the person watching thriller movies, and considering the positions already filled, the only way to satisfy this is:
- Folk in position 1
- Thriller in position 2

Let's place ""Folk"" in position 1 and ""Thriller"" in position 2:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Folk       | Thriller |
| Music-Genre   |            |          |
| Nationality   | Australian | Japanese |
| Pet           |            | Ferret   |
```

Now, the only genres left for music are ""metal"" and ""epic"". Since the fan of folk is to the left of the person watching thriller movies, and we've already placed ""folk"" in position 1 and ""thriller"" in position 2, the only way to fit the remaining genres is:
- Metal in position 1
- Epic in position 2

Let's place ""Metal"" in position 1 and ""Epic"" in position 2:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Folk       | Thriller |
| Music-Genre   | Metal      | Epic     |
| Nationality   | Australian | Japanese |
| Pet           |            | Ferret   |
```

Finally, we need to assign the pets. The only pets left are ""cat"" and ""ferret"". Since the ferret is already assigned to position 2, the cat must be assigned to position 1.

Let's place ""Cat"" in position 1:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Folk       | Thriller |
| Music-Genre   | Metal      | Epic     |
| Nationality   | Australian | Japanese |
| Pet           | Cat        | Ferret   |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Folk       | Thriller |
| Music-Genre   | Metal      | Epic     |
| Nationality   | Australian | Japanese |
| Pet           | Cat        | Ferret   |

Lv8-4x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze and deduce step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The German is somewhere to the right of the Nurse.**
   - This means if we place the Nurse in position 1, the German must be in position 2.
   
2. **The person whose hobby is singing is not to the left of the person driving the tram.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of singing cannot be in position 1 if the person driving the tram is in position 2.
   
3. **The person driving the tram is on the left of the person whose hobby is singing.**
   - This means if the tram is driven by someone, that person must be in position 1 and the person with the hobby of singing must be in position 2.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the Nurse and the German
From clue 1, we know:
- If the Nurse is in position 1, the German must be in position 2.
- If the Nurse is in position 2, the German must be in position 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

- **Scenario 1: Nurse in position 1, German in position 2**
  - This satisfies clue 1.
  
- **Scenario 2: Nurse in position 2, German in position 1**
  - This also satisfies clue 1.

We need to further check which scenario fits all the clues.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of the Tram and the Person with the Hobby of Singing
From clue 3, we know:
- The person driving the tram must be in position 1.
- The person with the hobby of singing must be in position 2.

This directly conflicts with Scenario 1 because it would mean the German (position 2) is not next to the person with the hobby of singing (position 1).

Therefore, Scenario 2 must be correct:
- Nurse in position 2, German in position 1.

Now, we can place the Tram and the Person with the Hobby of Singing:
- Tram in position 1.
- Person with the Hobby of Singing in position 2.

#### Step 3: Determine the remaining positions for the Designer and the Polish person
Since we have already placed the Nurse, German, Tram, and Singing, the remaining positions are for the Designer and the Polish person.

From clue 2, the person with the hobby of singing is not to the left of the person driving the tram, which is already satisfied.

Thus, the remaining positions are:
- Position 3: Designer
- Position 4: Polish person

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1    |    2     |
| Hobby         |  Singing|   Sudoku  |
| Job           |  Tram  |  Designer|
| Nationality   |  Polish|   German  |
| Transport     |  Airplane|  Tram    |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv8-4x2-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given clues to fill in the table.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.
2. The person whose sport is basketball is not to the right of the French.
3. The French is on the right of the Japanese.
4. The person whose sport is basketball is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the person driving the scooter.
- From clue 1, the person driving the scooter (Transport: scooter) is on the far left.

So, we have:
```
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Nationality   |             |            |
| Sport         |             |            |
| Transport     |  Scooter    |            |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the nationality of the person driving the scooter.
- Since the French is on the right of the Japanese (clue 3), the Japanese must be in position 1 and the French in position 2.
- Therefore, the person driving the scooter (position 1) is Japanese.

So, we update the table:
```
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Nationality   | Japanese    | French     |
| Sport         |             |            |
| Transport     |  Scooter    |            |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the sport of the Japanese.
- From clue 2, the person whose sport is basketball is not to the right of the French.
- From clue 4, the person whose sport is basketball is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.

Since the Japanese is in position 1 and the French in position 2, the person with basketball cannot be the Japanese (as they would be to the right of the French).

Therefore, the Japanese must be watching scientific movies.

So, we update the table:
```
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific  |            |
| Nationality   | Japanese    | French     |
| Sport         | Basketball  |            |
| Transport     |  Scooter    |            |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the sport of the French.
- From clue 4, the person whose sport is basketball is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.
- This confirms that the French is watching scientific movies and the Japanese is playing basketball.

So, we update the table:
```
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific  | Documentary|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | French     |
| Sport         | Basketball  | Surfing    |
| Transport     |  Scooter    |            |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the remaining sport and movie genre.
- The only sports left are surfing and scientific movies.
- The only movie genres left are documentary and basketball.

From clue 4, the person whose sport is basketball is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. So, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2, which matches our table.

So, the final table is:
```
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific  | Documentary|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | French     |
| Sport         | Basketball  | Surfing    |
| Transport     |  Scooter    |            |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific  | Documentary|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | French     |
| Sport         | Basketball  | Surfing    |
| Transport     |  Scooter    |            |

Lv8-4x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically place each piece of information into the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person eating cherry.
2. The paramedic is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
3. The person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person eating garlic.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Foods and Jobs
We have two foods: cherry and garlic.
We have two jobs: paramedic and software-developer.

#### Step 2: Identify the Pets and Transport
We have two pets: chinchilla and hedgehog.
We have two means of transport: snowmobile and train.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
Clue 1 states that the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person eating cherry. This means if someone eats cherry in column 1, the person driving the snowmobile must be in column 2.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
Clue 2 states that the paramedic is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. This means if someone owns a hedgehog in column 1, the paramedic must be in column 2.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 3
Clue 3 states that the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person eating garlic. This means if someone eats garlic in column 2, the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in column 1.

### Constructing the Table

Let's start with the most restrictive clue first, which is Clue 3.

#### Clue 3 Analysis
- If the person eating garlic is in column 2, the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in column 1.
- Therefore, the person driving the snowmobile must be in column 2 if the person eating garlic is in column 1.

Given these constraints, let's try placing the information:

1. **Person Eating Cherry** (Clue 1):
   - If the person eating cherry is in column 1, the person driving the snowmobile must be in column 2.

2. **Paramedic and Hedgehog** (Clue 2):
   - If the owner of the hedgehog is in column 1, the paramedic must be in column 2.

3. **Garlic and Snowmobile** (Clue 3):
   - If the person eating garlic is in column 2, the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in column 1.

Let's start by placing the food items:

- Place ""cherry"" in column 1.
- Since the person driving the snowmobile must be to the right of the person eating cherry, place ""snowmobile"" in column 2 for the person driving it.
- Place ""garlic"" in column 2 (since it cannot be in column 1 due to Clue 3).

Now we need to place the remaining items:

- The paramedic and hedgehog must be placed such that the paramedic is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
- If the owner of the hedgehog is in column 1, the paramedic must be in column 2.

Given the above, let's place the remaining items:

- If the owner of the hedgehog is in column 1, the paramedic must be in column 2.
- The remaining pet (chinchilla) can be placed in column 1 or 2, but since the paramedic is already in column 2, place the chinchilla in column 1.

### Final Table

```
|             |         1          |     2      |
| Food        | cherry             | garlic     |
| Job         | chinchilla         | paramedic  |
| Pet         | hedgehog           | software-developer |
| Transport   | snowmobile         | train      |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv8-4x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The person watching spy movies is not to the left of the Australian.
2. **Clue 2**: The person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.
3. **Clue 3**: The Australian is somewhere to the right of the person eating peach.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the beverage ""milk"" and the movie genre ""spy"".
- From Clue 2, the person watching spy movies must be either to the left or right of the person drinking milk.
- From Clue 1, the person watching spy movies cannot be to the left of the Australian.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Left
- Position 2: Right

We can test both scenarios for Clue 2:

**Scenario 1: Spy is to the left of Milk**
- If Spy is in Position 1 (left), then Milk must be in Position 2 (right).
- This would mean the Australian cannot be in Position 1 (left) because the Australian cannot be to the left of the Spy.

**Scenario 2: Spy is to the right of Milk**
- If Spy is in Position 2 (right), then Milk can be in Position 1 (left) or Position 2 (right).

Given Clue 1, if Spy is in Position 2 (right), then the Australian must be in Position 2 (right) as well (since the Australian cannot be to the left of the Spy). This would contradict Clue 3 because the Australian would have to be to the right of the Peach eater, which means Peach eater must be in Position 1 (left).

Therefore, **Spy must be in Position 1 (left)** and **Milk must be in Position 2 (right)**.

#### Step 2: Determine the position of the Australian.
- From Clue 1, the Australian cannot be to the left of the Spy, so the Australian must be in Position 2 (right).

#### Step 3: Determine the position of the Peach eater.
- From Clue 3, the Australian (in Position 2) must be to the right of the Peach eater. Therefore, the Peach eater must be in Position 1 (left).

#### Step 4: Fill in the remaining categories.
- We now have:
  - Position 1: Peach eater, Spy movie watcher, drinks Milk
  - Position 2: Australian, eats Zucchini, watches Mystery movie

### Final Table:
```
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |  Milk   |           |
| Food          |  Peach  |  Zucchini  |
| Movie-Genre   |  Spy    |  Mystery   |
| Nationality   | Italian |  Australian|
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv8-4x2-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Breakdown:
1. The dancer is on the far left.
2. The person driving the helicopter is not to the right of the person eating lemon.
3. The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the helicopter.

### Initial Setup:
```
|             |   1    |       2        |
| Beverage    |        | soy-           |
| Food        |        |                |
| Job         |        |                |
| Transport   |        |                |
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1: The dancer is on the far left.**
   - This means the dancer is in position 1 for the job column.

```
|             |   1    |       2        |
| Beverage    |        | soy-           |
| Food        |        |                |
| Job         | Dancer |                |
| Transport   |        |                |
```

2. **Clue 2: The person driving the helicopter is not to the right of the person eating lemon.**
   - This means if the person eating lemon is in position 2, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 1.
   - If the person eating lemon is in position 1, the person driving the helicopter can be in either position 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 3: The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the helicopter.**
   - This means the person drinking milk cannot be in position 2 if the person driving the helicopter is in position 1 (because it would violate clue 3).

### Analyzing the Clues:

- Let's assume the person eating lemon is in position 2. Then, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 1.
- The person drinking milk must be in position 1 (since it is to the left of the person driving the helicopter).

So, we have:
- Position 1 (Beverage): Milk
- Position 1 (Job): Dancer (from Clue 1)
- Position 2 (Beverage): Soy-milk

Now, we need to assign the remaining items (lemon, cherry, security-guard, boat) to positions 1 and 2 for food, job, and transport.

### Assigning Remaining Items:

- Since the person eating lemon must be in position 2 for the food column, the person eating lemon is in position 2.
- The remaining food item (cherry) must be in position 1.
- The remaining job (security-guard) must be in position 2.
- The remaining transport (boat) must be in position 2.

### Final Table:

```
|             |   1    |       2        |
| Beverage    | Milk   | Soy-milk       |
| Food        | Cherry | Lemon         |
| Job         | Dancer | Security-guard |
| Transport   | Boat   | Helicopter    |
```

### Final Solution:

```

Lv8-4x2-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person eating tomato is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa.
2. **Clue 2:** The fan of d&b is not to the left of the person watching adventure movies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is not the fan of d&b.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Possible Positions for Each Category
We have two columns (1 and 2) and four categories (food, hobby, movie genre, music genre).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- The person eating tomato must be to the left of the fan of salsa.
- This means if someone is eating tomato, they cannot be in column 2, because there is no column to their right.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
- The fan of d&b is not to the left of the person watching adventure movies.
- This means that the person watching adventure movies cannot be directly to the left of the fan of d&b.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 3
- The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is not the fan of d&b.
- This means these two cannot be the same person.

### Arranging Based on Clues:

1. **Tomato (T) vs Salsa (S):**
   - T must be in column 1 because it has to be to the left of S.
   - Therefore, S must be in column 2.

2. **D&B (d&b) vs Adventure (A):**
   - d&b cannot be to the left of A.
   - This means A cannot be in column 1 if d&b is in column 1, and vice versa.

3. **Rock Climbing (R) vs D&B:**
   - R cannot be the same as d&b.
   - This means R and d&b must be in different rows.

### Final Table Arrangement:

Given the constraints, let's place the items in a way that satisfies all conditions:

|               |     1     |       2       |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Food          | Tomato    | Pepper        |
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Puzzles      |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Fantasy       |
| Music-Genre   | D&B       | Salsa         |

### Verification:
1. **Clue 1:** Tomato (1) is to the left of Salsa (2).
2. **Clue 2:** D&B (1) is not to the left of Adventure (2).
3. **Clue 3:** Rock-climbing (1) is not D&B (1).

All conditions are satisfied.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |       2       |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Food          | Tomato    | Pepper        |
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Puzzles      |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Fantasy       |
| Music-Genre   | D&B       | Salsa         |

Lv8-4x2-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the car is the person driving the car (redundant and doesn't provide new information).
3. **Clue 3:** The person eating lettuce is somewhere to the right of the doctor.
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the car is not to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person eating lettuce.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- The person eating lettuce is to the right of the doctor.
- This means the doctor cannot be in position 2 for both food and job (since there would be no room for the person eating lettuce).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- The person driving the car is not to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
- This means the person driving the car must be in a position to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 5
- The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person eating lettuce.
- This means the person eating lettuce must be in a position to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.

#### Step 4: Combine Clues 4 and 5
- From Clue 4, the person driving the car is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
- From Clue 5, the person eating lettuce is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
- Therefore, the person driving the car must be in position 1, and the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 1
- The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
- Given that the person driving the car is in position 1 and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2, we need to place the cabbage and lettuce eaters and their respective hobbies.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 3
- The person eating lettuce is to the right of the doctor.
- Since the person driving the car (position 1) is not the doctor, the doctor must be in position 2 (since the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2).

#### Step 7: Final Placement
- Position 1: Car (Driver)
- Position 2: Snowmobile (Driver), Doctor, Eating Lettuce
- Position 3: Cabbage Eater (Not Writing)
- Position 4: Writing (Not Eating Cabbage)

Given these placements:
- The person eating cabbage cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- The person writing cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- The person eating lettuce is in position 2 (doctor).

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|             |    1    |         2          |
| Food        | Car    | Lettuce            |
| Hobby       | Writing| Doctor             |
| Job         |        | Software-developer |
| Transport   | Car    | Snowmobile         |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |    1    |         2          |
| Food        | Car    | Lettuce            |
| Hobby       | Writing| Doctor             |
