This is the final solution based on the given clues."
Lv8-6x7-7	"Solving this complex logic puzzle requires a systematic approach, often involving elimination and logical deduction. Let's break down the process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify Fixed Positions
1. **Owner of the turtle**: From clue 44, the owner of the turtle is in position 1.
2. **Person eating blueberry**: From clue 2, the owner of the turtle (position 1) is not to the right of the person eating blueberry. Thus, the person eating blueberry must be in position 2.
3. **Person watching horror movies**: From clue 17, the Brazilian watches horror movies.
4. **Person eating eggplant**: From clue 58, the person eating eggplant is in the middle, which is position 4.

### Step 2: Deduce More Positions
5. **Person drinking water**: From clue 10, the person drinking water is not to the left of the person eating eggplant. Since the person eating eggplant is in position 4, the person drinking water can only be in positions 5, 6, or 7.
6. **Person eating spinach**: From clue 52, the person eating spinach is on the left or right of the Dutch. Also, from clue 51, the owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. The owner of the rabbit cannot be to the right of the person drinking lemonade (clue 45), so the owner of the rabbit must be in position 3. Therefore, the person eating spinach must be in position 5 (since it's to the right of the Dutch and to the left of the person drinking juice).

### Step 3: Continue with Clues
7. **Person drinking juice**: From clue 22, the person drinking juice is to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Also, from clue 27, the person who's hobby is chess is to the right of the person watching disaster movies. The person watching disaster movies cannot be in position 1 (turtle owner) or 2 (blueberry eater). Therefore, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 3, making the person who's hobby is chess in position 4 (same as the person eating spinach). Hence, the person drinking juice must be in position 6.

8. **Person drinking milk**: From clue 23, the person drinking milk is not to the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 2 (blueberry eater), the person drinking milk can only be in position 5 (same as the person eating spinach).

9. **Person drinking tea**: From clue 30, the person drinking tea is not the owner of the goat. The owner of the goat must be in position 3 (same as the person eating spinach), so the person drinking tea must be in position 7.

10. **Person drinking 7up**: From clue 4, the French is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the French cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 (positions occupied by turtle owner, blueberry eater, disaster movie watcher, chess hobbyist, and juice drinker respectively), the person drinking 7up must be in position 5 (same as the person eating spinach and drinking milk).

11. **Person drinking fanta**: From clue 5, the Malaysian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. Since the Malaysian cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (positions occupied by turtle owner, blueberry eater, disaster movie watcher, chess hobbyist, juice drinker, and milk drinker respectively), the person drinking fanta must be in position 7 (same as the person drinking tea).

### Step 4: Finalize Remaining Hobbies and Foods
12. **Person who's hobby is baking**: From clue 20, the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (positions occupied by turtle owner, blueberry eater, disaster movie watcher, chess hobbyist, juice drinker, and milk drinker respectively), the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 7 (same as the person drinking tea and fanta).

13. **Person who's hobby is video-games**: From clue 33, the person who's hobby is video-games is between the person who's hobby is sudoku and the person drinking fanta. The person who's hobby is sudoku must be in position 6 (same as the juice drinker), so the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 5 (same as the spinach eater and milk drinker).

14. **Person who's hobby is puzzles**: From clue 29, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (positions occupied by turtle owner, blueberry eater, disaster movie watcher, chess hobbyist, and juice drinker respectively), the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 7 (same as the person drinking tea and fanta).

15. **Person who's hobby is chess**: From clue 25, the Malaysian is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. The person who's hobby is chess must be in position 3 (same as the spinach eater and rabbit owner), and the Malaysian must be in position 7 (same as the person drinking tea and fanta).

16. **Person who's hobby is board-games**: From clue 50, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the Indonesian. The Indonesian must be in position 1 (same as the turtle owner), and the person who's hobby is board-games must be in position 6 (same as the juice drinker).
