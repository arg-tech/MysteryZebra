Lv8-4x5-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate items in the correct positions. Let's go through the clues step-by-step and fill out the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is sailing is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
2. **Clue 9:** The fan of electronic is on the far left or far right.
3. **Clue 14:** The owner of the cat is on the far left.
4. **Clue 16:** The owner of the bird is not to the right of the fan of trance.
5. **Clue 18:** The person who's sport is sailing is somewhere to the left of the person eating pumpkin.
6. **Clue 20:** The person who's sport is rowing is not the fan of pop.
7. **Clue 21:** The person who's sport is rowing is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
8. **Clue 23:** The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
9. **Clue 26:** The person who's sport is sailing is not the owner of the rat.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- Position 1 must be occupied by the fan of electronic or the owner of the cat.
- Position 3 must be occupied by the person who's sport is sailing.

Since the owner of the cat is on the far left (position 1), and the person who's sport is sailing is in an odd position, it means that the person who's sport is sailing cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 3.

### Filling the Table:

Next, let's use Clue 15 and Clue 25 to determine the position of the person eating pumpkin:
- **Clue 15:** The person eating pumpkin is not to the left of the owner of the bird.
- **Clue 25:** The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin.

Since the owner of the cat is in position 1, the person eating pumpkin cannot be in position 1 or 2. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the person eating pumpkin are 4 or 5. However, since the person who's sport is climbing is either to the left or right of the person eating pumpkin, and considering the other constraints, the person eating pumpkin must be in position 5.

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 6 to determine the position of the person eating pumpkin:
- **Clue 2:** The person eating pumpkin is not to the right of the person eating cauliflower.
- **Clue 6:** The person eating pumpkin is somewhere to the left of the fan of reggae.

Given the constraints, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 4, as the person eating pumpkin is in position 5 and cannot be to the right of the person eating cauliflower.

- **Clue 8:** The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person eating peas.
- **Clue 22:** The person eating eggplant is somewhere between the owner of the bird and the owner of the rat.

Since the person eating cauliflower is in position 4, the person who's sport is rowing must be in position 2, and the person eating peas must be in position 3. The person eating eggplant must be in position 1, and the person eating nectarine must be in position 5.

Lv8-4x5-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is writing is on the far right (Position 5).
2. **Clue 11:** The person watching epic movies is on the far right (Position 5).

From Clues 1 and 11, we can conclude:
- Position 5: Writing & Epic Movies

3. **Clue 5:** The person driving the roller is the person who's hobby is cooking.
4. **Clue 2:** The person driving the roller is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.

From Clue 3 and 4, we can conclude:
- Position 5: Cooking & Roller

5. **Clue 7:** The person driving the helicopter is somewhere between the person driving the roller and the fan of country.
6. **Clue 17:** The person driving the subway is in an odd position (Positions 1, 3, or 5).

From Clue 7, since the person driving the roller is in Position 5, and the person driving the helicopter is between them and the fan of country, the only possible positions for the fan of country are Positions 1 or 3. Since the person driving the subway must be in an odd position, it cannot be in Position 5 (occupied by Writing & Epic Movies). Therefore:
- Position 1 or 3: Fan of Country
- Position 3 or 1: Helicopter

7. **Clue 9:** The person who's hobby is drawing is not to the right of the person watching satire movies.
8. **Clue 12:** The person watching satire movies is not the person who's hobby is card-games.
9. **Clue 10:** The person driving the subway is the person watching family movies.
10. **Clue 16:** The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching satire movies.

From Clue 10, we know:
- Position 4: Subway & Family Movies

Since the person watching epic movies is on the far right (Position 5), and they are to the right of the person watching satire movies, the person watching satire movies must be in Position 3 or 1. Given that the person driving the subway is in an odd position (Position 4), the fan of country must be in Position 1, and the person driving the helicopter must be in Position 3.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Fan of Country & Helicopter
- Position 3: Drawing & Subways & Family Movies
- Position 5: Writing & Epic Movies

11. **Clue 13:** The person who's hobby is drawing is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
12. **Clue 8:** The person watching comedy movies is the person driving the roller.
13. **Clue 6:** The fan of electronic is not to the left of the person driving the roller.
14. **Clue 15:** The person driving the roller is not to the right of the person driving the roller (redundant).

From Clue 12, we know:
- Position 2: Comedy Movies & Roller

Since the fan of electronic is not to the left of the person driving the roller (Position 2), and the fan of electronic is not in Position 1 (Fan of Country), it must be in Position 4. But Position 4 is already occupied by the person driving the subway (Family Movies). Therefore, the fan of electronic must be in Position 1, and the person driving the helicopter must be in Position 3 (Drawing & Subways & Family Movies).

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Fan of Electronic & Helicopter
- Position 3: Drawing & Subways & Family Movies
- Position 4: Subway & Family Movies
- Position 5: Writing & Epic Movies

15. **Clue 18:** The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of jazz.
16. **Clue 19:** The person watching action movies is on the far left or far right.
17. **Clue 20:** The fan of electronic is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.
18. **Clue 21:** The person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling.

From Clue 19, the person watching action movies is either in Position 1 or 5. Since Position 1 is occupied by the fan of electronic and Position 5 is occupied by writing, the person watching action movies must be in Position 1.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Fan of Electronic & Helicopter & Action Movies
- Position 3: Drawing & Subways & Family Movies
- Position 4: Subway & Family Movies
- Position 5: Writing & Epic Movies

From Clue 18, the fan of trance is to the left of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of electronic is in Position 1, the fan of trance must be in Position 2, and the fan of jazz must be in Position 3 (Drawing & Subways & Family Movies).

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Fan of Electronic & Helicopter & Action Movies
- Position 2: Fan of Trance
- Position 3: Fan of Jazz & Drawing & Subways & Family Movies
- Position 4: Subway & Family Movies
- Position 5: Writing & Epic Movies

19. **Clue 2:** The person driving the roller is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.

From Clue 2, the person driving the roller is in Position 2 (Fan of Trance) and the person who's hobby is cooking is in Position 5 (Writing).

Finally, we need to assign the remaining hobbies and movie genres:

- Position 1: Fan of Electronic & Helicopter & Action Movies
- Position 2: Fan of Trance & Cooking
- Position 3: Fan of Jazz & Drawing & Subways & Family Movies
- Position 4: Subway & Family Movies

Based on these clues, let's fill in the table:

|             |    1     |     2      |        3        |      4      |     5     |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Beverage    | Coffee   |            |                 |             | Juice     |
| Job         |          |            |                 |             | Accountant|
| Pet         |          |            | Hedgehog        |             | Rabbit    |
| Transport   |          |            | Jet-ski         |             | Scooter   |

Now, let's assign the remaining details:

- Since the Fisherman is in Position 3 and drinks Fanta, and the Electrician is between the person drinking Water and the person driving the Bike:
  - Position 2 must be the person driving the Bike.
  - Position 4 must be the person drinking Water.
  - Position 1 is Coffee.
  - Position 5 is Juice and Accountant.
  - The owner of the Hedgehog is in Position 3 (Jet-ski), so the owner of the Hedgehog is in Position 3.
  - The owner of the Lizard is to the right of the owner of the Hedgehog, so the owner of the Lizard is in Position 4.
  - The owner of the Rabbit is the Fisherman (Position 3).
  - The owner of the Horse is to the right of the owner of the Bird, so the owner of the Horse is in Position 5 (Scooter).
