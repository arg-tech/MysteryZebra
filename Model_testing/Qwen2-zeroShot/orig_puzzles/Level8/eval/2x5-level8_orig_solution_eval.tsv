Lv8-2x5-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person eating tomato is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating cherry is the person driving the motorbike.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the motorbike is the person eating cherry (redundant with Clue 2).
4. **Clue 4:** The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person driving the van.
5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the ship.
6. **Clue 6:** The person eating tomato is not to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
7. **Clue 7:** The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.
8. **Clue 8:** The person eating tomato is not the person driving the ship.
9. **Clue 9:** The person eating nectarine is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi.
10. **Clue 10:** The person driving the boat is not the person eating pepper.
11. **Clue 11:** The person driving the motorbike is on the far right (position 5).
12. **Clue 12:** The person eating pepper is on the right of the person driving the boat.
13. **Clue 13:** The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person driving the ship.
14. **Clue 14:** The person eating nectarine is somewhere between the person eating tomato and the person driving the ship.
15. **Clue 15:** The person eating cherry is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 5 for Motorbike:**
   - From Clue 11, the person driving the motorbike (cherry) is in position 5.

2. **Position 3 for Boat:**
   - From Clue 12, the person eating pepper is on the right of the person driving the boat. Since the motorbike is in position 5, the boat must be in position 3 (since it's the only odd position left that allows the person eating pepper to be to its right).

3. **Position 4 for Van:**
   - From Clue 5, the person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the ship. Since the boat is in position 3, the van must be in position 4 (the only position left that keeps the ship to its left).

4. **Position 1 for Ship:**
   - From Clue 5, the person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the ship. So, the ship must be in position 1.

5. **Position 2 for Snowmobile:**
   - From Clue 7, the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat. Since the boat is in position 3, the snowmobile must be in position 2.

6. **Position 1 for Tomato:**
   - From Clue 1, the person eating tomato is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the ship is in position 1, the tomato must be in position 2 (but we already have the snowmobile there), so it must be in position 3, but that conflicts with the van. Thus, it must be in position 4 (since the van is in position 4).

7. **Position 3 for Pepper:**
   - From Clue 4, the person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person driving the van. Since the van is in position 4, the pepper must be in position 5 (but the motorbike is there). So, it must be in position 3 (conflict resolved with the van).

8. **Position 4 for Nectarine/Kiwi:**
   - From Clue 9, the person eating nectarine is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi. Since the tomato is in position 4, the nectarine and kiwi must be in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the ship is in position 1 and the tomato is in position 4, the nectarine and kiwi must be in positions 2 and 3.

9. **Final Placement:**
   - From Clue 14, the person eating nectarine is somewhere between the person eating tomato and the person driving the ship. Since the tomato is in position 4 and the ship is in position 1, the nectarine must be in position 2 and the kiwi in position 3.

So, the final solution is:

```
|             |  1   |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5     |
| Food        | Kiwi | Nectarine | Cherry | Tomato     | Pepper    |
| Transport   | Ship | Snowmobile| Boat   | Van        | Motorbike |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |  1   |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5     |

Lv8-2x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct nationality and movie genre in their respective positions. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies.**
   - Z > M (Zombie is to the left of Musical)

2. **The Thai is not to the left of the Argentine.**
   - A > T (Argentine is to the left of Thai)

3. **The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the British.**
   - D > B (Disaster is to the left of British)

4. **The Argentine is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.**
   - A > Z (Argentine is to the left of Zombie)

5. **The person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the person watching adventure movies.**
   - A > Z > Adv (Argentine is to the left of Zombie, which is to the left of Adventure)

6. **The Brazilian is not the person watching adventure movies.**
   - Adv â‰  B (Adventure is not Brazilian)

7. **The Argentine is on the far left or far right.**
   - A = 1 or A = 5 (Argentine is either first or last)

8. **The Malaysian is on the left of the Thai.**
   - Mal > T (Malaysian is to the left of Thai)

9. **The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching adventure movies.**
   - Adv < D (Adventure is to the left of Disaster)

10. **The person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the person watching adventure movies.**
    - Adv > Z (Adventure is to the left of Zombie)

11. **The person watching adventure movies is the Thai.**
    - Adv = T (Thai is Adventure)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 11, we know:
   - Adv = T (Thai is Adventure)

2. From Clue 7, since the Argentine is on the far left or far right, and from Clue 4, Argentine must be on the far left (since Thai is Adventure and cannot be on the far left):
   - A = 1

3. From Clue 4 and Clue 5, since Argentine is on the far left, Argentine must be to the left of Zombie, and Zombie must be to the left of Adventure:
   - A > Z > T (Argentine, Zombie, Thai)
   
4. From Clue 3, Disaster is to the left of British:
   - D > B

5. From Clue 2, Thai is not to the left of Argentine, so Thai cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since Argentine is in position 1):
   - T = 3, 4, or 5

6. From Clue 9, Disaster is to the right of Adventure:
   - Adv < D

7. From Clue 6, Brazilian is not the person watching adventure movies, and since Thai is Adventure, Brazilian cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since Thai is Adventure and Disaster is to the right of Adventure):
   - B = 2

8. From Clue 8, Malaysian is to the left of Thai, and Thai is in position 3, 4, or 5:
   - Mal = 1 or 2 (but 1 is Argentine, so Mal = 2)

9. From Clue 9 and Clue 10, Zombie is to the left of Adventure and not to the right of Adventure:
   - Z = 2, 3, or 4 (since B = 2 and T = 3, 4, or 5, and D > B, D cannot be 2)

10. Since Z > T and T = 3, 4, or 5, Z must be 3 or 4:
    - Z = 3 or 4

11. Since D > B and B = 2, D must be 4 or 5:
    - D = 4 or 5

12. Since Z > T and T = 3, 4, or 5, if Z = 4, then T = 5:
    - Z = 4, T = 5

13. Since D > B and B = 2, D must be 5:
    - D = 5

14. Since Z > T and T = 5, Z must be 4:
    - Z = 4

15. Since A = 1, Z = 4, T = 5, and D = 5, the only position left for Malaysian is 3:
    - Mal = 3

Lv8-2x5-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The architect is not to the right of the fan of indie.
2. The fan of dubstep is on the left or right of the fan of folk.
3. The firefighter is between the fan of house and the musician.
4. The firefighter is the fan of folk.
5. The police-officer is in the middle (position 3).
6. The architect is on the left of the fan of classical.
7. The architect is not to the left of the police-officer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Positioning the Police-Officer:
Since the police-officer is in position 3, we can place that first.
```
|               |    1     |      2      |       3        |     4     |     5     |
| Job           |          |             | Police-Officer |           |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |             | Folk           |           |           |
```

#### Positioning the Firefighter:
From clue 4, the firefighter is the fan of folk, which means the firefighter is in position 3. We already placed the police-officer there, so the firefighter must be in position 3 as well.
```
|               |    1     |      2      |       3        |     4     |     5     |
| Job           |          |             | Firefighter    |           |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |             | Folk           |           |           |
```

#### Positioning the Musician and House:
From clue 3, the firefighter (in position 3) is between the fan of house and the musician. Therefore, the fan of house and the musician must be in positions 2 and 4, but we don't know which is which yet.

#### Positioning the Architect and Classical:
From clue 6, the architect is on the left of the fan of classical. From clue 7, the architect is not to the left of the police-officer (who is in position 3). Therefore, the architect cannot be in position 1 because then he would be to the left of the police-officer. So, the architect must be in position 2, and the fan of classical must be in position 4.
```
|               |    1     |      2      |       3        |     4     |     5     |
| Job           |          | Architect   | Firefighter    | Classical |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |             | Folk           |           |           |
```

Now, from clue 6, the architect (in position 2) is on the left of the fan of classical (in position 4), which is correct.

#### Positioning the Remaining Jobs and Genres:
From clue 1, the architect (in position 2) is not to the right of the fan of indie. Since the architect is in position 2, the fan of indie must be in position 5.
```
|               |    1     |      2      |       3        |     4     |     5     |
| Job           | Mechanic | Architect   | Firefighter    | Classical | Indie    |
| Music-Genre   |          |             | Folk           |           |           |
```

From clue 2, the fan of dubstep is on the left or right of the fan of folk. Since the fan of folk is in position 3, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2 or 4. However, position 2 is taken by the architect, so the fan of dubstep must be in position 4. This conflicts with the Classical genre being in position 4. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate.

Re-evaluating the positions for the remaining genres:
- The fan of house must be in position 2 (since it needs to be between the firefighter and the musician).
- The fan of indie must be in position 5 (since the architect is not to the right of the fan of indie).

Thus, the musician must be in position 4, and the fan of house must be in position 2.
```
|               |    1     |      2      |       3        |     4     |     5     |
| Job           | Mechanic | Architect   | Firefighter    | Musician  | Indie    |
| Music-Genre   |          |             | Folk           | House     | Indie    |
```

Finally, the fan of dubstep must be in position 1.
```
|               |    1     |      2      |       3        |     4     |     5     |
| Job           | Mechanic | Architect   | Firefighter    | Musician  | Indie    |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep |             | Folk           | House     | Indie    |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |      2      |       3        |     4     |     5     |
| Job           | Mechanic | Architect   | Firefighter    | Musician  | Indie    |

| Pet   | Cat   |       |       |       |       |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1 is the Cat owner:**
   - Position 1: Cat
   - Position 5: Not Cat, not Ferret, not Goat, not Hamster, must be Argentine or Brazilian.

2. **Argentine is between Brazilian and Cat owner:**
   - Since the Cat owner is at position 1, Argentine must be at position 3 or 4 (between positions 1 and 5).

3. **Owner of the Frog is in an odd position (1 or 3):**
   - Position 1 is taken by the Cat owner.
   - So, the Frog owner can only be at position 3.

4. **Frog owner is to the right of the Ferret owner:**
   - If Frog is at position 3, Ferret cannot be at position 3, so Ferret must be at position 2.

5. **Argentine is to the right of Hamster owner:**
   - Argentine must be at position 4 or 5.
   - Since Argentine is between Brazilian and Cat, Argentine cannot be at position 5 (as Brazilian would need to be to the left, but thereâ€™s no room for both).

6. **Brazilian is to the right of Argentine:**
   - Argentine must be at position 4.
   - Brazilian must be at position 5.

7. **German is not the Ferret owner:**
   - Ferret is at position 2.
   - German cannot be at position 2.

8. **Polish is on the left or right of the Indonesian:**

10. **Clue 3**: The person watching western movies is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
11. **Clue 12**: The person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching epic movies.

Let's start placing the information based on these clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person driving the ship is in position 3.
   ```
   |               |     1     |     2      |    3    |  4   |    5    |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |            |   Ship  |      |         |
   | Transport     |           |            |   Ship  |      |         |
   ```

2. **Clue 7** and **Clue 8**: The person watching fantasy movies and the person watching horror movies must be in positions 1 and 5 (since they are on the far left or right).
   - Assume the person watching fantasy movies is in position 1 and the person watching horror movies is in position 5.
   ```
   |               |     1     |     2      |    3    |  4   |    5    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   |            |   Ship  |      | Horror  |
   | Transport     | Fantasy   |            |   Ship  |      | Horror  |
   ```

3. **Clue 6**: The person driving the car is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway.
   - This means the car can only be in position 1 or 3, but since position 1 is already taken by fantasy, the car must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person driving the subway must be in position 4 or 5. Since position 5 is already taken by horror, the subway must be in position 4.
   ```
   |               |     1     |     2      |    3    |  4   |    5    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   |            |   Ship  |      | Horror  |
   | Transport     | Fantasy   |            |   Car   | Subway| Horror  |
   ```

4. **Clue 10**: The person driving the motorbike is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
   - Position 1 is already taken by fantasy, and position 3 is taken by car. So, the motorbike must be in position 5.
   - However, position 5 is already taken by horror, so the motorbike must be in position 1.
   ```
   |               |     1     |     2      |    3    |  4   |    5    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   |            |   Ship  |      | Horror  |
   | Transport     | Motorbike |            |   Car   | Subway| Horror  |
   ```

5. **Clue 9**: The person watching drama movies is somewhere between the person driving the motorbike and the person driving the car.
   - The person driving the motorbike is in position 1, and the person driving the car is in position 3. Therefore, the person watching drama movies must be in position 2.
   ```
   |               |     1     |     2      |    3    |  4   |    5    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   | Drama      |   Ship  |      | Horror  |
   | Transport     | Motorbike |            |   Car   | Subway| Horror  |
   ```

6. **Clue 5**: The person watching drama movies is not to the left of the person driving the motorbike.
   - This is satisfied as drama is in position 2, which is to the right of motorbike in position 1.

7. **Clue 11**: The person watching drama movies is not the person driving the car.
   - This is satisfied as drama is in position 2, and the car is in position 3.

8. **Clue 4**: The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies.
   - The person watching horror movies is in position 5, so the person driving the helicopter must be in position 4.
   - The remaining genre is epic, so it must be in position 4.
   ```
   |               |     1     |     2      |    3    |  4   |    5    |

   | Transport     | Motorbike |            |   Car   | Subway| Horror  |
   ```

9. **Clue 12**: The person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching epic movies.
   - The person watching epic movies is in position 4, so the person watching western movies must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since position 1 is already taken by fantasy and position 2 is taken by drama, there is no valid position for western movies that satisfies all conditions.
   - Re-evaluate and correct any missteps.

Upon re-evaluation, we find that the correct placement is:
```

Lv8-2x5-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each job and movie genre according to the given clues. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.
2. The person watching family movies is not to the left of the person watching romance movies.
3. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the designer.
4. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies (repeated from clue 1).
5. The person watching family movies is not to the left of the person watching romance movies (repeated from clue 2).
6. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the paramedic.
7. The freelancer is somewhere to the right of the designer.
8. The doctor is on the right of the freelancer.
9. The designer is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies.
10. The freelancer is on the right of the person watching romance movies.

Let's start by placing the jobs and genres in a way that satisfies all these conditions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1 & 4**: The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.
   - Possible order: D, A or D, _, A or D, __, A

2. **Clue 2 & 5**: The person watching family movies is not to the left of the person watching romance movies.
   - Possible orders: R, F or F, R

3. **Clue 3**: The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the designer.
   - Possible positions for F: Designer, _, Designer, __, Designer

4. **Clue 6**: The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the paramedic.
   - Possible positions for R: Paramedic, _, Paramedic, __, Paramedic

5. **Clue 7**: The freelancer is somewhere to the right of the designer.
   - Possible positions for Freelancer: Designer, _, Freelancer, __, Freelancer

6. **Clue 8**: The doctor is on the right of the freelancer.
   - Possible positions for Doctor: Freelancer, _, Doctor, __, Doctor

7. **Clue 9**: The designer is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies.
   - Possible positions for Crime: Designer, _, Designer, __, Designer

8. **Clue 10**: The freelancer is on the right of the person watching romance movies.
   - Possible positions for Romance: Freelancer, _, Romance, __, Romance

Now let's try to fit everything together:

- From Clue 1 & 4: D, A or D, _, A
- From Clue 2 & 5: R, F or F, R
- From Clue 3: F can be with Designer at either end
- From Clue 6: R must be after P
- From Clue 7: F must be after D
- From Clue 8: D must be before F
- From Clue 9: D must be before C or D must be after C
- From Clue 10: R must be after F

Given these constraints, we can deduce the following:

1. Since D must be before A and R must be after F, and F must be after D, the only possible order is:
   - D, F, A, R, _
   
2. From Clue 6, R must be after P, so P cannot be in position 5. Also, since R is already placed as the fourth, P must be in position 3 or 4. But since R is in position 4, P must be in position 3.

3. From Clue 9, D must be before C or after C. Since D is in position 1 and R is in position 4, C must be in position 2 or 5. But since R is in position 4, C must be in position 2.

4. From Clue 7, F must be after D, which is true since F is in position 3.

5. From Clue 10, R must be after F, which is true since R is in position 4.

Thus, the order of jobs is:
- Designer (D)
- Freelancer (F)
- Crime (C)
- Paramedic (P)
- Doctor (Dr)

And the order of movie genres is:
- Disaster (D)
- Family (F)
- Adventure (A)
- Romance (R)
- Crime (C)

So the final solution table is:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |     3      |    4     |      5      |
| Job           | Designer  | Freelancer| Crime      | Paramedic| Doctor     |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster  | Family    | Adventure  | Romance  | Crime      |

Lv8-2x5-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down and analyze each clue step-by-step:

1. **The owner of the snake is in the middle (position 3).**
   - Snake is in position 3.

2. **The Turkish is somewhere to the left of the owner of the horse.**
   - This means the Turkish cannot be in position 4 or 5, and if they are in position 1 or 2, the horse must be in the next position(s).

3. **The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the German.**
   - This means the German and the owner of the hedgehog must be adjacent to each other, with the German either to the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog.

4. **The Brazilian is somewhere to the right of the French.**
   - This means the French cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and the Brazilian must be in one of those positions.

5. **The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the owner of the bird.**
   - This means the owner of the bird must be in position 1 or 2, and the Turkish must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

6. **The Thai is on the far left or far right.**
   - The Thai must be in position 1 or 5.

7. **The French is in an odd position.**
   - The French can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

8. **The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the Turkish.**
   - Since the snake is in position 3, the Turkish must be in position 4 or 5.

9. **The owner of the snake is not the Thai.**
   - The Thai is not in position 3.

10. **The owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the Thai.**
    - The Thai must be in position 5, so the owner of the hedgehog cannot be in position 1.

Now, let's use these constraints to fill in the table:

- From clue 6, Thai must be in position 1 or 5.
- From clue 7, French must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- From clue 9, since the Thai is not in position 3 and the owner of the snake is in position 3, the Thai must be in position 5.
- From clue 4, the Brazilian must be in position 4 or 5, but since the Thai is in position 5, the Brazilian must be in position 4.
- From clue 2, the Turkish must be in position 4 or 5, but since the Brazilian is in position 4, the Turkish must be in position 5.
- From clue 1, the snake is in position 3.
- From clue 8, the owner of the snake (which is the Turkish) is somewhere to the left of the Thai, which fits.
- From clue 3, the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the German. Since the Thai is in position 5, the German must be in position 4 (Turkish), and the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 3 (snake).
- From clue 10, the owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the Thai, which fits since the Thai is in position 5.
- From clue 5, the Turkish (German) is somewhere to the right of the owner of the bird, and the bird must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Thai
- Position 2: French
- Position 3: Hedgehog
- Position 4: German (Turkish)
- Position 5: Brazilian

Let's summarize the final solution:
