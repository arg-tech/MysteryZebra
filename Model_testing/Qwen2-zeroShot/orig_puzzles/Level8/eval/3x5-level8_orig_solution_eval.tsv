### Step-by-Step Solution:

   - Russian -> Jet-ski

2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the Brazilian.
   - Russian -> Jet-ski
   - Brazilian -> Right of Russian

3. **Clue 9:** The Brazilian is not to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.

5. **Clue 11:** The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the Brazilian.
   - Helicopter -> Right of Brazilian

6. **Clue 8:** The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person driving the car.
   - Helicopter -> Left of Car

7. **Clue 4:** The person driving the car is somewhere between the German and the person driving the airplane.
   - Car -> Between German and Airplane

8. **Clue 10:** The person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the Brazilian.
   - Documentary -> Not Right of Brazilian

3. **Documentary** -> 2nd position (right of Crime)

Now we need to assign the nationalities and transportation methods:

- **Russian** -> Jet-ski (Clue 6)
- **Brazilian** -> Helicopter (Clue 2, 11)
- **Argentine** -> Car (Clue 7, 10, 4)
- **German** -> Airplane (Clue 4)
- **Quad-bike** -> Not assigned yet (Clue 9, 12)

Since the quad-bike cannot be to the left of the jet-ski and must be to the right of the Brazilian, it must be in the 4th or 5th position. However, the car is already in the 5th position, so the quad-bike must be in the 4th position.

Thus, the final arrangement is:

1. **Crime**
2. **Disaster**
3. **Documentary**
4. **Time-travel** -> Quad-bike
5. **Argentine** -> Car

Lv8-3x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate items in the correct positions. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

11. **Clue 11**: The person eating blueberry is not to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
12. **Clue 12**: The owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
13. **Clue 13**: The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of indie.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. From **Clue 7**, the person eating pepper is the fan of house.
2. From **Clue 2** and **Clue 10**, the person eating cucumber cannot be the fan of house. Therefore, the fan of house must be eating pepper.
3. From **Clue 1**, the fan of classical cannot be to the left of the person eating cauliflower.
4. From **Clue 5**, the owner of the pony is between the fan of house (pepper) and the person eating cauliflower.
5. Since the fan of house (pepper) is at position 4, the owner of the pony must be at either position 2 or 3.
6. From **Clue 5**, the person eating cauliflower cannot be at position 1 or 2 (since the owner of the pony would have to be to the left).
7. From **Clue 3**, the person eating cauliflower must be to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
8. From **Clue 6**, the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person eating grapes.
9. From **Clue 11**, the person eating blueberry cannot be to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
10. From **Clue 12**, the owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
11. From **Clue 8**, the fan of electronic is on the left or right of the fan of house (pepper), so it could be at position 1, 2, or 3.
12. From **Clue 9**, the person eating pepper (house fan) is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Since the fan of house is at 4, the person eating blueberry can only be at 1, 2, or 3.
13. From **Clue 13**, the owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of indie. So the fan of indie must be at 5, and the owner of the turtle must be at 1, 2, or 3.

### Final Placement:
- **Position 1**: Owner of turtle (fan of indie)
- **Position 2**: Owner of bird (classical fan, since the owner of the hedgehog must be to the right)
- **Position 3**: Owner of hedgehog (grapes eater, since the owner of the bird is to the left)
- **Position 4**: Fan of house (pepper eater)
- **Position 5**: Owner of pony (between the fan of house and the person eating cauliflower)

Now let's fill in the details for food, music genre, and pet:

- **Owner of Turtle (Indie)**: Grapes
- **Owner of Bird (Classical)**: Cucumber

14. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
15. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the Spanish.
16. The Canadian is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of Canadian**:
   - Clue 16: The Canadian is on the far right (position 5).

2. **Beverages**:
   - Clue 4: The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking juice.
   - Clue 10: The person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person drinking juice.
   - Clue 11: The person drinking soy-milk is not to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - From these clues, we can deduce that the order must be: juice, iced-tea, and then either cola or soy-milk. Since soy-milk cannot be to the right of cola, and iced-tea must be to the right of juice, the order must be: juice, iced-tea, cola, with soy-milk in position 4.

3. **Nationalities**:
   - Clue 9: The Spanish is not to the left of the Thai.
   - Clue 12: The Spanish is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - Clue 13: The Spanish is not to the left of the Thai.
   - Therefore, the Spanish must be in position 2 or 3, and the Thai must be in position 4 or 5. Since the Brazilian is in an odd position (Clue 9), and the Canadian is in position 5 (Clue 16), the Thai cannot be in position 5. So, the Thai must be in position 4, and the Spanish must be in position 3.

4. **Pets**:
   - Clue 7: The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the snake.
   - Clue 12: The Spanish is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - Therefore, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 2, and the owner of the snake must be in position 4 or 5. Since the Thai is in position 4, the owner of the snake must be in position 5.

5. **Final Positioning**:
   - From the above deductions:
     - Position 1: Juice
     - Position 2: Guineapig
     - Position 3: Spanish
     - Position 4: Soy-milk
     - Position 5: Thai

   - Beverages:
     - Position 1: Juice
     - Position 2: Iced-tea
     - Position 3: Cola
     - Position 4: Soy-milk

     - Position 2: Canadian
     - Position 3: Spanish
     - Position 4: Thai
     - Position 5: Spanish

   - Pets:
     - Position 1: Horse
     - Position 2: Guinea-pig

2. **Sport:**
   - Since cooking is in position 1, swimming must be in position 5.
   - Skateboarding can only be in position 5 if climbing is in 3, but swimming is already in 5. Therefore, skateboarding must be in position 1.
   - This means the person with skateboarding is on the far left.
   - Apple is between skateboarding and lemon. Since skateboarding is in 1, lemon must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Raspberry is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since 1 and 3 are taken, raspberry must be in position 5.
   - Lemon must then be in position 4.
   - Avocado is to the right of skateboarding, so it must be in position 2.

3. **Hobby:**
   - Collecting is on the far left or far right. Since skateboarding is in position 1, collecting must be in position 5.
   - Photography is to the right of lemon, so it must be in position 4.
   - Filmmaking is to the right of cooking, so it must be in position 2.
   - Puzzles is to the right of strawberry, so it must be in position 3.
   - This leaves collecting as the only hobby for position 5, which matches our earlier placement.

4. **Food:**
   - Apple is between skateboarding and lemon. Since skateboarding is in 1 and lemon is in 4, apple must be in position 2.
   - Raspberry is in position 5.
   - Lemon is in position 4.
   - Strawberry is to the left of puzzles, so it must be in position 1.
   - Avocado is in position 2, which matches with apple.
