Lv8-4x7-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's start by organizing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7:** The person driving the bus is somewhere to the right of the person driving the airplane.
2. **Clue 15:** The person driving the snowmobile is on the far right (position 7).
3. **Clue 17:** The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person eating artichoke.
4. **Clue 26:** The person driving the bus is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).
5. **Clue 28:** The person eating corn is the person driving the taxi.
6. **Clue 29:** The person watching horror movies is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).

From Clue 28, we know:
- **Position 2, 4, or 6** is the person driving the taxi.
- The person eating corn is the person driving the taxi.

From Clue 29, we know:
- The person watching horror movies is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

Let's denote:
- **Position 2, 4, or 6** as \(X\) for the person driving the taxi and watching horror movies.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The person driving the bus is to the right of \(X\).

From Clue 15, we know:
- The person driving the snowmobile is in position 7.

So, the possible positions for \(X\) are 2, 4, or 6.

### Position Analysis:
- If \(X = 2\):
  - The person driving the bus must be in position 4 or 6.
  - The person driving the snowmobile is in position 7.
  
- If \(X = 4\):
  - The person driving the bus must be in position 6.
  - The person driving the snowmobile is in position 7.
  
- If \(X = 6\):
  - The person driving the bus cannot be in position 6 (since it would violate the condition that the person driving the bus is to the right of \(X\)).
  - This is not possible.

Thus, \(X = 2\) or \(X = 4\).

### Further Analysis:
- From Clue 28, the person eating corn is the person driving the taxi, so position 2 or 4 is the person eating corn.
- From Clue 29, the person watching horror movies is in an even position, so position 2 or 4 is the person watching horror movies.

Since the person eating corn and the person watching horror movies are the same person, let’s assume:
- Position 2 is the person eating corn and watching horror movies.

Then:
- Position 4 must be the person driving the bus.
- Position 6 must be the person driving the snowmobile.

### Filling in the Table:

Let's start with the known positions and fill in the table:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |    3     |    4    |    5     |     6      |    7    |

| Food          |          |             |          |         |          |            | Apricot |
| Nationality   | Thai     |             |          |         |          |            |         |

```

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the rest:

- From Clue 22: The owner of the cat must be after position 7, so it can't be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. It must be in position 7 (which is already occupied by apricot).

- From Clue 21: Thai is on the left of Egyptian, so Thai must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and Egyptian must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

- From Clue 27: The owner of the ferret is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. So, if the owner of the rabbit is at position 1, the owner of the ferret must be at position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

- From Clue 38: The owner of the goldfish is to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the cat is in position 7, the owner of the goldfish must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

- From Clue 34: The owner of the goldfish is to the left of the Australian. So, the Australian must be in a position to the right of the owner of the goldfish.

- From Clue 33: The person drinking tea is between the Thai and the person drinking almond-milk. Thai and almond-milk must be on either side of the person drinking tea.

After careful analysis and placement of all the clues, the final solution is:

### Solving the Puzzle:
Let's place the positions and constraints step-by-step.

#### Step 1: Positioning Superhero Movies
- The person watching superhero movies is in an odd position (Clue 22). Possible positions: 1, 3, 5, 7.
- Since the person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies (Clue 2), the superhero movie can't be in position 7.
- The Brazilian is in an even position (Clue 3). Possible positions for the Brazilian: 2, 4, 6.
- The person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies (Clue 2). The superhero movie can't be in position 3 because it would leave no room for the western movie to the right of the time-travel movie.
- Therefore, the superhero movie must be in position 1.

#### Step 2: Positioning Western Movies
- The person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies (Clue 2).
- The western movie can't be in position 1 (superhero movie).

Lv8-4x7-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will systematically go through each clue and place the information into the appropriate categories (food, job, nationality, sport). We'll use the provided clues to deduce the correct positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating pomegranate is the videographer.
2. **Clue 40**: The videographer is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
3. **Combining Clues 1 and 40**: The videographer eats pomegranate and is in position 2, 4, or 6.

Let's start with position 4 since it's the most likely given the other constraints:
- Position 4: Videographer, Eats Pomegranate

4. **Clue 7**: The person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the videographer.
- Since the videographer is in position 4, the person eating pineapple must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

5. **Clue 3**: The engineer is on the left of the person eating pineapple.
- The person eating pineapple can't be in position 1 because then the engineer would be in position 0, which is invalid. Therefore, the person eating pineapple must be in position 2 or 3.
- If the person eating pineapple is in position 2, the engineer must be in position 1.
- If the person eating pineapple is in position 3, the engineer must be in position 2.

6. **Clue 11**: The photographer is on the left of the engineer.
- Given the engineer is on the left of the person eating pineapple, the photographer must be in position 1 if the pineapple is in position 2, and in position 1 or 2 if the pineapple is in position 3.

Let's assume the person eating pineapple is in position 2 for now:
- Position 1: Photographer
- Position 2: Pineapple
- Position 3: Engineer

7. **Clue 15**: The person who's sport is surfing is not to the left of the videographer.
- Since the videographer is in position 4, the person who's sport is surfing cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3.
