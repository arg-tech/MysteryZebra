Lv8-7x5-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically apply each clue to fill in the table. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify key positions and relationships from clues.
- Clue 6: The person drinking tea is in an even position (4).
- Clue 22: The fan of ambient is in the middle (3).

### Step 2: Place the known positions.
|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |      4      |     5      |
| Beverage      |           |         |            | **tea**     |            |
| Food          |           |         |            |             |            |
| Hobby         |           |         | **ambient**|             |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |            |             |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |            |             |            |
| Nationality   |           |         |            |             |            |
| Pet           |           |         |            |             |            |

### Step 3: Apply more clues.
- Clue 26: The owner of the rat is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
- Clue 21: The owner of the horse is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
- Clue 27: The person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the fan of disco.

Since the fan of ambient is in position 3, the person who's hobby is singing must be to the right of the fan of disco. We can place the singing hobbyist in position 5 and the fan of disco in position 2.

|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |      4      |     5      |
| Beverage      |           |         |            | **tea**     |            |
| Food          |           |         |            |             |            |
| Hobby         |           | **disco**| **ambient**|             | **singing**|
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |            |             |            |

- Clue 11: The pakistani is between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking milk.
- Clue 25: The brazilian is on the left of the person eating potato.

We can place the pakistani, cabbage, and milk in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively, with the pakistani in position 3. This means the person drinking milk is in position 4, and the pakistani is between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking milk.

|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |      4      |     5      |

| Movie-Genre   |           |         |            |             |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |            |             |            |
| Nationality   |           | **pakistani**|            |             |            |
| Pet           |           |         |            |             |            |

- Clue 24: The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the thai.
- Clue 20: The fan of ambient is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
- Clue 28: The fan of house is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda.

Since the person drinking milk is in position 4, the thai must be in position 1. The person drinking mirinda is in position 4, so the fan of house can be in position 2 or 5.

|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |      4      |     5      |

| Hobby         |           | **disco**| **ambient**|             | **singing**|
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |            |             |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |            |             |            |

- Clue 19: The fan of house is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda.
- Clue 29: The person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the british.

The fan of house can be in position 2 or 5. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 4, the fan of house must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |      4      |     5      |

| Hobby         |           | **disco**| **ambient**|             | **singing**|
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |            |             |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |            |             |            |

- Clue 30: The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the fan of folk.
- Clue 36: The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.

Since the person drinking almond-milk is not in position 4, it must be in position 1. The person who's hobby is singing is in position 5, so the fan of folk must be in position 2.
