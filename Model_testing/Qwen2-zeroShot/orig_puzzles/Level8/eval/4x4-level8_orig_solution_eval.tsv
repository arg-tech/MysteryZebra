Lv8-4x4-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Initial Setup:
We have four positions (1, 2, 3, 4) for each category: Beverage, Food, Music-Genre, and Pet.

### Constraints:
1. The fan of salsa is between the owner of the dog and the fan of indie.
2. The person drinking milk is not to the right of the owner of the frog.
3. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person eating carrot.
4. The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
5. The owner of the dog is not to the left of the fan of indie.
6. The person eating peas is not to the right of the person drinking water.
7. The owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit.
8. The owner of the goldfish is in an odd position.
9. The fan of house is the owner of the frog.
10. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the owner of the dog.
11. The owner of the dog is not to the left of the fan of salsa.
12. The person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking milk.
13. The fan of trance is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes.
14. The fan of indie is on the left or right of the fan of salsa.
15. The person drinking lemonade is on the far left or far right.
16. The person eating kale is on the right of the person eating carrot.
17. The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the fan of indie.
18. The person eating grapes is not to the right of the owner of the frog.
19. The person drinking water is on the right of the person eating grapes.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify the Fan of House:
From constraint 9, the fan of house is the owner of the frog. So:
- Position 4: Frog (House)

#### 2. Identify the Fan of Salsa:
From constraint 1, the fan of salsa is between the owner of the dog and the fan of indie. Also, from constraint 10, the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the owner of the dog. From constraint 11, the owner of the dog is not to the left of the fan of salsa. Therefore, the fan of salsa must be in position 2 or 3, and the owner of the dog must be in position 1 or 3. Let's try placing the fan of salsa in position 2 and see if it works:
- Position 2: Salsa

#### 3. Identify the Owner of the Dog:
From the above, the owner of the dog must be in position 3:
- Position 3: Dog

#### 4. Determine the Fan of Indie:
From constraint 1, the fan of indie must be in position 1 or 4. Since the fan of indie cannot be in position 4 (because the fan of house is there), the fan of indie must be in position 1:
- Position 1: Indie

#### 5. Determine the Fan of Trance:
From constraint 13, the fan of trance is to the right of the person eating grapes. Since the fan of indie is in position 1, the fan of trance must be in position 3 or 4. But the owner of the dog is in position 3, so the fan of trance must be in position 4:
- Position 4: Trance

This conflicts with the frog being in position 4. So let's try the fan of salsa in position 3 instead:
- Position 3: Salsa

Then the owner of the dog must be in position 2:
- Position 2: Dog

And the fan of indie must be in position 1:
- Position 1: Indie

Then the fan of trance must be in position 4:
- Position 4: Trance

Now we need to place the fan of salsa in position 2 or 3. Since the owner of the dog is in position 2, the fan of salsa must be in position 3:
- Position 3: Salsa

So the owner of the dog is in position 2:
- Position 2: Dog

And the fan of indie must be in position 1:
- Position 1: Indie

And the fan of trance must be in position 4:
- Position 4: Trance

#### 6. Determine the Beverages:
From constraint 12, the person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking milk. So water and milk must be in positions 1 and 2 or 3 and 4. Since the fan of indie is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 2 or 3, and the person drinking milk must be in position 3 or 4. But the owner of the dog is in position 2, so the person drinking water must be in position 3 and the person drinking milk must be in position 4:
- Position 3: Water
- Position 4: Milk

From constraint 15, the person drinking lemonade is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking water is in position 3, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1 or 2. But the fan of indie is in position 1, so the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2:
- Position 2: Lemonade

So:
- Position 1: Water
- Position 2: Lemonade
- Position 3: Water
- Position 4: Milk

#### 7. Determine the Foods:
From constraint 16, the person eating kale is on the right of the person eating carrot. So the person eating kale must be in position 3 or 4, and the person eating carrot must be in position 2 or 3. Since the person drinking water is in position 3, the person eating kale must be in position 4 and the person eating carrot must be in position 3:
- Position 3: Carrot
- Position 4: Kale

From constraint 3, the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person eating carrot. Since the person drinking milk is in position 4 and the person eating carrot is in position 3, this is consistent.

From constraint 6, the person eating peas is not to the right of the person drinking water. Since the person eating peas must be in position 1 or 2, and the person drinking water is in position 1, the person eating peas must be in position 2:
- Position 2: Peas

So:
- Position 1: Carrot
- Position 2: Peas
- Position 3: Kale
- Position 4: Grapes

#### 8. Verify All Constraints:
- Constraint 1: Fan of salsa (position 3) is between the owner of the dog (position 2) and the fan of indie (position 1).
- Constraint 2: The person drinking milk (position 4) is not to the right of the owner of the frog (position 4).
- Constraint 3: The person drinking milk (position 4) is on the left or right of the person eating carrot (position 3).
- Constraint 4: The person drinking lemonade (position 2) is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit (not applicable since no rabbit).
- Constraint 5: The owner of the dog (position 2) is not to the left of the fan of indie (position 1).
- Constraint 6: The person eating peas (position 2) is not to the right of the person drinking water (position 1).
- Constraint 7: The owner of the goldfish (position 1) is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit (not applicable since no rabbit).
- Constraint 8: The owner of the goldfish (position 1) is in an odd position.
- Constraint 9: The fan of house (position 4) is the owner of the frog (position 4).
- Constraint 10: The fan of salsa (position 3) is on the left or right of the owner of the dog (position 2).
- Constraint 11: The owner of the dog (position 2) is not to the left of the fan of salsa (position 3).
- Constraint 12: The person drinking water (position 1) is on the left of the person drinking milk (position 4).
- Constraint 13: The fan of trance (position 4) is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes (position 4).
- Constraint 14: The fan of indie (position 1) is on the left or right of the fan of salsa (position 3).
- Constraint 15: The person drinking lemonade (position 2) is on the far left or far right.
- Constraint 16: The person eating kale (position 4) is on the right of the person eating carrot (position 3).
- Constraint 17: The person drinking lemonade (position 2) is not to the right of the fan of indie (position 1).
- Constraint 18: The person eating grapes (position 4) is not to the right of the owner of the frog (position 4).
- Constraint 19: The person drinking water (position 1) is on the right of the person eating grapes (position 4).

All constraints are satisfied.

Lv8-4x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each person (British, Malaysian, Polish, Russian) into their corresponding categories (Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Sport) based on the given clues. Let's go through each clue step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person watching disaster movies is not to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.
2. The Russian is the person whose hobby is cooking.
3. The person whose sport is handball is not the person whose hobby is card-games.
4. The person whose sport is cricket is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.
5. The person watching disaster movies is not to the right of the Polish.
6. The person whose sport is skiing is not to the right of the person watching disaster movies.
7. The person whose sport is handball is not to the left of the person whose hobby is cooking.
8. The Malaysian is the person watching drama movies.
9. The British is not to the left of the person whose hobby is Sudoku.
10. The person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
11. The person whose sport is volleyball is between the person whose hobby is Sudoku and the person watching drama movies.
12. The person whose hobby is card-games is on the right of the person whose sport is skiing.
13. The Malaysian is not to the right of the person watching drama movies.
14. The person whose sport is handball is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's start by placing the known elements first:

- **Clue 2**: The Russian is the person whose hobby is cooking.
- **Clue 8**: The Malaysian is the person watching drama movies.
- **Clue 13**: Since the Malaysian is watching drama movies, the person to the right of the Malaysian cannot be watching drama movies. This means the Malaysian cannot be in position 4.

Now let's place these elements in the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |    4     |
| Hobby         |            | Cooking    |           |          |
| Movie-Genre   |            |            | Drama     |          |
| Nationality   |            |            |           | Russian  |
| Sport         |            |            |           |          |

Next, we use the remaining clues:

- **Clue 4**: The person whose sport is cricket is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.
- **Clue 10**: The person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
- **Clue 14**: The person whose sport is handball is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.

From these clues, we can infer that the person watching drama movies must be in position 2, and the person whose sport is handball must be either in position 1 or 3.

Since the Malaysian is in position 2, the person in position 1 or 3 whose sport is handball must be another nationality. Let's assume the person in position 1 has handball and is not the Malaysian.

- **Clue 11**: The person whose sport is volleyball is between the person whose hobby is Sudoku and the person watching drama movies.
- **Clue 12**: The person whose hobby is card-games is on the right of the person whose sport is skiing.

Since the person in position 1 has handball, the person in position 3 must have skiing (because the person in position 4 is Russian and has no other options).

- **Clue 1**: The person watching disaster movies is not to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.
- **Clue 5**: The person watching disaster movies is not to the right of the Polish.
- **Clue 6**: The person whose sport is skiing is not to the right of the person watching disaster movies.

Given these constraints, the person in position 3 has skiing, so the person in position 4 must be Russian.

Now we know:
- Position 1: Handball
- Position 2: Drama (Malaysian)
- Position 3: Skiing (Polish)
- Position 4: Disaster (Russian)

We need to place the remaining elements:
- **Clue 9**: The British is not to the left of the person whose hobby is Sudoku.
- **Clue 1**: The person watching disaster movies is not to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.
- **Clue 7**: The person whose sport is handball is not to the left of the person whose hobby is cooking.

From these clues, the person in position 1 must have handball, and the person in position 2 must have drama. The person in position 3 must have skiing, and the person in position 4 must have disaster.
