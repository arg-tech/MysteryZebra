Lv8-1x6-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the six movie genres (action, crime, drama, martial-arts, sports, time-travel) into the six slots while satisfying all the given conditions. Let's go through each condition step-by-step:

1. **Condition 2:** The person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person watching action movies.
   - This means that if ""action"" is in position 1, then ""drama"" must be in position 2 or 3; if ""action"" is in position 2, then ""drama"" must be in position 1 or 3, etc.

2. **Condition 3:** The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies.
   - If ""sports"" is in position 1, then ""crime"" must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6; if ""sports"" is in position 2, then ""crime"" must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, etc.

3. **Condition 5:** The person watching drama movies is on the far left or far right.
   - This means ""drama"" must be in position 1 or 6.

4. **Condition 6:** The person watching action movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - If ""martial-arts"" is in position 1, then ""action"" must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6; if ""martial-arts"" is in position 2, then ""action"" must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, etc.

5. **Condition 7:** The person watching martial-arts movies is between the person watching action movies and the person watching time-travel movies.
   - This means there must be exactly one slot between ""action"" and ""time-travel,"" and ""martial-arts"" must fill that slot.

6. **Condition 8:** The person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies.
   - This means that if ""time-travel"" is in position 1, then ""crime"" must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6; if ""time-travel"" is in position 2, then ""crime"" must be in position 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6, etc.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit them together:

- From Condition 5, ""drama"" must be in position 1 or 6.
- From Condition 2, if ""drama"" is in position 1, ""action"" can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If ""drama"" is in position 6, ""action"" can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- From Condition 3, ""sports"" cannot be in position 6 if ""drama"" is in position 1, and ""sports"" cannot be in position 1 if ""drama"" is in position 6.
- From Condition 6, ""action"" must be to the right of ""martial-arts.""
- From Condition 7, ""martial-arts"" must be between ""action"" and ""time-travel.""
- From Condition 8, ""crime"" must be next to ""time-travel.""

Let's assume ""drama"" is in position 1 (since it simplifies the placement):

1. Drama
2. Action
3. Martial-arts
4. Time-travel
5. Sports
6. Crime

This arrangement satisfies:
- Condition 2: ""Drama"" is on the left of ""Action.""
- Condition 3: ""Sports"" is to the left of ""Crime.""
- Condition 5: ""Drama"" is in position 1.
- Condition 6: ""Martial-arts"" is between ""Action"" and ""Time-travel.""
- Condition 7: ""Martial-arts"" is between ""Action"" and ""Time-travel.""
- Condition 8: ""Crime"" is to the right of ""Time-travel.""

Thus, the final solution is:

```

Lv8-1x6-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the beverages accordingly.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.**
   - This means if cola is at position \(i\), iced-tea must be at position \(j\) where \(i < j\).

2. **The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.**
   - If mirinda is at position \(k\), then cola must be at position \(l\) where \(k < l\).

3. **The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda.**
   - This means almond-milk can be at position \(m\) (left) or \(n\) (right) compared to mirinda.

4. **The person drinking water is on the far right.**
   - Water must be at position 6.

5. **The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.**
   - If almond-milk is at position \(p\), then mirinda must be at position \(q\) where \(p < q\).

6. **The person drinking mirinda is not to the right of the person drinking sprite.**
   - If mirinda is at position \(r\), then sprite must be at position \(s\) where \(r \leq s\).

7. **The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.**
   - If iced-tea is at position \(t\), then sprite must be at position \(u\) where \(t \leq u\).

8. **The person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking sprite.**
   - Since water is at position 6, sprite must be at position 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Water is at position 6.**
   - This satisfies Clue 4 and Clue 8.

2. **Sprite must be at position 5.**
   - This satisfies Clue 6 and Clue 8.

3. **Mirinda cannot be at position 6 or 5.**
   - Mirinda must be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Cola and iced-tea must be positioned such that cola is to the left of iced-tea.**
   - If mirinda is at position 1, cola must be at position 2, and iced-tea must be at position 3 or 4.
   - If mirinda is at position 2, cola must be at position 3, and iced-tea must be at position 4.
   - If mirinda is at position 3, cola must be at position 4.

5. **Almond-milk must be to the left of mirinda.**
   - If mirinda is at position 1, almond-milk can be at position 1 or 2.
   - If mirinda is at position 2, almond-milk can be at position 1 or 2.
   - If mirinda is at position 3, almond-milk can be at position 1, 2, or 3.
   - If mirinda is at position 4, almond-milk can be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Given these constraints, let's test the positions:

- **If mirinda is at position 1:**
  - Almond-milk can be at position 1 or 2.
  - Cola must be at position 2.
  - Iced-tea must be at position 3 or 4.
  - Sprite must be at position 5.
  - Water must be at position 6.

This gives us:
- Position 1: Mirinda
- Position 2: Cola
- Position 3: Iced-tea
- Position 4: Sprite
- Position 5: Water
- Position 6: Water

However, this violates Clue 6 because mirinda is not to the right of sprite.

- **If mirinda is at position 2:**
  - Almond-milk can be at position 1 or 2.
  - Cola must be at position 3.
  - Iced-tea must be at position 4.
  - Sprite must be at position 5.
  - Water must be at position 6.

This gives us:
- Position 1: Almond-milk
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 3: Cola
- Position 4: Iced-tea
- Position 5: Sprite
- Position 6: Water

This satisfies all clues.

Lv8-1x6-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the guinea-pig is not to the right of the owner of the rat.
2. The owner of the rat is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
3. The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the right of the owner of the turtle.
4. The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the turtle.
5. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
6. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the owner of the lizard.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: These two clues together imply that the owner of the rat and the owner of the guinea-pig must be adjacent (either in positions 1-2 or 2-3).
   
2. **Clue 3 and Clue 5**: These clues tell us that the owner of the mouse is to the right of the owner of the turtle and also to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. This means the order must be: Turtle -> Mouse -> Guinea-Pig.

3. **Clue 4**: The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the owner of the turtle is in position 3, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 1.

4. **Clue 6**: The owner of the rat is to the left of the owner of the lizard. Given the previous constraints, we need to fit these into the remaining slots.

Let's try to place the pets based on the above deductions:

- Position 1: Rabbit (from Clue 4)
- Position 2: Rat (since it has to be to the left of the lizard and must be next to the guinea-pig from Clues 1 and 2)
- Position 3: Turtle (from Clue 4 and Clue 3)
- Position 4: Mouse (from Clue 3 and Clue 5)
- Position 5: Guinea-Pig (from Clue 2 and Clue 5)
- Position 6: Lizard (from Clue 6)

So the final arrangement is:

Lv8-1x6-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the sports in the correct order. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is rowing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is parkour.
   - This means that Rowing (R) must come before Parkour (P).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the person who's sport is rowing.
   - This means that Weightlifting (W) cannot be in positions 1 or 2 if Rowing is in position 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - This means that Biathlon (B) must come before Weightlifting (W).

4. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
   - This means that Water-Polo (WP) must come after Surfing (S).

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing.
   - This means that Parkour (P) must come before Surfing (S).

6. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
   - This means that Water-Polo (WP) must be adjacent to Weightlifting (W).

Now, let's use these clues to determine the order:

- From Clue 5, Parkour (P) must be before Surfing (S).
- From Clue 4, Surfing (S) must be before Water-Polo (WP).
- Therefore, P < S < WP.

- From Clue 1, Rowing (R) must be before Parkour (P).
- From Clue 2, Weightlifting (W) cannot be to the left of Rowing (R), so W cannot be in positions 1 or 2 if R is in positions 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, Biathlon (B) must come before Weightlifting (W).
- From Clue 6, Water-Polo (WP) must be adjacent to Weightlifting (W).

Given all these constraints, let's try to fit them into the sequence:

- Since B < W and W < WP, we have B, W, and WP together with their order.
- Since R < P and P < S < WP, we can place R, P, and S accordingly.

Let's start placing the sports:

1. B (Biathlon)
2. R (Rowing)
3. P (Parkour)
4. S (Surfing)
5. W (Weightlifting)
6. WP (Water-Polo)

This order satisfies all the given clues:
- R is to the left of P (Clue 1).
- W is not to the left of R (Clue 2).
- W is not to the right of B (Clue 3).
- S is to the right of WP (Clue 4).
- P is to the left of S (Clue 5).
- WP is adjacent to W (Clue 6).

Thus, the final solution is:

Lv8-1x6-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who's sport is rugby is in an odd position (Clue 1).
2. The person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the person who's sport is parkour (Clue 2).
3. The person who's sport is snowboarding is in an odd position (Clue 3).
4. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding (Clue 4).
5. The person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is parkour (Clue 5).
6. The person who's sport is climbing is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person who's sport is rugby (Clue 6).
7. The person who's sport is climbing is somewhere between the person who's sport is parkour and the person who's sport is rugby (Clue 7).
8. The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon (Clue 8).
9. The person who's sport is rugby is not to the right of the person who's sport is rugby (Clue 9, redundant information).
10. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby (Clue 10).

First, let's identify the positions for rugby and snowboarding based on Clues 1 and 3:
- Rugby must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
- Snowboarding must also be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

Since snowboarding must be to the left of skateboarding (Clue 4), and considering the positions, the only possible positions are:
- Snowboarding at position 1, and skateboarding at position 3 or 5.
- Snowboarding at position 3, and skateboarding at position 5.

Next, let's use Clue 2, which states that the person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the person who's sport is parkour. This means parkour cannot be in position 1 if rugby is in position 1, and parkour cannot be in position 2 if rugby is in position 3.

Using Clue 6 and Clue 7, the person who's sport is climbing is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person who's sport is rugby. This gives us:
- If rugby is in position 1, parkour must be in position 3 or 5.
- If rugby is in position 3, parkour must be in position 1 or 5.
- If rugby is in position 5, parkour must be in position 1 or 3.

From Clue 8, parkour is to the right of biathlon. So, biathlon can't be in positions 3, 5, or 6 if parkour is in those positions.

Combining all the clues, we get:
- Rugby is in position 3 (since it fits with all other constraints).
- Parkour is in position 1 (since it's to the right of biathlon and between climbing and rugby).
- Climbing is in position 2 (between parkour and rugby).
- Snowboarding is in position 1 (to the left of skateboarding).
- Skateboarding is in position 5 (to the right of snowboarding).

This leaves biathlon in position 6.

So, the final arrangement is:

|         |      1       |    2     |    3    |    4     |   5   |       6       |

Lv8-1x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and place the pets accordingly.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the goldfish.**
   - This means that if we have positions L, C, G (L for lizard, C for chinchilla, G for goldfish), then the order could be L-C-G or G-C-L.

2. **The owner of the snake is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish.**
   - This means that the snake must be to the left of the goldfish (or possibly in the same position as the goldfish).

3. **The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.**
   - This means that the rabbit can only be in a position adjacent to the lizard.

4. **The owner of the rabbit is in an odd position.**
   - The possible positions for the rabbit are 1, 3, or 5.

5. **The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the rat.**
   - This means that the rat must be to the right of the goldfish.

6. **The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit.**
   - Since the rabbit is in an odd position, the snake must be in one of the even positions (2, 4, or 6).

7. **The owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard.**
   - This means that the lizard must be to the left of the goldfish.

8. **The owner of the rabbit is somewhere between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the chinchilla.**
   - This means that if we have positions L, R, C (L for lizard, R for rabbit, C for chinchilla), then the order could be L-R-C or C-R-L.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of Rabbit:**
   - From Clue 4, the rabbit must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

2. **Snake Position:**
   - From Clue 6, the snake must be to the left of the rabbit.
   - From Clue 2, the snake cannot be to the right of the goldfish.
   - Therefore, the snake must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

3. **Goldfish and Rat:**
   - From Clue 5, the goldfish must be on the left of the rat.
   - From Clue 7, the goldfish must be to the right of the lizard.
   - From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the chinchilla must be between the lizard and the goldfish.

4. **Possible Positions for Lizard and Goldfish:**
   - If the rabbit is in position 1, the possible positions for the lizard and goldfish would be 2 and 3 (since the rabbit is to the right of the lizard and goldfish).
   - If the rabbit is in position 3, the possible positions for the lizard and goldfish would be 2 and 4.
   - If the rabbit is in position 5, the possible positions for the lizard and goldfish would be 4 and 6.

Given these constraints, let's test the possible configurations:

### Testing Configuration:
- **Rabbit in position 3:**
  - Possible positions for the lizard and goldfish are 2 and 4.
  - Snake must be in position 2 (to the left of the rabbit) and goldfish must be in position 4 (to the right of the lizard).

So, the configuration might look like:
- Lizard in position 2
- Snake in position 1
- Chinchilla in position 3
- Goldfish in position 4
- Rabbit in position 5
- Rat in position 6

### Final Table:

```

Lv8-1x6-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each sport in one of the six positions (1 through 6) based on the given clues. Let's analyze each clue step-by-step:

1. The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
2. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
3. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
4. The person who's sport is cricket is not to the right of the person who's sport is sailing.
5. The person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
6. The person who's sport is sailing is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person who's sport is baseball.
7. The person who's sport is baseball is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
8. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the far right (position 6).
9. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is sailing.

Given that weightlifting is on the far right (position 6), we can start with that:

|         |    1     |    2    |    3    |    4     |    5     |       6       |
| Sport   |          |         |         |          |          | Weightlifting |

Next, let's use the information from clue 6:
- Sailing must be between cricket and baseball.
- Baseball is to the right of sailing.
- Cricket is to the left of baseball.

From clue 9, we know baseball is to the right of sailing. So, we can place these three sports in positions 1, 2, and 3 (since 6 is already occupied by weightlifting).

Let's denote:
- Sailing as S
- Cricket as C
- Baseball as B

So far, we have:
|         |    1     |    2    |    3    |    4     |    5     |       6       |
| Sport   |    S     |    C    |    B    |          |          | Weightlifting |

Now, let's consider the remaining sports: biathlon, lacrosse, and cricket. We need to fit them into the remaining slots (4 and 5).

From clue 1:
- Cricket (C) is to the left of baseball (B).

From clue 2:
- Biathlon is to the left of weightlifting (already placed at position 6).

From clue 3:
- Baseball (B) is to the right of lacrosse.

From clue 5:
- Lacrosse is not to the right of biathlon.

From clue 7:
- Baseball (B) is not to the left of lacrosse.

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:
- Lacrosse (L) must be to the left of biathlon (Bi).

So, the only possible arrangement for the remaining sports in positions 4 and 5 is:
- Lacrosse (L) in position 4
- Biathlon (Bi) in position 5

Thus, the final solution is:
|         |    1     |    2    |    3    |    4     |    5     |       6       |
| Sport   |    S     |    C    |    B    |    L     |    Bi    | Weightlifting |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-1x6-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the sports accordingly:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
   - This means that skiing and water-polo must be adjacent.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is swimming is somewhere between the person who's sport is sailing and the person who's sport is skiing.
   - This places swimming in the middle of sailing and skiing.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo.
   - This means skiing comes before water-polo.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is skiing is not to the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
   - This means baseball cannot be directly to the right of skiing.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is baseball is not to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
   - This means baseball cannot be directly to the left of sailing.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
   - This means cycling comes before baseball.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is swimming is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person who's sport is sailing.
   - This places swimming between cycling and sailing.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is sailing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
   - This means sailing comes before baseball.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 7, we know:
   - Cycling < Swimming < Sailing (or Sailing < Swimming < Cycling)

2. From Clue 2, we know:
   - Swimming is between sailing and skiing.
   - So, the order involving these three must be: Sailing, Swimming, Skiing or Skiing, Swimming, Sailing.

3. From Clue 3, we know:
   - Skiing must be on the left of water-polo.
   - Therefore, if Skiing is on the left of Water-Polo, then Skiing, Swimming, Sailing is the only valid sequence from Clue 2.

4. From Clue 1, we know:
   - Skiing and Water-Polo must be adjacent.
   - Given the order Skiing, Swimming, Sailing, Water-Polo must be next to Skiing.

5. From Clue 4, we know:
   - Baseball cannot be directly to the right of Skiing.
   - Therefore, Skiing, Swimming, Sailing, Water-Polo, Baseball.

6. From Clue 6, we know:
   - Cycling must come before Baseball.
   - So, Cycling, Skiing, Swimming, Sailing, Water-Polo, Baseball.

7. From Clue 8, we know:
   - Sailing must come before Baseball.
   - This confirms our previous placement.

8. From Clue 5, we know:
   - Baseball cannot be directly to the left of Sailing.
   - This fits with our current arrangement.

### Final Placement:

- Cycling (1)
- Skiing (2)
- Swimming (3)
- Sailing (4)
- Water-Polo (5)
- Baseball (6)

Thus, the final solution is:

Lv8-1x6-9	"Let's analyze the clues step-by-step to determine the correct order of the jobs.

1. **The architect is on the right of the videographer.**
   - This means the videographer cannot be in position 6, and the architect must be in a position to the right of the videographer.

2. **The mechanic is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the mechanic is either in position 1 or 6.

3. **The mechanic is on the right of the analyst.**
   - If the mechanic is in position 1, then the analyst must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the mechanic is in position 6, this would violate clue 2 because there would be no position to the right of the mechanic for the analyst.

4. **The manager is on the left of the videographer.**
   - This means the manager cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 6, and the videographer must be to the right of the manager.

5. **The architect is not to the right of the project-manager.**
   - This means the project-manager cannot be in a position to the left of the architect.

6. **The analyst is somewhere to the right of the videographer.**
   - This means the videographer cannot be in position 6, and the analyst must be in a position to the right of the videographer.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the jobs:

- Since the mechanic must be on the far left or right (clue 2), and considering the other constraints, the mechanic must be in position 1 (because if it were in position 6, there would be no room for the analyst to be to the right of the videographer).
- The analyst must be to the right of the videographer (clue 6), and the mechanic is to the left of the analyst (clue 3). So, the analyst cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The manager must be to the left of the videographer (clue 4), so the manager cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 6.
- The architect must be to the right of the videographer (clue 1), and the architect cannot be to the right of the project-manager (clue 5).

Let's place the jobs step-by-step:

1. Mechanic (from clue 2)
2. Analyst (from clue 3 and 6)
3. Manager (from clue 4)
4. Videographer (from clue 4 and 6)
5. Project-manager (from clue 5 and 1)
6. Architect (from clue 1)

So, the final arrangement is:

```
|       |    1    |      2       |     3     |        4        |    5    |    6     |

Lv8-1x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each nationality in one of the six positions (1 through 6) while satisfying all the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step.

### Conditions Recap:
1. The Nigerian is on the left of the American.
2. The American is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian.
3. The Italian is somewhere between the Polish and the American.
4. The Canadian is on the right of the Italian.
5. The Polish is on the left of the Italian.
6. The Canadian is not to the left of the Canadian (this condition seems redundant or incorrectly worded, but it likely means that no two Canadians can be placed next to each other).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Condition 1**: The Nigerian is on the left of the American.
   - Possible pairs: (N, A), (N, A), (N, A), (N, A), (N, A)

2. **Condition 2**: The American is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian.
   - Possible order: (A, E)

3. **Condition 3**: The Italian is somewhere between the Polish and the American.
   - Possible orders: (P, I, A) or (A, I, P)

4. **Condition 4**: The Canadian is on the right of the Italian.
   - Possible order: (I, C)

5. **Condition 5**: The Polish is on the left of the Italian.
   - Possible order: (P, I)

6. **Condition 6**: The Canadian is not to the left of the Canadian (no redundancy here).

Let's combine these conditions:

- From Condition 5, we know Polish (P) must be on the left of Italian (I).
- From Condition 4, we know Italian (I) must be on the left of Canadian (C).
- Combining these, we get: (P, I, C).

Now, let's fit the remaining nationalities (American (A), Nigerian (N), and Egyptian (E)) into the remaining slots:

- From Condition 1, the Nigerian (N) must be to the left of the American (A).
- From Condition 2, the American (A) must be to the left of the Egyptian (E).

Given the constraints, we can place the nationalities as follows:

1. Nigerian (N)
2. Polish (P)
3. Italian (I)
4. Canadian (C)
5. American (A)
6. Egyptian (E)
