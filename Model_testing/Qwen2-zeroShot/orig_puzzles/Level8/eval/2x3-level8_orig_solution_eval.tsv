Lv8-2x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Statement 1:** The person driving the car is not to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
   - This means the person driving the car must be to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

2. **Statement 2:** The journalist is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
   - This means the journalist cannot be in the first position (leftmost) if someone is driving the quad-bike.

3. **Statement 3:** The person driving the quad-bike is between the architect and the journalist.
   - This means the order must be: Architect (A), Quad-bike driver (Q), Journalist (J).

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible positions for each person and vehicle.

- The person driving the quad-bike (Q) must be in the middle (position 2).
- The architect (A) must be to the left of the quad-bike driver.
- The journalist (J) must be to the right of the quad-bike driver.

So, the only valid arrangement considering all constraints is:
- Position 1: Architect (A)
- Position 2: Quad-bike driver (Q)
- Position 3: Journalist (J)

### Final Table:
Now we can fill in the table based on this arrangement:

```markdown
|             |     1     |     2     |     3      |
| Job         |   Architect | Quad-bike  | Journalist  |
| Transport   |    Car     |  Motorbike |    Car     |
```

### Explanation:
- Position 1: The architect is driving the car.
- Position 2: The quad-bike driver is using a motorbike.
- Position 3: The journalist is driving the car.

This satisfies all the given conditions:
1. The person driving the car (architect in position 1) is not to the left of the person driving the quad-bike (quad-bike driver in position 2).
2. The journalist (in position 3) is to the right of the quad-bike driver (in position 2).
3. The quad-bike driver (in position 2) is between the architect (in position 1) and the journalist (in position 3).

Lv8-2x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct beverage and pet in their respective positions.

Let's break down the clues:

1. **The person drinking cola is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the owner of the chinchilla.**
   - This means the order could be: Tea -> Cola -> Chinchilla or Chinchilla -> Cola -> Tea.

2. **The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.**
   - This means the owner of the turtle is either next to the person drinking tea (left or right).

3. **The owner of the rat is not to the right of the person drinking cola.**
   - This means the owner of the rat must be to the left of the person drinking cola or in the same position as the person drinking cola.

Let's start placing the information based on these clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis:**
   - We have three positions for the beverages: 1, 2, and 3.
   - The person drinking cola is between the person drinking tea and the owner of the chinchilla.
   - Possible orders: Tea -> Cola -> Chinchilla or Chinchilla -> Cola -> Tea.

2. **Clue 2 Analysis:**
   - The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
   - If the person drinking tea is in position 1, the owner of the turtle can be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the person drinking tea is in position 2, the owner of the turtle can be in position 1 or 3.
   - If the person drinking tea is in position 3, the owner of the turtle can be in position 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 3 Analysis:**
   - The owner of the rat is not to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - If the person drinking cola is in position 1, the owner of the rat cannot be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the person drinking cola is in position 2, the owner of the rat cannot be in position 3.
   - If the person drinking cola is in position 3, there are no restrictions on the position of the owner of the rat.

### Combining Clues:

Let's try the first possible order from Clue 1: **Tea -> Cola -> Chinchilla**.

- If Tea is in position 1, Cola is in position 2, and Chinchilla is in position 3.
- From Clue 2, the owner of the turtle must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since Cola is in position 2, the owner of the rat cannot be in position 3.
- Therefore, the owner of the turtle must be in position 3, and the owner of the rat must be in position 1.

This gives us:
- Position 1: Rat
- Position 2: Cola
- Position 3: Turtle and Chinchilla

But this does not satisfy Clue 2 since the owner of the turtle should be next to the person drinking tea, and here it is in position 3, which is not next to position 1 (Tea).

Now let's try the second possible order from Clue 1: **Chinchilla -> Cola -> Tea**.

- If Chinchilla is in position 1, Cola is in position 2, and Tea is in position 3.
- From Clue 2, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since Cola is in position 2, the owner of the rat cannot be in position 3.
- Therefore, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1, and the owner of the rat must be in position 3.

This gives us:
- Position 1: Turtle (owner of the turtle)
- Position 2: Cola
- Position 3: Rat (owner of the rat)

This satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 1: Chinchilla -> Cola -> Tea (Chinchilla is between Tea and Cola).
- Clue 2: Owner of the turtle (Turtle) is next to the person drinking tea (Tea).
- Clue 3: Owner of the rat (Rat) is not to the right of the person drinking cola (Cola).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |  1  |   2    |     3      |
| Beverage   | Tea | Cola   |  Soy-milk  |

Lv8-2x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and determine the correct placement for each person and their corresponding food and mode of transport.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating cauliflower is not to the left of the person driving the car.
   - This means the person eating cauliflower cannot be in position 1 (leftmost).

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating strawberry is somewhere between the person eating cauliflower and the person driving the bus.
   - This means the person eating strawberry must be in position 2 (middle) because it is between the person eating cauliflower (which cannot be in position 1) and the person driving the bus.

3. **Clue 3**: The person eating strawberry is not to the left of the person driving the subway.
   - Since the person eating strawberry is in position 2, the person driving the subway must be in position 3 (rightmost).

4. **Clue 4**: The person eating strawberry is on the right of the person driving the bus.
   - Since the person eating strawberry is in position 2, the person driving the bus must be in position 1 (leftmost).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 4, we know:
   - Position 1: Bus
   - Position 2: Strawberry
   - Position 3: Subway

2. From Clue 1, the person eating cauliflower cannot be in position 1 (leftmost). Since position 2 is occupied by strawberry, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 3 (rightmost).

3. From Clue 3, the person eating strawberry is not to the left of the person driving the subway, which is consistent with our previous placements.

4. We have three foods: cauliflower, nectarine, and strawberry. We need to place these in the correct positions.

5. Since position 2 is already occupied by strawberry, the remaining foods are cauliflower and nectarine. The person eating cauliflower is in position 3, so the remaining food, nectarine, must be in position 1.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food        | Nectarine | Strawberry | Cauliflower |

Lv8-2x3-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **The bartender is not to the right of the architect**:
   - This means the architect must be to the right of the bartender.
   
2. **The bartender is on the right of the analyst**:
   - This means the analyst cannot be in position 3 (the rightmost position).

3. **The person watching adventure movies is somewhere between the person watching horror movies and the analyst**:
   - This implies that the analyst is not in position 1 (leftmost), because if the analyst were in position 1, there would be no one to the left of the person watching horror movies for the analyst to be between.

Given these constraints, let's place the jobs and movie genres step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Analyst**:
   - From clue 2, the analyst cannot be in position 3.
   - From clue 3, the analyst cannot be in position 1 (because there would be no one to the left of the person watching horror movies).
   - Therefore, the analyst must be in position 2.

2. **Positioning the Bartender**:
   - From clue 2, the bartender cannot be in position 3.
   - Since the bartender is on the right of the analyst (who is in position 2), the bartender must be in position 3.

3. **Positioning the Architect**:
   - From clue 1, the architect must be to the right of the bartender.
   - Since the bartender is in position 3, the architect must be in position 1.

4. **Assigning Movie Genres**:
   - From clue 3, the person watching adventure movies is between the person watching horror movies and the analyst.
   - The analyst is in position 2, so the person watching horror movies must be in position 1 (architect) or position 3 (bartender).
   - Since the architect is in position 1, the person watching horror movies must be the architect.
   - The person watching adventure movies must be in position 2 (analyst).
   - Therefore, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 3 (bartender).

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1    |     2     |     3     |
| Job           | Architect | Analyst  | Bartender |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror    | Adventure | Zombie    |

Lv8-2x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the jobs and pets accordingly. Let's break down the clues:

1. The owner of the horse is somewhere to the left of the dancer.
2. The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the dancer.
3. The security-guard is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
4. The photographer is on the left of the dancer.

Let's denote:
- Dancer as D
- Photographer as P
- Security-guard as S

And the pets:
- Chinchilla as C
- Goat as G
- Horse as H

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: The owner of the horse (H) is somewhere to the left of the dancer (D).
This means that if H is in position 1, D must be in position 2 or 3. If H is in position 2, D must be in position 3.

#### Clue 2: The owner of the chinchilla (C) is somewhere to the right of the dancer (D).
This means that if D is in position 1, C must be in position 2 or 3. If D is in position 2, C must be in position 3.

#### Clue 3: The security-guard (S) is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla (C).
This means that if C is in position 2, S cannot be in position 3. If C is in position 3, S can be in position 1 or 2 but not 3.

#### Clue 4: The photographer (P) is on the left of the dancer (D).
This means that if D is in position 2, P must be in position 1. If D is in position 3, P must be in position 1 or 2.

### Combining the Clues:

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we know:
- H must be to the left of D.
- C must be to the right of D.

From Clue 3, we know:
- S cannot be to the right of C.

From Clue 4, we know:
- P must be to the left of D.

Considering these constraints, let's test possible placements:

1. If D is in position 3:
   - H must be in position 1 or 2.
   - C must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Since D is in position 3, C cannot be in position 3, so C must be in position 2.
   - H must be in position 1 (since it's to the left of D).
   - This leaves position 2 for C, which conflicts with C being in position 2. So, D cannot be in position 3.

2. If D is in position 2:
   - H must be in position 1.
   - C must be in position 3.
   - S cannot be in position 3 (Clue 3), so S must be in position 1.
   - This placement satisfies all conditions.

So, the only valid arrangement is:
- Position 1: S (Security-guard)
- Position 2: D (Dancer)
- Position 3: C (Chinchilla)

Now, we need to assign the jobs and pets based on the remaining positions and clues:

- P (Photographer) must be to the left of D (Clue 4). Therefore, P must be in position 1.
- S (Security-guard) must be in position 1, leaving D (Dancer) in position 2 and C (Chinchilla) in position 3.
- The photographer (P) must be in position 1.

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|       |      1       |   2    |       3        |
| Job   | Photographer |   Dancer | Security-guard |
| Pet   | Chinchilla  |   Goat  |     Horse      |
```

```plaintext
|       |      1       |   2    |       3        |
| Job   | Photographer |   Dancer | Security-guard |
| Pet   | Chinchilla  |   Goat  |     Horse      |

Lv8-2x3-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The pilot is between the writer and the person drinking sprite.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the writer.
3. The person drinking sprite is not to the left of the writer.
4. The writer is the person drinking almond-milk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4:
- **Writer** drinks **almond-milk**.

So, we can fill this in our table:

|            |      1      |    2     |   3    |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Beverage   | almond-milk |          |        |
| Job        |             |          |        |

#### Clue 3:
- The person drinking **sprite** is not to the left of the writer (who is in position 3).

This means the person drinking **sprite** must be in position 2 or 3. Since the writer is in position 3, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2.

So, we update our table:

|            |      1      |    2     |   3    |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Beverage   | almond-milk | sprite   |        |
| Job        |             |          | writer |

#### Clue 1:
- The pilot is between the writer and the person drinking **sprite**.

Since the writer is in position 3 and the person drinking sprite is in position 2, the pilot must be in position 1.

So, we update our table:

|            |      1      |    2     |   3    |

| Beverage   | almond-milk | sprite   |        |
| Job        | pilot       |          | writer |

#### Clue 2:
- The person drinking **iced-tea** is not to the left of the writer.

Since the writer is in position 3, the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3.

However, position 3 is already occupied by the writer. This means there is no contradiction because the only job left for position 1 and 2 is the pilot and the person drinking iced-tea, respectively.

So, we update our table:

|            |      1      |    2     |   3    |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Beverage   | almond-milk | sprite   | iced-tea |
| Job        | pilot       | lawyer   | writer |

Lv8-2x3-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the Dutch.**
2. **The person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming.**
3. **The person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the Dutch.**
4. **The Egyptian is not to the left of the person who's sport is swimming.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- The person who skis must be to the left of the Dutch.
- This means if the Dutch is in position 3, the skier can only be in positions 1 or 2.
- If the Dutch is in position 2, the skier can only be in position 1.
- If the Dutch is in position 1, there would be no room for the skier to the left.

#### Clue 3:
- The person who swims must be to the right of the Dutch.
- This means if the Dutch is in position 1, the swimmer can be in positions 2 or 3.
- If the Dutch is in position 2, the swimmer can only be in position 3.
- If the Dutch is in position 3, there would be no room for the swimmer to the right.

#### Combining Clues 1 and 3:
- Since the Dutch cannot be in position 3 (because then there would be no room for the swimmer to the right), the Dutch must be in either position 1 or 2.
- If the Dutch is in position 1, the swimmer can be in position 2 or 3.
- If the Dutch is in position 2, the swimmer must be in position 3.

#### Clue 2:
- The person who climbs is not to the right of the person who swims.
- This means if the swimmer is in position 3, the climber cannot be in position 3.
- If the swimmer is in position 2, the climber cannot be in position 3.
- If the swimmer is in position 1, the climber can be in positions 2 or 3.

#### Clue 4:
- The Egyptian is not to the left of the person who swims.
- This means if the swimmer is in position 2, the Egyptian cannot be in position 1.
- If the swimmer is in position 3, the Egyptian cannot be in position 1 or 2.

### Final Arrangement:
Let's test the possible scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Dutch in Position 1**
- If Dutch is in position 1, the swimmer can be in position 2 or 3.
- If the swimmer is in position 2, the climber must be in position 3 (since the climber is not to the right of the swimmer).
- The Egyptian must be in position 3 (since the Egyptian is not to the left of the swimmer).

This arrangement does not work because the climber would be in position 3, and the Egyptian would also be in position 3, which is impossible.

**Scenario 2: Dutch in Position 2**
- If Dutch is in position 2, the swimmer must be in position 3.
- The climber cannot be in position 3, so the climber must be in position 1.
- The Egyptian must be in position 1 (since the Egyptian is not to the left of the swimmer).

This arrangement works:
- Dutch in position 2.
- Climber in position 1.
- Swimmer in position 3.
- Egyptian in position 1.

Since the Egyptian is in position 1 and the climber is in position 1, this scenario is invalid due to the repetition.

**Correct Scenario:**
- Dutch in position 2.
- Swimmer in position 3.
- Climber in position 1.
- Egyptian in position 2.

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. The skier (climber) is to the left of the Dutch.
2. The climber is not to the right of the swimmer.
3. The swimmer is to the right of the Dutch.
4. The Egyptian is not to the left of the swimmer.

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1    |    2     |    3     |

Lv8-2x3-9	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

We have:
- 3 types of food: pear, raspberry, watermelon
- 3 movie genres: action, drama, romance

Given clues:
1. The person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.
2. The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the person eating raspberry.
3. The person watching action movies is on the far left.
4. The person watching drama movies is not to the right of the person eating pear.

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues:

|               |     1      |   2   |     3     |
|---------------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Food          |            |       |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     |       |           |

From clue 3, we know that ""Action"" must be in position 1. So the table looks like this now:

|               |     1      |   2   |     3     |
|---------------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Food          |            |       |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     |       |           |

Next, let's consider clue 1: ""The person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies."" Since ""Action"" is already in position 1, the person eating pear cannot be in position 1 (because there's no one to the left of position 1). Therefore, the person eating pear must be in either position 2 or 3, and the person watching romance movies must be in position 3.

Now, considering clue 4: ""The person watching drama movies is not to the right of the person eating pear."" This means the person watching drama movies must be in position 1 (since it can't be in position 2 or 3 if the person eating pear is in position 2 or 3).

Since ""Action"" is in position 1 and ""Drama"" is in position 1, this creates a contradiction unless we reconsider the positions for the other foods and movies. Let's try another arrangement:

|               |     1      |   2   |     3     |
|---------------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Food          |            |       |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     | Drama | Romance   |

This satisfies clue 3 and clue 4. Now, we need to place the foods based on the remaining clues:

Clue 2 states: ""The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the person eating raspberry.""
Clue 1 states: ""The person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.""

Since ""Romance"" is in position 3, ""Pear"" must be in position 2 (left of position 3) and ""Raspberry"" must be in position 1 (left of position 2). And ""Watermelon"" must be in position 1 because it needs to be to the left of ""Raspberry"".

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |     1      |   2   |     3     |
|---------------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Food          | Watermelon | Pear  | Raspberry |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     | Drama | Romance   |

Let's box the final solution:

```
|               |     1      |   2   |     3     |
|---------------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Food          | Watermelon | Pear  | Raspberry |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     | Drama | Romance   |

Lv8-2x3-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking sprite is in the middle.
2. The person whose sport is tennis is not to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
3. The person whose sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is weightlifting.
4. The person whose sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the person whose sport is weightlifting (redundant with clue 3).
5. The person whose sport is tennis is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The person drinking sprite is in the middle.
This means:
- Sprite is in position 2.

#### Clue 2: The person whose sport is tennis is not to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
- This means that if someone is drinking mirinda, they cannot be to the left of the person doing tennis.

#### Clue 3: The person whose sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is weightlifting.
- This means biathlon must be to the right of weightlifting.

#### Clue 5: The person whose sport is tennis is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
- Since sprite is in position 2, tennis must be in position 1.

From Clue 5, we can place tennis in position 1 and sprite in position 2:
```
|            |    1    |       2       |    3     |
| Beverage   | tennis  |       sprite  |          |
| Sport      |         |               |          |
```

Now, let's consider Clue 3 and Clue 1:
- Biathlon must be to the right of weightlifting, and sprite is already in position 2.
- Therefore, weightlifting must be in position 1 and biathlon in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|            |    1    |       2       |    3     |
| Beverage   | tennis  |       sprite  |          |
| Sport      | weightlifting |       sprite  | biathlon |
```

Finally, let's assign the beverages based on Clue 2:
- The person drinking mirinda cannot be to the left of the person doing tennis.
- Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3, and the remaining beverage (juice) must be in position 1.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
```
|            |    1    |       2       |    3     |
| Beverage   | juice   |       sprite  |       mirinda |
| Sport      | weightlifting |       sprite  | biathlon |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |    1    |       2       |    3     |
| Beverage   | juice   |       sprite  |       mirinda |
| Sport      | weightlifting |       sprite  | biathlon |
```"	{'beverage': ['juice', 'sprite', 'mirinda'], 'sport': ['weightlifting', 'sprite', 'biathlon']}	True	2	False
