Lv8-2x2-1	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

Given:
- There are two types of food: onion and orange.
- There are two types of transport: airplane and scooter.
- The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the scooter.
- The person eating onion is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.

We need to fill in the table:

|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        |         |          |
| Transport   |         |          |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Transport Order**:
   - The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the scooter.
   - This means that if the person in position 1 is driving the scooter, then the person in position 2 must be driving the airplane.
   
2. **Identify the Food Order**:
   - The person eating onion is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.
   - This means that the person eating onion cannot be in position 2 (the rightmost position).

Let's consider the possible combinations:

- If the person in position 1 is driving the scooter, then the person in position 2 is driving the airplane.
- The person eating onion cannot be in position 2, so they must be in position 1.

So, we can conclude:
- Position 1: Scooter, Onion
- Position 2: Airplane, Orange

Now, let's fill in the table:

|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        | Onion   | Orange   |
| Transport   | Scooter | Airplane |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        | Onion   | Orange   |
| Transport   | Scooter | Airplane |

Lv8-2x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

### Conditions:
1. The person who's sport is cycling is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

### Analysis:
- From condition 1 and 2, we can infer that the person who drinks soy-milk must be immediately to the left of the person who plays cycling. This means there is no one between them.

Given the table structure:

|            |    1     |    2    |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Beverage   |          |         |
| Sport      |          |         |

We need to place ""juice"" or ""soy-milk"" in the Beverage column and ""cycling"" or ""lacrosse"" in the Sport column.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Place ""soy-milk"" in either position 1 or 2 in the Beverage column.
2. Place ""cycling"" in the adjacent position (either 1 or 2) in the Sport column.

Let's start with placing ""soy-milk"" in position 1 and ""cycling"" in position 2:

|            |    1     |    2    |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Beverage   | soy-milk |         |
| Sport      | cycling  |         |

This satisfies both conditions since the person drinking soy-milk (position 1) is immediately to the left of the person playing cycling (position 2).

Now, we need to fill the remaining positions with the other beverage and sport.

3. The remaining beverage is ""juice"".
4. The remaining sport is ""lacrosse"".

So, the final arrangement is:

|            |    1     |    2    |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Beverage   | soy-milk | juice   |
| Sport      | cycling  | lacrosse|

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |    1     |    2    |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Beverage   | soy-milk | juice   |
| Sport      | cycling  | lacrosse|

Lv8-2x2-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step:

1. We have two columns (1 and 2) and two rows (Food and Music-Genre).
2. The possible foods are cabbage and peach.
3. The possible music genres are pop and r&b.
4. We need to satisfy the given conditions:
   - Condition 1: The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the fan of r&b.
   - Condition 2: The person eating peach is on the left of the fan of r&b.

Let's denote the cells as follows:
- Cell (1, 1): Top-left cell (Food)
- Cell (1, 2): Top-right cell (Food)
- Cell (2, 1): Bottom-left cell (Music-Genre)
- Cell (2, 2): Bottom-right cell (Music-Genre)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Condition 1 Analysis:
- If the person eating cabbage is in cell (1, 1), then the person who is a fan of r&b must be in either cell (1, 2) or (2, 1).
- If the person eating cabbage is in cell (1, 2), then the person who is a fan of r&b must be in (2, 2).

#### Condition 2 Analysis:
- If the person eating peach is in cell (1, 1), then the person who is a fan of r&b must be in (2, 1).
- If the person eating peach is in cell (1, 2), then the person who is a fan of r&b must be in (2, 2).

Let's try to place the values based on these conditions:

1. **Assume the person eating cabbage is in cell (1, 2)**:
   - This means the person who is a fan of r&b cannot be in (1, 1) because that would violate Condition 1.
   - Therefore, the person who is a fan of r&b must be in (2, 2).
   - Now, we need to place peach in (1, 1) since it must be to the left of the fan of r&b (Condition 2).

So, the configuration looks like this:
- Cell (1, 1): Peach
- Cell (1, 2): Cabbage
- Cell (2, 1): Pop
- Cell (2, 2): R&B

This satisfies both conditions:
- Condition 1: The person eating cabbage (cell (1, 2)) is not to the left of the fan of r&b (cell (2, 2)).
- Condition 2: The person eating peach (cell (1, 1)) is on the left of the fan of r&b (cell (2, 2)).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1   |    2    |
| Food          | Peach | Cabbage |
| Music-Genre   | Pop   | R&B     |

Lv8-2x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information into the given table step by step.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the dog is not to the right of the person eating lime.
2. The person eating lime is on the right of the owner of the dog.

### Table:
```
|        |   1    |  2   |
| Food   |        |      |
| Pet    |        |      |
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person eating lime is on the right of the owner of the dog.
   - This means that if someone is eating lime, they must be in position 2 (right side) and the owner of the dog must be in position 1 (left side).

2. **Clue 1**: The owner of the dog is not to the right of the person eating lime.
   - This reaffirms that the owner of the dog must be in position 1 and the person eating lime must be in position 2.

Given these two clues, we can deduce the following:
- The owner of the dog must be in position 1.
- The person eating lime must be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the table with the information we have:

### Final Table:
```
|        |   Dog  |  Lime |
| Food   |        |      |
| Pet    |        |      |
```

Since we have only two types of food (lime and potato) and two types of pets (dog and fish), and we've already placed the dog and lime, the remaining options are:

- Position 1 (Dog) can either have the dog or the fish as the pet.
- Position 2 (Lime) can either have the lime or the potato as the food.

However, since we know the dog is in position 1 and the lime is in position 2, the remaining food for position 1 must be potato and the remaining food for position 2 must be lime. Similarly, the remaining pet for position 2 must be fish.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|        |   Potato |  Lime  |
| Food   |         |       |
| Pet    |   Fish   |   Dog  |

Lv8-2x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place them into the table step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter (This seems redundant or incorrectly phrased, but we'll interpret it as the person driving the helicopter is not on the far left).
2. The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1 Analysis:
- This clue suggests that the person driving the helicopter cannot be in the first position. Therefore, the person driving the helicopter must be in the second position.

#### Clue 2 Analysis:
- The person who plays soccer must be to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since there are only two positions, this means the person who plays soccer must be in the first position, and the person driving the snowmobile must be in the second position.

Given these deductions, we can place the elements in the table:

|             |     1      |     2      |

Lv8-2x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the information and apply it step by step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two different favorite beverages: Fanta and Soy-milk.
2. There are two different types of sports: Baseball and Volleyball.
3. The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person drinking Fanta.
4. The person who's sport is volleyball is not to the right of the person who's sport is baseball.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze the first clue.
- ""The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person drinking Fanta.""
  - This means if the person drinking Fanta is in position 1, then the person doing baseball must be in position 2.
  
#### Step 2: Analyze the second clue.
- ""The person who's sport is volleyball is not to the right of the person who's sport is baseball.""
  - This means if the person doing baseball is in position 2, then the person doing volleyball cannot be in position 2 (since position 2 is occupied by baseball).

### Combining the Clues:
- From clue 1, we know that if Fanta is in position 1, then Baseball must be in position 2.
- From clue 2, since Baseball is in position 2, Volleyball cannot be in position 2. Therefore, Volleyball must be in position 1.

### Assigning the Beverages and Sports:
- Position 1: Fanta (since Volleyball cannot be in position 2)
- Position 2: Baseball (since Fanta is in position 1)

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- **Position 1:** Fanta (Beverage)
- **Position 2:** Baseball (Sport)

### Final Table:
```
|            |     1      |    2     |
| Beverage   |    Fanta   |          |

Lv8-2x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is gardening.
2. The person eating pomegranate is not to the right of the person eating pomegranate (which means there must be another person eating pomegranate to the left).

From clue 1, we know that the person with the hobby of gardening cannot be in the first position if the person eating pomegranate is to their right. From clue 2, it implies there are two people eating pomegranate, but since there are only two positions available, one of them must be in position 1 and the other in position 2.

Let's denote:
- Person 1: Position 1
- Person 2: Position 2

Given the constraints, the only way to satisfy both clues is:
- Person 1 eats pomegranate.
- Person 2 has the hobby of gardening.
- Therefore, Person 2 must eat pomegranate as well.

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- Since Person 1 and Person 2 both eat pomegranate, the remaining food, papaya, must be eaten by someone else. However, there are no other people mentioned, so we assume the remaining person (if any) would eat papaya.

- The remaining hobby, chess, must be assigned to the remaining person (if any).

Since we have two people eating pomegranate and only two positions, the only logical arrangement is:
- Person 1: Eating pomegranate, Hobby: Chess
- Person 2: Eating pomegranate, Hobby: Gardening

### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |     1     |      2      |
| Food    | Papaya    | Pomegranate |

Lv8-2x2-8	"Certainly! Let's break down the information and constraints provided:

1. The people have two different jobs: librarian and videographer.
2. The people use two different means of transport: helicopter and scooter.
3. The librarian is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.
4. The videographer is on the far left.

Given the table structure:
```
|             |      1       |     2     |
| Job         |              |           |
| Transport   |              |           |
```

We need to place the jobs and transports accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Videographer is on the far left**:
   - This means the videographer must be in position 1 for both job and transport.

2. **Librarian is not to the right of the person driving the scooter**:
   - If the librarian is in position 2, then the person driving the scooter must be in position 1 (since the librarian cannot be to the right of the scooter driver).

3. **Determine the remaining roles and transports**:
   - Since the videographer is in position 1 for both job and transport, we can fill that in first.
   - The librarian must be in position 2 for the job, and since the librarian cannot be to the right of the scooter driver, the person driving the scooter must be in position 1 for transport.

So, the final arrangement should be:
- Position 1 (Job): Videographer
- Position 1 (Transport): Helicopter (since the videographer uses the helicopter)
- Position 2 (Job): Librarian
- Position 2 (Transport): Scooter (since the librarian uses the scooter)

Here's the final solution table:

```
|             |      1       |     2     |
| Job         | Videographer | Librarian |

Lv8-2x2-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place them in the grid accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person watching zombie movies is not to the left of the Mexican.
2. The American is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.

### Initial Setup:
We have two columns (1 and 2) and two rows (Movie-Genre and Nationality). We need to fill these with ""thriller"" and ""zombie"" for Movie-Genre, and ""American"" and ""Mexican"" for Nationality.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The person watching zombie movies is not to the left of the Mexican.
This means that if someone is watching zombie movies, they cannot be in column 1 (leftmost position).

#### Clue 2: The American is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.
This means the American must be in a column to the left of the column where the person watching zombie movies is located.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

1. Since the American is to the left of the person watching zombie movies, the American cannot be in column 2 because there would be no column to the left.
2. Therefore, the American must be in column 1, and the person watching zombie movies must be in column 2.

Now we can place the values:

- Column 1 (American) must watch thriller.
- Column 2 (Zombie) must be watched by the Mexican.

So, the final solution looks like this:

Lv8-2x2-10	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We have the following constraints:
1. The person who prefers surfing is not to the left of the Pakistani.
2. The Pakistani is on the far right.

Given the table format:

|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Nationality   |           |           |
| Sport         |           |           |

Let's denote:
- The nationality of person 1 as \( N_1 \)
- The nationality of person 2 as \( N_2 \)
- The sport of person 1 as \( S_1 \)
- The sport of person 2 as \( S_2 \)

From the second constraint, we know that the Pakistani (P) must be in position 2. So, we can fill in the nationality for position 2:

|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Nationality   |           | **P**     |
| Sport         |           |           |

Now, we need to place the sports and ensure that the person who prefers surfing is not to the left of the Pakistani. The possible sports are surfing (S) and tennis (T).

Since the Pakistani is in position 2, the person in position 1 cannot be surfing if the person in position 2 is Pakistani. Therefore, the person in position 1 must be tennis.

So, we can fill in the sport for position 1:

|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Nationality   |           | **P**     |
| Sport         | **T**     |           |

Finally, the only sport left for position 2 is surfing (S), since there are no other options.

|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Nationality   |           | **P**     |
| Sport         | **T**     | **S**     |

Now, we need to determine the nationalities. Since the Pakistani is in position 2, the remaining nationality (Argentine) must be in position 1.

|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Nationality   | **A**     | **P**     |
