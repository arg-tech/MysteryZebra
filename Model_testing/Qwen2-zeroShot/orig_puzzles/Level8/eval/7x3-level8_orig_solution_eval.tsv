### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the librarian
From clue 1, the owner of the frog is the librarian.
From clue 4, the librarian drives the jet-ski.
From clue 14, the person driving the taxi is on the far right (position 3), so the librarian must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 2: Determine the firefighter and the owner of the ferret
From clue 12, the firefighter is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret.
From clue 9, the owner of the frog (librarian) is on the left of the scientist.
Thus, the scientist must be in position 3 (since the librarian is either in position 1 or 2).

Since the librarian is in position 1 or 2, the firefighter must be in position 1 if the scientist is in position 3.
This means the firefighter is in position 1 and the owner of the ferret is in position 2.

#### Step 3: Determine the person with the hobby of baking
From clue 3, the person whose hobby is baking is the person driving the taxi (position 3).
So, the person with the hobby of baking is the scientist.

#### Step 4: Determine the person with the hobby of chess

Since the scientist has the hobby of baking, the person with the hobby of chess must be the librarian (position 1).

#### Step 5: Determine the person with the hobby of drawing
From clue 9, the owner of the frog (librarian) is on the left of the scientist.
The remaining person with the hobby of drawing must be the firefighter (position 1).

#### Step 6: Determine the person with the pet of ferret
From clue 12, the firefighter is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret.
The owner of the ferret must be in position 2, which is the firefighter.
From clue 7, the person drinking sprite is the owner of the guinea pig.
So, the firefighter drinks sprite and owns the guinea pig.

#### Step 7: Determine the person with the pet of frog
From clue 1, the owner of the frog is the librarian (position 1).
From clue 7, the person drinking sprite is the owner of the guinea pig.
So, the librarian does not drink sprite, thus the librarian drinks almond milk.

#### Step 8: Determine the person with the pet of guinea pig
From clue 7, the person drinking sprite is the owner of the guinea pig.
So, the firefighter drinks sprite and owns the guinea pig.

#### Step 9: Determine the person with the pet of ferret
From clue 12, the firefighter is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret.
The owner of the ferret must be in position 2, which is the firefighter.
The firefighter drinks sprite and owns the guinea pig.

#### Step 10: Determine the person with the beverage of soy milk
From clue 6, the person drinking soy milk is the person whose hobby is chess.
So, the librarian drinks soy milk.

#### Step 11: Determine the person with the beverage of sprite
From clue 7, the person drinking sprite is the owner of the guinea pig.
So, the firefighter drinks sprite.

#### Step 12: Determine the person with the beverage of watermelon
From clue 8, the person eating watermelon is not to the right of the person drinking soy milk.
Since the librarian drinks soy milk, the person eating watermelon must be in position 1 (the librarian).

#### Step 13: Determine the person with the beverage of almond milk
The only remaining person is the firefighter, who drinks sprite and owns the guinea pig.
The firefighter must drink watermelon.

#### Step 14: Determine the person with the beverage of sprite
From clue 11, the owner of the frog (librarian) is not the person watching animation movies.
So, the person watching animation movies must be the firefighter (position 1).

**Clue 14**: The fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the person eating garlic.

Since reggae is to the left of garlic, and reggae must be in position 1 or 2, and since position 2 is taken by hot-chocolate, reggae must be in position 1.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of folk is somewhere to the right of the person watching zombie movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the rabbit is the person eating garlic.
3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the rabbit is on the far left or far right.
4. **Clue 4:** The person eating onion is somewhere between the Mexican and the owner of the cat.
5. **Clue 5:** The person drinking tea is not to the right of the person eating garlic.
6. **Clue 6:** The American is not to the right of the Argentine.
7. **Clue 7:** The owner of the goat is the person watching horror movies.
8. **Clue 8:** The fan of gospel is not the owner of the goat.
9. **Clue 9:** The owner of the rabbit is not the fan of punk.
10. **Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the person eating onion.
11. **Clue 11:** The person eating onion is not to the left of the fan of folk.

13. **Clue 13:** The person watching sports movies is on the far left or far right.
14. **Clue 14:** The owner of the cat is not to the left of the American.
15. **Clue 15:** The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the fan of punk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 3:** The owner of the rabbit is on the far left or far right. Let's place the rabbit at position 1 or 3.
2. **From Clue 2:** The owner of the rabbit eats garlic. So, if the rabbit is at position 1, then position 1 is garlic; if the rabbit is at position 3, then position 3 is garlic.
3. **From Clue 12:** The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means the filmmaking position must be to the right of the hot-chocolate position.
4. **From Clue 13:** The person watching sports movies is on the far left or far right. Since the rabbit is already placed at one of these positions (1 or 3), the sports movie position must be the other one.
5. **From Clue 7:** The owner of the goat watches horror movies. The horror movie position must be either 1 or 3, but since the rabbit is already placed there, the horror movie position must be 2.
6. **From Clue 7:** The owner of the goat watches horror movies, so the horror movie position is 2.
7. **From Clue 1:** The fan of folk is to the right of the person watching zombie movies. Since the horror movie is in position 2, the zombie movie position must be 1 or 3.
8. **From Clue 5:** The person drinking tea is not to the right of the person eating garlic. If the rabbit is at position 1, then the person drinking tea cannot be at position 2 or 3. If the rabbit is at position 3, then the person drinking tea cannot be at position 2 or 3.
9. **From Clue 4:** The person eating onion is between the Mexican and the owner of the cat. The only way to fit this is if the Mexican is at position 1, the owner of the cat is at position 3, and the person eating onion is at position 2.
10. **From Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is card-games is to the right of the person eating onion. Since the onion is at position 2, the card-games position must be 3.
11. **From Clue 6:** The American is not to the right of the Argentine. The American must be at position 1 and the Argentine at position 3.
12. **From Clue 9:** The owner of the rabbit is not the fan of punk. Since the rabbit is at position 1 or 3, the fan of punk must be at position 2.
13. **From Clue 11:** The person eating onion is not to the left of the fan of folk. Since the onion is at position 2, the folk position must be 3.
14. **From Clue 8:** The fan of gospel is not the owner of the goat. Since the goat is at position 2, the fan of gospel must be at position 1.
15. **From Clue 14:** The owner of the cat is not to the left of the American. Since the cat is at position 3 and the American is at position 1, this is consistent.
16. **From Clue 15:** The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the fan of punk. Since the punk is at position 2, the milk can be at position 1 or 3. Given the positions of other items, milk must be at position 3.
