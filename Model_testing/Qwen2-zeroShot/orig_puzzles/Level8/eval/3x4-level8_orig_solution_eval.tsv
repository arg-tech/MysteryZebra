1. **Clue 10:** The person whose sport is Ice-Hockey is the person whose hobby is Writing.
   - This means:
     - Position 1: Writing (Hobby), Ice-Hockey (Sport)
     - Position 4: Not Writing (Hobby), Not Ice-Hockey (Sport)

2. **Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is Sudoku is in an odd position (1 or 3).
   - Since position 1 is taken by Writing, Sudoku must be in position 3.
   - This means:
     - Position 3: Sudoku (Hobby), Not Cycling, Not Skiing

3. **Clue 6:** The person whose sport is Ice-Hockey is on the left of the person whose hobby is Sudoku.
   - Since Ice-Hockey is in position 1, Sudoku must be in position 3.
   - This is consistent with our previous deductions.

4. **Clue 3:** The person whose sport is Skiing is not to the right of the person whose hobby is Magic-Tricks.
   - Since Sudoku is in position 3, Skiing cannot be in position 4.
   - This means Skiing must be in position 2 or 4, but since position 4 is not for Skiing, it must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 14:** The person whose hobby is Sudoku is not to the right of the person whose sport is Skiing.
   - Since Sudoku is in position 3 and Skiing is in position 2, this is consistent.

6. **Clue 7:** The person whose sport is Skiing is not to the left of the person eating Kale.
   - Since Skiing is in position 2, Kale must be in position 4.
   - This means:
     - Position 4: Kale (Food)

7. **Clue 12:** The person eating Kale is in an even position (2 or 4).
   - We already placed Kale in position 4, so this is consistent.

8. **Clue 8:** The person eating Kale is not the person whose sport is Volleyball.
   - This means Volleyball cannot be in position 4.

9. **Clue 11:** The person eating Kale is not to the right of the person whose sport is Skiing.
   - Since Skiing is in position 2 and Kale is in position 4, this is consistent.

10. **Clue 4:** The person whose sport is Cycling is not the person eating Radish.
    - Since Skiing is in position 2, Cycling must be in position 1 or 3, but position 1 is for Writing, so Cycling must be in position 3.
    - This means:
      - Position 3: Not Cycling, Skiing, Sudoku
      - Position 1: Writing (Hobby), Ice-Hockey (Sport)

11. **Clue 2:** The person eating radish is on the right of the person whose sport is cycling.
    - Since Cycling is in position 3, Radish must be in position 4.
    - This means:
      - Position 4: Kale (Food)
      - Position 3: Not Cycling, Skiing, Sudoku
      - Position 1: Writing (Hobby), Ice-Hockey (Sport)

12. **Clue 5:** The person eating Pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating Apple.
    - Since Radish is in position 4, Apple must be in position 1 or 2.

    - This means:
      - Position 2: Apple (Food)
      - Position 1: Writing (Hobby), Ice-Hockey (Sport)
      - Position 3: Not Cycling, Skiing, Sudoku
      - Position 4: Kale (Food), Radish

    - Since Volleyball cannot be in position 4, it must be in position 1 or 2.
    - Since Writing is in position 1, Volleyball must be in position 2.
    - This means:
      - Position 2: Apple (Food)
      - Position 1: Writing (Hobby), Ice-Hockey (Sport)
      - Position 3: Not Cycling, Skiing, Sudoku
      - Position 4: Kale (Food), Radish

14. **Clue 9:** The person eating Apple is not the person whose hobby is Writing.
    - This is consistent since Apple is in position 2 and Writing is in position 1.

15. **Clue 15:** The person eating Pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating Apple.
    - Since Apple is in position 2 and Kale is in position 4, Pepper must be in position 3.
    - This means:
      - Position 3: Not Cycling, Skiing, Sudoku
      - Position 1: Writing (Hobby), Ice-Hockey (Sport)
      - Position 2: Apple (Food)

Lv8-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 2:** The person drinking milk is on the far left.
2. **Clue 4:** The person drinking water is the freelancer.
3. **Clue 5:** The electrician is not the person drinking milk.
4. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
5. **Clue 7:** The person drinking water is on the right of the electrician.
6. **Clue 8:** The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking water.
7. **Clue 9:** The person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the librarian.
8. **Clue 10:** The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.

From Clue 2, we know:
- **Position 1:** Milk

From Clue 4, we know:
- **Position 3:** Water (Freelancer)

From Clue 7 and Clue 8, we can deduce:
- Since the person drinking water is on the right of the electrician and also on the right of the person drinking coffee, the person drinking coffee must be in Position 2 and the electrician in Position 4.

So far, we have:
```
|            |       1       |      2      |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage   | Milk          | Coffee      | Water      |            |
| Job        |               |             | Freelancer |            |
| Sport      |               |             |            |            |
```

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
- Therefore, the person with badminton as their sport is in Position 4.

From Clue 10, we know:
- The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
- Therefore, the person with weightlifting as their sport is in Position 2.

Now we have:
```
|            |       1       |      2      |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage   | Milk          | Coffee      | Water      | Weightlifting |
| Job        |               |             | Freelancer |            |
| Sport      |               | Badminton   |            | Ice-hockey  |
```

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
- This means the person with ice-hockey as their sport is in Position 4, which conflicts with our previous assignment for Position 4. So, we need to adjust.

Since the person with ice-hockey as their sport must be in Position 4, and the person with badminton as their sport is in Position 2, we need to reassign:
- The person with weightlifting as their sport is in Position 2.
- The person with badminton as their sport is in Position 3.
- The person with ice-hockey as their sport is in Position 4.

So now we have:
```
|            |       1       |      2      |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage   | Milk          | Coffee      | Badminton  | Ice-hockey |
| Job        |               |             | Freelancer |            |
| Sport      |               | Weightlifting|            |            |
```

From Clue 1, we know:
- The librarian is not to the right of the pilot.
- Since the librarian is in Position 3, the pilot must be in Position 1 or 2.

From Clue 9, we know:
- The person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the librarian.
- Since the librarian is in Position 3, the pilot must be in Position 1.

So now we have:
```
|            |       1       |      2      |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage   | Milk          | Coffee      | Badminton  | Ice-hockey |
| Job        | Electrician   |             | Freelancer |            |
| Sport      |               | Weightlifting|            |            |
```

From Clue 5, we know:
- The electrician is not the person drinking milk.
- Therefore, the electrician must be in Position 1.

Finally, the remaining job is the librarian, who must be in Position 2.

So the final solution is:
```
|            |       1       |      2      |     3      |     4      |

8. The person whose hobby is sudoku is on the left of the fan of d&b.
9. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is in an even position.
10. The person whose hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Van Driver and Card-Games Hobbier
From clue 1:
- The person with the hobby of card-games is on the right of the van driver.
- This implies the van driver must be in position 1 or 2, and the card-games hobbier must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Roller and Tram Drivers
From clue 2:
- The person driving the roller is to the right of the person driving the tram.
- This means the tram driver must be in position 1 or 2, and the roller driver must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Country Fan
From clue 4:
- The fan of country is to the left of the van driver.
- Since the van driver can only be in positions 1 or 2, the country fan must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 4: Positioning the Blues Fan
From clue 6:
- The fan of blues is to the left of the van driver.
- This means the blues fan must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 5: Positioning the Sudoku Hobbier
From clue 8:
- The person with the hobby of sudoku is to the left of the d&b fan.
- From clue 10, the person with the hobby of sudoku is also to the left of the roller driver.
- Combining these, the sudoku hobbier must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 6: Positioning the Filmmaker
From clue 9:
- The person whose hobby is filmmaking is in an even position (2 or 4).
- Since the van driver and the roller driver cannot occupy the same position as the filmmaker, the filmmaker must be in position 4.

#### Step 7: Final Positioning
We need to fit all the clues together:

1. The van driver must be in position 1 or 2.
2. The card-games hobbier must be in position 2 or 3.
3. The roller driver must be to the right of the tram driver.
4. The country fan must be to the left of the van driver.
5. The blues fan must be to the left of the van driver.
6. The sudoku hobbier must be in position 1 or 2.
7. The d&b fan must be to the right of the sudoku hobbier.

Given the constraints, let's place the elements:

- Position 1: Tram driver (since it needs to be to the left of the roller driver)
- Position 2: Blues fan (to the left of the van driver, and to the left of the d&b fan)
- Position 3: Van driver (card-games hobbier is to the right)
- Position 4: Filmmaker (even position)

Now we need to fill in the remaining elements:

- The person with the hobby of card-games is in position 3.
- The person driving the roller is in position 4.
- The person driving the airplane is not the fan of blues, so the fan of blues must be in position 1.
- The fan of country must be in position 2 (left of the van driver).

This leaves us with the following:

- Position 1: Blues fan
- Position 2: Country fan
- Position 3: Card-games hobbier
- Position 4: Van driver (filmmaker)

### Final Solution Table:

   - This means the person in position 1 watches crime movies.
   
2. **Clue 10**: The person watching thriller movies is the German.
   - Since the German is in the last position (4), the person in position 4 watches thriller movies.
   
3. **Clue 9**: The Chinese is on the left of the German.

4. **Clue 6**: The German is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies.
   - This is already satisfied as the German is in position 4.
   
5. **Clue 7**: The fan of jazz is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies.

   - But since the person watching crime movies is in position 1 and the fan of pop is in position 4, the fan of folk must be in position 2.
   - So, the Colombian cannot be in position 1, which means the Colombian is in position 3.
   
8. **Clue 5**: The person watching horror movies is not to the right of the Colombian.
   - The Colombian is in position 3, so the person watching horror movies must be in position 1 or 2.

9. **Clue 8**: The Thai is somewhere to the right of the Colombian.
   - The Colombian is in position 3, so the Thai must be in position 4.
   
10. **Clue 11**: The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the fan of folk.
    - The fan of folk is in position 2, and the fan of pop is in position 4, so the fan of dubstep must be in position 3.

Lv8-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Constraints Recap:
1. The person eating plum is not to the left of the person watching action movies.
2. The person watching horror movies is not the Brazilian.
3. The Colombian is somewhere between the person eating grapes and the person watching horror movies.
4. The Brazilian is not to the left of the person watching crime movies.
5. The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person eating potato.
6. The Colombian is the person watching action movies.
7. The person eating blueberry is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies.
8. The Dutch is between the person eating blueberry and the Colombian.
9. The person watching horror movies is not to the right of the person eating blueberry.
10. The person eating plum is not to the right of the person eating potato.
11. The American is somewhere to the left of the person watching horror movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Colombian
From constraint 6, we know the Colombian is the person watching action movies. So, let's place ""Colombian"" in the ""Nationality"" column for row 2 (Movie-Genre).

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          |             |           |        |           |
| Movie-Genre   | action      |           |        |           |
| Nationality   | Colombian  |           |        |           |

#### Step 2: Determine the position of the person watching action movies
Since the Colombian is watching action movies, we need to determine where the other nationalities can be placed.

#### Step 3: Place the Brazilian
From constraint 2, the Brazilian cannot watch horror movies. Also, from constraint 4, the Brazilian is not to the left of the person watching crime movies. Let's place the Brazilian in one of the remaining positions.

#### Step 4: Place the American
From constraint 11, the American must be to the left of the person watching horror movies. Let's place the American in one of the remaining positions.

#### Step 5: Place the Dutch
From constraint 8, the Dutch is between the person eating blueberry and the Colombian. Since the Colombian is in position 2, the Dutch must be in position 1.

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          |             |           |        |           |
| Movie-Genre   | action      |           |        |           |
| Nationality   | Dutch      |           |        |           |

#### Step 6: Determine the person eating blueberry
From constraint 7, the person eating blueberry is to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the Colombian is watching action movies, the person watching documentary movies must be to the left of the Colombian. Therefore, the person watching documentary movies must be the American.

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          |             |           |        |           |
| Movie-Genre   | action      | documentary |        |           |
| Nationality   | Dutch      |           |        |           |

Now, the person eating blueberry must be in position 3 or 4. However, since the Dutch is between the person eating blueberry and the Colombian, the person eating blueberry must be in position 4.

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          |             |           |        | blueberry |

| Nationality   | Dutch      |           |        |           |

#### Step 7: Determine the person watching horror movies
From constraint 9, the person watching horror movies is not to the right of the person eating blueberry. Therefore, the person watching horror movies must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Dutch is in position 1, the person watching horror movies must be in position 2.

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          |             |           |        | blueberry |
| Movie-Genre   | horror      | documentary |        |           |
| Nationality   | Dutch      |           |        |           |

#### Step 8: Determine the person eating grapes
From constraint 3, the Colombian is somewhere between the person eating grapes and the person watching horror movies. Since the Colombian is in position 2 and the person watching horror movies is in position 1, the person eating grapes must be in position 3.

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          |             | grapes    |        | blueberry |
| Movie-Genre   | horror      | documentary |        |           |
| Nationality   | Dutch      |           |        |           |

#### Step 9: Determine the person eating plum
From constraint 1, the person eating plum is not to the left of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching action movies is in position 2, the person eating plum must be in position 3 or 4. However, the person eating grapes is in position 3, so the person eating plum must be in position 4.

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          | plum        | grapes    |        | blueberry |
| Movie-Genre   | horror      | documentary |        |           |
| Nationality   | Dutch      |           |        |           |

#### Step 10: Determine the person eating potato
From constraint 5, the person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person eating potato. Since the person watching action movies is in position 2, the person eating potato must be in position 1 or 3. However, the Dutch is in position 1, so the person eating potato must be in position 3.

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          | potato     | grapes    | plum   | blueberry |
| Movie-Genre   | horror      | documentary |        |           |
| Nationality   | Dutch      |           |        |           |

#### Step 11: Determine the nationality for the remaining positions
From constraint 4, the Brazilian is not to the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching action movies is in position 2 and the person watching horror movies is in position 1, the person watching crime movies must be in position 4. Therefore, the Brazilian must be in position 3.

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          | potato     | grapes    | Brazilian | blueberry |
| Movie-Genre   | horror      | documentary |        |           |
| Nationality   | Dutch      |           | American |           |

Finally, the person watching crime movies must be the American.

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food          | potato     | grapes    | Brazilian | blueberry |

| Nationality   | Dutch      |           | American |           |

To satisfy all constraints, the final solution is:

13. **The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi**:
    - The Spy watcher must be in a position to the right of the Taxi driver.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's start placing based on the constraints:

1. **Malaysian Position**: Assume Malaysian is in position 1 (we'll check other positions later).
   - Chinese is in position 2.
   - Train driver is in position 3.
   - Adventure watcher is in position 2 or 3.

2. **Spy and Taxi**: 
   - Spy watcher must be to the right of the Taxi driver.
   - Taxi driver must be to the right of the Tram driver.

3. **Train Driver Not Polish**: Train driver is not Polish.

4. **Scientific Watcher Not Right of Polish**: Scientific watcher is not in position to the right of the Polish.

5. **Chinese Not Spy**: Chinese watches either Adventure, Musical, or Scientific.

Given these constraints, let's test the positions:

### Testing Malaysian in Position 1:
- Malaysian: 1
- Chinese: 2 (between Malaysian and Train driver)
- Train driver: 3
- Adventure watcher: 2 or 3 (but 2 is taken by Chinese, so it must be 3)

Now, we have:
```
| Movie-Genre   |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |
| Nationality   |   Malaysian |   Chinese  |   Train    |            |
| Transport     |            |            |            |            |
```

Next, we need to place the remaining individuals:

- **Polish**: Not in position 1, 2, or 3 (so it must be 4).
- **Tram Driver**: Must be in position 1 or 2 (but 1 is Malaysian and 2 is Chinese, so it must be 2).

Now:
```
| Movie-Genre   |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |
| Nationality   |   Malaysian |   Polish  |   Train    |            |
| Transport     |   Tram     |            |            |            |
```

- **Spy Watcher**: Must be in position 4 and must be to the right of the Taxi driver.
- **Taxi Driver**: Must be in position 3 (since Train driver is in 2).

Now:
```
| Movie-Genre   |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |
| Nationality   |   Malaysian |   Polish  |   Train    |   Spy      |
| Transport     |   Tram     |            |   Taxi     |            |
```

- **Scientific Watcher**: Cannot be in position 4 (Polish), so it must be in position 1 (Malaysian).

Final arrangement:
```
| Movie-Genre   |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |
| Nationality   |   Scientific |   Polish  |   Train    |   Spy      |
| Transport     |   Tram     |   Musical |   Taxi     |   Car      |
```

Lv8-3x4-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding items in the correct positions. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the person eating lime.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating asparagus is somewhere between the person eating lime and the person eating cucumber.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the fan of pop.
4. **Clue 4:** The fan of pop is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
5. **Clue 5:** The person eating lime is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta.
6. **Clue 6:** The person eating asparagus is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
7. **Clue 7:** The person eating lime is the fan of jazz.
8. **Clue 8:** The person eating lime is somewhere between the fan of rock and the person drinking fanta.
9. **Clue 9:** The person eating lime is on the left of the fan of rock.

Let's start placing the items based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7:** The person eating lime is the fan of jazz.
   - This means:
     - Lime -> Jazz

2. **Clue 5:** The person eating lime is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta.
   - This means:
     - Fanta -> Lime (right side)

3. **Clue 8:** The person eating lime is somewhere between the fan of rock and the person drinking fanta.
   - Since Lime is already placed between Fanta and Rock, this confirms:
     - Fanta -> Lime -> Rock

4. **Clue 9:** The person eating lime is on the left of the fan of rock.
   - This is consistent with the previous placement.

5. **Clue 1:** The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the person eating lime.
   - Since Lime is at position 2, Cucumber must be at position 3 or 4.

6. **Clue 2:** The person eating asparagus is somewhere between the person eating lime and the person eating cucumber.
   - Since Lime is at position 2 and Cucumber can only be at 3 or 4, Asparagus must be at position 1.

7. **Clue 6:** The person eating asparagus is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - This means Iced-tea cannot be at position 4 if Asparagus is at position 1.

8. **Clue 3:** The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the fan of pop.
   - Since Lime is at position 2, Iced-tea can be at position 1 or 3, but not 4 (because Asparagus is at 1).

9. **Clue 4:** The fan of pop is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - This means Pop cannot be at position 4 if Soy-milk is at position 3 or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the remaining items:

- Position 1: Asparagus (fan of rock)
- Position 2: Lime (jazz)
- Position 3: Cucumber (fanta)
- Position 4: Iced-tea (pop)

- The only beverage left for Asparagus is soy-milk.
- The only food left for Cucumber is fanta.
- The only music genre left for Iced-tea is pop.

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk  | Coffee | Fanta     | Iced-tea  |
| Food          | Asparagus| Lime   | Cucumber  | Rock     |
| Music-Genre   | House     | Jazz   | Cranberry | Pop      |
```

### Final Solution Table:

- **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not to the right of the person driving the car.
- **Clue 2**: The pakistani is somewhere between the person driving the subway and the malaysian.
- **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is fishing is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
- **Clue 9**: The person who's hobby is fishing is not to the left of the person driving the car.
- **Clue 10**: The person driving the ship is not to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
- **Clue 12**: The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person driving the subway.

Since the Helicopter driver is in position 1, the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 4. Let's place the drawing and helicopter:
```
| Hobby         | Nationality   | Transport     |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Drawing       |              | Helicopter   |
| Fishing       |              |              |
|               |              |              |
| Magic-Tricks  |              |              |
```

### Step 3: Continue Placing Information
- **Clue 6**: The german is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
- **Clue 7**: The pakistani is on the left or right of the german.
- **Clue 8**: The german is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
- **Clue 11**: The german is not to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
- **Clue 13**: The german is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.

Given the Helicopter driver and the person with the hobby of drawing, the German cannot be in position 1 or 2, so they must be in position 3 or 4. Since the German must be to the right of the person with the hobby of drawing (position 4), the German must be in position 3. 

- **Clue 14**: The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.

Since the German is in position 3, the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in position 2, and the person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 4.

```
| Hobby         | Nationality   | Transport     |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Drawing       | German       | Helicopter   |
| Woodworking   | Indonesian   | Ship         |
| Fishing       | Malaysian    | Car          |
| Magic-Tricks  | Pakistani    | Submarine    |
```

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person watching adventure movies.
2. The coach is not the person drinking almond-milk.
3. The mechanic is the person drinking iced-tea.
4. The coach is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.

9. The coach is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies.
10. The coach is somewhere to the right of the bartender.
11. The architect is not the person drinking iced-tea.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3:
- The mechanic is the person drinking iced-tea.
- This means the 3rd column must be ""mechanic"" and ""iced-tea"".

#### Clue 6:
- The person watching epic movies is the coach.
- This means the 6th clue can be simplified as the coach watches epic movies.

#### Clue 9:
- The coach is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies.
- This means the coach cannot be in the last position (4th column).

#### Clue 10:
- The coach is somewhere to the right of the bartender.
- This means the bartender cannot be in the last position (4th column).

#### Clue 7:
- The bartender is not to the right of the coach.
- This means the coach must be in a position where the bartender is to its left.

#### Clue 8:
- The coach is not to the left of the person drinking milk.
- This means the coach cannot be in the first position if the person drinking milk is in the second position.

#### Clue 1:
- The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person watching adventure movies.
- Since the 3rd column is iced-tea, the person watching adventure movies must be in a position to the right of the 3rd column.

#### Clue 2:
- The coach is not the person drinking almond-milk.
- This means the coach drinks either juice, milk, or iced-tea (but we already know the 3rd column is iced-tea).

#### Clue 4:
- The coach is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
- If the coach is in the 1st or 2nd position, the person drinking juice could be in the 2nd or 3rd position respectively.

#### Clue 5:
- The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the architect.
- This means the architect cannot be in the last position (4th column) and the person watching comedy movies cannot be in the first position.

### Final Arrangement:

1. **Beverage**
   - The 3rd column is iced-tea (mechanic).
   - The iced-tea drinker (mechanic) is to the left of the person watching adventure movies.
   - Therefore, the person watching adventure movies must be in the 4th column.
   - The coach is in the 2nd column because it is to the right of the bartender and to the left of the person drinking milk.
   - The bartender is in the 1st column because the coach is to the right of the bartender.
   - The person drinking milk must be in the 3rd column (mechanic), which is not possible, so let's re-evaluate.

2. **Job**
   - The coach is in the 2nd column.
   - The coach is the one watching epic movies.
   - The bartender is in the 1st column.
   - The mechanic is in the 3rd column.
   - The architect must be in the 4th column because the coach is to the left of the person watching comedy movies and to the right of the bartender.

3. **Movie-Genre**
   - The coach (2nd column) watches epic movies.
   - The bartender (1st column) watches comedy movies.
   - The architect (4th column) watches adventure movies.
   - The mechanic (3rd column) watches superhero movies.
