Lv8-1x3-1	"Certainly! Let's break down the puzzle and use the given clues to determine the correct arrangement.

### Clues:
1. The person who's sport is climbing is on the far right.
2. The person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.

### Analysis:
- From clue 1, we know that the person who prefers climbing is in position 3.
- From clue 2, since the person who prefers climbing is in position 3, the person who prefers sailing cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because if sailing were in position 1 or 2, climbing would be to its left).
- From clue 3, the person who prefers weightlifting must be to the left of the person who prefers sailing.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

1. Since the person who prefers climbing is in position 3, the person who prefers sailing cannot be in position 1 or 2.
2. Therefore, the only possible position for the person who prefers sailing is position 2.
3. This leaves position 1 for the person who prefers weightlifting.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Weightlifting
- Position 2: Sailing
- Position 3: Climbing

### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |       1       |    2    |    3     |
| Sport   | Weightlifting | Sailing | Climbing |

Lv8-1x3-2	"Certainly! Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- There are three people with hobbies: chess, skydiving, and sudoku.
- The person who likes sudoku is not to the left of the person who likes chess.
- The person who likes sudoku is in the middle.

We can represent the positions as follows:

|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   |       |        |           |

From the second clue, we know that the person who likes sudoku is in the middle (position 2).

So, we can place ""sudoku"" in position 2:

|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   |       | sudoku |           |

Now, from the first clue, the person who likes sudoku is not to the left of the person who likes chess. Since the person who likes sudoku is already in position 2, the person who likes chess must be either in position 1 or position 3.

Since there are only two remaining positions (1 and 3) and we need to fit both chess and skydiving into these positions, let's consider the possible placements:

1. If chess is in position 1, then skydiving must be in position 3.
2. If chess is in position 3, then skydiving must be in position 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Chess in position 1, Skydiving in position 3**
|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   | chess | sudoku | skydiving |

In this scenario, the person who likes sudoku is not to the left of the person who likes chess, which satisfies the first clue.

**Scenario 2: Chess in position 3, Skydiving in position 1**
|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   | skydiving | sudoku | chess |

In this scenario, the person who likes sudoku is still not to the left of the person who likes chess, which also satisfies the first clue.

Both scenarios are valid based on the given clues. However, typically such puzzles would have a unique solution, but here both seem to fit. Given the constraints provided, both solutions are correct. For completeness, let's present the final solution in the requested format:

```
|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   | chess | sudoku | skydiving |
```

or

```
|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   | skydiving | sudoku | chess |

Lv8-1x3-3	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given conditions and place the beverages accordingly.

1. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice.
2. The person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking tea.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

- Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice, soy-milk cannot be in position 3.
- Since the person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking tea, tea cannot be in position 1.

Given the three positions (1, 2, 3) and the three beverages (juice, soy-milk, tea), let's try to fit them into the table while satisfying both conditions.

Let's start with position 1:
- If position 1 is tea, then juice must be in position 2 or 3 (since it cannot be to the right of tea). But if juice is in position 2, soy-milk must be in position 1, which contradicts our assumption that position 1 is tea. Therefore, position 1 cannot be tea.

Next, let's consider position 1 as soy-milk:
- If position 1 is soy-milk, then juice must be in position 2 (since it must be to the right of soy-milk).
- This leaves tea for position 3 (since juice is in position 2 and it cannot be to the right of tea).

So, the arrangement would be:
- Position 1: soy-milk
- Position 2: juice
- Position 3: tea

This satisfies both conditions:
1. Soy-milk (position 1) is on the left of juice (position 2).
2. Juice (position 2) is not to the right of tea (position 3).

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|            |    1     |   2   |  3  |
| Beverage   | soy-milk | juice | tea |
```"	{'beverage': ['soy-milk', 'juice', 'tea']}	True	3	True
Lv8-1x3-4	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.

We have three positions (1, 2, 3) and three beverages: almond-milk, cola, and lemonade. We need to place these beverages in the correct order based on the given clues:

1. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking cola.

Let's analyze these clues:

### Clue 1: The person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
This means that if cola is in position 1 or 2, then lemonade must be in position 2 or 3. If cola is in position 3, then there are no restrictions from this clue.

### Clue 2: The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking cola.
This means that if cola is in position 1, almond-milk must be in position 2 or 3. If cola is in position 2, almond-milk must be in position 3. If cola is in position 3, then there are no restrictions from this clue.

Now let's consider the possible positions for each beverage:

#### Case 1: Cola in Position 1
- Almond-milk must be in position 2 or 3.
- Lemonade must be in position 3 if cola is in position 1 (because cola cannot be to the left of lemonade).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Cola
- Position 2: Almond-milk
- Position 3: Lemonade

This arrangement satisfies both clues:
- Cola is not to the left of lemonade.
- Almond-milk is on the right of cola.

#### Case 2: Cola in Position 2
- Almond-milk must be in position 3.
- Lemonade must be in position 1 (because cola cannot be to the left of lemonade).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Lemonade
- Position 2: Cola
- Position 3: Almond-milk

This arrangement also satisfies both clues:
- Cola is not to the left of lemonade.
- Almond-milk is on the right of cola.

#### Case 3: Cola in Position 3
- Almond-milk can be in position 2 or 3.
- Lemonade can be in position 1 or 2.

However, if cola is in position 3, then there is no restriction from the first clue, but the second clue still requires that almond-milk be to the right of cola, which is only possible if almond-milk is in position 2. This would make lemonade in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Lemonade
- Position 2: Almond-milk
- Position 3: Cola

This arrangement satisfies both clues:
- Cola is not to the left of lemonade.
- Almond-milk is on the right of cola.

### Conclusion
The valid solutions are:
1. Position 1: Cola, Position 2: Almond-milk, Position 3: Lemonade
2. Position 1: Lemonade, Position 2: Cola, Position 3: Almond-milk
3. Position 1: Lemonade, Position 2: Almond-milk, Position 3: Cola

Since the problem does not specify a unique solution, any of these arrangements is correct. Here is one of the solutions in a table format:

```
|            |    1     |  2   |      3      |
| Beverage   | Cola     | Almond-milk | Lemonade   |

Lv8-1x3-5	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. The Colombian is in an even position.
2. The Colombian is not to the right of the Malaysian.

From clue 1, we know that the Colombian must be in either position 2 or position 4. However, since there are only three positions (1, 2, and 3), the Colombian must be in position 2.

From clue 2, if the Colombian is in position 2, then the Malaysian cannot be in position 3 because the Colombian would then be to the left of the Malaysian, which contradicts the second clue. Therefore, the Malaysian must be in position 1 or position 3.

Let's assign the positions:
- Position 1: Malaysian
- Position 2: Colombian
- Position 3: Brazilian

This arrangement satisfies both clues:
- The Colombian is in an even position (position 2).
- The Colombian is not to the right of the Malaysian (since the Malaysian is in position 1).

So, the final solution table looks like this:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |     3     |
| Nationality   |   Malaysian|   Colombian|   Brazilian|

Lv8-1x3-6	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.
2. The person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is reading.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is reading (R) is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing (W).
   - This means R must be in position 1 and W must be in position 2 or 3.
   
2. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is video-games (VG) is not to the right of the person who's hobby is reading (R).
   - This means VG cannot be in position 2 if R is in position 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

Let's consider the positions for R, W, and VG based on these clues:

- If R is in position 1, then W can be in position 2 or 3.
  - If W is in position 2, then VG must be in position 3 (since it cannot be to the right of R).

So, one possible arrangement is:
- Position 1: Reading (R)
- Position 2: Writing (W)
- Position 3: Video-Games (VG)

This satisfies both clues:
- Clue 1: R is to the left of W.
- Clue 2: VG is not to the right of R.

### Final Solution Table:

Lv8-1x3-7	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step.

We have three positions (1, 2, 3) and three music genres: funk, pop, and soul. The given clues are:

1. The fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of soul.
2. The fan of soul is in an even position.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of soul must be in either position 2 or 3. However, from clue 1, we know that the fan of funk cannot be in position 3 if the fan of soul is in position 2. Therefore, the fan of soul must be in position 2.

So, the layout so far is:
- Position 1: Unknown
- Position 2: Soul
- Position 3: Unknown

Since the fan of funk cannot be in position 3, the only remaining position for the fan of funk is position 1. This leaves position 3 for the fan of pop.

Thus, the final solution is:
- Position 1: Funk
- Position 2: Soul
- Position 3: Pop

Here is the final solution table:

```
|               |  1   |  2   |  3  |

Lv8-1x3-8	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

We have three columns (1, 2, 3) and three music genres: electronic, techno, and trance. The clues given are:
1. The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of techno.
2. The fan of techno is not to the right of the fan of electronic.

Let's denote:
- E for electronic
- T for techno
- R for trance

From clue 1, we know that if someone likes trance (R), they must be in a column to the left of someone who likes techno (T). This means:
- If R is in column 1, T can be in column 2 or 3.
- If R is in column 2, T must be in column 3.

From clue 2, we know that T cannot be to the right of E. This means:
- T cannot be in column 3 if E is in column 1.
- T cannot be in column 2 if E is in column 1 or column 2.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible placements:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **If R is in column 1:**
   - T can be in column 2 or 3.
   - If T is in column 2, E must be in column 3 (since T cannot be to the right of E).
   - If T is in column 3, E must be in column 2 (since T cannot be to the right of E).

2. **If R is in column 2:**
   - T must be in column 3.
   - E must be in column 1 (since T cannot be to the right of E).

### Valid Configurations:

- **Configuration 1:** R in column 1, T in column 2, E in column 3.
- **Configuration 2:** R in column 1, T in column 3, E in column 2.
- **Configuration 3:** R in column 2, T in column 3, E in column 1.

All configurations satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1    |   2    |     3      |
| Music-Genre   |  R     |  T     |    E       |

This configuration satisfies both clues:
1. The fan of trance (R) is on the left of the fan of techno (T).
2. The fan of techno (T) is not to the right of the fan of electronic (E).

Lv8-1x3-9	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given conditions step by step:

1. The person drinking milk is not to the left of the person drinking fanta.
2. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking milk.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

- Since fanta is between lemonade and milk, the only possible order is either ""lemonade - fanta - milk"" or ""milk - fanta - lemonade"".
- However, condition 1 states that the person drinking milk cannot be to the left of the person drinking fanta. This means the order must be ""lemonade - fanta - milk"".

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Lemonade
- Position 2: Fanta
- Position 3: Milk

Now, let's present this solution in the requested format:

```
|            |    1     |   2   |  3   |

Lv8-1x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
2. The person who's sport is water-polo is not to the left of the person who's sport is cycling.

From clue 1, we can infer that if the person who likes water-polo is at position 1, then the person who likes surfing must be at position 2 or 3. If the person who likes water-polo is at position 2, then the person who likes surfing must be at position 3. If the person who likes water-polo is at position 3, there would be no room for the person who likes surfing (as per the clue).

From clue 2, we know that the person who likes water-polo cannot be to the left of the person who likes cycling. This means that the person who likes water-polo cannot be at position 1 if the person who likes cycling is at position 2 or 3.

Combining these clues, we can deduce the following:
- Water-polo cannot be at position 1 (since it cannot be to the left of cycling and also needs to have surfing to its right).
- Therefore, water-polo must be at either position 2 or 3.
- If water-polo is at position 2, then surfing must be at position 3, and cycling must be at position 1.
- If water-polo is at position 3, then surfing must be at position 2, but this would place water-polo to the left of cycling, which contradicts clue 2.

Thus, the only valid arrangement is:
- Position 1: Cycling
- Position 2: Water-polo
- Position 3: Surfing

So, the final solution table is:

```
|         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
| Sport   | Cycling | Water-polo | Surfing |
