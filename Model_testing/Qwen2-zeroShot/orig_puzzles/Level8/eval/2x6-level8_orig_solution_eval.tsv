15. **Clue 15**: The fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
16. **Clue 16**: The pilot is not the fan of r&b.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1 & 7**: The fan of jazz must be immediately to the left of the lawyer (since the lawyer cannot be to the left of the fan of jazz).

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Lawyer |   ?   |   ?   |   ?   |   ?   |
   ```

2. **Clue 3**: The manager must be to the right of the fan of classical.

   Since the manager cannot be to the left of the fan of classical, the fan of classical must be in position 2, and the manager must be in position 4 or later.

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Classical |   ?   | Manager |   ?   |   ?   |
   ```

3. **Clue 5 & 6**: The security-guard is to the right of the fan of rock, and the fan of rock is between the fan of jazz and the security-guard.

   This means the fan of rock must be in position 3, the fan of jazz in position 1, and the security-guard in position 5.

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Classical | Rock | Manager | Security-Guard |   ?   |
   ```

4. **Clue 4**: The fan of soul is not to the left of the nurse.

   Since the nurse is to the right of the fan of jazz, and the fan of soul is to the right of the fan of classical, the nurse can only be in position 6.

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Classical | Rock | Manager | Security-Guard | Nurse |
   ```

5. **Clue 10 & 11**: The fan of classical is not to the left of the paramedic, and the fan of rock is to the right of the paramedic.

   This means the paramedic must be in position 2.

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Paramedic | Rock | Manager | Security-Guard | Nurse |
   ```

6. **Clue 12**: The manager is on the right of the paramedic.

   This confirms that the manager is in position 4.

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Paramedic | Rock | Manager | Security-Guard | Nurse |
   ```

7. **Clue 8 & 9**: The pilot is on the left or right of the fan of house, and the security-guard is on the left or right of the pilot.

   This means the pilot must be in position 3.

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Paramedic | Pilot | Manager | Security-Guard | Nurse |
   ```

8. **Clue 14**: The security-guard is between the fan of house and the nurse.

   This means the fan of house must be in position 5.

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Paramedic | Pilot | Manager | House | Nurse |
   ```

9. **Clue 15**: The fan of soul is to the right of the fan of classical.

   This means the fan of soul must be in position 6.

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Paramedic | Pilot | Manager | House | Soul |
   ```

10. **Clue 16**: The pilot is not the fan of r&b.

    Since the pilot is in position 3, the job for the pilot must be either lawyer, manager, nurse, paramedic, or security-guard. Given the positions and other constraints, the only job that fits is ""manager"".

   Therefore, the final arrangement is:

   ```
   |  Fan of Jazz | Paramedic | Pilot | Manager | House | Soul |
   ```

14. **The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the owner of the goat**.
15. **The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 2**: The owner of the turtle is in position 4.
2. **From Clue 1**: The person with the hobby ""puzzles"" cannot be the owner of the turtle.
3. **From Clue 5**: The owner of the turtle (position 4) is between the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" and the owner of the goat.
4. **From Clue 4**: The person with the hobby ""photography"" must be in position 1 or 6.
5. **From Clue 7**: The owner of the mouse is to the right of the person with the hobby ""photography"".
6. **From Clue 8**: The owner of the pony must be either to the left or right of the owner of the turtle (position 4).
7. **From Clue 3**: The owner of the pony is not to the right of the owner of the mouse.
8. **From Clue 6**: The owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
9. **From Clue 9**: The person with the hobby ""magic-tricks"" is not the owner of the mouse.
10. **From Clue 10**: The person with the hobby ""cooking"" must be in position 1 or 6.
11. **From Clue 12**: The owner of the turtle is not to the right of the person with the hobby ""sudoku"".

14. **From Clue 15**: The owner of the guinea-pig is to the left of the person with the hobby ""puzzles"".

### Final Placement:

Let's start filling in the positions based on these clues:

- Position 1: Photography (since it can only be here or at 6)
- Position 6: Cooking (since it can only be here or at 1)

Now let's place the turtle:
- Position 4: Turtle

Next, we place the goat:
- Since the owner of the turtle is between the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" and the owner of the goat, the goat must be in position 3 or 5.
- If the goat were in position 5, then the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" would have to be in position 2, but that would conflict with clue 5. Therefore, the goat must be in position 5.

Now, the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" must be in position 2:
- Position 2: Puzzles

We know the owner of the turtle is between the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" and the owner of the goat:
- Position 3: Goat

Next, we place the pony:
- The owner of the pony must be either to the left or right of the owner of the turtle (position 4), and not to the right of the owner of the mouse.
- The owner of the mouse must be to the right of the person with the hobby ""photography"" (position 1).

So, the owner of the mouse must be in position 3 or 5. But since the goat is in position 5, the mouse must be in position 3:
- Position 3: Mouse

The owner of the pony must be in position 2 or 4. Since position 2 is occupied by puzzles, the owner of the pony must be in position 4:
- Position 4: Turtle

Finally, we place the chinchilla and guinea-pig:
- The owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
- The owner of the guinea-pig must be to the left of the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" (position 2).
- Therefore, the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 1:
- Position 1: Photography
- Position 2: Puzzles
- Position 3: Goat
- Position 4: Turtle
- Position 5: Guinea-Pig
- Position 6: Cooking

Now, we place the remaining pets and hobbies:
- The person with the hobby ""woodworking"" must be to the left of the owner of the goat (position 3):
- Position 1: Photography
- Position 2: Puzzles
- Position 3: Goat
- Position 4: Turtle
- Position 5: Guinea-Pig
- Position 6: Cooking

The remaining pet for position 1 is the chinchilla:
- Position 1: Chinchilla
- Position 2: Puzzles
- Position 3: Goat
- Position 4: Turtle
- Position 5: Guinea-Pig
- Position 6: Cooking

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|         |      1      |      2      |      3       |   4    |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby   | Chinchilla  | Puzzles     | Goat         | Turtle | Guinea-Pig | Cooking |
| Pet     | Photography |             |              |        |           |         |

Lv8-2x6-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 18:** The Polish person plays biathlon.
   - Position: Polish (Biathlon) -> 5

2. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the left of the British.
   - Since Biathlon is at position 5, the British must be somewhere to the right of 5.

3. **Clue 5:** The British is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
   - Since the British cannot be in position 5 (Biathlon), they can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 6:** The Spanish is on the left or right of the British.
   - If the British is in position 4, the Spanish could be in position 3 or 5 (but 5 is taken by Biathlon). So, the British must be in position 3 or 4, and the Spanish in position 2 or 4 (or 1 or 3 if British is in 4).

5. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the right of the British.
   - If British is in position 3, then Basketball can be in positions 4, 5, or 6. But since Biathlon is in 5, Basketball can only be in 6.

6. **Clue 10:** The person who's sport is sailing is on the far right.
   - Position: Sailing -> 6

7. **Clue 2:** The Argentine is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - Since Biathlon is at position 5, the Argentine must be in position 6 (Sailing), but Sailing is already placed in 6. Therefore, the Argentine must be in position 4 or 6. Given Sailing is in 6, Argentine must be in 4.

8. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the Polish.
   - Weightlifting must be in position 6 (Sailing is there), so it can't be there. Therefore, Weightlifting must be in position 4, 5, or 6. But Sailing is in 6 and Biathlon is in 5, so Weightlifting must be in 4.

9. **Clue 11:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere between the Polish and the person who's sport is cricket.
   - Polish is in 5, Weightlifting is in 4, so Cricket must be in position 3.

10. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is cricket is not to the left of the Argentine.
    - Argentine is in 4, so Cricket can't be in 3 (it is in 3).

11. **Clue 12:** The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cricket.
    - Biathlon is in 5, so Cricket can't be in 4 (it is in 3).

12. **Clue 13:** The Spanish is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person who's sport is weightlifting.
    - Weightlifting is in 4, so Soccer must be in 2 and Spanish in 3 (Cricket).

13. **Clue 14:** The Argentine is on the right of the Canadian.
    - Argentine is in 4, so Canadian must be in 3 (Cricket).

14. **Clue 15:** The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the American.
    - Cricket is in 3, Weightlifting is in 4, so American must be in 5 (Biathlon).

15. **Clue 9:** The American is somewhere to the right of the British.
    - American is in 5 (Biathlon), so British must be in 3.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who's sport is soccer is not to the left of the person who's sport is soccer.
    - Soccer is in 2.

17. **Clue 17:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
    - Weightlifting is in 4, Soccer is in 2.

18. **Clue 19:** The person who's sport is cricket is not the American.
    - Cricket is in 3, American is in 5.

Lv8-2x6-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given constraints:

1. **Constraint 1**: The person who's hobby is reading is not to the left of the person eating pineapple.
2. **Constraint 2**: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading.
3. **Constraint 3**: The person eating zucchini is between the person who's hobby is card-games and the person eating eggplant.
4. **Constraint 4**: The person eating radish is in an even position (position 4).
5. **Constraint 5**: The person eating zucchini is somewhere between the person eating tomato and the person who's hobby is drawing.
6. **Constraint 6**: The person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person eating pineapple.
7. **Constraint 7**: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading.
8. **Constraint 8**: The person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the left of the person eating zucchini.
9. **Constraint 9**: The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
10. **Constraint 10**: The person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person eating pineapple.
11. **Constraint 11**: The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading.
12. **Constraint 12**: The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere between the person who's hobby is writing and the person eating zucchini.
13. **Constraint 13**: The person who's hobby is writing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
14. **Constraint 14**: The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating pomegranate.
15. **Constraint 15**: The person who's hobby is writing is in an even position (position 4).
16. **Constraint 16**: The person eating pomegranate is in an even position (position 4).
17. **Constraint 17**: The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the left of the person eating zucchini.

From constraints 15 and 16, we know:
- Position 4 is for the person with the hobby of writing.
- Position 4 is also for the person eating pomegranate.

From constraint 14, since the person eating pomegranate is in position 4, the person eating pineapple must be in position 2 or 3 (since it must be to the left of the person eating pomegranate).

From constraint 4, the person eating radish is in position 4, which conflicts with the writing hobby being in position 4. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Let's start placing the known positions:
- Position 4: Writing and Pomegranate.
- Position 2 or 3: Pineapple (but not 4).

Now let's use the remaining constraints to fill in the rest of the table:

- From constraint 10 and 15, the person with the writing hobby is in position 4, so the person eating pineapple must be in position 2 or 3.
- From constraint 14, if the person eating pineapple is in position 2, then the person eating pomegranate is in position 4.
- From constraint 1, the person with the reading hobby cannot be in position 1 (left of pineapple) or 2 (pineapple itself).
- From constraint 2, the person with the magic-tricks hobby must be before the person with the reading hobby.
- From constraint 3, the person eating zucchini is between the person with the card-games hobby and the person eating eggplant.
- From constraint 5, the person eating zucchini is between the person eating tomato and the person with the drawing hobby.
- From constraint 6, the person with the writing hobby is to the left of the person eating pineapple.
- From constraint 7, the person with the magic-tricks hobby is on the left or right of the person with the reading hobby.
- From constraint 8, the person with the woodworking hobby is not to the left of the person eating zucchini.
- From constraint 9, the person with the drawing hobby is to the left of the person with the woodworking hobby.
- From constraint 12, the person with the card-games hobby is between the person with the writing hobby and the person eating zucchini.
- From constraint 13, the person with the writing hobby is not to the right of the person with the magic-tricks hobby.
- From constraint 17, the person with the drawing hobby is to the left of the person eating zucchini.

By carefully placing each element based on these constraints, we can determine the final arrangement:

6. **From Clue 6 and Clue 12:**
   - The fan of rock is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
   - The person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking cola.
   - Therefore, the person drinking cola must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, and the person drinking juice in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6.

7. **From Clue 13:**
   - The person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking cola.

Lv8-2x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the hobbies and pets accordingly. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

1. **The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping.**
2. **The owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.**
3. **The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the owner of the bird.**
4. **The owner of the frog is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.**
5. **The person who's hobby is baking is in an odd position.**
6. **The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left.**
7. **The owner of the bird is not to the left of the owner of the rat.**
8. **The owner of the rat is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.**
9. **The person who's hobby is writing is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit.**
10. **The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.**
11. **The owner of the frog is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.**
12. **The person who's hobby is woodworking is not the owner of the rat.**
13. **The owner of the pony is not to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.**

Let's start placing the information based on these clues:

- From clue 6, the person with woodworking is on the far left (position 1).
- From clue 8, the owner of the rat is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
- From clue 11, the owner of the frog is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

Since the woodworking person is in position 1, and the owner of the rat is to the left of the filmmaking person, and the owner of the frog is to the right of the filmmaking person, we can deduce the following positions for the filmmaking person:
- Position 2: Owner of the rat
- Position 3: Filmmaking
- Position 4: Owner of the frog

Now let's place the remaining people:

- From clue 1, the filmmaking person (position 3) must be next to the camping person. Therefore, the camping person must be in position 2 or 4.
- Since the filmmaking person is in position 3, the camping person must be in position 2.
- From clue 5, the baking person is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5). Since positions 1 and 3 are already occupied, the baking person must be in position 5.
- From clue 3, the writing person is on the left of the bird owner. Since the bird owner cannot be in position 1 (woodworking), and the writing person cannot be in position 6 (since the bird owner must be to the right of the writing person), the writing person must be in position 2, and the bird owner must be in position 3.
- From clue 4, the owner of the frog is not to the right of the drawing person. Since the frog owner is in position 4, the drawing person must be in position 5.
- From clue 9, the writing person (position 2) is not to the right of the rabbit owner. Since the writing person is in position 2, the rabbit owner must be in position 4.
- From clue 10, the rabbit owner (position 4) is to the right of the woodworking person (position 1).
- From clue 7, the bird owner (position 3) is not to the left of the rat owner (position 4).

Finally, the only pet left is the horse, which must go in position 6.

Here is the final solution table:
