   - Mechanic = 1, 3, or 5

4. **Clue 1:** The Thai is the firefighter.
   - Thai = Firefighter (Position 1)

5. **Clue 10:** The French is the mechanic.
   - French = Mechanic (Position 3 or 5)

6. **Clue 2:** The Brazilian is not to the left of the Electrician.

    - Manager > Photographer

13. **Clue 9:** The Nigerian is somewhere between the Thai and the French.
    - Thai < Nigerian < French

14. **Clue 13:** The Brazilian is on the left of the Photographer.
    - Brazilian < Photographer

15. **Clue 15:** The Mechanic is on the left of the Brazilian.
    - Mechanic < Brazilian

20. **Clue 20:** The Firefighter is not the Spanish.
    - Firefighter ≠ Spanish

21. **Clue 21:** The Chef is not to the right of the Chef.
    - Chef = Chef (This is redundant and doesn't provide new information)

22. **Clue 22:** The Dancer is on the left or right of the Manager.
    - Dancer = 2 or 6

### Deductions:
- Since Thai = Firefighter (1) and Mechanic = 1, 3, or 5, Mechanic cannot be 1.
- Mechanic = 3 or 5.
- Thai < Chef, so Chef cannot be 1.
- Since Thai = Firefighter (1), Chef must be in 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
- Since Manager is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and Mechanic = 3 or 5, Manager cannot be 3 if Mechanic is 3.
- Manager = 1 or 5.
- Since Mechanic is on the left of the Brazilian and Brazilian is on the left of the Photographer (Indonesian), Mechanic < Brazilian < Photographer (Indonesian).

### Placing Values:
- Mechanic = 3 (since Mechanic is in an odd position and cannot be 1)
- Thai = Firefighter (1)
- French = Mechanic (Mechanic = 3, so French = 3)
- Brazilian < Photographer (Indonesian), so Brazilian < 6 or 7.
- Since Brazilian is on the left of the Photographer (Indonesian) and Mechanic is on the left of the Brazilian, Brazilian = 4 or 5.
- Since Manager is in an odd position and not to the left of the Photographer (Indonesian), Manager = 5.
- Since Mechanic = 3 and Mechanic is on the left of the Brazilian, Brazilian = 4.
- Since Brazilian < Photographer (Indonesian), Photographer = 6.
- Since Chef is not to the left of the Spanish and not to the right of the Chef, Chef = 7.
- Since Spanish is not to the left of the Manager, Spanish = 2.
- Since Nigerian is between Thai and French, Nigerian = 2.
- Dancer = 6 (since Dancer is on the right of the Manager and Dancer = 2 or 6).

Lv8-2x7-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the hobbies and pets accordingly. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Clue 1:** The owner of the hamster is in the middle (position 4).
2. **Clue 5:** The person with the hobby of filmmaking is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5). Since position 5 is already occupied by the hamster, the person with the hobby of filmmaking must be in either position 1 or 3.
3. **Clue 7:** The person with the hobby of puzzles is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5). Since position 5 is occupied by the hamster and position 3 is potentially for the hobby of filmmaking, the person with the hobby of puzzles must be in position 1.
4. **Clue 11:** The person with the hobby of board-games is on the right of the person with the hobby of filmmaking. This means if the hobby of filmmaking is in position 1, the hobby of board-games must be in position 2 or higher. If the hobby of filmmaking is in position 3, the hobby of board-games must be in position 4 or higher.
5. **Clue 6:** The person with the hobby of board-games is on the right of the owner of the goat. Given that the owner of the goat must be to the left of the owner of the hamster (clue 14), the goat cannot be in position 4 or 5 (since the hamster is in position 4). Therefore, the goat can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
6. **Clue 14:** The owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hamster. Since the hamster is in position 4, the goat must be in positions 5, 6, or 7.
7. **Clue 12:** The owner of the chinchilla is not to the right of the owner of the goat. This means the goat cannot be in position 7, so the goat must be in position 5 or 6.
8. **Clue 10:** The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the frog. So, if the goat is in position 5, the frog must be in position 6 or 7. If the goat is in position 6, the frog must be in position 7.
9. **Clue 3:** The owner of the frog is not to the left of the owner of the cat. This means the cat must be to the left of the frog.
10. **Clue 8:** The owner of the frog is not to the left of the owner of the goat. This reaffirms that the goat cannot be in position 1 or 2.
11. **Clue 9:** The person with the hobby of photography is somewhere to the right of the person with the hobby of drawing. This means the drawing hobbyist must be in a position to the left of the photography hobbyist.
12. **Clue 2:** The owner of the horse is not the person whose hobby is dancing. This means the owner of the horse could have any other hobby except dancing.
13. **Clue 4:** The owner of the horse is between the owner of the cat and the person whose hobby is dancing. This means the horse owner must be in position 4, which is already taken by the hamster.
14. **Clue 15:** The person with the hobby of camping is on the left or right of the owner of the goat. This means the camping hobbyist must be in position 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.

### Final Placement

Let's place the items based on these constraints:

1. **Position 1:** Puzzles (from Clue 7)
2. **Position 2:** Filmmaking (to satisfy Clue 5 and Clue 11)
3. **Position 3:** Board-Games (to satisfy Clue 11)
4. **Position 4:** Hamster (from Clue 1)
5. **Position 5:** Goat (to satisfy Clue 14 and Clue 12)
6. **Position 6:** Frog (to satisfy Clue 3 and Clue 10)
7. **Position 7:** Camping (to satisfy Clue 15)

Now, let's assign the remaining hobbies and pets:

- **Hobby of Dancing:** Must be in position 2 or 3 (but not 2 since the owner of the horse is not the person who's hobby is dancing, and the horse is in position 4, which is already taken by the hamster). Therefore, the dancing hobbyist must be in position 3.
- **Hobby of Drawing:** Must be in position 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7. But since positions 1, 2, and 3 are taken, and the drawing hobbyist must be to the left of the photography hobbyist, the drawing hobbyist can only be in position 5 or 6. Since the goat is in position 5, the drawing hobbyist must be in position 6.
- **Hobby of Photography:** Must be in position 7 (right of the drawing hobbyist).

Lv8-2x7-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the movie genres and sports accordingly. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball.
2. The person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the left of the person watching drama movies.
3. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person watching documentary movies.
4. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
6. The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person watching spy movies.
7. The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies.
8. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
9. The person who's sport is lacrosse is in the middle.
10. The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies.
11. The person watching superhero movies is in an even position.
12. The person who's sport is basketball is between the person who's sport is badminton and the person who's sport is golf.
13. The person who's sport is lacrosse is not the person watching documentary movies.
14. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is badminton.

Let's start placing some information based on these clues:

### Step-by-step Analysis:

**Clue 9:** Lacrosse is in the middle (position 4).
**Clue 13:** Lacrosse is not the person watching documentary movies.
So, we can place:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |   3   |    4     |      5       |      6      |    7    |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |       | Documentary |              |             |         |
| Sport         |           |            |       | Lacrosse   |              |             |         |
```

**Clue 2:** Lacrosse is not to the left of the person watching drama movies.
So, the person watching drama movies must be in position 1 or 2.

**Clue 10:** Basketball is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies.
So, if drama is in position 1, basketball must be in position 1 (impossible as it's already occupied), so drama must be in position 2, and basketball must be in position 1.
```
|               | Basketball | Drama      |       | Documentary |              |             |         |
| Sport         | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse   |       | Lacrosse    |              |             |         |
```

This creates a conflict because Lacrosse cannot be in both positions 2 and 4. So, let's correct this:
```
|               | Basketball |           |       | Documentary |              |             |         |
| Sport         | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse  |       | Lacrosse    |              |             |         |
```

**Clue 1:** The person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball.
This means the person watching drama movies is either in position 1 or 2.

**Clue 3:** The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person watching documentary movies.
Since lacrosse is in position 4, documentary must be in position 5 or 6.
```
|               | Basketball |           |       | Documentary |              |             |         |
| Sport         | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse  |       | Lacrosse    |              |             |         |
```

**Clue 4:** The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
**Clue 5:** The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
Since lacrosse is in position 4, snowboarding must be in position 5 or 6.
```
|               | Basketball |           |       | Documentary | Snowboarding |             |         |
| Sport         | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse  |       | Lacrosse    | Lacrosse     |             |         |
```

**Clue 7:** The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies.
**Clue 8:** The person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
Since snowboarding is in position 5 or 6, time-travel must be in position 6 or 7.
```
|               | Basketball |           |       | Documentary | Snowboarding | Time-travel |         |
| Sport         | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse  |       | Lacrosse    | Lacrosse     | Lacrosse    |         |
```

**Clue 6:** The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person watching spy movies.
**Clue 11:** The person watching superhero movies is in an even position.
So, superhero must be in position 6 or 7, and spy must be in position 4 or 5.
```
|               | Basketball |           |       | Documentary | Snowboarding | Time-travel |         |
| Sport         | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse  |       | Lacrosse    | Lacrosse     | Lacrosse    |         |
```

**Clue 12:** The person who's sport is basketball is between the person who's sport is badminton and the person who's sport is golf.
So, badminton and golf must be on either side of basketball.
```
|               | Badminton  | Basketball | Golf  | Documentary | Snowboarding | Time-travel |         |
| Sport         | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse | Lacrosse    | Lacrosse     | Lacrosse    |         |
```

**Clue 14:** The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
So, superhero must be in position 6 or 7, and badminton must be in position 1 or 2.
```
|               | Badminton  | Basketball | Golf  | Documentary | Snowboarding | Superhero   | Satire  |
| Sport         | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse | Lacrosse    | Lacrosse     | Lacrosse    |         |
```

Finally, the remaining genres and sports:
```
|               | Badminton  | Basketball | Golf  | Documentary | Snowboarding | Superhero   | Satire  |
| Sport         | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse   | Lacrosse | Lacrosse    | Lacrosse     | Lacrosse    |         |
```

### Final Solution:
```
|               | Badminton  | Basketball | Golf  | Documentary | Snowboarding | Superhero   | Satire  |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire     | Spy        | Time-travel | Western    | Spy          | Superhero   | Drama   |

17. The person drinking 7up is between the person drinking almond-milk and the software-developer.
18. The person drinking almond-milk is not the writer.
19. The teacher is somewhere between the software-developer and the accountant.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7**: The person drinking cola is the architect.
   - This means Architect = Cola.

2. **Clue 8**: The person drinking cola (architect) is between the person drinking tea and the person drinking juice.
   - So, the order must be: [Tea, Cola, Juice] or [Juice, Cola, Tea].

3. **Clue 16**: The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
   - This confirms the order: [Tea, Cola, Juice] or [Juice, Cola, Tea].

4. **Clue 1**: The dressmaker is on the far left or far right.
   - Let's assume Dressmaker is at position 1 for now (we will check if it fits).

5. **Clue 2**: The teacher is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - Since the architect is the person drinking cola, the teacher must be to the right of the architect.

6. **Clue 5**: The person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the architect.
   - This means Tea must be after the architect (Cola).

7. **Clue 3**: The person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking tea.
   - This means Juice cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7 if Tea is in position 4.

8. **Clue 4**: The engineer is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
   - This means Engineer > Almond-Milk.

9. **Clue 6**: The person drinking cola is not to the right of the person drinking water.
   - This means Water cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7.

10. **Clue 10**: The person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person drinking tea.
    - This means 7up cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7 if Tea is in position 4.

11. **Clue 11**: The architect is not to the left of the dressmaker.
    - Since Architect = Cola, and we assumed Dressmaker is at position 1, this is consistent.

12. **Clue 12**: The engineer is somewhere to the right of the person drinking iced-tea.

Lv8-2x7-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate music genres and pets in the correct positions. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the fan of salsa.
2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the dog is not the fan of house.
3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the cat is on the far right.
4. **Clue 4:** The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep.
5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the horse is somewhere to the left of the fan of r&b.
6. **Clue 6:** The fan of salsa is not to the left of the fan of ambient.
7. **Clue 7:** The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
8. **Clue 8:** The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the fan of reggae.
9. **Clue 9:** The owner of the horse is between the fan of ambient and the owner of the rat.
10. **Clue 10:** The fan of r&b is somewhere to the right of the fan of house.
11. **Clue 11:** The fan of r&b is not to the left of the fan of salsa.
12. **Clue 12:** The owner of the cat is not to the right of the fan of country.
13. **Clue 13:** The fan of reggae is not to the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
14. **Clue 14:** The owner of the dog is between the fan of reggae and the owner of the cat.
15. **Clue 15:** The fan of ambient is in an odd position.
16. **Clue 16:** The owner of the chinchilla is not to the left of the owner of the horse.
17. **Clue 17:** The fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of r&b.
18. **Clue 18:** The fan of country is somewhere to the right of the fan of house.

Let's start with some basic deductions:
- From Clue 3, the owner of the cat is in position 7.
- From Clue 15, the fan of ambient must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- From Clue 17, the fan of salsa is to the left of the fan of r&b.
- From Clue 10 and Clue 11, the order of fans of house, r&b, and salsa must be house (left), salsa (middle), r&b (right).

Now let's place the fans of house, salsa, and r&b:
- The fan of house cannot be in position 1 or 7 because the fan of ambient is in an odd position and the fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of r&b.
- The fan of house can only be in position 2 or 4.
- The fan of salsa can only be in position 3 or 5.
- The fan of r&b can only be in position 4 or 6.

Since the fan of salsa is not to the left of the fan of ambient (Clue 6) and the fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of r&b (Clue 17), the fan of salsa must be in position 3 and the fan of r&b must be in position 6.

Now we know:
- Position 1: Fan of ambient
- Position 3: Fan of salsa
- Position 6: Fan of r&b

Next, we use Clue 7 and Clue 1: The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the fan of salsa, so the owner of the goldfish can be in position 2, 4, or 5.

From Clue 9, the owner of the horse is between the fan of ambient and the owner of the rat, so the owner of the horse can be in position 2, 4, or 5, and the owner of the rat must be to the right of the owner of the horse.

From Clue 5, the owner of the horse is to the left of the fan of r&b, so the owner of the horse must be in position 2 or 4.

From Clue 14, the owner of the dog is between the fan of reggae and the owner of the cat, and the owner of the cat is in position 7, so the owner of the dog must be in position 4.

From Clue 8, the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the fan of reggae, so the owner of the reggae must be in position 2 or 5.

From Clue 16, the owner of the chinchilla is not to the left of the owner of the horse, so the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 5.

From Clue 10 and Clue 11, the fan of r&b is to the right of the fan of house, so the fan of house must be in position 2.

From Clue 12, the owner of the cat is not to the right of the fan of country, so the fan of country must be in position 4.

From Clue 13, the fan of reggae is not to the left of the owner of the hedgehog, so the fan of reggae must be in position 2.

Finally, the remaining positions and pets are:
- Position 1: Fan of ambient
- Position 2: Fan of house
- Position 3: Fan of salsa
- Position 4: Fan of reggae
- Position 5: Chinchilla
- Position 6: Fan of r&b
- Position 7: Cat

The solution table is as follows:
