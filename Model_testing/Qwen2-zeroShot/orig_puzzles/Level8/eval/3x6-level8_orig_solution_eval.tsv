19. **The person eating asparagus is the person drinking milk** (Constraint 19)
20. **The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person eating lemon** (Constraint 20)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Constraint 19**: The person eating asparagus drinks milk.
2. **From Constraint 18**: The person eating kiwi drinks papaya.
3. **From Constraint 3 & 14**: Asparagus (milk) must be in an even position, so it can only be in positions 2 or 4. Kiwi (papaya) must also be in an even position, so it can only be in positions 2 or 4.
4. **From Constraint 2 & 13**: Papaya (kiwi) must be between the person eating papaya and the person drinking 7up. Since both are in even positions, the only possible configuration for these is positions 2 and 4.
5. **From Constraint 9**: The person eating papaya (kiwi) is between the person eating papaya and the person drinking 7up. So, we have:
   - Position 2: Eating papaya (kiwi)
   - Position 4: Drinking 7up
6. **From Constraint 12 & 20**: Lemon is on the left of asparagus (milk). Since asparagus (milk) is in position 4, lemon must be in position 3.
7. **From Constraint 13**: The person drinking 7up (position 4) is between the person eating papaya (kiwi) and the person eating asparagus (milk). This confirms our previous placements.
8. **From Constraint 10**: Asparagus (milk) is to the right of the Russian. So, the Russian cannot be in position 4 or 6. The only possible positions for the Russian are 1, 2, or 3.
9. **From Constraint 11**: The Thai is to the left of the person eating kiwi. So, the Thai cannot be in position 4 or 6. The only possible positions for the Thai are 1, 2, or 3.
10. **From Constraint 6**: The Thai is not to the left of the person eating asparagus (milk). So, the Thai cannot be in position 1. Thus, the Thai can only be in positions 2 or 3.
11. **From Constraint 7**: The person eating tomato is not to the right of the Indian. So, the Indian cannot be in position 5 or 6. The only possible positions for the Indian are 1, 2, or 3.
12. **From Constraint 5**: The Nigerian is to the right of the Indian. So, if the Indian is in position 1, the Nigerian can be in position 2 or 3. If the Indian is in position 2, the Nigerian can only be in position 3. If the Indian is in position 3, the Nigerian can only be in position 4 or 5.
13. **From Constraint 16**: The person drinking coffee is not to the right of the Chinese. So, the Chinese cannot be in position 5 or 6. The only possible positions for the Chinese are 1, 2, or 3.
14. **From Constraint 15**: The person eating tomato is to the left of the Russian. So, the Russian cannot be in position 1. The only possible positions for the Russian are 2, 3, or 4.
15. **From Constraint 17**: The person drinking tea is to the left of the Mexican. So, the Mexican cannot be in position 1. The only possible positions for the Mexican are 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

### Final Placement:

- **Position 1**: Chinese (drinking coffee), eating lemon
- **Position 2**: Thai (eating kiwi/papaya)
- **Position 3**: Indian (eating tomato)
- **Position 4**: Russian (drinking 7up)
- **Position 5**: Nigerian (eating asparagus/milk)
- **Position 6**: Mexican (drinking tea)

- **Clue 13:** The fan of soul is in an even position (Positions 2, 4, or 6).

### Step 3: Deduce Further Positions
- Since the person driving the helicopter is on the far left (Position 1), the person eating pepper must be on the far right (Position 6) because it cannot be in Position 1.
- Since the person eating spinach is on the far left or far right and cannot be in Position 6, it must be in Position 1.
- The fan of ambient is in an odd position and cannot be in Position 1 (occupied by spinach). Therefore, it must be in Position 3 or 5.
- The fan of soul is in an even position and cannot be in Position 1 (occupied by spinach) or 3 (occupied by ambient). Therefore, it must be in Position 2, 4, or 6.

### Step 4: Apply Remaining Clues

23. The person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk.
24. The person drinking fanta is the person eating kiwi.
25. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the social-worker.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Journalist (drinking lemonade) is on the far right (position 6).**
   - **6. Journalist** - lemonade

2. **Architect (eating apricot) is on the far left (position 1).**
   - **1. Architect** - apricot

3. **Manager (on the far right) is at position 6.**
   - **6. Manager** - milk

4. **The person drinking cola is not the musician and not to the left of the social-worker.**
   - Since the manager is at position 6 and drinks milk, the only possible positions for cola are 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - Let's place the musician and social-worker such that the cola drinker is not to the left of the social-worker.

5. **The person drinking fanta is the person eating kiwi.**
   - So, the person drinking fanta and eating kiwi must be in the same position.

6. **The person eating eggplant is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).**
   - Since position 6 is occupied by the manager (milk), the person eating eggplant can be in position 2 or 4.

7. **The person eating grapes is on the left of the person drinking 7up.**
   - This means grapes and 7up must be adjacent, with grapes on the left.

8. **The person eating grapes is between the person eating eggplant and the person eating onion.**
   - This means if eggplant is in position 2, then grapes must be in position 1 and onion in position 3.
   - If eggplant is in position 4, then grapes must be in position 3 and onion in position 5.

9. **The videographer is between the person eating radish and the journalist.**
   - The journalist is at position 6, so the videographer must be in position 4 and the person eating radish in position 5.

10. **The person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the person eating kiwi.**
    - Since the person drinking fanta is the person eating kiwi, soy-milk cannot be in position 1 or 2.

11. **The person drinking 7up is not to the left of the videographer.**
    - Since the videographer is in position 4, 7up must be in position 5.

12. **The person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the manager.**
    - Since the manager is in position 6, soy-milk cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3.

13. **The person drinking cola is not the musician and not to the left of the social-worker.**
    - Let's place cola in position 3, and the musician in position 2.

14. **The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.**
    - Since 7up is in position 5, lemonade must be in position 4.

15. **The person drinking milk is not to the right of the person eating apricot.**
    - Since the architect is in position 1 and eats apricot, milk must be in position 6.

16. **The person eating onion is not the social-worker.**
    - The social-worker must be in position 3, since the videographer is in position 4 and the person eating radish is in position 5.

17. **The person drinking cola is not to the left of the social-worker.**
    - Since the social-worker is in position 3, cola must be in position 5.

    - Since the person drinking milk is in position 6, radish must be in position 5.

19. **The person drinking fanta is the person eating kiwi.**
    - Since the person drinking fanta is in position 3, the person eating kiwi is also in position 3.

20. **The person drinking cola is not to the left of the social-worker.**
    - Since the social-worker is in position 3, cola must be in position 5.

21. **The person drinking 7up is not to the left of the videographer.**
    - Since the videographer is in position 4, 7up must be in position 5.

22. **The person eating eggplant is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade.**
    - Since the person drinking lemonade is in position 6, eggplant must be in position 4.

23. **The person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk.**
    - Since the person drinking milk is in position 6, radish must be in position 5.

24. **The person drinking fanta is the person eating kiwi.**
