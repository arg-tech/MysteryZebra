8. **Clue 8:** The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the left of the American.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The Indonesian drives the car. So, we can place:
   ```
   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         |            |          |            |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |          |            |
   | Nationality   | Indonesian |          |            |
   | Transport     | Car        |          |            |
   ```

2. **Clue 7:** The American is not to the right of the person driving the car (Indonesian). So, the American must be in position 1 or 2:
   ```
   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         |            |          |            |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |          |            |
   | Nationality   | American   |          |            |
   | Transport     | Car        |          |            |
   ```

3. **Clue 3:** The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the American. Since the Indonesian is in position 3 and the American is in position 1, this is consistent.

4. **Clue 8:** The person watching scientific movies is to the left of the American. Since the American is in position 1, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2 or 1. But since position 1 is taken by the American, it must be in position 2:
   ```
   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         |            |          |            |
   | Movie-Genre   |            | Scientific|            |
   | Nationality   | American   |          |            |
   | Transport     | Car        |          |            |
   ```

5. **Clue 1:** The person driving the roller is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the person watching scientific movies is in position 2, the person driving the roller must be in position 1:
   ```
   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         |            |          |            |
   | Movie-Genre   |            | Scientific|            |
   | Nationality   | American   |          |            |
   | Transport     | Roller     |          |            |
   ```

6. **Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is gardening is not to the right of the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the roller is in position 1, the person with the hobby of gardening cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, the person with the hobby of gardening must be in position 3:
   ```
   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Gardening  |          | Chess      |
   | Movie-Genre   |            | Scientific|            |
   | Nationality   | American   |          |            |
   | Transport     | Roller     |          |            |
   ```

7. **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is collecting is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person with the hobby of gardening is in position 3, the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 2, and the person watching romance movies must be in position 1:
   ```
   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Collecting | Gardening| Chess      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Romance    | Scientific|            |
   | Nationality   | American   |          |            |
   | Transport     | Roller     |          |            |
   ```

8. **Clue 6:** The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is chess. Since the person with the hobby of chess is in position 3, the person driving the roller (in position 1) is already on the left, so this is consistent.

9. **Clue 6 (revisited):** The person driving the roller is not to the right of the person whose hobby is chess. This is already satisfied as the person driving the roller is in position 1 and the person with the hobby of chess is in position 3.

10. **Clue 8 (revisited):** The person watching scientific movies is to the left of the American. This is already satisfied as the person watching scientific movies is in position 2 and the American is in position 1.

Lv8-4x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The Brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus**.
2. **The fan of d&b is between the person eating cabbage and the fan of soul**.
3. **The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane**.
4. **The person driving the airplane is not to the left of the fan of reggae**.
5. **The person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the Russian**.
6. **The person eating mango is the person driving the airplane**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 6: The person eating mango is the person driving the airplane.
- This means that the person in seat 3 (Airplane) is eating mango.

#### Clue 5: The person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the Russian.
- Since the person in seat 3 (Airplane) is eating mango, the Russian cannot be in seat 3. Therefore, the Russian must be in seat 1 or 2.

#### Clue 1: The Brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus.
- This means the Brazilian is either in seat 2 or 3 if the bus driver is in seat 1 or 2.

#### Clue 3: The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane.
- Given that the airplane is in seat 3, the bus driver must be in seat 1 or 2.

#### Clue 4: The person driving the airplane is not to the left of the fan of reggae.
- Since the airplane is in seat 3, the fan of reggae cannot be in seat 1 or 2.

#### Clue 2: The fan of d&b is between the person eating cabbage and the fan of soul.
- This means the order of these three must be Cabbage, d&b, Soul or Soul, d&b, Cabbage.

### Placing the Information:

1. **Person in seat 3 (Airplane)**: Mango.
2. **Russian**: Since the mango eater (seat 3) is to the left of the Russian, the Russian must be in seat 1 or 2. But since the airplane is in seat 3, the Russian cannot be in seat 3, so the Russian must be in seat 1 or 2.
3. **Bus Driver**: Since the Brazilian is to the right of the bus driver, and the bus driver can only be in seat 1 or 2, the Brazilian must be in seat 2 and the bus driver in seat 1.
4. **Fan of Reggae**: Not in seat 1 or 2, so it must be in seat 3.
5. **Fan of d&b**: Between cabbage and soul. Since seat 3 is occupied by mango and reggae, the only possible seats for cabbage and soul are seat 1 and 2.

Given the constraints:
- Seat 1: Bus Driver, Russian
- Seat 2: Brazilian, Fan of d&b or Soul
- Seat 3: Airplane, Mango, Reggae

Since the fan of d&b is between cabbage and soul, and the only available seats are 1 and 2:
- If the fan of d&b is in seat 2, then the remaining positions would be:
  - Seat 1: Bus Driver, Russian
  - Seat 2: Brazilian, Fan of d&b
  - Seat 3: Airplane, Mango, Reggae

Thus, the only way to satisfy all conditions is:
- Seat 1: Bus Driver, Russian
- Seat 2: Brazilian, Fan of d&b
- Seat 3: Airplane, Mango, Reggae

### Final Solution Table:

Lv8-4x3-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The German is in the middle.
2. The person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the fan of d&b.
3. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the fan of d&b.

6. The person whose sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person whose sport is rugby.
7. The fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of salsa.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the German in the Middle
Since the German is in the middle, we can place them in position 2.

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   |          | **d&b**    |            |
| Nationality   |          | **German** |            |
| Sport         |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

#### Step 2: Determine the Position of the Fan of d&b
From clue 7, the fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of salsa. Therefore, the fan of d&b must be in position 1, and the fan of salsa must be in position 3.

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | **d&b**  | **d&b**    | **salsa**  |
| Nationality   |          | **German** |            |
| Sport         |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

From clue 3, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of d&b is in position 1, the jet-ski could be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 2, the person driving the roller is to the right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of d&b is in position 1, the roller cannot be in position 1. So, it must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Determine the Sport and Transport for the Fan of d&b
From clue 5, the person whose sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. From clue 6, the person whose sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person whose sport is rugby. This means that the person with lacrosse must be in position 1 (leftmost), and the person with rugby must be in position 3 (rightmost).

Since the fan of d&b is in position 1, the only sport that fits is lacrosse. Therefore, the person with lacrosse is in position 1.

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | **d&b**  | **d&b**    | **salsa**  |
| Nationality   |          | **German** |            |
| Sport         | **lacrosse** |          | **rugby**  |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

From clue 5, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 3. From clue 6, the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person with lacrosse, which is already satisfied.

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | **d&b**  | **d&b**    | **salsa**  |
| Nationality   |          | **German** |            |
| Sport         | **lacrosse** |          | **rugby**  |
| Transport     |          |            | **snowmobile** |

From clue 2, the person driving the roller is to the right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of d&b is in position 1, the roller must be in position 3. However, position 3 is already occupied by the snowmobile. Therefore, the roller must be in position 2.

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | **d&b**  | **d&b**    | **salsa**  |
| Nationality   |          | **German** |            |
| Sport         | **lacrosse** |          | **rugby**  |
| Transport     |          | **roller** | **snowmobile** |

#### Step 4: Determine the Nationality and Sport for the Remaining Person
From clue 4, the Pakistani is not to the left of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of salsa is in position 3, the Pakistani cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the Pakistani must be in position 1.

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | **d&b**  | **d&b**    | **salsa**  |
| Nationality   | **Pakistani** | **German** |            |
| Sport         | **lacrosse** |          | **rugby**  |
| Transport     |          | **roller** | **snowmobile** |

From clue 1, the German is in the middle. We have already placed the German in position 2.

From clue 4, the Pakistani is not to the left of the fan of salsa. Since the Pakistani is in position 1 and the fan of salsa is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

The only remaining nationality is Polish, which must be in position 3.

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | **d&b**  | **d&b**    | **salsa**  |
| Nationality   | **Pakistani** | **German** | **Polish** |
| Sport         | **lacrosse** |          | **rugby**  |
| Transport     |          | **roller** | **snowmobile** |

From clue 5, the person whose sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This is already satisfied.

From clue 6, the person whose sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person whose sport is rugby. This is also satisfied.

Finally, the only remaining sport for position 2 is rugby.

Lv8-4x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice.
   - This means the order for drinks (left to right) could be: Juice, Coffee, Lemonade or Juice, Lemonade, Coffee.

2. **Clue 8:** The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the owner of the hamster.
   - This means the owner of the hamster cannot be in the last position (rightmost) and the person drinking lemonade must be to the right of the hamster owner.

3. **Clue 6:** The Indonesian is on the left of the owner of the hamster.
   - This means the Indonesian cannot be in the last position and must be to the left of the hamster owner.

4. **Clue 3:** The designer is on the left or right of the British.
   - This means the designer and the British are adjacent.

5. **Clue 4:** The Canadian is the designer.
   - So, the Canadian must be the designer.

6. **Clue 2:** The designer is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goldfish.
   - Since the designer is the Canadian, the Canadian must be to the left of the owner of the goldfish.

7. **Clue 1:** The dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the musician.
   - This means the dressmaker and the musician are not in the same position, and the dressmaker is to the left of the musician.

8. **Clue 7:** The owner of the goldfish is not to the left of the Canadian.
   - Since the Canadian is the designer, the owner of the goldfish cannot be to the left of the Canadian.

### Placing the Information:

Let's start placing the information based on these clues:

- **Canadian (Designer):** We can place the Canadian in positions 1 or 2 because they must be to the left of the owner of the goldfish and the designer is to the left of the owner of the goldfish.
- **British:** The British must be next to the Canadian (either left or right).
- **Goldfish Owner:** The owner of the goldfish must be to the right of the Canadian.
- **Hamster Owner:** The Indonesian must be to the left of the hamster owner, and the hamster owner must be to the right of the lemonade drinker.

Considering all these constraints, let's try placing them:

1. **Canadian (Designer): Position 1**
   - This means the British must be in position 2.
   - The owner of the goldfish must be in position 3.

2. **Indonesian:** The Indonesian must be to the left of the hamster owner, and since the Canadian is in position 1, the Indonesian must be in position 2 (but that would make the British the Indonesian, which is not possible).

3. **Revising the placement:**
   - If the Canadian is in position 2, then the British must be in position 1.
   - The owner of the goldfish must be in position 3.
   - The Indonesian must be in position 1 (left of the hamster owner).

4. **Revising further:**
   - If the Canadian is in position 2, the British must be in position 1.
   - The owner of the goldfish must be in position 3.
   - The Indonesian must be in position 1 (left of the hamster owner).

### Final Placement:

- **Position 1:** Indonesian (British)
- **Position 2:** Canadian (Designer)
- **Position 3:** Owner of the Goldfish

Now, we need to fit the drinks and pets:

- **Clue 5:** Juice, Coffee, Lemonade.
- **Clue 8:** The owner of the hamster must be in position 2 (Canadian) or 3 (Owner of the Goldfish).
- **Clue 6:** The Indonesian (British) must be to the left of the hamster owner.
- **Clue 7:** The owner of the goldfish must be to the right of the lemonade drinker.

Given the constraints, let's place the drinks and pets:

- **Position 1:** British (Indonesian), Goldfish
- **Position 2:** Canadian (Designer), Hamster
- **Position 3:** Owner of the Goldfish, Lemonade

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage      |  Juice     |  Coffee  |  Lemonade|

   - Therefore, the person driving the car must be in position 1 because it needs to satisfy both conditions of being to the left of the fan of reggae and to the right of the person eating orange.

3. **Positioning Sudoku-Hobbyist:**
   - The person with the hobby of sudoku must be to the left of the fan of reggae.
   - Since the person driving the car is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 2 (the only remaining position that can fit all conditions).

4. **Positioning Rock-Fan:**
   - From clue 5, the fan of rock is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person eating blueberry.
   - The person driving the car (position 1) and the person with the hobby of sudoku (position 2) are already placed.
   - Therefore, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 3, and the person eating blueberry must be in position 1.

5. **Final Placement:**
   - We now have:
     - Position 1: Blueberry, Car, Sudoku
     - Position 2: Peach, Quad-bike, Reggae

Lv8-4x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to fill in the table based on the given clues. Let's break down each clue and deduce the information step-by-step.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The person who's sport is water-polo is on the far right.**
   - This means Water-Polo is in position 3 for the Sport column.

2. **The Turkish is on the left or right of the person eating spinach.**
   - This means either Turkish is in position 1 or 3 (left or right) of the person eating spinach.

3. **The person driving the taxi is not the person eating garlic.**
   - This means Garlic is not in the Transport column for the taxi.

4. **The person driving the trike is the person eating garlic.**
   - This means Garlic is in the Transport column for the trike.
   - So, the Transport column for the trike is ""Garlic"".

5. **The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis.**
   - This means Tennis is not in position 3, and Airplane is in position 2 or 3.

6. **The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere between the person driving the trike and the person who's sport is water-polo.**
   - This means Tennis is in position 2 (between the trike and water-polo).

7. **The Canadian is on the right of the Turkish.**
   - This means Canadian is in position 2 or 3, and Turkish is in position 1 or 2.

8. **The Canadian is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis.**
   - Since Tennis is in position 2, the Canadian cannot be in position 3.

9. **The person driving the airplane is not to the left of the person who's sport is cricket.**
   - This means Cricket cannot be in position 1 if Airplane is in position 2 or 3.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Sport Column:**
   - Water-Polo is in position 3.
   - Tennis is in position 2 (between trike and water-polo).
   - So, Cricket must be in position 1.

2. **Transport Column:**
   - Garlic is in the trike (position 3 for trike).
   - Airplane cannot be in position 1 (leftmost), so it must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Tennis is in position 2, so Airplane must be in position 3.

3. **Nationality Column:**
   - Turkish is on the left or right of the person eating spinach.
   - Canadian is on the right of the Turkish.
   - Since Canadian is not in position 3 (rightmost), Turkish must be in position 1, and Canadian must be in position 2.
   - This leaves Dutch in position 3.

4. **Food Column:**
   - Since Garlic is in the trike (position 3), it cannot be in the Transport column.
   - The person eating garlic is in the trike, so the person eating garlic is not in the Transport column.
   - Since Airplane is in position 3, the person eating garlic is not the one driving the Airplane.
   - Since Tennis is in position 2, the person eating spinach cannot be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person eating spinach must be in position 1 (Turkish).
   - This leaves the person eating radish in position 2 (Canadian).
