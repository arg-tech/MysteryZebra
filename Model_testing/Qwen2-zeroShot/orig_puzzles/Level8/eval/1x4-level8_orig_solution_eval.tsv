Lv8-1x4-1	"Let's analyze the given clues step by step and determine the correct order of the jobs.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The nurse is on the left or right of the dancer.**
2. **The dancer is somewhere to the right of the nurse.**
3. **The dressmaker is not to the left of the entrepreneur.**
4. **The dressmaker is on the left of the nurse.**

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **From Clue 1 and Clue 2:**
   - The nurse (N) and the dancer (D) must be next to each other, and the dancer must be to the right of the nurse.
   - Possible positions: N D _ _

2. **From Clue 4:**
   - The dressmaker (DM) must be to the left of the nurse (N).
   - This means DM cannot be in position 4 because N is to its right.

3. **From Clue 3:**
   - The dressmaker (DM) is not to the left of the entrepreneur (E), so E cannot be in position 1 if DM is in position 2.

### Combining all Clues:
- We know from Clue 4 that DM is to the left of N, and from Clue 2 that N is to the right of D.
- Therefore, we can place DM and N as follows: DM _ N _
- Since DM is to the left of N and cannot be in position 4, it must be in position 1 or 2.
- If DM is in position 1, then N must be in position 2, and D must be in position 3 (since D is to the right of N).

This leaves position 4 for the entrepreneur (E).

### Final Arrangement:
- Position 1: DM (dressmaker)
- Position 2: N (nurse)
- Position 3: D (dancer)
- Position 4: E (entrepreneur)

### Solution Table:
```

Lv8-1x4-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **The person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda.**
   - This means the person drinking 7up must be to the left of the person drinking mirinda.

2. **The person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking milk.**
   - This means the sequence must be either Mirinda -> Lemonade -> Milk or Milk -> Lemonade -> Mirinda.

3. **The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.**
   - This confirms the sequence must be Mirinda -> Lemonade -> Milk.

4. **The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up.**
   - This means the person drinking 7up cannot be in the last position (position 4).

Given these constraints, let's deduce the positions:

- Since the person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda, 7up must be to the left of mirinda.
- The sequence for beverages must be: 7up -> (some beverage) -> mirinda -> lemonade -> milk.

From clue 4, mirinda cannot be in position 4, so mirinda can only be in positions 2 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If mirinda is in position 2:
  - 7up must be in position 1.
  - lemonade must be in position 3.
  - milk must be in position 4.

This fits all the clues:
- 7up is to the left of mirinda.
- lemonade is between mirinda and milk.
- lemonade is to the left of mirinda.
- mirinda is to the right of 7up.

So, the final arrangement is:

|            |  1  |  2   |    3     |    4    |
| Beverage   | 7up | mirinda | lemonade | milk |

Lv8-1x4-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating papaya is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes.
   - This means that if someone is eating grapes, they must be to the left of someone eating papaya.

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating apricot is on the left of the person eating peach.
   - This means that the person eating apricot cannot be in position 4, and the person eating peach cannot be in position 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating grapes is not to the left of the person eating peach.
   - This means that if someone is eating grapes, they must be to the right of someone eating peach or in the same position as the peach.

Given these clues, let's try to deduce the positions:

- From Clue 1, we know grapes (G) must be to the left of papaya (P).
- From Clue 2, we know apricot (A) must be to the left of peach (Pe).
- From Clue 3, grapes (G) must be to the right of peach (Pe).

Considering these constraints, the only possible order that fits all the clues is:
- Peach (Pe) in position 1
- Apricot (A) in position 2
- Grapes (G) in position 3
- Papaya (P) in position 4

So the final arrangement is:

Lv8-1x4-4	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the correct order of hobbies:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere between the person who's hobby is baking and the person who's hobby is chess.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position (positions 1 or 3).
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 3:** Rock-climbing must be in position 1 or 3 because it is in an odd position.

**Clue 4:** If rock-climbing is in position 1, then baking cannot be to the right of rock-climbing. So, rock-climbing cannot be in position 1. Therefore, rock-climbing must be in position 3.

Given rock-climbing is in position 3, let's place the other hobbies based on Clue 1 and Clue 2.

**Clue 1:** Woodworking is between baking and chess. Since rock-climbing is in position 3, woodworking cannot be in position 3. Thus, woodworking must be either in position 1 or 2, and baking and chess must be placed accordingly.

**Clue 2:** Woodworking is not to the right of rock-climbing. Since rock-climbing is in position 3, woodworking must be in position 1 or 2. 

Let's try placing woodworking in position 1:
- If woodworking is in position 1, then baking and chess must be in positions 2 and 4 respectively (since woodworking is between them).

This gives us:
- Position 1: Woodworking
- Position 2: Baking
- Position 3: Rock-climbing
- Position 4: Chess

This satisfies all the given clues:
- Clue 1: Woodworking (1) is between Baking (2) and Chess (4).
- Clue 2: Woodworking (1) is not to the right of rock-climbing (3).
- Clue 3: Rock-climbing (3) is in an odd position.
- Clue 4: Rock-climbing (3) is not to the right of baking (2).

Thus, the final solution is:

```

Lv8-1x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the sports accordingly.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The person who's sport is rowing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting**.
2. **The person who's sport is rowing is not to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting**.
3. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon**.
4. **The person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- The person who's sport is rowing cannot be to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. This means the person with weightlifting must be either directly to the left or at one of the ends (leftmost) compared to the person with rowing.

#### Clue 1 & 2 Combined:
- From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce that the person with weightlifting must be on the left of the person with rowing. So, the possible positions are:
  - Weightlifting (W) at position 1, Rowing (R) at position 2, 3, or 4.
  - Weightlifting (W) at position 2, Rowing (R) at position 3 or 4.
  - Weightlifting (W) at position 3, Rowing (R) at position 4.

#### Clue 3:
- The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon (B). This further restricts the positions:
  - If W is at position 1, B must be at position 2, 3, or 4.
  - If W is at position 2, B must be at position 3 or 4.
  - If W is at position 3, B must be at position 4.

#### Clue 4:
- The person who's sport is cycling (C) is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing (R).
  - If R is at position 2, C must be at position 1.
  - If R is at position 3, C must be at position 1 or 2.
  - If R is at position 4, C must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

### Combining All Clues:
Let's try to fit all clues together:

- **Position 1**: C (from Clue 4)
- **Position 2**: R (from Clue 4)
- **Position 3**: W (from Clue 1 & 2, and Clue 3)
- **Position 4**: B (from Clue 3)

This fits all the given conditions:
- C is on the left of R.
- W is on the left of R.
- W is on the left of B.

So, the final arrangement is:

|         |    1    |   2    |       3       |    4     |
|---------|---------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Sport   | Cycling | Rowing | Weightlifting | Biathlon |

### Final Solution:
```
|         |    1    |   2    |       3       |    4     |
|---------|---------|--------|---------------|----------|

Lv8-1x4-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. **The person eating pineapple is in an odd position.**
   - Possible positions for pineapple: 1 or 3.

2. **The person eating asparagus is in an odd position.**
   - Possible positions for asparagus: 1 or 3.

3. **The person eating asparagus is not to the left of the person eating nectarine.**
   - This means that if asparagus is in position 1, nectarine cannot be in position 2.
   - If asparagus is in position 3, nectarine cannot be in position 2 or 4.

4. **The person eating asparagus is the person eating asparagus.**
   - This is a tautology and doesn't provide new information but confirms that the same person is eating asparagus.

Now, let's combine these clues:

- Since both pineapple and asparagus must be in odd positions (1 or 3), and asparagus cannot be to the left of nectarine, we need to consider the possible combinations:
  - If asparagus is in position 1, then nectarine can only be in position 3 (since it can't be in position 2).
  - If asparagus is in position 3, then nectarine can be in position 4 (since it can't be in positions 2 or 3).

However, since there are only 4 positions and each food type must be represented exactly once, let's test both scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Asparagus in position 1**
- Asparagus: 1
- Nectarine: 3
- Pineapple and Peach must occupy positions 2 and 4.
- Possible assignments: (Peach: 2, Pineapple: 4) or (Peach: 4, Pineapple: 2)

**Scenario 2: Asparagus in position 3**
- Asparagus: 3
- Nectarine: 4
- Pineapple and Peach must occupy positions 1 and 2.
- Possible assignments: (Peach: 1, Pineapple: 2) or (Peach: 2, Pineapple: 1)

Since Scenario 1 fits all the conditions better (as it allows for more flexibility with the remaining foods), let's finalize with Scenario 1:

Final solution:
```
|        |     1     |     2     |     3     |   4   |
| Food   |   Peach   |  Pineapple| Asparagus | Nectarine|

Lv8-1x4-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step and place the hobbies accordingly.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess.
2. The person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
3. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is chess.
4. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is writing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** Gardening (G) is on the right of Chess (C).
   - This means C must be in position 1 or 2, and G must be in position 2 or 3.

2. **Clue 2:** Card-games (CG) is not to the right of Writing (W).
   - This means W must be in a position to the right of CG.

3. **Clue 3:** Card-games (CG) is somewhere to the right of Chess (C).
   - This means C cannot be in position 3 or 4, and CG must be in position 3 or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** Card-games (CG) is somewhere to the left of Writing (W).
   - This means W must be in a position to the right of CG.

### Combining Clues:

From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we can infer that C must be in position 1, and G must be in position 2 because:
- If C were in position 2, then G would need to be in position 3, but this would contradict Clue 3 since CG cannot be to the right of C.

So, we have:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: G

Now, from Clue 2 and Clue 4:
- Since CG is to the right of C and to the left of W, W must be in position 4.
- Therefore, CG must be in position 3.

### Final Configuration:
- Position 1: C (Chess)
- Position 2: G (Gardening)
- Position 3: CG (Card-games)
- Position 4: W (Writing)

### Solution Table:
```
|         |   1   |     2     |     3      |    4    |

Lv8-1x4-8	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. The fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of techno.
2. The fan of r&b is between the fan of indie and the fan of techno.
3. The fan of techno is not to the right of the fan of disco.

From clue 2, we can infer that the order must be Indie -> R&B -> Techno. This means the fan of indie is on the far left, followed by the fan of r&b, and then the fan of techno.

From clue 3, since the fan of techno cannot be to the right of the fan of disco, the fan of disco must be on the far right. This leaves us with only one position for the fan of indie, which is the first position, the fan of r&b in the second position, and the fan of techno in the third position. Therefore, the fourth position must be the fan of disco.

So, the order must be:
1. Indie
2. R&B
3. Techno
4. Disco

Let's place these in the table:

```
|               |   1   |  2  |   3    |   4   |
| Music-Genre   | Indie | R&B | Techno | Disco |
```

Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1   |  2  |   3    |   4   |
| Music-Genre   | Indie | R&B | Techno | Disco |

Lv8-1x4-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The bartender is between the doctor and the security-guard.
2. The bartender is not to the left of the doctor.
3. The musician is somewhere to the right of the security-guard.

From clue 1, we can deduce that the bartender must be in position 2 or 3 because the bartender has to be between the doctor and the security-guard. However, clue 2 states that the bartender cannot be to the left of the doctor. Therefore, the bartender cannot be in position 1. This leaves us with two possible placements for the bartender: position 2 or 3.

- If the bartender were in position 2, then the doctor would need to be in position 3 and the security-guard would need to be in position 1. But this would violate clue 3 because the musician would have to be in position 4, which means the musician would be to the right of the security-guard (in position 1), which is not allowed as per clue 3.
- Therefore, the bartender must be in position 3. This means the doctor must be in position 2 and the security-guard must be in position 1.

Now, the table looks like this:
```
|       |   1    |     2     |       3        |    4     |
| Job   | Security-guard | Doctor | Bartender |        |
```

With the bartender in position 3, the only job left for position 4 is the musician, and it satisfies clue 3 since the musician is to the right of the security-guard.

So, the final solution is:
```
|       |   1    |     2     |       3        |    4     |
| Job   | Security-guard | Doctor | Bartender | Musician |

Lv8-1x4-10	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The architect is somewhere between the police-officer and the doctor.
2. **Clue 2:** The police-officer is on the left of the writer.
3. **Clue 3:** The police-officer is not to the left of the architect.
4. **Clue 4:** The writer is somewhere to the right of the architect.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3 and Clue 1:
- From Clue 3, we know that the architect cannot be on the far left because the police-officer (who must be to the left of the architect) would then be out of position.
- From Clue 1, the architect must be between the police-officer and the doctor. This means the order could be Police-officer - Architect - Doctor or Police-officer - Architect - Writer.

#### Clue 2 and Clue 4:
- From Clue 2, the police-officer is on the left of the writer.
- From Clue 4, the writer is to the right of the architect.

Combining these clues, let's explore possible positions for each job:

1. If the police-officer is in position 1, the writer must be in position 3 or 4 (since the writer is to the right of the architect).
2. If the police-officer is in position 2, the writer must be in position 3 or 4, and the architect must be in position 1 (since the architect is between the police-officer and the doctor).
3. If the police-officer is in position 3, it conflicts with the requirement that the architect is between the police-officer and the doctor.

Given the constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:

- Police-officer in position 1
- Architect in position 2
- Writer in position 3
- Doctor in position 4

This satisfies all the given clues:
- Clue 1: The architect (2) is between the police-officer (1) and the doctor (4).
- Clue 2: The police-officer (1) is on the left of the writer (3).
- Clue 3: The police-officer (1) is not to the left of the architect (2).
- Clue 4: The writer (3) is to the right of the architect (2).
