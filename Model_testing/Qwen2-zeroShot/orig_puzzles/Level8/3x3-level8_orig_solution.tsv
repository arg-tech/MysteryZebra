Lv8-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is photography is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies.**
   - This means that if someone's hobby is photography, they cannot be in position 3 (rightmost) if the person in position 2 is watching scientific movies.

2. **The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo.**
   - This means the person with the hobby ""collecting"" must be in position 1 or 2, and the person with the sport ""water-polo"" must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting.**
   - This means the person watching western movies can be in position 1 or 3, and the person with the hobby ""collecting"" can be in position 1 or 2.

4. **The person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is water-polo and the person who's sport is golf.**
   - This means the order for sports must be either: golf -> soccer -> water-polo or water-polo -> soccer -> golf.

5. **The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography.**
   - This means the person with the sport ""water-polo"" must be in position 2 or 3, and the person with the hobby ""photography"" must be in position 1 or 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 5, we know:
   - Photography (Photog) cannot be in position 3.
   - Water-polo (Water) must be in position 2 or 3.
   
2. From Clue 1, we know:
   - If Photography is in position 2, then Scientific (Sci) cannot be in position 1.
   - If Photography is in position 1, then Sci can be in any position.
   
3. From Clue 2, we know:
   - Collecting (Coll) must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Water must be in position 2 or 3.
   
4. From Clue 3, we know:
   - Western (West) can be in position 1 or 3.
   - Coll can be in position 1 or 2.
   
5. From Clue 4, we know:
   - The order for sports must be golf -> soccer -> water-polo or water-polo -> soccer -> golf.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit everything together:

- Since Water must be in position 2 or 3 (Clue 5), and Photography cannot be in position 3 (Clue 1), Photography must be in position 1.
- Coll must be in position 2 (since Water must be in 2 or 3 and Photography is in 1).
- Water must be in position 3 (since Coll is in 2 and Photography is in 1).

Now, let's place the sports based on Clue 4:
- Golf -> Soccer -> Water (since Water is in 3)
- Therefore, Golf is in position 1, Soccer is in position 2, and Water is in position 3.

Finally, we need to assign the hobbies and movie genres:
- Photography (Photog) is in position 1.
- Coll is in position 2.
- West is in position 3.

For the movie genres:
- Sci must be in position 2 (since Coll is there and Sci cannot be in 1 as per Clue 1).
- West must be in position 3 (as per Clue 3).
- Fantasy must be in position 1.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Hobby         | Photography| Collecting  |   Golf     |
| Movie-Genre   |   Fantasy  |    Sci      |   West     |
| Sport         |    Golf    |   Soccer    |  Water-Polo|
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv8-3x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step-by-step. Let's start by summarizing the clues and then fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's sport is tennis is not to the right of the person who's sport is basketball.
2. The person eating orange is on the left or right of the photographer.
3. The person eating carrot is not to the right of the photographer.
4. The photographer is on the left of the lawyer.
5. The freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating orange.
6. The person who's sport is tennis is in the middle.
7. The person eating orange is in the middle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 6 and Clue 7
From Clue 6, the person who's sport is tennis is in the middle (position 2).
From Clue 7, the person eating orange is in the middle (position 2).

So, we can place:
- Sport: Tennis -> Position 2
- Food: Orange -> Position 2

|         |      1       |   2    |     3      |
| Food    |              | Orange |            |
| Job     |              |        |            |
| Sport   |              | Tennis |            |

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 3
From Clue 2, the person eating orange (Position 2) is on the left or right of the photographer.
From Clue 3, the person eating carrot is not to the right of the photographer.

Since the person eating orange is in position 2, the photographer must be either in position 1 or 3.

Let's consider both cases:

**Case 1: Photographer in Position 1**
- Food: Carrot -> Position 1 (since it cannot be to the right of the photographer)
- Food: Watermelon -> Position 3

**Case 2: Photographer in Position 3**
- Food: Carrot -> Position 3 (since it cannot be to the right of the photographer)
- Food: Watermelon -> Position 1

We will test these cases with other clues.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5
From Clue 4, the photographer is on the left of the lawyer.
From Clue 5, the freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating orange.

Since the person eating orange is in position 2, the photographer and lawyer must be in positions 1 and 3 respectively.

Let's test Case 1 first:

**Case 1: Photographer in Position 1**
- Food: Carrot -> Position 1
- Food: Orange -> Position 2
- Food: Watermelon -> Position 3

This satisfies Clue 4 (photographer in position 1, lawyer in position 3).

Now, let's place the jobs and sports based on Clue 5:
- Freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating orange (Position 2).
- Since the person eating orange is in position 2, the freelancer can be in position 1 or 3.

If the freelancer is in position 1:
- Job: Freelancer -> Position 1
- Job: Lawyer -> Position 3

Now, we need to place the sports:
- From Clue 6, the person who's sport is tennis is in the middle (Position 2), so the sport for Position 2 is Tennis.
- From Clue 1, the person who's sport is tennis (Tennis) is not to the right of the person who's sport is basketball.
- Therefore, the person who's sport is basketball must be in Position 1 or 3.

Since Position 1 has the Freelancer and Position 3 has the Lawyer, the only remaining option for basketball is Position 3.

- Sport: Basketball -> Position 3
- Sport: Ice Hockey -> Position 1

So, we have:
- Job: Freelancer -> Position 1
- Job: Lawyer -> Position 3
- Sport: Ice Hockey -> Position 1
- Sport: Tennis -> Position 2
- Sport: Basketball -> Position 3

This fits all the given clues.

#### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |      1       |   2    |     3      |
| Food    | Carrot       | Orange | Watermelon |
| Job     | Freelancer   |        | Lawyer     |
| Sport   | Ice Hockey   | Tennis | Basketball |

Lv8-3x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the beverages, jobs, and nationalities into the given slots based on the provided clues. Let's break down each clue and use logical deduction to find the correct arrangement.

### Clues Recap:
1. The Malaysian is somewhere between the Firefighter and the French.
2. The person drinking Cola is not to the left of the person drinking Iced-tea.
3. The person drinking Cola is not to the left of the French.
4. The Firefighter is on the left or right of the Social Worker.
5. The person drinking Mirinda is on the far right.
6. The person drinking Iced-tea is not to the right of the French.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5: The person drinking Mirinda is on the far right.
This means:
- **Beverage 3**: Mirinda

#### Clue 6: The person drinking Iced-tea is not to the right of the French.
Since Mirinda is in position 3, the Iced-tea cannot be in position 3. Also, it must be to the left of the French.

#### Clue 3: The person drinking Cola is not to the left of the French.
Since Mirinda is in position 3, Cola can only be in positions 1 or 2.

#### Clue 2: The person drinking Cola is not to the left of the person drinking Iced-tea.
If Cola is in position 1, then Iced-tea must be in position 2. If Cola is in position 2, then Iced-tea must be in position 3 (which is not possible since Mirinda is in position 3).

Thus, Cola must be in position 1, and Iced-tea must be in position 2.

#### Clue 1: The Malaysian is somewhere between the Firefighter and the French.
Given that Cola is in position 1 and Iced-tea is in position 2, the Malaysian must be in position 2 or 3. Since Mirinda is in position 3, the Malaysian must be in position 2. This leaves the Firefighter and the French to be in positions 1 and 3.

Since the Malaysian is between the Firefighter and the French, and the Malaysian is in position 2, the Firefighter must be in position 1 and the French in position 3.

#### Clue 4: The Firefighter is on the left or right of the Social Worker.
Since the Firefighter is in position 1, the Social Worker must be in position 3 (the only remaining position).

### Final Arrangement:

- **Beverage 1**: Cola
- **Beverage 2**: Iced-tea
- **Beverage 3**: Mirinda

- **Job 1**: Firefighter
- **Job 2**: Malaysian
- **Job 3**: Social Worker

- **Nationality 1**: Colombian (since the French is in position 3)
- **Nationality 2**: Malaysian (in position 2)
- **Nationality 3**: French (in position 3)

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      |    Cola   |   Iced-tea    |   Mirinda   |
| Job           | Firefighter | Malaysian | Social Worker |
| Nationality   | Colombian  | Malaysian   | French      |

2. **The fan of d&b is on the left of the person driving the ship.**
3. **The person driving the subway is not to the right of the person watching musical movies.**
4. **The fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
5. **The fan of blues is in an even position.**
6. **The person driving the ship is the person watching musical movies.**

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Identify the person watching musical movies
From clue 6:
- The person driving the ship is the person watching musical movies.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions
Since the person watching musical movies is in position 3 (from clue 6), and the person driving the ship cannot be to the left of this person (clue 1):
- The person driving the ship must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the person watching musical movies is in position 3, the person driving the ship must be in position 2.

#### Step 3: Position the fan of d&b
From clue 2:
- The fan of d&b is on the left of the person driving the ship.
- Therefore, the fan of d&b must be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Position the fan of blues
From clue 5:
- The fan of blues is in an even position.
- From the above steps, the only even position left is position 2.
- However, position 2 is already taken by the person driving the ship.
- Therefore, the fan of blues must be in position 4, which is the only remaining even position.

#### Step 5: Position the fan of martial-arts movies
From clue 4:
- The fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
- Since the fan of blues is in position 4, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 5 or 6.

However, we have only three columns, so the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 3 (the only remaining position).

#### Step 6: Determine the genres
From clue 6:
- The person watching musical movies is in position 3.

From the remaining positions and genres:
- The person in position 1 (fan of d&b) must be watching either epic or martial-arts movies.
- The person in position 2 (person driving the ship) is watching musical movies.
- The person in position 4 (fan of blues) must be watching either epic or martial-arts movies.
- The person in position 3 (watching musical movies) is the person driving the ship.

Given that the person in position 3 is watching musical movies, the remaining genres for the other positions are:
- Position 1: Fan of d&b, can be watching either epic or martial-arts.
- Position 2: Person driving the ship, watching musical movies.
- Position 4: Fan of blues, can be watching either epic or martial-arts.

From clue 4:
- The fan of blues is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
- Therefore, the fan of blues must be watching epic movies, and the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 1.

Lv8-3x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the correct positions in the table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The Indian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the chinchilla.**
   - This means the Indian cannot be to the right of the chinchilla.

2. **The Pakistani is on the right of the person whose hobby is writing.**
   - The Pakistani must be to the right of the person with the hobby of writing.

3. **The owner of the cat is not to the right of the person whose hobby is fishing.**
   - The owner of the cat must be either in position 1 or 2 if the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 3.

4. **The person whose hobby is photography is somewhere to the left of the Indian.**
   - Photography must be in a position to the left of the Indian.

5. **The owner of the cat is between the person whose hobby is fishing and the owner of the dog.**
   - The owner of the cat must be in the middle if the person with the hobby of fishing is in one end and the owner of the dog is in the other end.

6. **The owner of the chinchilla is on the far left or far right.**
   - The chinchilla owner can only be in position 1 or 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Positioning the Chinchilla Owner:**
   - From clue 6, the chinchilla owner must be in position 1 or 3.
   - If the chinchilla owner is in position 1, then the Indian (clue 1) cannot be in position 2 or 3, which would leave no room for the Indian to be to the left of the chinchilla owner.
   - Therefore, the chinchilla owner must be in position 3.

2. **Positioning the Indian:**
   - Since the chinchilla owner is in position 3, the Indian must be in position 1 (clue 1).

3. **Positioning the Photography Owner:**
   - The Indian is in position 1, so the photography owner must be in position 2 (clue 4).

4. **Positioning the Pakistani:**
   - The Pakistani must be to the right of the person with the hobby of writing (clue 2).
   - Since the Indian is in position 1 and photography is in position 2, the writing hobbyist must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, the Pakistani must be in position 3.

5. **Positioning the Cat Owner:**
   - The owner of the cat must be between the person with the hobby of fishing and the owner of the dog (clue 5).
   - The only remaining positions are 2 (photography) and 3 (writing), so the cat owner must be in position 2.

6. **Final Placement:**
   - The person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 1 since the cat owner is in position 2 and the dog owner must be in position 3.

Lv8-3x3-6	"Let's break down the clues step by step to solve this puzzle:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The Mexican is somewhere between the person driving the car and the person driving the ship.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the car is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the Canadian.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 2
From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can infer the order of transport:
- The person driving the ship is to the left of the person driving the car (since the Mexican is between them and the person driving the car is to the right of the person driving the ship).

Thus, the order must be:
- Ship (leftmost)
- Mexican (middle)
- Car (rightmost)

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
From Clue 3, we know that the person who prefers swimming is to the right of the Canadian. Given the order from Step 1, the only possible positions for the Canadian and the swimmer are:
- Canadian cannot be in position 3 (since the swimmer must be to the right of the Canadian).
- Therefore, the Canadian must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
From Clue 4, we know that the person who prefers climbing is not to the right of the person who prefers swimming. Given the order from Step 1, the only possible positions for the climber and the swimmer are:
- If the swimmer is in position 2, the climber must be in position 1.
- If the swimmer is in position 3, the climber must be in position 1 or 2, but since the climber cannot be to the right of the swimmer, the climber must be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Determine the Sport and Nationality
Given the above constraints, let's assign sports and nationalities:
- If the swimmer is in position 2, then the Canadian must be in position 1. The climber must be in position 1, which is a contradiction because the climber cannot be to the right of the swimmer. Therefore, the swimmer must be in position 3.
- The Canadian must be in position 1.
- The Australian must be in position 2 (since the climber cannot be to the right of the swimmer and the Mexican is in position 2, the Australian must be in position 2).
- The Mexican must be in position 3.

Now, let's assign the sports:
- The swimmer (position 3) must be the Mexican.
- The climber (position 1) must be the Canadian.
- The Australian must be the one who prefers climbing (since the climber cannot be to the right of the swimmer).

Therefore, the sports assignments are:
- Position 1 (Canadian): Climbing
- Position 2 (Australian): Swimming
- Position 3 (Mexican): Volleyball

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Australian | Mexican    |
| Sport         | Climbing | Swimming  | Volleyball |
| Transport     | Ship     | Bike      | Car        |

Let's start by assuming the photographer is in position 1 and the firefighter is in position 2 (since the photographer is to the left of the firefighter).

- **Position 1:** Photographer
- **Position 2:** Firefighter
- **Position 3:** Electrician (from clue 2, it can't be apricot, so it must be either corn or onion)

Since the electrician is not the person eating apricot, let's assume the electrician eats onion.

- **Position 1:** Photographer
- **Position 2:** Firefighter
- **Position 3:** Electrician (eating onion)

Now, we need to fit the hobbies and foods:

- **Hobby:** 
  - Position 1: Must be video-games (from clue 7)
  - Position 2: Must be camping (from clue 7)
  - Position 3: Must be cooking (from clue 5 and clue 7)

- **Food:**
  - Position 1: Must be apricot (from clue 5 and clue 7)
  - Position 2: Must be corn (from clue 5 and clue 7)
  - Position 3: Must be onion (from clue 2 and clue 5)

Lv8-3x3-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and use process of elimination and logical deduction.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. The Dutch is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is camping.
2. The person whose hobby is camping is on the right of the Chinese.
3. The person whose hobby is gardening is not to the right of the person whose hobby is woodworking.
4. The person whose hobby is camping is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard.
5. The owner of the lizard is between the owner of the pony and the person whose hobby is woodworking.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Determine the order based on hobbies and nationalities:
- From Clue 2: The Chinese is on the left of the person whose hobby is camping.
- From Clue 1: The Dutch is to the left of the person whose hobby is camping.
- From Clue 4: The person whose hobby is camping is to the right of the owner of the lizard.

Combining these clues, we can infer that the order of the person whose hobby is camping must be in the middle or third position because it has to be to the right of the owner of the lizard and also to the right of the Chinese. Also, the Dutch must be to the left of the person whose hobby is camping.

#### Step 2: Determine the order based on pets:
- From Clue 5: The owner of the lizard is between the owner of the pony and the person whose hobby is woodworking.
- This means the sequence for the pets could be: Pony, Lizard, Woodworking (or Woodworking, Lizard, Pony).

Given the above, let's place the people and their attributes step by step:

1. **Person 1:**
   - Since the Dutch is to the left of the person whose hobby is camping, and the Chinese is to the left of the person whose hobby is camping, the Dutch cannot be in the first position (because then the Chinese would not fit). Therefore, the Dutch must be in the first position.
   - The Chinese must be in the second position because they are to the left of the person whose hobby is camping.
   - Therefore, the person whose hobby is camping must be in the third position.

2. **Person 2:**
   - The Chinese is in the second position, so the person whose hobby is camping is in the third position.
   - The Dutch is in the first position, and the person whose hobby is camping is in the third position.

3. **Person 3:**
   - The person whose hobby is camping is in the third position, so the person whose hobby is woodworking must be to the right of the owner of the lizard, and the owner of the lizard must be between the owner of the pony and the person whose hobby is woodworking.

From Clue 5, the sequence for the pets must be:
- Person 1 (Dutch): Lizard
- Person 2 (Chinese): Pony
- Person 3 (Woodworking): Guinea-pig

So, the final arrangement is:

| Hobby          | Nationality  | Pet        |
|----------------|--------------|------------|

Lv8-3x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person eating cabbage.
2. The person who's hobby is traveling is the musician.
3. The bartender is not to the right of the person eating spinach.
4. The musician is on the left of the police-officer.
5. The bartender is on the left of the person eating plum.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2: The person who's hobby is traveling is the musician.
This means:
- Musician = Traveling

#### Clue 4: The musician is on the left of the police-officer.
Since the musician is traveling, we can place this pair as:
- Traveling (Musician) - Police-officer

#### Clue 5: The bartender is on the left of the person eating plum.
We need to determine who the bartender is and where they fit.

#### Clue 3: The bartender is not to the right of the person eating spinach.
This implies the bartender must be either in position 1 or 2 if the person eating spinach is in position 3.

#### Clue 1: The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person eating cabbage.
This means the cooking person must be to the left of the cabbage-eater.

#### Clue 6: The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person eating cabbage.
Given that the musician is traveling, let's place the cooking and cabbage-eating positions considering all constraints.

### Possible Arrangements:
Let's start with placing the Musician (Traveling) and Police-officer:
- Position 1: Traveling (Musician)
- Position 2: Police-officer

Now, we need to place the Bartender and the Plum-eater:
- Since the bartender is on the left of the Plum-eater, and the bartender cannot be to the right of the spinach-eater, the bartender must be in position 1 or 2.
- The Plum-eater must be in position 2 or 3.

Considering the cooking and cabbage constraints:
- Cooking must be to the left of Cabbage.

### Final Arrangement:
Let's try:
- Position 1: Cooking
- Position 2: Bartender
- Position 3: Cabbage

This fits all the clues:
- The bartender is on the left of the Plum-eater.
- The bartender is not to the right of the spinach-eater.
- The cooking person is to the left of the cabbage-eater.
- The musician (traveling) is on the left of the police-officer.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Cooking
- Position 2: Bartender
- Position 3: Cabbage

And since the musician is traveling and is to the left of the police-officer:
- Position 1: Traveling (Musician)
- Position 2: Police-officer
- Position 3: Cabbage

Finally, the Plum-eater must be in position 2, and the Bartender is in position 1.

### Final Table:
```
|         |     1     |     2     |       3        |
| Food    |  Cooking  |  Plum     |      Cabbage   |
| Hobby   | Traveling | Police-officer|  Cooking      |
| Job     | Bartender |            |               |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv8-3x3-10	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking almond-milk is not the person driving the car.
2. The person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person driving the car.
3. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person eating cauliflower.
4. The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person driving the ship.
5. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
6. The person eating radish is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6**: The person eating radish is on the far right (position 3).
   - This gives us: 
     ```
     |             |       1       |      2      |   3    |
     | Beverage    |               |             |        |
     | Food        |               |             | radish |
     | Transport   |               |             |        |
     ```

2. **Clue 5**: The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
   - Since position 3 is already occupied by radish, the only possible positions for almond-milk and sprite are 1 and 2.
   - Let's assume the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1 and the person drinking sprite is in position 2.
     ```
     |             |       1       |      2      |   3    |
     | Beverage    | almond-milk   |             |        |
     | Food        |               |             | radish |
     | Transport   |               |             |        |
     ```

3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person eating cauliflower.
   - Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2 or 3. But since position 3 is radish, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2.
     ```
     |             |       1       |      2      |   3    |
     | Beverage    | almond-milk   |             |        |
     | Food        | cauliflower   |             | radish |
     | Transport   |               |             |        |
     ```

4. **Clue 1**: The person drinking almond-milk is not the person driving the car.
   - This means the person driving the car must be in position 2 or 3. But since position 3 is radish, the person driving the car must be in position 2.
     ```
     |             |       1       |      2      |   3    |
     | Beverage    | almond-milk   |             |        |
     | Food        | cauliflower   |             | radish |
     | Transport   |               | car         |        |
     ```

5. **Clue 2**: The person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person driving the car.
   - Since the person driving the car is in position 2, the person driving the scooter must be in position 1.
     ```
     |             |       1       |      2      |   3    |
     | Beverage    | almond-milk   |             |        |
     | Food        | cauliflower   |             | radish |
     | Transport   | scooter       | car         |        |
     ```

6. **Clue 4**: The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person driving the ship.
   - Since the person driving the ship must be in position 3 (as the only remaining position), the person eating papaya must be in position 1 or 2.
   - We already have the person eating cauliflower in position 2, so the person eating papaya must be in position 1.
     ```
     |             |       1       |      2      |   3    |
     | Beverage    | almond-milk   |             |        |
     | Food        | papaya        | cauliflower | radish |
     | Transport   | scooter       | car         | ship   |
     ```

7. **Clue 5**: Revisited to confirm.
   - The person drinking almond-milk (position 1) is indeed to the left of the person drinking sprite (position 2).

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |       1       |      2      |   3    |
| Beverage    | almond-milk   |             |        |
| Food        | papaya        | cauliflower | radish |
| Transport   | scooter       | car         | ship   |
