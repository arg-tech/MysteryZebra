10. **Clue 15:** The person eating lemon is on the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the Brazilian is in position 2, the owner of the goldfish must be in position 1.
11. **Clue 1:** The owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog. Since the Brazilian is in position 1, the owner of the frog must be in position 1 (already determined), so the owner of the fish must be in position 3.
12. **Clue 11:** The Egyptian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish. Since the Egyptian is in position 3, this is already satisfied.
13. **Clue 14:** The person eating cherry is not the Canadian. So, the Canadian must be in position 6.
14. **Clue 28:** The owner of the snake is somewhere between the owner of the mouse and the owner of the goldfish. Since the mouse is in position 2 and the goldfish in position 1, the snake must be in position 3.
15. **Clue 17:** The owner of the fish is not to the right of the person eating cherry. Since the owner of the fish is in position 3 and the person eating cherry is in position 3, this is already satisfied.
16. **Clue 18:** The Turkish is not to the right of the person eating cherry. Since the person eating cherry is in position 3, the Turkish must be in position 7.
17. **Clue 19:** The person eating lemon is not to the left of the person eating peas. Since the person eating lemon is in position 6 and the person eating peas is in position 3, this is already satisfied.
18. **Clue 20:** The person eating artichoke is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the owner of the goldfish is in position 1, the artichoke must be in position 4.
19. **Clue 21:** The person eating lemon is not to the left of the person eating peas. Since the person eating lemon is in position 6 and the person eating peas is in position 3, this is already satisfied.
20. **Clue 27:** The person eating cherry is not to the right of the German. Since the person eating cherry is in position 3 and the German is in position 5, this is already satisfied.

### Final Table:
```
|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |    4    |    5     |     6     |    7    |

15. **Clue 27:** The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person eating kiwi.
16. **Clue 30:** The person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.
17. **Clue 31:** The person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

### Placing Information:

- **Writing (Carrot)**: From Clue 24, we know the person who's hobby is writing eats carrot. This must be placed in one of the positions.
- **Skydiving**: From Clue 29 and 27, the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski and on the right of the person eating kiwi. Therefore, skydiving must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and the jet-ski driver must be in an even position (2, 4, 6, or 7).
- **Cooking**: From Clue 13 and 16, the person who's hobby is cooking is to the right of the person eating apricot, and the person who's hobby is card-games is not the person eating apricot. Therefore, the person eating apricot cannot be in position 1 or 3 (since cooking would then be in 2 or 4, which contradicts Clue 1). So, apricot must be in position 5, 6, or 7, and cooking must be in position 6 or 7.
- **Train Driver**: From Clue 7, the person driving the train is not to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since filmmaking is in an even position (2, 4, 6), the train driver must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).
- **Boat Driver**: From Clue 6, the person who's hobby is sudoku is the person driving the boat. This means the boat driver is in an odd position, and the person with the hobby of sudoku is in that same position.
- **Motorbike Driver**: From Clue 10, the person driving the motorbike is not to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since skydiving is in an odd position, the motorbike driver must be in an even position.
- **Car Driver**: From Clue 10, the person driving the car is not the person who's hobby is cooking. Since cooking is in position 6 or 7, the car driver must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- **Strawberry Eater**: From Clue 9 and 22, the person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car, and the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person driving the train. This places the strawberry eater in a position to the right of the car driver and the kiwi eater in a position to the right of the train driver.
- **Eggplant Eater**: From Clue 17 and 21, the person eating eggplant is not to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku and on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This places the eggplant eater in a position to the right of the jet-ski driver.
- **Filmmaker**: From Clue 7 and 14, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in an even position and not to the left of the skateboard driver. This places the filmmaker in an even position (2, 4, 6).
