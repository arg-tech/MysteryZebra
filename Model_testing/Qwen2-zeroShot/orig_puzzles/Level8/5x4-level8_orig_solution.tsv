   - Clue 10: Coffee is on the left or right of the French.
   - Clue 8: The Polish is not to the left of the person drinking coffee.

   - Let's assume coffee is in position 1 for now and see if it works.

   - Clue 5: Juice is not to the right of the person driving the tram.
   - Therefore, the person driving the tram must be in position 4.

   - Clue 3: The person driving the bike is to the right of the person whose hobby is skydiving.
   - Therefore, skydiving cannot be in position 1 or 2.

   - Therefore, the person driving the bike must be in position 4, but this conflicts with the tram driver, so we need to adjust.

7. **Position of Taxi Drivers:**
   - Clue 15: The person driving the taxi is on the right of the Polish.
   - Therefore, the Polish must be in position 1 or 2, and the taxi driver must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Since skydiving is in position 3, the taxi driver must be in position 4.

8. **Position of Handball Players:**
   - Clue 14: The person whose sport is handball is not to the left of the German.
   - Therefore, the German cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since the French is not in position 1 (from clue 8), the French must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Since juice is in position 3, the French must be in position 4.
   - Therefore, the German must be in position 1 or 2.

9. **Position of Collectors:**
   - Clue 12: The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left of the French.
   - Therefore, the collector must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since the French is in position 4, the collector must be in position 1 or 2.

10. **Position of Singers:**
    - Clue 16: The person whose hobby is singing is on the left or right of the person whose sport is rowing.
    - Therefore, the singer must be in position 2 or 3.

11. **Final Adjustments:**
    - The person whose sport is lacrosse is between the person whose hobby is photography and the person whose hobby is collecting.
    - The person whose sport is lacrosse is in position 4.
    - The person whose hobby is photography must be in position 2.

Lv8-5x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information in the correct positions. Let's start by organizing the clues and solving step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 14:** The software-developer is the fan of hip-hop.
   - Software-developer → Hip-hop

2. **Clue 6:** The person watching adventure movies is on the far left.
   - Adventure → 1

3. **Clue 15:** The person watching documentary movies is somewhere between the lawyer and the fan of soul.
   - This means the person watching documentary movies is either in position 2 or 3, and the lawyer and the fan of soul are on either side of it.

4. **Clue 3:** The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the librarian.
   - Musical → Not 4 (Librarian)

5. **Clue 11:** The person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the librarian.
   - Swimming → > Librarian

6. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - Skiing → < Camping

7. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the fan of classical.
   - Skiing → > Classical

8. **Clue 7:** The fan of soul is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
   - Soul → < Swimming

9. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is camping is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.
   - Camping → < Family

10. **Clue 8:** The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
    - Skydiving → > Camping

11. **Clue 9:** The person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the left of the fan of soul.
    - Skydiving → > Soul

12. **Clue 10:** The person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the left of the fan of soul.
    - Skydiving → > Soul

13. **Clue 12:** The person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
    - Sudoku → < Skydiving

14. **Clue 16:** The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
    - Fishing → > Sudoku

15. **Clue 17:** The fan of classical is on the far left or far right.
    - Classical → 1 or 4

From Clue 6, we know that Adventure is at position 1. From Clue 14, we know that the software-developer is at Hip-hop (which is 1 or 2).

Since Adventure is at 1 and Classical is at either 1 or 4, let's assume Classical is at 1 for now and check consistency.

1. Adventure → 1
2. Classical → 1 (assumed)
3. Software-developer → 2 (since Classical is at 1 and Software-developer cannot be at 1)

Now, let's place the rest based on the remaining clues:

4. Librarian must be somewhere to the right of Classical, so Librarian can be at 3 or 4.

From Clue 3, the person watching musical movies is not to the right of the librarian, so if Librarian is at 3, then Musical must be at 2 or 1 (but 1 is taken by Adventure).

If Librarian is at 4, then Musical can be at 2 or 3.

From Clue 11, Swimming is to the right of Librarian, so if Librarian is at 4, Swimming can be at 3 or 4. But since Librarian is at 4, Swimming must be at 3.

So, we have:
1. Adventure
2. Software-developer
3. Musical
4. Librarian

From Clue 15, the person watching documentary movies is between the lawyer and the fan of soul. Since Classical is at 1 and Musical is at 3, the only positions left are 2 and 4. Since Librarian is at 4, the person watching documentary movies must be at 2.

So, we have:
1. Adventure
2. Documentary
3. Musical
4. Librarian

From Clue 16, Fishing is to the right of Sudoku. Since Sudoku is to the left of Skydiving and Skydiving is to the right of Camping, and Camping is to the left of Family, we can deduce:

- Sudoku is at 1 (since Adventure is at 1 and Classical is at 1)
- Skydiving is at 4 (since it is to the right of Camping and Fishing)
- Fishing is at 3 (since it is to the right of Sudoku)

So, we have:
1. Adventure
2. Documentary
3. Fishing
4. Librarian

From Clue 12, Sudoku is to the left of Skydiving, which is consistent with our placement.

Finally, the remaining positions and genres are:
- Skydiving is at 4 (Sudoku is at 1, Fishing is at 3)
- Sudoku is at 1
- Fishing is at 3
- Librarian is at 4

From Clue 5, Skiing is to the right of Classical, so Skiing must be at 2 (since Classical is at 1).

From Clue 4, Skiing is to the left of Camping, so Camping must be at 3 (since Skiing is at 2 and Fishing is at 3).

From Clue 8, Skydiving is to the right of Camping, so Skydiving must be at 4 (since Camping is at 3 and Librarian is at 4).

From Clue 2, Camping is to the left of Family, so Family must be at 2 (since Skiing is at 2 and Documentary is at 2).

   | Sport         |          |            |            | Polish    |
   ```

2. **Dutch in an odd position:** Dutch can be in positions 1 or 3.
3. **Person watching thriller movies is on the far left or far right:** Since Polish is on the far right, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 1.
   ```

   | Sport         |          |            |            | Polish    |
   ```

4. **Owner of the rat is between the fan of pop and the person who's sport is soccer:** This means the owner of the rat cannot be in position 1 or 4.
5. **Fan of pop is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies:** This means the person watching scientific movies must be to the left of the fan of pop.
6. **Person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret:** This means the owner of the ferret must be to the right of the person who's sport is basketball.
7. **Owner of the lizard is on the left of the owner of the ferret:** This means the owner of the lizard must be in a position to the left of the owner of the ferret.
8. **Nigerian is on the left of the person watching musical movies:** This means the person watching musical movies must be to the right of the Nigerian.
9. **Fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of classical:** This means the fan of classical must be to the left of the fan of funk.
10. **Person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball:** This means the person who's sport is rugby must be to the left of the person who's sport is baseball.

13. **Person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person watching action movies:** This means the person watching action movies must be to the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
14. **Person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of soul:** This means the fan of soul must be to the right of the person watching musical movies.

By combining these constraints, we can deduce the following:

- The person watching thriller movies (position 1) must be Dutch.
- The person who's sport is soccer (position 2) must be to the left of the person watching action movies (position 3).
- The person watching musical movies (position 3) must be between the Dutch (position 1) and the owner of the frog (position 4).

Thus, the final solution is:
```

   - **Food (4): Zucchini**
   - **Nationality (4): Japanese**

3. **Clue 13:** The person eating radish is on the left or right of the Indonesian.
   - Since the Indonesian is in position 2, the person eating radish can be in position 1 or 3.

4. **Clue 11:** The Dutch is not to the right of the person eating strawberry.
   - This means the Dutch cannot be in position 4 if the person eating strawberry is in position 4.

5. **Clue 6:** The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the left of the person eating zucchini.
   - Since the person eating zucchini is in position 4, the person eating strawberry must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

6. **Clue 4:** The person eating zucchini is not to the left of the Japanese.
   - Since the Japanese is in position 4, the person eating zucchini (Japanese) cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the person eating zucchini must be in position 4.

7. **Clue 5:** The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the left of the person eating zucchini.
   - Since the person eating zucchini is in position 4, the person eating strawberry must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

8. **Clue 12:** The person who's sport is tennis is not the owner of the snake.
   - This does not directly help us but will be useful later.

9. **Clue 8:** The owner of the snake is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
   - We need to find where the documentary movies are watched.

10. **Clue 10:** The person watching sports movies is somewhere between the owner of the rat and the owner of the ferret.
    - This places the sports movies in one of the middle positions (2 or 3).

11. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is rowing is not the person eating radish.
    - This helps us place the rower.

12. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is badminton is the Indonesian.
    - We already know the Indonesian is watching scientific movies, so this is consistent.

13. **Clue 9:** The owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing.
    - This helps us place the skier.

14. **Clue 1:** The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the owner of the ferret.
    - The Indonesian (watching scientific movies) is in position 2, so the owner of the ferret must be in position 1.

15. **Clue 2:** The owner of the rat is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies.
    - The owner of the rat cannot be in position 2 or 3 since the Indonesian is in position 2.

16. **Clue 6:** The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the left of the person eating zucchini.
    - Since the person eating zucchini is in position 4, the person eating strawberry must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

17. **Clue 18:** The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish.
    - The person eating radish can be in position 1 or 3, so the chinchilla owner must be in position 3 or 4.

18. **Clue 16:** The person eating zucchini is on the left of the Malaysian.
    - The person eating zucchini (Japanese) is in position 4, so the Malaysian must be in position 5, which is not possible since we only have 4 columns.

19. **Clue 17:** The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing.
    - This places the tennis player after the skier.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Skiing and Handball
- From Clue 3 and Clue 4, the person whose sport is skiing must be in position 2 or 4.
- Since the French is to the right of the person whose sport is skiing (Clue 2), the French cannot be in position 1.
- If the person whose sport is skiing is in position 2, then the French would have to be in positions 3 or 4, which contradicts Clue 2 (the French must be to the right of the person whose sport is skiing). Therefore, the person whose sport is skiing must be in position 4.
- The French is then in position 5 or 6. But since the person driving the jet-ski is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike (Clue 10), and the person driving the quad-bike is in position 1 or 3 (since they are to the left or right of the person eating tomato), the French must be in position 6.
- So, the person whose sport is skiing is in position 4, and the French is in position 6.

#### Step 2: Positioning Quad-bike and Subways
- From Clue 1, the person driving the quad-bike is on the left or right of the person eating tomato.
- From Clue 7, the person eating tomato is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the subway.
- Therefore, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1 or 3, and the person driving the subway must be in position 3 or 5.
- Since the person driving the quad-bike is to the left or right of the person eating tomato (Clue 1) and the person eating tomato is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the subway (Clue 7), the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1, and the person driving the subway must be in position 3.
- The person eating tomato is then in position 2.

#### Step 3: Positioning Other Positions
- From Clue 10, the person driving the jet-ski is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike, so the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 1 (but it can't be since the person driving the quad-bike is in position 1). This means the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 2.
- The person driving the scooter must be in position 5 (Clue 14).
- The person driving the jet-ski (position 2) is between the person eating banana and the Egyptian (Clue 16), so the person eating banana must be in position 1, and the Egyptian must be in position 3.

#### Step 4: Filling in Remaining Information
- The person eating garlic must be in position 5 (Clue 15).
- The Brazilian must be in position 3 (Clue 9).

#### Step 5: Final Assignment
- From Clue 11, the owner of the guinea-pig cannot be to the left of the person eating garlic, so the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 4.
- The owner of the bird must be in position 1 (Clue 19), and the owner of the snake must be in position 2 (Clue 18).

Lv8-5x4-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 5**: The Indian is on the far left.
2. **Clue 14**: The person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the Indian.
3. **Clue 3**: The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies.
4. **Clue 17**: The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the Indian.
5. **Clue 16**: The Indonesian is on the far right.

Given these clues, we can start placing the Indian and Indonesian:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |        4        |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Food          | Indian     |             |           |                 |
| Job           |            |             |           |                 |
| Movie-Genre   |            |             |           |                 |

| Transport     |            |             |           |                 |

Next, let's use Clue 1:

6. **Clue 1**: The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies.

Since the Indian is on the far left (Clue 5), the person watching disaster movies cannot be in position 1. Therefore, it must be in position 2, 3, or 4. And the person watching satire movies must be in one of the positions to the left or right of the person watching disaster movies.

Next, let's use Clue 3:

7. **Clue 3**: The person eating carrot is in an odd position.

This means the person eating carrot is in position 1 or 3. Since the Indian is already in position 1, the person eating carrot must be in position 3.

Next, let's use Clue 11:

11. **Clue 11**: The project-manager is the person eating eggplant.

So, the project-manager is in position 3 and is eating eggplant.

Next, let's use Clue 12:

12. **Clue 12**: The person eating cauliflower is not the person driving the roller.

Since the person eating carrot is in position 3 and eating eggplant, the person eating cauliflower cannot be in position 3. It also cannot be in position 4 because the Indonesian is there. So, it must be in position 2.

Now, let's use Clue 4:

4. **Clue 4**: The person eating cherry is on the left or right of the person eating cauliflower.

Since the person eating cauliflower is in position 2, the person eating cherry must be in position 1 or 3. But since the person eating carrot is in position 3, the person eating cherry must be in position 1.

Now, let's use Clue 13:

13. **Clue 13**: The project-manager is not the person watching satire movies.

Since the project-manager is in position 3, they cannot be watching satire movies. So, the person watching satire movies must be in position 2 or 4. Since the person eating cauliflower is in position 2, the person watching satire movies must be in position 4.

Now, let's use Clue 9:

9. **Clue 9**: The person watching fantasy movies is between the architect and the person driving the bike.

Since the person watching satire movies is in position 4, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 2 or 3. But the person eating cauliflower is in position 2, so the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 3. This means the architect must be in position 2 and the person driving the bike must be in position 4.

Finally, let's use Clue 15:

15. **Clue 15**: The person eating cauliflower is between the person eating cherry and the turkish.

Since the person eating cherry is in position 1 and the person eating cauliflower is in position 2, the person eating eggplant (the project-manager) must be in position 3, and the person driving the bike must be in position 4. Therefore, the person eating eggplant is the turkish.

So, we have:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |        4        |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Food          | Cherry     | Cauliflower | Eggplant  |                 |
| Job           | Architect  |             | Turkish   |                 |
| Movie-Genre   |            | Fantasy     | Satire    | Disaster         |
| Nationality   | Indian     |             | Nigerian  | Indonesian      |
| Transport     | Bike       | Roller      | Trike     | Helicopter      |

We still need to determine the job for position 2 and the movie genre for positions 1 and 4. Using Clue 6:

6. **Clue 6**: The project-manager is the person eating eggplant.

This confirms that the project-manager is in position 3 and eating eggplant.

Using Clue 7:

7. **Clue 7**: The architect is not to the left of the person driving the trike.

This means the architect cannot be in position 1. Since the architect is in position 2, the person driving the trike must be in position 4. This fits with the disaster movie in position 4.

Using Clue 8:

8. **Clue 8**: The person eating carrot is not to the left of the turkish.

This means the person eating carrot (cherry) is not in position 1. Since the person eating cherry is in position 1, this is consistent.

Using Clue 10:

10. **Clue 10**: The person eating cauliflower is not the person driving the roller.

This means the person eating cauliflower is in position 2 and the person driving the roller is in position 1. This fits with the cherry in position 1 and the cauliflower in position 2.

Using Clue 18:

18. **Clue 18**: The nigerian is not to the right of the indonesian.

This means the nigerian cannot be in position 4. Since the nigerian is in position 3, this is consistent.

Finally, using Clue 19:

19. **Clue 19**: The person watching disaster movies is not to the left of the person eating carrot.

This means the person watching disaster movies is not in position 1. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 4, this is consistent.

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |        4        |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Food          | Cherry     | Cauliflower | Eggplant  |                 |
| Job           | Architect  | Dressmaker  | Turkish   | Scientist       |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy     | Fantasy     | Satire    | Disaster        |
| Nationality   | Indian     | Indonesian  | Nigerian  | Indonesian      |
| Transport     | Bike       | Roller      | Trike     | Helicopter      |
