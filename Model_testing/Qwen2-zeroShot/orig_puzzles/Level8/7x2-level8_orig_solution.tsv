Lv8-7x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding information into the table. Let's break down the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The mechanic is on the left or right of the person driving the roller.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the dancer.
3. **Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is singing is not the person watching drama movies.
4. **Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is singing is somewhere to the left of the mechanic.
5. **Clue 5:** The mechanic is not to the left of the person driving the roller (redundant with Clue 1).
6. **Clue 6:** The Thai is not the person driving the roller.
7. **Clue 7:** The person eating raspberry is the person whose hobby is board-games.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 & 5
Clue 1 and 5 are redundant, so we only need to consider:
- The mechanic is either to the left or right of the person driving the roller.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the dancer.
- This means if the dancer is in position 1, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The person whose hobby is singing is not the person watching drama movies.
- This means these two attributes do not overlap.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The person whose hobby is singing is somewhere to the left of the mechanic.
- This places the person with the hobby of singing before the mechanic.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 6
- The Thai is not the person driving the roller.
- This means the Thai can be in any other position except for the one driving the roller.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 7
- The person eating raspberry is the person whose hobby is board-games.
- This means the person eating raspberry and the person with the hobby of board-games are the same.

Lv8-7x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements accordingly. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The person who's hobby is hiking is not to the left of the person watching mystery movies**.
2. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the left of the social-worker**.
3. **The Italian is somewhere to the right of the British**.
4. **The person who's hobby is hiking is not the person eating lemon**.
5. **The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions of the hobbies and sports
- Hiking cannot be in position 1 (leftmost) because it would violate Clue 1 if the mystery movie watcher was in position 2.
- Therefore, Hiking must be in position 2 (rightmost).

#### Step 2: Identify the positions of the beverage and job
- Hot-chocolate is to the left of the social-worker (Clue 2), so Hot-chocolate can only be in position 1 (leftmost).
- Therefore, Social-worker must be in position 2 (rightmost).

#### Step 3: Identify the positions of the nationalities
- The Italian must be to the right of the British (Clue 3), so the British must be in position 1 and the Italian in position 2.

#### Step 4: Identify the positions of the movie genre and sport
- Adventure movies are to the left of water-polo (Clue 5), so Adventure must be in position 1 and Water-polo in position 2.

#### Step 5: Identify the remaining food items
- Since Hiking is in position 2 and cannot be eating lemon (Clue 4), the person with Hiking must be eating apricot.
- Therefore, the person eating lemon must be doing Drawing (since Hiking is already assigned to apricot).

#### Final Assignment:
- **Position 1**: British, Drinking Hot-Chocolate, Watching Adventure Movies, Eating Lemon, Doing Drawing, Watching Mystery Movies, Playing Baseball
- **Position 2**: Italian, Social-Worker, Dancing, Eating Apricot, Hiking, Watching Mystery Movies, Playing Water-Polo

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking water is on the left of the person eating pear.
2. **Clue 2**: The person whose sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the person whose hobby is collecting.
3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse.
4. **Clue 4**: The person driving the bike is on the far left or far right.
5. **Clue 5**: The fan of electronic is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is baking.

First, let's set up the initial table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |            |            |
| Food          |            |            |
| Hobby         |            |            |

| Sport         |            | quad-      |
| Transport     | bike       | quad-bike  |
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 4**: The person driving the bike is on the far left or far right.
   - This means either person 1 or person 2 is driving the bike.
   - Since the transport column already shows ""bike"" for person 1 and ""quad-bike"" for person 2, we can conclude:
     - Person 1 is driving the bike.
     - Person 2 is driving the quad-bike.

2. **Clue 3**: The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse.
   - This confirms that person 2 (who drives the quad-bike) is to the right of the owner of the mouse.
   - Therefore, the owner of the mouse must be person 1.

3. **Clue 5**: The fan of electronic is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is baking.
   - This means the electronic fan cannot be in position 2 if the hobbyist is in position 2.

4. **Clue 1**: The person drinking water is on the left of the person eating pear.
   - This means the beverage order must be water, then pear.

5. **Clue 2**: The person whose sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the person whose hobby is collecting.
   - This means the lacrosse player cannot be in position 2 if the collector is in position 2.

### Final Table Construction:

Given the above constraints, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | water      | pear       |
| Food          | cucumber   | pear       |
| Hobby         | baking     | collecting |
| Music-Genre   | electronic | soul       |
| Pet           | mouse      | cat        |
| Sport         | lacrosse   | basketball |
| Transport     | bike       | quad-bike  |
```

### Verification:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking water (person 1) is on the left of the person eating pear (person 2).
2. **Clue 2**: The person whose sport is lacrosse (person 2) is not to the right of the person whose hobby is collecting (person 2).
3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the quad-bike (person 2) is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse (person 1).
4. **Clue 4**: The person driving the bike (person 1) is on the far left.
5. **Clue 5**: The fan of electronic (person 1) is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is baking (person 1).

3. **Electronic** is on the far left.
4. **Adventure** is to the right of **Taxi**.
5. **Soy-milk** is to the left of **Goat**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: Electronic is on the far left.
   ```
   |   Electronic |       |       |
   |             |       |       |
   |             |       |       |
   |             |       |       |
   |             |       |       |
   ```

2. **Clue 1**: Sprite is not to the left of Gardening.
   - This implies that if Sprite is in position 1, Gardening cannot be in position 2.
   
3. **Clue 2**: Gardening is to the right of Indonesian.
   - If Indonesian is in position 1, Gardening must be in position 2 or higher.
   
4. **Clue 4**: Adventure is to the right of Taxi.
   - If Taxi is in position 1, Adventure must be in position 2 or higher.
   
5. **Clue 5**: Soy-milk is to the left of Goat.
   - If Goat is in position 2, Soy-milk must be in position 1.

### Applying Clues:

- Since Electronic is fixed at position 1, let's consider the remaining positions for other categories.

#### Position 1 (Electronic):
```

|             |       |       |
|             |       |       |
|             |       |       |
|             |       |       |
```

#### Position 2:
- **Gardening** can't be here because it has to be to the right of **Indonesian**.
- **Sprite** can't be here because it has to be to the right of **Gardening**.

#### Position 3:
- **Adventure** can't be here because it has to be to the right of **Taxi**.
- **Soy-milk** can't be here because it has to be to the left of **Goat**.

#### Position 4:
- **Taxi** can't be here because **Adventure** has to be to the right of **Taxi**.
- **Gardening** can be here because it has to be to the right of **Indonesian**.

#### Position 5:
- **Indonesian** can be here because **Gardening** needs to be to the right of **Indonesian**.
- **Sprite** can be here because it can be to the left of **Gardening**.

Now we have:
```
|   Electronic | Sprite |       |
|             |       |       |
|             |       |       |
|             |       |       |
|             |       |       |
```

#### Position 6:
- **Goat** can be here because **Soy-milk** needs to be to the left of **Goat**.
- **Metal** can be here because it can be anywhere.

#### Position 7:
- **Metal** can be here because it can be anywhere.
- **Adventure** can be here because it has to be to the right of **Taxi**.

#### Position 8:
- **Taxi** can be here because **Adventure** needs to be to the right of **Taxi**.
- **Metal** can be here because it can be anywhere.

Final Table:
```
|   Electronic | Sprite | Metal  |
|             |       |       |

2. The social-worker is Thai.
3. The owner of the goldfish is not to the left of the fan of trance.
4. The person drinking coffee is on the far right.
5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4: The person drinking coffee is on the far right.
This means that in column 2 (the rightmost column), the beverage is coffee.

|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      |   cola    |   coffee      |
| Food          |           |               |
| Job           |           |               |
| Music-Genre   |           |               |
| Nationality   |           |               |
| Pet           |           |               |
| Sport         |           |               |

#### Clue 2: The social-worker is Thai.
This means the nationality in column 2 is Thai.

|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      |   cola    |   coffee      |
| Food          |           |               |
| Job           |           |   social-worker|
| Music-Genre   |           |               |
| Nationality   |           |   Thai        |
| Pet           |           |               |
| Sport         |           |               |

#### Clue 1: The social-worker is on the right of the person eating peas.
Since the social-worker is in column 2, the person eating peas must be in column 1.

|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      |   cola    |   coffee      |
| Food          |   lettuce |   peas       |
| Job           |           |   social-worker|
| Music-Genre   |           |               |
| Nationality   |           |   Thai        |
| Pet           |           |               |
| Sport         |           |               |

#### Clue 5: The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep.
Since we don't know yet who is doing which sport, let's hold this clue for now.

#### Clue 3: The owner of the goldfish is not to the left of the fan of trance.
Since we don't know yet who has the goldfish or prefers trance, let's also hold this clue for now.

### Determining Remaining Details:

We need to place the remaining details based on the remaining clues.

- **Beverage:** We have cola and coffee already placed.
- **Food:** We have lettuce and peas already placed.
- **Job:** We have paramedic and social-worker.
- **Music-Genre:** We have dubstep and trance.
- **Nationality:** We have Canadian and Thai.
- **Pet:** We have goldfish and pony.
- **Sport:** We have snowboarding and surfing.

From Clue 4, we know coffee is in column 2, so cola is in column 1 for beverages.
From Clue 2, Thai is in column 2 for nationality, so Canadian must be in column 1.
From Clue 1, the social-worker (Thai) is to the right of the person eating peas (lettuce).

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:

- **Job:** Since the social-worker is in column 2, the paramedic must be in column 1.
- **Music-Genre:** We can assume the person who likes trance is in column 2 and the person who likes dubstep is in column 1.
- **Pet:** The goldfish must be in column 1 because it cannot be to the left of the person who likes trance.
- **Sport:** Snowboarding must be in column 2 because it is to the right of the person who likes dubstep.

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      |   cola    |   coffee      |
| Food          |   lettuce |   peas       |
| Job           | paramedic | social-worker |
| Music-Genre   |   dubstep |    trance     |
| Nationality   |   Canadian|      Thai     |
| Pet           |   pony    |   goldfish    |
| Sport         | surfing   | snowboarding  |

### Initial Setup:
We'll start by setting up the table with placeholders for each category.

```
|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |              |            |
| Food          |              |            |
| Job           |              |            |
| Movie-Genre   |              |            |
| Nationality   |              |            |
| Pet           |              |            |
| Sport         |              |            |
```

### Applying Clues:

#### Clue 1: The owner of the turtle is not to the right of the owner of the lizard.
This means if someone has a lizard, they cannot be in position 2 and the owner of the turtle must be in position 1.

#### Clue 2: The bartender is somewhere to the right of the person watching disaster movies.
This means the bartender cannot be in position 1 if the person watching disaster movies is in position 1.

#### Clue 3: The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
This means badminton must be in position 1 and soy-milk in position 2 or vice versa.

#### Clue 4: The owner of the lizard is on the right of the american.
This means the american must be in position 1 and the owner of the lizard in position 2.

#### Clue 5: The indonesian is not the person watching disaster movies.
This means the indonesian can only watch sports movies.

#### Clue 6: The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person eating avocado.
This means the person watching sports movies (indonesian) is either in position 1 or 2 of the movie genre row, and the person eating avocado is either in position 1 or 2 of the food row.

### Deduction:

1. **Lizard and Turtle:**
   - From Clue 4, the american is in position 1 and the owner of the lizard is in position 2.
   - Therefore, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1.

2. **Sports and Beverage:**
   - From Clue 3, badminton must be in position 1 and soy-milk in position 2 or vice versa.
   - Since the owner of the turtle is in position 1, and from Clue 1, the turtle owner cannot be in position 2, badminton must be in position 1 and soy-milk in position 2.

3. **Disaster Movies and Bartender:**
   - From Clue 2, the bartender is to the right of the person watching disaster movies.
   - Since the person watching disaster movies is not the bartender, and the bartender must be in position 2, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 1.

4. **Avocado and Sports:**
   - From Clue 6, the person watching sports movies (indonesian) is on the left or right of the person eating avocado.
   - Since the person watching sports movies is in position 2 of the movie genre row (from Clue 5), the person eating avocado must be in position 1 of the food row.

5. **American and Indonesian:**
   - The american is in position 1 of the nationality row (from Clue 4).
   - The indonesian is in position 2 of the nationality row (from Clue 5).

6. **Job:**
   - The bartender is in position 2 of the job row (from Clue 2).

7. **Pet:**
   - The owner of the lizard is in position 2 of the pet row (from Clue 4).

Lv8-7x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each attribute (food, hobby, job, movie genre, nationality, pet, and sport) into the correct cells while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the information and constraints step-by-step.

### Constraints Recap:
1. The architect is not to the right of the person whose hobby is baking.
2. The person whose hobby is Sudoku is not the person whose sport is Lacrosse.
3. The person watching Satire movies is either to the left or right of the owner of the Hedgehog.
4. The person watching Drama movies is to the right of the Writer.
5. The Architect is to the right of the Dutch.
6. The person eating Nectarine is not the person whose sport is Lacrosse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Job - Architect**: Based on constraint 5, the Architect must be in position 2 for Dutch (since the Architect is to the right of the Dutch).
2. **Hobby - Baking**: From constraint 1, the person with the hobby of Baking cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 1.
3. **Sport - Lacrosse**: From constraint 6, the person eating Nectarine cannot be the one playing Lacrosse. So, let's assign Lacrosse to another cell first.
4. **Movie Genre - Drama**: From constraint 4, the person watching Drama movies must be to the right of the Writer. Since the Architect is in position 2, the Writer cannot be in position 2, so the Writer must be in position 1.
5. **Nationality - Dutch**: From constraint 5, the Dutch must be in position 2.
6. **Pet - Hedgehog**: From constraint 3, the person owning the Hedgehog must be either to the left or right of the person watching Satire movies. Since the Dutch is in position 2, the Hedgehog could be in position 1 or 2. However, since the person watching Satire movies must be to the right of the Hedgehog, the Hedgehog must be in position 1.
7. **Movie Genre - Satire**: From constraint 3, the person watching Satire movies must be to the right of the Hedgehog, so they must be in position 2.
8. **Hobby - Sudoku**: From constraint 2, the person whose hobby is Sudoku cannot be the person whose sport is Lacrosse. Since the person owning the Hedgehog is in position 1, the Sudoku person must be in position 2.
9. **Sport - Badminton**: The only remaining sport for the person eating Nectarine is Badminton, as Lacrosse is already assigned to someone else.
10. **Food - Nectarine**: The person eating Nectarine cannot play Lacrosse, so they must eat Nectarine.
11. **Food - Blueberry**: The remaining food must be Blueberry for the other person.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          | Nectarine | Blueberry |
| Hobby         | Baking    | Sudoku    |
| Job           | Writer    | Architect |

| Nationality   | Argentine | Dutch     |
| Pet           | Hedgehog  | Turtle    |
| Sport         | Badminton | Lacrosse  |

7. The person watching martial-arts movies is the person eating mango.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7:** The person watching martial-arts movies is the person eating mango.
   - This means the person eating mango is also the one watching martial-arts movies.

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating mango is not the person watching family movies.
   - Since the person eating mango is watching martial-arts movies, they are not watching family movies.

3. **Clue 1:** The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is weightlifting.
   - Let's denote the positions as 1 and 2 for each category. We need to place the Japanese and the person with weightlifting in such a way that the Japanese is to the left.

4. **Clue 5:** The person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the Japanese.
   - This means if the Japanese is in position 1, the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in position 2.

5. **Clue 4:** The person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person watching family movies.
   - This means the person watching family movies must be to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

6. **Clue 3:** The fan of punk is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine.
   - This means if the person eating nectarine is in position 1, the fan of punk can be in position 2, and vice versa.

7. **Clue 6:** The pilot is somewhere to the right of the fan of punk.
   - This means the fan of punk cannot be in position 2 (since the pilot must be to the right).

8. **Combining Clues:**
   - From clue 7, the person eating mango (and thus watching martial-arts) cannot be the person watching family movies.
   - From clue 1, if the Japanese is in position 1, the person with weightlifting must be in position 2.
   - From clue 5, the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in position 2 if the Japanese is in position 1.
   - From clue 4, the person watching family movies must be to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - From clue 3, the fan of punk and the person eating nectarine must be adjacent.
   - From clue 6, the pilot must be to the right of the fan of punk.

### Final Placement:

- **Food:**
  - Position 1: Nectarine (since the person eating mango is not the person watching family movies)
  - Position 2: Mango

- **Job:**
  - Position 1: Fisherman (since the pilot must be to the right of the fan of punk and the pilot cannot be in position 1)
  - Position 2: Pilot

- **Movie-Genre:**
  - Position 1: Family (since the person eating mango is watching martial-arts)
  - Position 2: Martial-arts

- **Music-Genre:**
  - Position 1: Metal (since the fan of punk is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine)
  - Position 2: Punk

Lv8-7x2-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Given Information:**
   - There are two types of food: carrot, cauliflower.
   - Two hobbies: fishing, magic-tricks.
   - Two jobs: dressmaker, pilot.
   - Two movie genres: animation, documentary.
   - Two music genres: hip-hop, rock.
   - Two sports: handball, tennis.
   - Two modes of transport: airplane, taxi.

2. **Clues:**
   - Clue 1: The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person eating carrot.
   - Clue 2: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not to the right of the person who's sport is handball.
   - Clue 3: The person who's hobby is fishing is on the far right.
   - Clue 4: The person driving the airplane is not to the right of the person watching documentary movies.
   - Clue 5: The person who's sport is handball is not to the right of the dressmaker.
   - Clue 6: The person driving the airplane is the person who's sport is handball.
   - Clue 7: The fan of hip-hop is not to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.

3. **Analyzing the Clues:**

   - From Clue 6, we know that the person who drives the airplane plays handball.
   - From Clue 1, the person who eats carrot is on the left of the person who plays handball. Therefore, the person who eats carrot must be in position 1, and the person who plays handball must be in position 2.
   - From Clue 3, the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 2 (the far right).
   - Since the person playing handball is in position 2 and the person with the hobby of fishing is also in position 2, there is a contradiction unless we interpret ""fishing is on the far right"" as the last column of the second row. This implies the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 2 of the second row.

   Let's update the table:
   
   ```
   |               |      1       |      2      |
   | Food          | Carrot       | Cauliflower |
   | Hobby         | Magic-Tricks | Fishing     |
   | Job           |              |             |
   | Movie-Genre   |              |             |
   | Music-Genre   |              |             |
   | Sport         | Handball     | Tennis      |
   | Transport     | Airplane     | Taxi        |
   ```

   - From Clue 2, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 1.
   - From Clue 5, the person who plays handball (in position 2) is not to the right of the dressmaker, so the dressmaker must be in position 1.
   - From Clue 4, the person driving the airplane (handball player) is not to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the handball player is in position 2, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 1.
   - From Clue 7, the fan of hip-hop is not to the left of the person with the hobby of fishing. Since the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 2, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 1.

   Let's update the table:

Lv8-7x2-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify Constraints and Initial Setup
We have two columns (1 and 2) and six rows (Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality, Sport).

### Step 2: List All Constraints
1. The person who's hobby is photography is not to the right of the doctor.
2. The Colombian is not to the left of the person eating asparagus.
3. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the person eating asparagus.
4. The person watching adventure movies is not to the right of the doctor.
5. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the fan of indie.
6. The doctor is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.

### Step 3: Apply Constraints
#### Constraint 1: Photography & Doctor
- If the doctor is in column 1, then the person with photography cannot be in column 2.
- If the doctor is in column 2, then the person with photography cannot be in column 1.

#### Constraint 2: Colombian & Asparagus
- The Colombian cannot be in column 1 if the person eating asparagus is in column 1.
- The Colombian cannot be in column 2 if the person eating asparagus is in column 2.

#### Constraint 3: Carrot & Asparagus
- The person eating carrot must be in a column to the left of the person eating asparagus.

#### Constraint 4: Adventure & Doctor
- The person watching adventure movies must be in a column to the left of the doctor.

#### Constraint 5: Disaster & Indie
- The person watching disaster movies must be in a column to the right of the person who prefers indie.

#### Constraint 6: Doctor & Cycling
- The doctor must be in a column to the left of the person who likes cycling.

### Step 4: Logical Deduction
Let's start placing values based on constraints:

1. **Doctor & Photography**
   - Let's assume the doctor is in column 1 (we can test other positions later).
   - Then the person with photography must be in column 2.
   
2. **Colombian & Asparagus**
   - Let's assume the Colombian is in column 1 (we can test other positions later).
   - Then the person eating asparagus must be in column 2.

3. **Carrot & Asparagus**
   - Since the person eating asparagus is in column 2, the person eating carrot must be in column 1.

4. **Adventure & Doctor**
   - Since the doctor is in column 1, the person watching adventure movies must be in column 1.

5. **Disaster & Indie**
   - The person watching disaster movies must be in a column to the right of the person who prefers indie.

6. **Doctor & Cycling**
   - The doctor is in column 1, so the person who likes cycling must be in column 2.

### Step 5: Final Placement
Based on these deductions, we can place the values as follows:

|               |      1      |       2       |
| Food          | carrot      | asparagus     |
| Hobby         | photography | rock-climbing |
