12. The fan of trance is not to the right of the lawyer.
13. The fan of trance is somewhere between the person watching spy movies and the person eating cranberry.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person driving the trike is on the far left.**
   - Trike (1)

2. **The person driving the train is on the left or right of the German.**
   - Since the trike is already placed, the train must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Train (2) or Train (3)

3. **The person driving the train is on the right of the person eating cucumber.**
   - This means cucumber can only be in position 1 if train is in position 2.
   - Cucumber (1), Train (2)

4. **The person driving the train is not to the left of the fan of reggae.**
   - Since the train is in position 2, the fan of reggae cannot be in position 1.
   - Reggae (3)

5. **The person driving the train is on the right of the person eating cucumber.**
   - This confirms that cucumber is in position 1 and train is in position 2.
   - Cucumber (1), Train (2), Reggae (3)

6. **The lawyer is somewhere to the right of the fisherman.**
   - This means the fisherman cannot be in position 3.
   - Fisherman (1) or Fisherman (2)

7. **The person driving the trike is on the far left.**
   - This is already established as trike (1).

8. **The person driving the train is on the left or right of the German.**
   - Since the train is in position 2, the German can be in position 1 or 3.
   - German (1) or German (3)

9. **The lawyer is somewhere to the left of the person eating orange.**
   - This means the person eating orange cannot be in position 1.
   - Orange (2) or Orange (3)

10. **The person driving the train is not to the left of the fan of reggae.**
    - This is already satisfied since train (2) and reggae (3).

11. **The person driving the trike is on the far left.**
    - This is already established as trike (1).

12. **The fan of trance is not to the right of the lawyer.**
    - This means the lawyer cannot be in position 3.
    - Lawyer (1) or Lawyer (2)

13. **The fan of trance is somewhere between the person watching spy movies and the person eating cranberry.**
    - This means the person watching spy movies and the person eating cranberry must be on either side of the fan of trance.
    - Let's denote them as S (spy) and C (cranberry).
    - S (1), T (2), C (3) or C (1), T (2), S (3)

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining elements:

- Since the German cannot be in position 3 (lawyer), the German must be in position 1.
- The lawyer must be in position 2 (since the person eating orange is not to the left of the person watching satire movies and the lawyer is to the left of the person eating orange).
- The person eating orange must be in position 3 (since the lawyer is in position 2).

Now we have:
- German (1)
- Lawyer (2)
- Orange (3)

Since the person driving the train is in position 2, the person watching crime movies (Polish) must be in position 1.
- Polish (1)
- German (1)
- Lawyer (2)
- Orange (3)

The remaining positions for cranberry and cucumber must fit the constraints:
- The person eating cucumber cannot be in position 1 (German) or 3 (Orange).
- The person watching satire movies cannot be in position 1 (Polish) or 3 (Orange).

This leaves us with:
- Cucumber (1)
- Cranberry (2)
- Satire (2)

Finally, the fan of disco and trance must fit:
- The fan of disco is not to the right of the person watching spy movies.
- The fan of trance is between the person watching spy movies and the person eating cranberry.

This gives us:
- Disco (1)
- Trance (2)
- Spy (2)

   - The Italian (Egyptian) is the fan of trance (since the Brazilian is the fan of house and the filmmaker is the fan of metal, the only remaining genre is trance).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 14**: The accountant is the Russian. So, we can place ""Russian"" in the ""Job"" column for the accountant.

2. **Clue 2**: The firefighter is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the firefighter is in position 1 (we will check if it works later).

3. **Clue 11**: The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the accountant. Since the accountant is in position 3, the person with biathlon must be in position 1 or 2. Since firefighter is also in position 1, the biathlon must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 8**: The person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the right of the firefighter. If the firefighter is in position 1 and biathlon is in position 2, then skydiving must be in position 3.

5. **Clue 12**: The person who's hobby is baking is not to the left of the person eating pear. Since baking and pear are linked, and the firefighter (who is eating pear) is in position 1, baking cannot be in position 1 or 2.

6. **Clue 1**: The person eating pear is the person who's hobby is baking. So, baking must be in position 2, and pear must be in position 1.

7. **Clue 3**: The person watching fantasy movies is the person who's sport is rugby. Rugby is in position 3, so fantasy movies must be in position 3.

8. **Clue 13**: The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the right of the Italian. Mystery movies cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3, but since fantasy movies are there, mystery must be in position 2.

10. **Clue 9**: The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the Russian. Since the Russian is in position 3, carrot can be in position 1 or 2. Given that pomegranate is in position 1, carrot must be in position 2.

11. **Clue 7**: The person watching spy movies is not to the right of the Russian. Spy movies cannot be in position 2 or 3, so they must be in position 1.

12. **Clue 5**: The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Mystery movies are in position 2, and rugby is in position 3, which is correct.

13. **Clue 6**: The Italian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Golf must be in position 2, so Italian must be in position 1.

14. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is golf is not to the right of the Russian. Golf is in position 2, and Russian is in position 3, which is correct.

12. **Clue 12**: The Egyptian is on the left of the Italian.
13. **Clue 13**: The person drinking mirinda is in the middle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Thai's Position
From Clue 4, the Thai is watching musical movies. From Clue 8, the Thai owns the goldfish. Therefore, Thai is in position 3.

|               |    1     |    2    |     3     |
|---------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Beverage      |          |         | Lemonade  |
| Food          |          |         | Kiwi      |

| Nationality   | Egyptian |         | Thai      |
| Pet           | Horse    |         | Goldfish  |

#### Step 2: Determine the Fan of Folk
From Clue 6, the person drinking lemonade (Thai) is not to the left of the fan of folk. Since Thai is in position 3, the fan of folk must be in position 1 or 2.

From Clue 9, the person eating artichoke is not the fan of folk. So, the fan of folk cannot be eating artichoke.

From Clue 7, the person eating artichoke is not to the right of the fan of hip-hop. This means the fan of hip-hop must be in position 1 or 2, and the person eating artichoke must be in position 3. But since Thai is in position 3, the person eating artichoke must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the Thai is the only one who can own the goldfish, the fan of folk must be the Egyptian (position 1).

| Nationality   | Egyptian | Italian | Thai      |
| Pet           | Horse    |         | Goldfish  |

#### Step 3: Determine the Fan of Hip-Hop
From Clue 7, the person eating artichoke (Egyptian) is not to the right of the fan of hip-hop. Therefore, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Egyptian is in position 1, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2.

| Nationality   | Egyptian | Italian | Thai      |
| Pet           | Horse    | Hedgehog| Goldfish  |

#### Step 4: Determine the Owner of Hedgehog
From Clue 3, the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is Egyptian, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 1.

|               |    1     |    2    |     3     |

| Nationality   | Egyptian | Italian | Thai      |
| Pet           | Hedgehog | Horse   | Goldfish  |

#### Step 5: Determine the Remaining Positions
From Clue 2, the person eating peas is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 3, the person eating peas must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is occupied by the Egyptian, the person eating peas must be in position 2.

From Clue 5, the person watching satire movies is not the fan of folk. Since the fan of folk is Egyptian, the person watching satire movies must be in position 2 or 3. Since position 2 is Italian, the person watching satire movies must be in position 3.

Lv8-6x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis

1. **Clue 1:** The owner of the turtle is between the person watching musical movies and the fan of jazz.
   - This implies the order is: musical > turtle > jazz.

2. **Clue 2:** The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
   - This implies the order is: dubstep < sprite.

3. **Clue 3:** The fan of rock is on the left of the colombian.
   - This implies the order is: rock < colombian.

4. **Clue 4:** The Canadian is not the owner of the rat.
   - This means the Canadian cannot be in the ""Pet"" column for ""rat"".

5. **Clue 5:** The designer is not to the right of the fan of rock.
   - This implies the designer must be either in the same position as or to the left of the fan of rock.

6. **Clue 6:** The designer is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.
   - This means the designer is either in the same position as or next to the lemonade drinker.

7. **Clue 7:** The owner of the mouse is on the right of the fan of rock.
   - This implies the order is: rock < mouse.

8. **Clue 8:** The designer is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - This implies the order is: cola < designer.

9. **Clue 9:** The person watching sports movies is in the middle.
   - This means sports is in position 2.

10. **Clue 10:** The accountant is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
    - This implies the order is: cola < accountant.

11. **Clue 11:** The Canadian is not to the left of the Turkish.
    - This means the Canadian cannot be in the first position if the Turkish is in the second or third position.

### Placing the Information

Let's start placing the information based on the clues:

1. **Movie-Genre (Clue 9):**
   - Sports is in position 2.

2. **Beverage (Clue 2, Clue 8):**
   - Since the designer is to the right of the person drinking cola, and the designer can't be in the middle (sports), cola must be in position 1 or 3.
   - If cola were in position 3, then the designer would be in position 4 or 5, which doesn't fit with other clues.
   - Therefore, cola must be in position 1, and the designer in position 3 or 4.

3. **Nationality (Clue 11):**
   - Since the Canadian can't be in the first position if the Turkish is in the second or third, let's assume the Canadian is in position 3 or 4, and the Turkish in position 2 or 3.

4. **Pet (Clue 1, Clue 7):**
   - The owner of the turtle is between the person watching musical movies and the fan of jazz.
   - The owner of the mouse is on the right of the fan of rock.

5. **Job (Clue 5, Clue 6):**
   - The designer is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.
   - The designer is not to the right of the fan of rock.

6. **Music-Genre (Clue 2, Clue 3, Clue 4):**
   - The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
   - The fan of rock is on the left of the colombian.
   - The Canadian is not the owner of the rat.

### Final Table Construction

Based on the above analysis, let's fill in the table:

```

Lv8-6x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically place each attribute (food, movie genre, nationality, pet, sport, and transport) into the table based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the boat is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish.
2. **Clue 2:** The person whose sport is rowing is on the left of the Pakistani.
3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the goldfish is between the person whose sport is parkour and the person eating peach.
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person eating peach.
5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is biathlon.
6. **Clue 6:** The person watching drama movies is not to the right of the person whose sport is biathlon.
7. **Clue 7:** The Indonesian is on the right of the Pakistani.

10. **Clue 10:** The owner of the pony is not the person eating cabbage.
11. **Clue 11:** The person watching sports movies is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the person driving the quad-bike.

#### Initial Setup:
We start with an empty table and fill it based on the clues:

|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
|---------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Food          |            |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |            |
| Nationality   |            |           |            |
| Pet           |            |           |            |
| Sport         |            |           |            |
| Transport     |            |           |            |

#### Applying Clues:

**Clue 8:** The owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right.
- This means the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 1 or 3.

**Clue 9:** The person eating spinach is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
- If the hedgehog owner is in position 1, then the spinach eater must be in position 1.
- If the hedgehog owner is in position 3, then the spinach eater must be in position 2.

Let's assume the hedgehog owner is in position 1 (we will check consistency later):
- Position 1: Hedgehog, Spinach

**Clue 3:** The owner of the goldfish is between the person whose sport is parkour and the person eating peach.
- If the owner of the goldfish is in position 2, then the parkour person must be in position 1 and the peach eater must be in position 3.
- If the owner of the goldfish is in position 3, then the parkour person must be in position 2 and the peach eater must be in position 1.

Since the hedgehog owner is in position 1, the goldfish owner cannot be in position 1 (as they are not adjacent to the parkour person). So, let's assume the goldfish owner is in position 2:
- Position 2: Goldfish, Peach

**Clue 2:** The person whose sport is rowing is on the left of the Pakistani.
- Since the Pakistani is in position 3, the rowing person must be in position 2.

**Clue 5:** The owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is biathlon.
- Since the rowing person is in position 2, the biathlon person must be in position 3, and the pony owner must be in position 1.

**Clue 7:** The Indonesian is on the right of the Pakistani.
- The Pakistani is in position 3, so the Indonesian must be in position 3.

**Clue 10:** The owner of the pony is not the person eating cabbage.
- The pony owner is in position 1, so the person in position 1 cannot eat cabbage.

**Clue 1:** The person driving the boat is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish.
- The owner of the goldfish is in position 2, so the boat driver cannot be in position 3.

**Clue 6:** The person watching drama movies is not to the right of the person whose sport is biathlon.
- The biathlon person is in position 3, so the drama movie watcher cannot be in position 3.

**Clue 11:** The person watching sports movies is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the person driving the quad-bike.
- Let's assume the quad-bike driver is in position 1, and the sports movie watcher is in position 2, and the drama movie watcher is in position 3.

**Clue 4:** The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person eating peach.
- Since the peach eater is in position 2, the scooter driver can be in position 1 or 3.

Lv8-6x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Summary:
1. The person who's sport is golf is not the person driving the tram.
2. The person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hamster.
3. The owner of the hamster is not to the right of the argentine.
4. The coach is on the right of the polish.
5. The person driving the tram is on the right of the manager.
6. The polish is not to the left of the manager.
7. The person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the canadian.
8. The person watching disaster movies is not to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
9. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching disaster movies.

11. The owner of the snake is not to the right of the person watching disaster movies.
12. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Placing Sports and Transport
From Clue 1: The person who's sport is golf is not the person driving the tram.
From Clue 5: The person driving the tram is on the right of the manager.
From Clue 6: The polish is not to the left of the manager.
From Clue 4: The coach is on the right of the polish.

Let's start with Transport and Sport:
- Manager cannot drive the tram (Clue 1).
- Polish is not to the left of the manager (Clue 6), so Polish must be at least in position 2 or 3.
- Coach is on the right of the polish (Clue 4), so if Polish is in position 2, then Coach must be in position 3; if Polish is in position 3, then Coach must be in position 2 or 3.

Let's assume Polish is in position 2 (we can test later if this assumption leads to a contradiction):
- Manager must be in position 3 (since the tram driver is on the right of the manager, and the manager cannot drive the tram).

Now, let's assign sports:
- The person who's sport is golf is not the person driving the tram (Clue 1).
- The person driving the tram is on the right of the manager (Clue 5), so the person driving the tram must be in position 3.
- The coach is on the right of the polish (Clue 4), so the coach must be in position 3 as well, which contradicts our previous assignment.

So, let's try Polish in position 3:
- Manager must be in position 2.
- The person driving the tram must be in position 3.
- The coach must be in position 1 (since Polish is in position 3).

Now, we have:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |      3      |
| Job           | Coach      | Manager  | Scientist   |
| Movie-Genre   |            |          |             |

| Sport         | Climbing   | Golf     | Surfing     |
| Transport     | Skateboard | Ship     | Tram        |
```

#### Step 2: Placing Movies and Pets
From Clue 8: The person watching disaster movies is not to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
From Clue 9: The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching disaster movies.

This means:
- Disaster movies must be in position 1 or 2.
- Time-travel movies must be in position 2 or 3.

Since Manager is in position 2 and the person driving the ship is to the right of the owner of the hamster (Clue 2), the owner of the hamster must be in position 1.

From Clue 3: The owner of the hamster is not to the right of the argentine.
- Hamster must be in position 1, and Argentine must be in position 2.

From Clue 7: The person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the canadian.
- Climbing must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the coach is in position 1, climbing must be in position 1.
- Canadian must be in position 2.

From Clue 10: The scientist is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.
- Scientist must be in position 1.

From Clue 11: The owner of the snake is not to the right of the person watching disaster movies.
- Snake must be in position 1.

From Clue 12: The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing.
- Time-travel movies must be in position 3.

Now, we have:
```

Lv8-6x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items in the correct cells of the table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person watching horror movies.
2. **Clue 2**: The person watching musical movies is in the middle (i.e., row 3).
3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the goat is somewhere to the left of the person eating lemon.
4. **Clue 4**: The person eating lemon is not the Australian.
5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking fanta is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies.
6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat.
7. **Clue 7**: The person drinking milk is somewhere between the person driving the motorbike and the owner of the goat.
8. **Clue 8**: The person eating mango is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.
9. **Clue 9**: The person driving the skateboard is not to the right of the person drinking fanta.
10. **Clue 10**: The person eating lemon is somewhere to the right of the American.
11. **Clue 11**: The person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person eating mango.
12. **Clue 12**: The Australian is the person watching musical movies.
13. **Clue 13**: The person watching musical movies is the owner of the rat.
14. **Clue 14**: The Australian is on the left of the person watching documentary movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Place the person watching musical movies
- From Clue 2, the person watching musical movies is in row 3.
- From Clue 12 and Clue 13, the Australian watches musical movies and owns the rat.
- Therefore, the Australian is in row 3, column 3.

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
| Beverage      |          |            |             |
| Food          |          |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   |          |            | Musical     |
| Nationality   |          |            | Australian |
| Pet           |          |            | Rat         |
| Transport     |          |            |             |

#### Step 2: Place the person drinking 7up
- From Clue 1, the person drinking 7up cannot be to the right of the person watching horror movies.
- Since the person watching horror movies must be in row 1 or 2, the person drinking 7up must be in row 1 or 2.
- From Clue 14, the Australian is on the left of the person watching documentary movies, so the person watching horror movies cannot be in column 1 (since it would make the Australian in column 2).
