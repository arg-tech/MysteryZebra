Lv8-7x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Initial Setup
We have six categories:
- Beverage

Each category has 6 items, and each item must be placed in one of the 6 positions (1 to 6).
