1. **Person with lacrosse (Sport) is on the far right:**
   - This means the person with lacrosse is in position (2, Sport).

2. **Paramedic is on the left or right of the owner of the horse:**
   - This means the paramedic and the horse owner must be adjacent.

3. **Person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person eating banana:**
   - This means the cucumber eater and the banana eater must be adjacent.

4. **Person with volleyball (Sport) is not to the right of the person with lacrosse (Sport):**
   - This means the person with volleyball cannot be in position (2, Sport).

5. **Person eating banana is on the right of the paramedic:**
   - This means the paramedic cannot be in position (2, Food), and the banana eater must be in position (2, Food).

6. **Person with puzzles (Hobby) is on the far left:**
   - This means the person with puzzles is in position (1, Hobby).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning Puzzles:**
   - Person with puzzles (Hobby) is in position (1, Hobby).

2. **Positioning Lacrosse:**
   - Lacrosse is in position (2, Sport).

3. **Positioning Volleyball:**
   - Since volleyball cannot be to the right of lacrosse, it must be in position (1, Sport).

4. **Positioning Paramedic:**
   - The paramedic must be on the left or right of the horse owner.
   - Since the banana eater is on the right of the paramedic, the paramedic cannot be in position (2, Food).
   - Therefore, the paramedic must be in position (1, Food).

5. **Positioning Horse:**
   - The horse owner must be next to the paramedic, so the horse owner is in position (2, Food).

6. **Positioning Cucumber and Banana:**
   - The cucumber eater and the banana eater must be adjacent.
   - Given that the banana eater is on the right of the paramedic, the cucumber eater must be in position (1, Food).

Lv8-5x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and systematically fill out the table:

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues.
2. The Italian is not to the right of the person watching animation movies.
3. The Italian is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle.
4. The owner of the rabbit is the fan of ambient.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
- **Owner of the rabbit** = **fan of ambient**

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- The person with woodworking is to the right of the fan of blues.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
- The Italian is not to the right of the person watching animation movies.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 3
- The Italian is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle.

Given that there are only two columns, let's denote them as Column 1 and Column 2.

### Filling the Table

1. Since the owner of the rabbit is the fan of ambient (Clue 4), we can place this information first:
   - Column 1: Rabbit
   - Column 2: Ambient

2. Let's consider the other clues in relation to this:
   - The person who woodworking is to the right of the fan of blues (Clue 1).
   - The Italian is not to the right of the person watching animation movies (Clue 2).
   - The Italian is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle (Clue 3).

3. Given that the Italian cannot be to the right of the animation movie fan, and considering Clue 1, we need to place woodworking and blues such that woodworking is to the right of blues. This leaves us with:
   - Column 1: Blues
   - Column 2: Woodworking

4. Now, since the Italian must be on the left or right of the turtle owner (Clue 3) and cannot be to the right of the animation movie fan (Clue 2), we need to place the Italian and the turtle appropriately. Since the animation movie fan is not next to the Italian, and the woodworking person is already in Column 2, the Italian must be in Column 1, and the turtle in Column 2:
   - Column 1: Italian
   - Column 2: Turtle

5. Finally, the remaining slots for movie genre and nationality:
   - Column 1: Animation
   - Column 2: Thriller

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |
| Hobby         | Cooking  | Woodworking |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation| Thriller    |
| Music-Genre   | Blues    | Ambient     |
| Nationality   | Italian  | Japanese    |
| Pet           | Rabbit   | Turtle      |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv8-5x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze and place each piece of information step-by-step.

Given constraints:
1. The Polish person is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
2. The person watching sports movies is not to the right of the fan of soul.
3. The person whose sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies.

We have the following categories and items:
- **Beverage**: Almond milk, Hot chocolate
- **Movie-Genre**: Musical, Sports
- **Music-Genre**: R&B, Soul
- **Nationality**: Mexican, Polish
- **Sport**: Skiing, Volleyball

Let's denote the positions as follows:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      |     B1        |    B2       |
| Movie-Genre   |     M1        |    M2       |
| Music-Genre   |     MG1       |    MG2      |
| Nationality   |     N1        |    N2       |
| Sport         |     S1        |    S2       |
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Constraint 1: Polish is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
- This means if someone in position 1 drinks hot-chocolate, then the Polish person must be in position 2.
- If no one in position 1 drinks hot-chocolate, then the Polish person can only be in position 2.

#### Constraint 2: Person watching sports movies is not to the right of the fan of soul.
- This means if someone watches sports movies (M2 = Sports), then they cannot be in position 2 if the person who listens to soul (MG2 = Soul) is in position 2.
- So, if M2 = Sports, then MG2 ≠ Soul.

#### Constraint 3: Person whose sport is skiing is to the right of the person watching musical movies.
- This means if someone's sport is skiing (S2 = Skiing), then the person watching musical movies (M2 = Musical) cannot be in position 2.
- So, if S2 = Skiing, then M2 ≠ Musical.

Now let's try to fit all these constraints into the table.

### Initial Assumptions:
1. Let's assume the Polish person is in position 2 (N2 = Polish). This means the person in position 1 cannot drink hot-chocolate.
2. Let's assume the person in position 1 drinks almond milk (B1 = Almond milk).
3. Let's assume the person in position 1 watches musical movies (M1 = Musical).
4. Let's assume the person in position 1 listens to R&B (MG1 = R&B).

This gives us:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond milk   |    ?        |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical       |    ?        |
| Music-Genre   | R&B           |    ?        |
| Nationality   | Mexican       |    Polish   |
| Sport         | ?             |    ?        |
```

From constraint 2, since M1 = Musical, M2 cannot be Sports. So, M2 must be Musical.

From constraint 3, since S2 is not specified yet, we need to ensure it does not conflict with M2 being Musical.

Since the Polish person is in position 2, the person in position 1 cannot drink hot-chocolate. Therefore, the person in position 2 must drink hot-chocolate (B2 = Hot chocolate).

Now, the person in position 1 watches musical movies (M1 = Musical), so the person in position 2 cannot watch sports movies (M2 = Musical).

Since the person in position 1 listens to R&B (MG1 = R&B), the person in position 2 must listen to Soul (MG2 = Soul).

Finally, the sport for the person in position 1 is not specified yet, but the sport for the person in position 2 must be Skiing (S2 = Skiing) to satisfy constraint 3.

This gives us:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond milk   | Hot chocolate|
| Movie-Genre   | Musical       | Musical     |
| Music-Genre   | R&B           | Soul        |
| Nationality   | Mexican       | Polish      |
| Sport         | Volleyball    | Skiing      |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond milk   | Hot chocolate|
| Movie-Genre   | Musical       | Musical     |
| Music-Genre   | R&B           | Soul        |
| Nationality   | Mexican       | Polish      |
| Sport         | Volleyball    | Skiing      |

4. **The owner of the hedgehog is on the far right.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4:** The owner of the hedgehog is on the far right.
   - This means the hedgehog is in position 2 for both Food and Pet columns.

   |               |     1      |      2      |
   | Food          |            | lemon      |

   - This means the Spanish cannot be in position 2 if the fan of electronic is in position 1 for the Nationality column.

4. **Clue 2:** The fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is hiking.
   - This means the fan of blues must be in position 2 for the Music-Genre column if the hobby is hiking in position 1 for the Hobby column.

Let's now determine the remaining details:

- Since the Spanish cannot be in position 2 for the Nationality column (Clue 1), they must be in position 1 for the Nationality column.
- The fan of electronic cannot be in position 1 for the Nationality column because the Spanish is there. So, the fan of electronic must be in position 2 for the Nationality column.

   |               |     1      |      2      |

Lv8-5x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's go through the clues step by step.

### Clues:
1. The American is not the person watching western movies.
2. The person eating banana is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies.
3. The freelancer is on the left of the fan of gospel.
4. The person eating blueberry is not to the right of the scientist.

### Initial Setup:
Let's start by setting up the table with placeholders:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Food          |            |           |

| Music-Genre   |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |           |
```

### Analyzing Clues:

#### Clue 1: The American is not the person watching western movies.
- This means the American could be in either position 1 or 2 for any category, but not for the movie genre ""western"".

#### Clue 2: The person eating banana is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies.
- This implies that if someone is eating banana, they must be in position 1, and the person watching western movies must be in position 2.

#### Clue 3: The freelancer is on the left of the fan of gospel.
- This means the freelancer must be in position 1, and the fan of gospel must be in position 2 for the job and music genre categories.

#### Clue 4: The person eating blueberry is not to the right of the scientist.
- This means if someone is eating blueberry, they must be in position 1, and the scientist cannot be in position 2.

### Placing Information:

1. **Food Category:**
   - From Clue 2, the person eating banana must be in position 1, and the person watching western movies must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, Position 1 (Food) = Banana, Position 2 (Food) = Blueberry.

2. **Job Category:**
   - From Clue 3, the freelancer must be in position 1, and the fan of gospel must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, Position 1 (Job) = Freelancer, Position 2 (Job) = Fan of Gospel.

3. **Movie-Genre Category:**
   - From Clue 2, the person watching western movies must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, Position 2 (Movie-Genre) = Western.
   - The American cannot be in position 2 for movie genre, so they must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, Position 1 (Movie-Genre) = American (not Western).

4. **Music-Genre Category:**
   - From Clue 3, the fan of gospel must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, Position 2 (Music-Genre) = Gospel.
   - The person eating blueberry must be in position 1 (from Clue 4).
   - Therefore, Position 1 (Music-Genre) = Scientist (since the scientist cannot be in position 2 and the freelancer is already in position 1 for job).

5. **Nationality Category:**
   - From Clue 1, the American cannot be in position 2 for movie genre.
   - Since the American is in position 1 for movie genre, they must be in position 1 for nationality as well.
   - Therefore, Position 1 (Nationality) = American.
   - The British must be in position 2 for nationality.
   - Therefore, Position 2 (Nationality) = British.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Food          | Banana    | Blueberry |

| Movie-Genre   | American  | Western   |
| Music-Genre   | Scientist| Gospel    |

Lv8-5x2-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking milk is on the right of the Russian.
2. The person watching thriller movies is the Russian.
3. The fan of punk is not to the right of the Egyptian.
4. The person watching thriller movies is not to the left of the fan of rock.
5. The person watching disaster movies is the videographer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Russian and their beverage preference
- From clue 2, the Russian watches thriller movies.
- From clue 1, the person drinking milk is on the right of the Russian.

This means the Russian cannot be in position 2 (since there would be no one to the right), so the Russian must be in position 1.

- **Position 1: Russian**
- **Position 2: (Someone else)**

Since the Russian drinks milk (clue 1), the person in position 2 must drink cola.

#### Step 2: Determine the job and movie genre of the Russian
- From clue 2, the Russian watches thriller movies.

So, we can fill in the Russian's row as follows:
- **Beverage**: Milk
- **Job**: (Not yet determined)
- **Movie-Genre**: Thriller

#### Step 3: Determine the job and movie genre of the other person
- Since the Russian is in position 1, the other person must be in position 2.
- From clue 5, the person watching disaster movies is the videographer.
- Therefore, the person in position 2 cannot be the videographer.

From clue 4, the person watching thriller movies (Russian) is not to the left of the fan of rock. This confirms that the person in position 2 does not watch thriller movies.

So, the person in position 2 must watch disaster movies and be the videographer.

- **Position 2: Videographer**
- **Beverage**: Cola
- **Job**: Videographer
- **Movie-Genre**: Disaster

#### Step 4: Determine the nationality and music genre for each person
- From clue 3, the fan of punk is not to the right of the Egyptian.
- Since the Russian is in position 1 and the videographer is in position 2, the Egyptian cannot be in position 2 (videographer).

Thus, the Egyptian must be in position 1, and the Russian must be in position 2.

- **Nationality**:
  - Position 1: Egyptian
  - Position 2: Russian

- **Music-Genre**:
  - Since the Russian is in position 2 and the videographer is in position 2, the Russian cannot like rock music.
  - Therefore, the Russian must like punk music.
  - The videographer must like rock music (since the Russian is in position 2 and the videographer is in position 2).

So, we have:
- **Position 1: Egyptian**
  - **Beverage**: Cola
  - **Job**: (Not yet determined)
  - **Movie-Genre**: (Not yet determined)
  - **Music-Genre**: Punk

- **Position 2: Russian**
  - **Beverage**: Milk
  - **Job**: Electrician (since the videographer is the only job left)
  - **Movie-Genre**: Thriller
  - **Music-Genre**: Punk

However, this contradicts clue 3. Therefore, the Egyptian must like rock music, and the Russian must like punk music.

Lv8-5x2-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues:
1. The person drinking juice is on the left of the person watching musical movies.
2. The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person eating cherry.
3. The fan of electronic is somewhere to the right of the software-developer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The person drinking juice (J) is on the left of the person watching musical movies (M).

This gives us:
```
J - M
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The person watching musical movies (M) is not to the right of the person eating cherry (C).

This means that the person eating cherry (C) must be either directly to the left or in the same position as the person watching musical movies (M). So, we have two possibilities:
1. C - M
2. C - J - M

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The fan of electronic (E) is somewhere to the right of the software-developer (S).

This gives us:
```
S - E
```

### Combining All Clues:
Let's combine all the information to find a consistent arrangement.

From Clue 1, we have:
```
J - M
```

From Clue 2, we have two possibilities for the positions of C, M, and J:
1. C - M - J
2. C - J - M

From Clue 3, we have:
```
S - E
```

We need to fit these together. Let's test the possible arrangements:

#### Possible Arrangement 1: C - M - J
If C - M - J, then S and E must fit into the remaining positions:
- S - E - C - M - J

This fits all the clues:
- J - M (Clue 1)
- C - M (Clue 2)
- S - E (Clue 3)

#### Possible Arrangement 2: C - J - M
If C - J - M, then S and E must fit into the remaining positions:
- S - E - C - J - M

This does not fit Clue 2 because the person watching musical movies (M) would be to the right of the person eating cherry (C), which contradicts Clue 2.

Thus, the only valid arrangement is:
```
S - E - C - M - J
```

Lv8-5x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and systematically place the information into the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of soul is the person eating pineapple.
2. **Clue 2:** The fan of reggae is on the right of the person watching action movies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
4. **Clue 4:** The fan of soul is not to the left of the person driving the van.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Assign Food Preferences
- From Clue 1: The fan of soul is the person eating pineapple.
- Therefore, the fan of reggae must be eating broccoli (since there are only two types of food).

|               |     1     |     2      |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Food          | Broccoli  | Pineapple  |
| Hobby         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae    | Soul       |
| Transport     |           |            |

#### Step 2: Assign Movie Genres
- From Clue 2: The fan of reggae is on the right of the person watching action movies.
- This implies that the person in position 2 watches action movies.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Food          | Broccoli  | Pineapple  |

| Music-Genre   | Reggae    | Soul       |
| Transport     |           |            |

#### Step 3: Assign Hobbies
- From Clue 3: The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
- From Clue 4: The fan of soul is not to the left of the person driving the van.
- Since the fan of soul is in position 2, the person driving the van must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the person with card-games as a hobby must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Food          | Broccoli  | Pineapple  |
| Hobby         | Card-Games| Gardening  |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports    | Action     |
