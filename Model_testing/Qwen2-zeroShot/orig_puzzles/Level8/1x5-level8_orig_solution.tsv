Lv8-1x5-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the transports in their respective positions.

### Clue Analysis:
1. The person driving the subway is on the right of the person driving the van.
   - This implies: V (van) < S (subway).

2. The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person driving the trike.
   - This implies: T (trike) ↔ R (tram).

3. The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person driving the tram.
   - This implies: R (tram) ↔ T (trike). This is consistent with clue 2.

4. The person driving the subway is somewhere between the person driving the tram and the person driving the bike.
   - This implies: R (tram) < S (subway) < B (bike).

5. The person driving the tram is not to the left of the person driving the bike.
   - This implies: B (bike) > R (tram).

6. The person driving the tram is not to the left of the person driving the van.
   - This implies: V (van) > R (tram).

7. The person driving the tram is between the person driving the subway and the person driving the trike.
   - This implies: T (trike) < R (tram) < S (subway).

### Combining Clues:
- From clues 1, 6, and 7: V (van) < R (tram) < S (subway).
- From clues 2, 3, and 7: T (trike) ↔ R (tram), so T (trike) must be next to R (tram).
- From clues 4 and 5: B (bike) > R (tram) and R (tram) < S (subway), thus B (bike) must be either 2nd or 3rd, and S (subway) must be 4th or 5th.

Given these constraints, we can deduce the following order:

1. V (van)
2. T (trike) / R (tram)
3. R (tram) / T (trike)
4. S (subway)
5. B (bike)

Since T (trike) and R (tram) are interchangeable in positions 2 and 3, but R (tram) must be between V (van) and S (subway), and B (bike) must be after R (tram):

1. V (van)
2. T (trike)
3. R (tram)
4. S (subway)
5. B (bike)

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |  1   |  2  |   3    |  4   |   5   |
| Transport   | Van  | Trike| Tram   | Subway| Bike  |

Lv8-1x5-2	"Let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step to determine the correct order of hobbies:

1. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
2. The person who's hobby is traveling is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
3. The person who's hobby is traveling is not to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
4. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (this is redundant and can be ignored).
5. The person who's hobby is traveling is between the person who's hobby is singing and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
6. The person who's hobby is traveling is in the middle.
7. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography.

From condition 6, we know that the person with the hobby of traveling is in position 3 (the middle).

From condition 5, since traveling is in the middle (position 3), and it must be between singing and magic-tricks, we can deduce:
- Singing must be either in position 1 or 2.
- Magic-tricks must be either in position 4 or 5.

From condition 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is on the left of the person with the hobby of magic-tricks. This means:
- Sudoku cannot be in position 4 or 5 because magic-tricks would then be to its right, which contradicts condition 1.
- Therefore, Sudoku must be in position 1 or 2.

From condition 3, traveling (in position 3) is not to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku. This means:
- Sudoku cannot be in position 2 (since traveling is in position 3 and would be to the left of it if Sudoku were in position 2).

So, Sudoku must be in position 1, and we now have:
1. Sudoku
2. ?
3. Traveling
4. ?
5. ?

From condition 2, traveling is not to the left of the person with the hobby of magic-tricks. Since traveling is in position 3, magic-tricks must be in position 4 or 5. Given that magic-tricks must be to the right of Sudoku (condition 1), and since traveling is in the middle, magic-tricks must be in position 4.

Therefore, we have:
1. Sudoku
2. ?
3. Traveling
4. Magic-tricks
5. ?

From condition 7, the person with the hobby of singing is on the left or right of the person with the hobby of photography. Since singing must be to the left of magic-tricks (condition 5), and magic-tricks is in position 4, singing must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is already occupied by Sudoku, so singing must be in position 2.

Finally, the only remaining hobby for position 5 is photography.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
1. Sudoku
2. Singing
3. Traveling
4. Magic-tricks
5. Photography

Here is the final solution table:

```
|         |   1    |      2       |     3     |    4    |      5      |

Lv8-1x5-3	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The fan of house is somewhere to the left of the fan of techno.
2. The fan of pop is between the fan of hip-hop and the fan of house.
3. The fan of hip-hop is somewhere between the fan of ambient and the fan of techno.
4. The fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the fan of house.
5. The fan of techno is not to the left of the fan of house.

### Analysis:

#### Clue 1:
- House must be to the left of Techno.

#### Clue 2:
- Pop is between Hip-hop and House.
- This means the order could be Hip-hop, Pop, House or House, Pop, Hip-hop.

#### Clue 3:
- Hip-hop is between Ambient and Techno.
- This means the order could be Ambient, Hip-hop, Techno or Techno, Hip-hop, Ambient.

#### Clue 4:
- Pop is to the left of House.
- Combining this with Clue 2, we can have two possible orders for Hip-hop, Pop, House: 
  - Hip-hop, Pop, House
  - House, Pop, Hip-hop (but this contradicts Clue 4)

So, the only valid order from Clues 2 and 4 is: **Hip-hop, Pop, House**

#### Clue 5:
- Techno is not to the left of House.
- Since House is the third position and Techno cannot be to the left of House, Techno must be in the fourth or fifth position.

### Combining all clues:
1. House (3rd) is to the left of Techno.
2. Hip-hop, Pop, House (Clue 2).
3. Hip-hop is between Ambient and Techno (Clue 3).
4. Techno is not to the left of House (Clue 5).

From these, we deduce:
- Hip-hop must be before Pop and House.
- Techno must be after House.
- Ambient must be before Hip-hop.

Thus, the only possible order is:
1. Ambient
2. Hip-hop
3. Pop
4. House
5. Techno

Lv8-1x5-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the beverages accordingly.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person drinking 7up is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the person drinking sprite.**
   - This means the order must be something like: Tea, 7up, Sprite or Sprite, 7up, Tea.
   
2. **The person drinking cola is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up.**
   - This means 7up cannot be in position 5, as there would be no room for cola to the right of it.

3. **The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade.**
   - This means the order must be: Lemonade, Sprite or Lemonade, Sprite, (something else).

4. **The person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade.**
   - This means 7up cannot be in positions 4 or 5 because lemonade would have to be to its left.

5. **The person drinking cola is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade.**
   - This means cola cannot be in positions 4 or 5 if lemonade is in position 3 or 2 respectively.

6. **The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.**
   - This means cola must be in a position to the left of lemonade.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clues 1 and 4, 7up can only be in positions 1 or 2.
2. Since 7up cannot be in position 5 (clue 2), it must be in positions 1 or 2.
3. From clue 3, sprite must be to the right of lemonade.
4. From clue 5, cola cannot be to the right of lemonade, so cola must be to the left of lemonade.
5. From clue 6, cola is to the left of lemonade.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the beverages:

- If 7up is in position 1:
  - The possible order could be: Tea, 7up, Sprite, Cola, Lemonade.
  - This satisfies all the conditions:
    - 7up is between tea and sprite.
    - Cola is to the right of 7up.
    - Sprite is to the right of lemonade.
    - 7up is not to the right of lemonade.
    - Cola is not to the right of lemonade.
    - Cola is to the left of lemonade.

Let's verify this arrangement:

|            |  1  |  2  |  3   |    4     |   5    |
|------------|-----|-----|------|----------|--------|
| Beverage   | Tea | 7up | Sprite| Cola     | Lemonade|

This fits all the given clues. Therefore, the final solution is:

```
|            |  1  |  2  |  3   |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage   | Tea | 7up | Sprite| Cola     | Lemonade|

Lv8-1x5-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and use the given clues to determine the correct order of movie genres.

### Clues:
1. The person watching satire movies is on the far right.
2. The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies.
3. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching romance movies.
4. The person watching scientific movies is not to the left of the person watching mystery movies.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: Satire is on the far right (position 5).
   - This means the last column is ""satire"".
   - |               |    1    |    2    |     3      |    4    |   5    |
   - | Movie-Genre   |         |         |            |         | satire |

2. **Clue 2**: The person watching satire is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies.
   - Since satire is on the far right, the person watching musical movies must be either in position 1 or 4.
   - Let's consider both possibilities.

3. **Clue 3**: The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching romance movies.
   - This means we have a sequence like: [Scientific, Mystery, Romance] or [Romance, Mystery, Scientific].

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching scientific movies is not to the left of the person watching mystery movies.
   - This means the sequence must be [Scientific, Mystery, Romance] because if it were [Romance, Mystery, Scientific], scientific would be to the left of mystery, which contradicts clue 4.

### Combining Clues:

- From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we can deduce that the sequence must be: [Scientific, Mystery, Romance].
- We need to fit this into the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4) with musical and satire.

Given that:
- Satire is in position 5.
- Musical is either in position 1 or 4.
- Scientific is in position 1 (since it needs to be to the left of mystery).

So, let's place these:
- Position 1: Scientific
- Position 4: Musical (since it cannot be in position 1 due to the sequence constraint)
- Position 2: Mystery
- Position 3: Romance

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- |               |    1    |    2    |     3      |    4    |   5    |
- | Movie-Genre   | scientific| mystery | romance | musical | satire |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |    2    |     3      |    4    |   5    |
| Movie-Genre   | scientific| mystery | romance | musical | satire |

Lv8-1x5-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The owner of the horse is not to the left of the owner of the turtle.**
   - This means the owner of the turtle must be to the right of the owner of the horse.

2. **The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.**
   - This means the owner of the mouse can be next to the owner of the horse (either to the left or right).

3. **The owner of the horse is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse.**
   - This means the owner of the mouse cannot be to the right of the owner of the horse; hence, the owner of the mouse must be to the left of the owner of the horse.

4. **The owner of the horse is not to the left of the owner of the turtle.**
   - This reiterates that the owner of the turtle must be to the right of the owner of the horse.

5. **The owner of the guinea-pig is between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the horse.**
   - This means the order involving these three pets is: Lizard, Guinea-Pig, Horse or Horse, Guinea-Pig, Lizard.

6. **The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.**
   - This means the order involving these two pets is: Guinea-Pig, Lizard.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 3, we know the owner of the mouse must be to the left of the owner of the horse.
2. From clue 1 and 4, the owner of the turtle must be to the right of the owner of the horse.
3. Combining clues 5 and 6, the order involving the guinea-pig, lizard, and horse is: Guinea-Pig, Lizard, Horse.

Given the above, let's place the pets in the slots:

- The owner of the mouse must be to the left of the owner of the horse.
- The owner of the guinea-pig is between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the horse.
- The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
- The owner of the horse is to the left of the owner of the turtle.

Considering all these constraints, one possible arrangement is:

Lv8-1x5-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the beverages accordingly. Let's break down the clues one by one:

1. **The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
   - This means they cannot be adjacent.

2. **The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.**
   - This means they also cannot be adjacent.

3. **The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade.**
   - This is redundant as it just reiterates that lemonade cannot be to the right of itself.

4. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right.**
   - So, hot-chocolate must be in position 1 or 5.

5. **The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.**
   - This means if A is in position X, L must be in position Y where X < Y.

6. **The person drinking fanta is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade.**
   - This means if F is in position X, L must be in position Y where X > Y.

Let's start placing the beverages based on these clues:

- Since hot-chocolate can only be in position 1 or 5 (clue 4), let's assume:
  - Hot-chocolate is in position 1.
  - This leaves positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 for the other beverages.

- Since almond-milk must be on the left or right of hot-chocolate (clue 1) and it must be to the left of lemonade (clue 5), almond-milk cannot be in position 5. Therefore, it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

- Lemonade must be to the right of almond-milk (clue 5), so it can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

- Fanta must be on the left or right of lemonade (clue 2) and not to the left of lemonade (clue 6). This means fanta must be in position 4 or 5 if lemonade is in position 3 or 4, respectively.

Let's test with hot-chocolate in position 1:

1. Hot-chocolate
2. Almond-milk
3. Lemonade
4. Fanta
5. Sprite

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 1: Almond-milk (2) is to the right of hot-chocolate (1).
- Clue 2: Fanta (4) is to the right of lemonade (3).
- Clue 5: Almond-milk (2) is to the left of lemonade (3).
- Clue 6: Fanta (4) is not to the left of lemonade (3).

Thus, the correct arrangement is:

Lv8-1x5-8	"Let's analyze and solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of funk.**
   - This means if someone likes funk, the person who likes hip-hop must be to their right.

2. **The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues.**
   - This means the fan of blues cannot be in positions 4 or 5 because hip-hop is in position 4 (clue 5).

3. **The fan of house is not to the left of the fan of hip-hop.**
   - This means house cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 if hip-hop is in position 4 or 5.

4. **The fan of funk is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.**
   - This means jazz cannot be in positions 1 or 5 if funk is in positions 1 or 5.

5. **The fan of house is on the right of the fan of hip-hop.**
   - Since hip-hop is in position 4, house must be in position 5.

6. **The fan of hip-hop is in an even position.**
   - This means hip-hop can only be in position 2 or 4.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Hip-hop must be in an even position (2 or 4).**
   - From clue 5, we know that house must be in position 5.
   - If hip-hop were in position 2, funk would need to be in position 1 (from clue 1), but this would violate clue 3 since house cannot be to the left of hip-hop.
   - Therefore, hip-hop must be in position 4.

2. **Hip-hop in position 4:**
   - Funk can be in position 1, 2, or 3 (from clue 1).
   - Blues cannot be in position 4 or 5 (from clue 2).

3. **House in position 5:**
   - House cannot be to the left of hip-hop (clue 3), so it fits perfectly.

4. **Funk and jazz placement:**
   - Funk can be in position 1 or 2 (since it cannot be in position 5).
   - Jazz can be in position 3 or 5 (but 5 is taken by house).
   - Therefore, funk must be in position 1 and jazz in position 3 (to satisfy clue 4).

5. **Blues placement:**
   - Blues cannot be in position 4 (hip-hop) or 5 (house).
   - Blues can be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - Since funk is in position 1, blues must be in position 2.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person eating potato is between the person eating cranberry and the person eating onion.**
   - This means the order must be: Cranberry, Potato, Onion.
   
2. **The person eating zucchini is on the right of the person eating eggplant.**
   - This means if Eggplant is at position \(x\), Zucchini must be at position \(x+1\) or higher.
   
3. **The person eating eggplant is not to the left of the person eating onion.**
   - This means Eggplant cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since Onion is after it).
   
4. **The person eating cranberry is not to the right of the person eating onion.**
   - Since the order is Cranberry, Potato, Onion, Cranberry cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
   
5. **The person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini.**
   - This means Eggplant and Zucchini are adjacent or Eggplant is to the right of Zucchini.
   
6. **The person eating onion is on the right of the person eating potato.**
   - This is already covered by the first clue since Potato is between Cranberry and Onion.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 1, we have the sequence: **Cranberry, Potato, Onion**.
2. From Clue 4, Cranberry cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so it can only be in positions 1 or 2.
3. From Clue 2, Eggplant must be before Zucchini.
4. From Clue 3, Eggplant cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
5. From Clue 5, Eggplant and Zucchini must be adjacent or Eggplant is to the right of Zucchini.

Let's test possible positions for Cranberry:

- If Cranberry is in position 1:
  - Potato must be in position 2.
  - Onion must be in position 3.
  - This leaves positions 4 and 5 for Eggplant and Zucchini.
  - Since Eggplant cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3, it must be in position 4.
  - Zucchini must be in position 5.

This fits all the clues:
- Cranberry (1)
- Potato (2)
- Onion (3)
- Eggplant (4)
- Zucchini (5)
