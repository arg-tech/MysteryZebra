   - This means the person in position (1, 2) drinks almond-milk.

2. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is collecting is not to the left of the fan of trance.
   - This means the fan of trance cannot be in position (1, 1) if the person with the hobby of collecting is in position (1, 1).

3. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the fan of trance.
   - This means the fan of trance cannot be in position (1, 1) if the person with the sport of rugby is in position (1, 1).

   - This means the person watching fantasy movies must be in position (1, 1) and the person with the sport of rugby must be in position (1, 2) or (2, 2).

6. **Clue 2:** The fan of trance is somewhere to the right of the person eating orange.
   - This means the person eating orange cannot be in position (1, 2), as the fan of trance would then be directly to the right of them.

1. The nurse is not to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
2. The teacher is not to the left of the person who's hobby is writing.
3. The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing.
4. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person eating grapefruit.
5. The nurse is not to the left of the fan of trance.
6. The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the order of Hobbies
From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we know:
- The teacher is not to the left of the person who's hobby is writing.
- The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing.

This implies that the person with the hobby of writing cannot be the first one, and the person with the ferret must be next to them.

#### Step 2: Determine the order of Jobs
From Clue 1, we know:
- The nurse is not to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.

This means the nurse cannot be in position 1 if the person with the hobby of skydiving is in position 2.

#### Step 3: Determine the order of Transport
From Clue 4, we know:
- The person driving the ship is on the right of the person eating grapefruit.

This means the person eating grapefruit cannot be in position 2, and the person driving the ship must be in position 2.

#### Step 4: Determine the order of Food
From Clue 6, we know:
- The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret.

This means the person eating zucchini must be adjacent to the owner of the ferret.

#### Step 5: Determine the order of Music-Genre
From Clue 5, we know:
- The nurse is not to the left of the fan of trance.

This means the nurse cannot be in position 1 if the person who likes trance is in position 2.

### Final Placement:

Given the constraints, let's place the elements step-by-step:

1. **Transport**: The person driving the ship (position 2) is on the right of the person eating grapefruit (position 1).
2. **Hobby**: The person with the hobby of writing (position 3) is next to the owner of the ferret (position 2 or 4). Since the ship is in position 2, the ferret must be in position 3.
3. **Job**: The teacher (position 4) is not to the left of the person with the hobby of writing (position 3), so the teacher is in position 4.
4. **Food**: The person eating zucchini (position 5) is next to the owner of the ferret (position 3), so the zucchini eater is in position 5.
5. **Music-Genre**: The nurse (position 6) is not to the left of the fan of trance, so the nurse is in position 6, and the fan of trance is in position 1.
6. **Remaining**: The only remaining positions for the nurse and the fan of trance are as follows.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |    2     |   3    |   4    |   5    |   6    |

Lv8-6x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to place each item in the correct column and row based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the positions step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is baking is not to the left of the owner of the goat.
2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the goat is somewhere to the left of the person eating radish.
3. **Clue 3:** The fan of soul is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is baking.
4. **Clue 4:** The person eating radish is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
5. **Clue 5:** The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person watching crime movies.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 2 & Clue 3:
- From Clue 2, the goat owner must be in a position to the left of the person eating radish.
- From Clue 3, the fan of soul must be in a position to the left of the person whose hobby is baking.

This means that if the goat owner is in column 1, then the person whose hobby is baking cannot be in column 1. Also, the fan of soul cannot be in column 1 either.

#### Clue 1:
- If the person whose hobby is baking is not to the left of the goat owner, and the goat owner is in column 1, then the hobby of baking must be in column 2.

#### Clue 4:
- The person eating radish is to the right of the person drinking hot chocolate. This means hot chocolate must be in a column to the left of radish.

#### Clue 5:
- Adventure movies are to the right of crime movies. So, if adventure is in column 2, crime must be in column 1 for the same row.

### Final Placement:

Let's start placing items based on these deductions:

1. **Baking** (Hobby) must be in column 2 because of Clue 1.
2. **Goat** (Pet) must be in column 1 because it has to be to the left of the person eating radish (Clue 2).
3. **Soul** (Music Genre) must be in column 1 because it has to be to the left of the person whose hobby is baking (Clue 3).
4. **Radish** (Food) must be in column 2 because it is to the right of the person drinking hot chocolate (Clue 4).
5. **Adventure** (Movie Genre) must be in column 2 because it is to the right of crime (Clue 5).

Given these placements, we can fill in the rest of the table:

Lv8-6x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each category (Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport, and Transport) into the two columns based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step by step:

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The librarian is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues.
2. The fan of punk is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.
3. The fan of punk is not to the left of the person driving the taxi.
4. The person whose sport is cycling is on the left of the person whose sport is soccer.
5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Placing the Chinchilla Owner
From clue 5, the owner of the chinchilla is on the far right. Therefore:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   |           |             |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |
| Pet           |           | chinchilla  |
| Sport         |           |             |
| Transport     |           |             |
```

#### Step 2: Placing the Librarian and Fan of Blues
From clue 1, the librarian is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues. This means the librarian cannot be in column 2 and the fan of blues must be to the right of the librarian. Since the chinchilla is in column 2, the librarian cannot be there. Therefore, the librarian must be in column 1 and the fan of blues in column 2. However, we don't know which one is the librarian yet.

#### Step 3: Placing the Fan of Punk and Zombie Movies
From clue 2, the fan of punk is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies. From clue 3, the fan of punk is not to the left of the person driving the taxi. Since the chinchilla is in column 2, the fan of punk must be in column 1 and the person watching zombie movies in column 2. The person driving the taxi can only be in column 1 or 2, but since the fan of punk is in column 1 and the person watching zombie movies is in column 2, the taxi driver must be in column 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   |           | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |
| Pet           |           | chinchilla  |
| Sport         |           |             |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

#### Step 4: Placing the Cycling and Soccer
From clue 4, the person whose sport is cycling is on the left of the person whose sport is soccer. Since the taxi is in column 1, the person with cycling must be in column 1 and the person with soccer in column 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   |           | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |
| Pet           |           | chinchilla  |
| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

#### Step 5: Placing the Librarian and Fan of Blues
We know that the librarian is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues. Since the librarian cannot be in column 2, and the fan of blues must be to the right of the librarian, the librarian must be in column 1 and the fan of blues in column 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           | librarian |             |
| Movie-Genre   |           | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |
| Pet           |           | chinchilla  |
| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

#### Step 6: Placing the Blues and Punk
The fan of punk is to the left of the person watching zombie movies, so the fan of punk must be in column 1 and the person watching zombie movies in column 2. The fan of blues must be in column 2 because the librarian is in column 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           | librarian |             |
| Movie-Genre   |           | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   | blues     | punk        |
| Pet           |           | chinchilla  |
| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

#### Step 7: Placing the Disaster and Zombie Movies
Since the person watching zombie movies is in column 2, the movie genre for the librarian must be disaster.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           | librarian |             |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   | blues     | punk        |
| Pet           |           | chinchilla  |
| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

#### Step 8: Placing the Firefighter and Librarian
The librarian is the only job left for column 1, so the librarian must be the firefighter.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           | firefighter |             |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   | blues     | punk        |
| Pet           |           | chinchilla  |
| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

#### Step 9: Placing the Firefighter's Music Genre
The firefighter cannot have blues or punk as their music genre, so the firefighter must have disaster or zombie. Since the librarian has disaster, the firefighter must have zombie.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           | firefighter |             |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   | zombie    | punk        |
| Pet           |           | chinchilla  |
| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

#### Step 10: Placing the Librarian's Music Genre
The librarian must have blues.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           | firefighter |             |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   | blues     | punk        |
| Pet           |           | chinchilla  |
| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

#### Step 11: Placing the Librarian's Pet
The librarian must have the cat.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           | firefighter |             |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   | blues     | punk        |
| Pet           | cat       | chinchilla  |
| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

#### Step 12: Placing the Librarian's Transport
The librarian must have the taxi.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           | firefighter |             |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   | blues     | punk        |
| Pet           | cat       | chinchilla  |
| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Job           | firefighter |             |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  | zombie      |
| Music-Genre   | blues     | punk        |

| Sport         | cycling   | soccer      |
| Transport     | taxi      |             |

Lv8-6x2-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given constraints.

### Constraints Recap:
1. The fan of pop is not to the right of the person driving the bike.
2. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
3. The fan of dubstep is not to the right of the person driving the boat.
4. The British is in an odd position (1 or 3).
5. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person eating mango.
6. The person eating mango is not to the right of the fan of pop.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Constraint 4
Since the British person must be in an odd position, they can only be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2: Analyze Constraint 2 and 3
From Constraint 2, the person with the hobby of filmmaking must be to the left of the fan of dubstep.
From Constraint 3, the fan of dubstep cannot be to the right of the person driving the boat.

This implies that the person driving the boat cannot be in position 1 (since the fan of dubstep would then need to be in position 2, making it impossible for the fan of dubstep to be to the right of the person driving the boat).

So, the person driving the boat must be in position 3.

#### Step 3: Analyze Constraint 1
From Constraint 1, the fan of pop cannot be to the right of the person driving the bike. Since the person driving the boat is in position 3, the person driving the bike must be in position 1 (because the fan of pop cannot be in position 2 if the person driving the bike is in position 1).

So, the person driving the bike is in position 1, and the person driving the boat is in position 3.

#### Step 4: Analyze Constraint 6
From Constraint 6, the person eating mango cannot be to the right of the fan of pop. Given that the fan of pop cannot be in position 2 (since the person driving the bike is in position 1), the fan of pop must be in position 2.

Therefore, the person eating mango must be in position 1 (driving the bike) because they cannot be in position 2 (fan of pop).

#### Step 5: Analyze Constraint 5
From Constraint 5, the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person eating mango. Since the person eating mango is in position 1, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2 (the fan of pop).

#### Step 6: Assign Remaining Attributes
Now we need to assign the remaining attributes (beverages, food, hobbies, music-genre, nationality, and transport) based on the constraints.

- **Beverages**: Lemonade and Soy-milk
- **Food**: Lime and Mango
- **Hobbies**: Filmmaking and Reading
- **Music-Genres**: Dubstep and Pop
- **Nationalities**: British and Pakistani
- **Transport**: Bike and Boat

Given the positions:
1. Person 1: Eating mango, drinking lemonade, driving the bike, fan of pop, British
2. Person 2: Drinking soy-milk, eating lime, hobby of filmmaking, Pakistani, riding the boat

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | lemonade   | soy-milk  |
| Food          | lime       | mango     |
| Hobby         | filmmaking | reading   |
| Music-Genre   | pop        | dubstep   |
| Nationality   | British    | Pakistani |
| Transport     | bike       | boat      |

- From Clue 3, the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games.

This means that if someone has video-games as a hobby, they cannot be the one watching drama movies. 

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
- From Clue 2, the Indian is somewhere to the right of the fan of techno.
- From Clue 4, the fan of techno is somewhere to the left of the manager.

Combining these two clues, we can infer that the manager cannot be Indian because the Indian must be to the right of the fan of techno, who is to the left of the manager. Therefore, the manager cannot be Indian.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 5 and Clue 6
- From Clue 5, the engineer is not to the right of the person watching drama movies.
- From Clue 6, the person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the Mexican.

If the engineer is not to the right of the person watching drama movies, then the engineer must be on the left of the person watching drama movies (since the person watching drama movies is either to the left or right of the person with video-games as a hobby).

#### Step 4: Determine the Layout
Let's assume the layout is as follows:
- Person 1: [Food] [Hobby] [Job] [Movie-Genre] [Music-Genre] [Nationality]
- Person 2: [Food] [Hobby] [Job] [Movie-Genre] [Music-Genre] [Nationality]

From Clue 2, the Indian is to the right of the fan of techno, so:
- Person 2: Indian

From Clue 4, the fan of techno is to the left of the manager, so:
- Person 1: Fan of Techno
- Person 2: Manager

From Clue 5, the engineer is not to the right of the person watching drama movies, so:
- Person 1: Engineer

From Clue 3, the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games, so:
- Person 2: Video-Games
- Person 1: Drama

From Clue 1, the person eating lime is not the person watching drama movies, so:
- Person 1: Lime
- Person 2: Corn

From Clue 6, the person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the Mexican, so:
- Person 1: Epic
- Person 2: Techno

From Clue 2, the Indian is to the right of the fan of techno, so:
- Person 1: Indian
- Person 2: Mexican

Finally, from Clue 4, the fan of techno is to the left of the manager, so:
- Person 1: Techno
- Person 2: Epic

Lv8-6x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break down the clues one by one:

### Clue Breakdown:
1. **Chinese is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing**:
   - If Chinese is on the left, then the person who surfs is next to them.
   - If Chinese is on the right, then the person who surfs is next to them.

2. **Chinese is on the left or right of the Turkish**:
   - If Chinese is on the left, then the Turkish is next to them.
   - If Chinese is on the right, then the Turkish is next to them.

3. **The person eating peas is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing**:
   - The person who eats peas is next to the person who sails.

4. **The fan of trance is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies**:
   - The person who listens to trance is before the person who watches fantasy.

5. **The person eating peas is not to the right of the person drinking almond-milk**:
   - The person who eats peas is not next to the person who drinks almond-milk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1 and 2**: 
   - Since Chinese can be on either side of the surfer and also on either side of the Turkish, let's assume Chinese is on the left of both (it will be easier to test later if we need to change).

2. **Clue 3**:
   - The person eating peas must be on the right of the person who sails. So, we have:
     - Sailing -> Peas

3. **Clue 4**:
   - The fan of trance must be to the left of the person watching fantasy. So, we have:
     - Trance -> Fantasy

4. **Clue 5**:
   - The person eating peas cannot be next to the person drinking almond-milk. Given that we already have Sailing -> Peas, the person drinking almond-milk must be on the left of Sailing.

### Initial Setup:
Let's start with the assumption that Chinese is on the left of both the surfer and the Turkish. We'll fill in the table based on the above clues:

```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      |         |             |
| Food          |         |             |
| Movie-Genre   |         |             |
| Music-Genre   |         |             |
| Nationality   | Chinese | Turkish     |
| Sport         | Surfing | Sailing     |
```

Given that the person eating peas is on the right of the person who sails:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      |         |             |
| Food          | Peas    |             |
| Movie-Genre   |         |             |
| Music-Genre   |         |             |
| Nationality   | Chinese | Turkish     |
| Sport         | Surfing | Sailing     |
```

Now, given that the fan of trance is to the left of the person watching fantasy:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      |         |             |
| Food          | Peas    |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy |             |
| Music-Genre   | Trance  |             |
| Nationality   | Chinese | Turkish     |
| Sport         | Surfing | Sailing     |
```

Finally, the person eating peas cannot be next to the person drinking almond-milk. Given that we already have Peas in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1 for Beverage:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-Milk | Mirinda     |
| Food          | Peas    |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy |             |
| Music-Genre   | Trance  |             |
| Nationality   | Chinese | Turkish     |
| Sport         | Surfing | Sailing     |
```

We now need to place the remaining items:
- The remaining food item is spinach.
- The remaining movie genre is action.
- The remaining music genre is d&b.

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-Milk | Mirinda     |
| Food          | Peas    | Spinach     |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy | Action      |
| Music-Genre   | Trance  | D&B         |
| Nationality   | Chinese | Turkish     |
| Sport         | Surfing | Sailing     |

Lv8-6x2-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through the clues step by step:

### Clues:
1. The owner of the dog is not to the right of the fan of country.
2. The fan of d&b is not to the left of the owner of the dog.
3. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket.
4. The security-guard is on the left of the person drinking tea.
5. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the fan of country.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
The owner of the dog is not to the right of the fan of country. This means that if someone likes country, they cannot be directly to the right of the dog owner.

#### Clue 2:
The fan of d&b is not to the left of the owner of the dog. This means that the dog owner cannot be directly to the left of the d&b fan.

#### Clue 3:
The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. This means video-games must be in column 1, and cricket must be in column 2 for any pair involving these two.

#### Clue 4:
The security-guard is on the left of the person drinking tea. This means the security-guard must be in column 1, and the person drinking tea must be in column 2 for any pair involving these two.

#### Clue 5:
The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the fan of country. This means video-games must be in column 1, and the fan of country must be in column 2 for any pair involving these two.

### Analyzing the Clues:

From Clue 3 and Clue 5, we can deduce that video-games and country must be in the same order as Clue 3 and Clue 5 indicate, which is:
- Video-games (1)
- Country (2)

From Clue 4, the security-guard and tea must also be in the same order as Clue 4 indicates:
- Security-guard (1)
- Tea (2)

Now, let's place these in the table:

|               |       1        |    2    |
|-------------- |--------------- |-------- |
| Beverage     |                |         |
| Hobby        |                |         |
| Job          | Security-guard |    tea  |
| Music-Genre  |                |         |
| Pet          |                |         |
| Sport        |                |         |

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we know that the dog owner cannot be directly to the right of the fan of country, and the fan of d&b cannot be directly to the left of the dog owner. Given that video-games and country are already placed, the only remaining hobby that fits the criteria is reading, and the only remaining sport is cricket. Therefore, we can place these:

|               |       1        |    2    |
|-------------- |--------------- |-------- |
| Beverage     |                |         |

| Sport        | Cricket        |         |

From Clue 2, the fan of d&b cannot be directly to the left of the dog owner. Since video-games and country are already placed, the only remaining music genre is d&b, and the only remaining pet is fish. Therefore, we can place these:

|               |       1        |    2    |
|-------------- |--------------- |-------- |
| Beverage     |                |         |
| Hobby        | Video-games    |    read |
| Job          | Security-guard |    tea  |
| Music-Genre  | D&B            |         |
| Pet          | Fish           |         |
| Sport        | Cricket        |         |

Finally, the only remaining beverage is milk, and the only remaining sport is soccer. Therefore, we can place these:

|               |       1        |    2    |
|-------------- |--------------- |-------- |
| Beverage     | Milk           |         |
| Hobby        | Video-games    |    read |
| Job          | Security-guard |    tea  |

| Pet          | Fish           |         |
| Sport        | Cricket        | Soccer  |

Lv8-6x2-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The nurse is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
2. The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
3. The fan of disco is not to the right of the person watching satire movies.
4. The Australian is not to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
5. The person driving the ship is not to the left of the person driving the scooter.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The nurse is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
- This implies that the person watching satire movies must be on the left side (either position 1 or 2).

#### Clue 2: The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
- If the person with the hobby of cooking is on the left, then the person driving the ship must be on the right side.

#### Clue 3: The fan of disco is not to the right of the person watching satire movies.
- This means the person watching satire movies cannot be on the leftmost position if the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right.

#### Clue 4: The Australian is not to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
- This means the Australian cannot be on the left if the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right.

#### Clue 5: The person driving the ship is not to the left of the person driving the scooter.
- This means the person driving the ship must be to the right of the person driving the scooter.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the elements:

1. Since the nurse is on the right of the person watching satire movies, the person watching satire movies must be on the left.
2. The person with the hobby of cooking must be to the left of the person driving the ship.
3. The person driving the ship cannot be to the left of the person driving the scooter.

Let's try to place the elements:

- Position 1: Person watching satire movies (Nurse is on the right)
- Position 2: Person driving the ship (Cooking hobby is to the left)

This gives us:
```
|               |    1    |      2       |
| Hobby         | Cooking |            Ship|

| Nationality   |         |              |
| Transport     |         |              |
```

Now, let's place the rest:

- The person driving the scooter must be to the left of the person driving the ship.
- The Australian cannot be to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
- The fan of disco is not to the right of the person watching satire movies.

Since the person watching satire movies is already placed, and the person driving the ship is also placed, we need to fit the remaining elements:

- The person with the hobby of baking must be to the right of the person with the hobby of cooking.
- The person who prefers martial-arts movies must be to the right of the person who prefers satire movies.
- The person who prefers disco must be to the left of the person who prefers satire movies.

Given all these constraints, we can place the remaining elements as follows:

```
|               |    1    |      2       |
| Hobby         | Cooking | Baking       |
| Job           | Nurse   | Chef         |

| Music-Genre   | Disco   | Ambient      |
| Nationality   | Indian  | Australian   |
| Transport     | Ship    | Scooter      |
```

### Final Solution Table:
