Lv8-3x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the table step-by-step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
2. The person whose hobby is gardening is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.

### Initial Table Setup:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   |             |           |
| Transport     |             |           |
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
- This means the person watching documentary movies must be in position 2 (since if they were in position 1, the person in position 2 would be to their right, which would imply they are driving the helicopter).

So, we can place ""documentary"" in position 2 for Movie-Genre.

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   |             | documentary|
| Transport     |             |           |
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The person whose hobby is gardening is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
- Since the documentary movie watcher is in position 2, the gardening enthusiast must be in position 2 as well (to be on the right of the documentary watcher).

So, we can place ""gardening"" in position 2 for Hobby.

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |             | gardening |
| Movie-Genre   |             | documentary|
| Transport     |             |           |
```

#### Step 3: Determine Remaining Hobbies and Movie-Genres
- The only remaining hobby is skydiving, so it must be in position 1 for Hobby.
- The only remaining movie genre is zombie, so it must be in position 1 for Movie-Genre.

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         | skydiving   | gardening |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie      | documentary|
| Transport     |             |           |
```

#### Step 4: Determine Remaining Transport
- The only remaining transport is the helicopter, so it must be in position 2 for Transport.
- The only remaining transport is the quad-bike, so it must be in position 1 for Transport.

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         | skydiving   | gardening |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie      | documentary|
| Transport     | quad-bike   | helicopter|
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         | skydiving   | gardening |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie      | documentary|
| Transport     | quad-bike   | helicopter|

Lv8-3x2-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
- There are 2 different favorite beverages: **mirinda** and **water**
- There are 2 different nationalities: **american** and **spanish**
- The people use 2 different means of transport: **jet-ski** and **snowmobile**

### Clues:
1. The person drinking **mirinda** is in an even position.
2. The person driving the **jet-ski** is not to the right of the **american**.
3. The **american** is somewhere to the left of the person drinking **mirinda**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The person drinking **mirinda** is in an even position.
- This means the person drinking **mirinda** can only be in position 2 (since there are only two positions).

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |    ?     |  Mirinda   |
| Nationality   |    ?     |   ?        |
| Transport     |    ?     |   ?        |
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- The **american** is somewhere to the left of the person drinking **mirinda**.
- Since the person drinking **mirinda** is in position 2, the **american** must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | American |  Mirinda   |
| Nationality   |    ?     |   ?        |
| Transport     |    ?     |   ?        |
```

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
- The person driving the **jet-ski** is not to the right of the **american**.
- Since the **american** is in position 1, the person driving the **jet-ski** cannot be in position 2.

This leaves us with the possibility that the person in position 2 could be using either **mirinda** or **water**, but since position 2 already has **mirinda**, the person in position 2 must be using **water**.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | American |  Mirinda   |
| Nationality   |    ?     |   Water   |
| Transport     |    ?     |   ?        |
```

Now, since the **american** is in position 1, the **spanish** must be in position 2 for nationality.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | American |  Mirinda   |
| Nationality   |   Spanish|   Water   |
| Transport     |    ?     |   ?        |
```

Finally, since the **american** is driving the **jet-ski** (Clue 2), the **spanish** must be using the **snowmobile**.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | American |  Mirinda   |
| Nationality   |   Spanish|   Water   |
| Transport     | Jet-ski  | Snowmobile |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | American |  Mirinda   |
| Nationality   |   Spanish|   Water   |
| Transport     | Jet-ski  | Snowmobile |
```"
Lv8-3x2-3	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.

We have the following variables and constraints:
- Beverage: Fanta (F), Water (W)
- Job: Manager (M), Project-Manager (PM)
- Nationality: Australian (A), French (F)

Given constraints:
1. The person drinking Fanta is not to the right of the French.
2. The Project-Manager is not the French.
3. The Manager is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Water.

We need to place these in the table:

|               |    1    |        2        |
| Beverage      |         |                 |
| Job           |         |                 |
| Nationality   |         |                 |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Constraint 2**: The Project-Manager is not the French.
   - This means if someone is a Project-Manager, they cannot be French.

2. **Constraint 1**: The person drinking Fanta is not to the right of the French.
   - This means if someone drinks Fanta, they cannot be in position 2 if the French is in position 1.

3. **Constraint 3**: The Manager is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Water.
   - This means the Manager must be in position 1 if the person drinking Water is in position 2.

### Initial Assumptions:
- Let's assume the French is in position 1 for now (we'll check other possibilities later).

#### Case 1: French in Position 1
- If the French is in position 1, then the person drinking Fanta cannot be in position 2 (Constraint 1).
- Therefore, the person in position 2 must drink Water.

Now we have:
|               |    1    |        2        |
| Beverage      |     F   |        W        |
| Job           |         |                 |
| Nationality   |     F   |                 |

- Since the Project-Manager cannot be French (Constraint 2), the Project-Manager must be in position 2.
- The Manager must be in position 1 because the Manager is to the left of the person drinking Water (Constraint 3).

So, we get:
|               |    1    |        2        |
| Beverage      |     F   |        W        |
| Job           |     M   |       PM        |
| Nationality   |     F   |                 |

But this doesn't satisfy all constraints because the French is in both Beverage and Nationality, which is not allowed.

### Re-evaluating the French Position:
- Let's try placing the French in position 2 instead.

#### Case 2: French in Position 2
- If the French is in position 2, the person in position 1 cannot drink Fanta (Constraint 1).
- Therefore, the person in position 1 must drink Water.

Now we have:
|               |    1    |        2        |
| Beverage      |     W   |        F        |
| Job           |         |                 |
| Nationality   |         |        F        |

- The Project-Manager cannot be French (Constraint 2), so the Project-Manager must be in position 1.
- The Manager must be in position 2 because the Manager is to the left of the person drinking Water (Constraint 3).

So, we get:
|               |    1    |        2        |
| Beverage      |     W   |        F        |
| Job           |     PM  |        M        |
| Nationality   |     A   |        F        |

This configuration satisfies all the constraints:
- The person drinking Fanta (position 2) is not to the right of the French (position 2).
- The Project-Manager (position 1) is not French.
- The Manager (position 2) is to the left of the person drinking Water (position 1).

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |        2        |
| Beverage      |     W   |        F        |
| Job           |     PM  |        M        |
| Nationality   |     A   |        F        |

Lv8-3x2-4	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step.

Given:
- Two hobbies: card-games, singing
- Two jobs: architect, dressmaker
- Two nationalities: Dutch, Spanish
- The architect is on the left of the Spanish.
- The person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the Dutch.

We need to place these in the given table:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         |            |            |
| Job           |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Architect and Spanish**:
   - The architect must be on the left of the Spanish.
   - This means that if the architect is in position 1, the Spanish must be in position 2 for the job column.

2. **Hobby Placement**:
   - The person with the hobby of card-games cannot be to the right of the Dutch.
   - If the Dutch is in position 2, then the card-games hobbyist cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the card-games hobbyist must be in position 1.

3. **Combining the Information**:
   - If the Dutch has the hobby of card-games, they must be in position 1 (because the card-games hobbyist cannot be to the right of the Dutch).
   - This means the Spanish must be in position 2 for the job column (since the architect is on the left of the Spanish).

4. **Remaining Assignments**:
   - Since the Dutch is in position 1 with the hobby of card-games, the Spanish must be in position 2 with the job of architect.
   - The remaining hobby (singing) must go to the Dutch.
   - The remaining job (dressmaker) must go to the Spanish.

### Final Table:

|               |     1      |     2      |

Lv8-3x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the given clues and systematically fill in the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person driving the trike is not to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
2. The person who prefers parkour is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1 Analysis:
- The person driving the trike cannot be in position 2 if the person with the hobby of puzzles is in position 2.
- This means the person with the hobby of puzzles must be in position 1, and the person driving the trike must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 2 Analysis:
- The person who prefers parkour must be to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
- If the person with the hobby of puzzles is in position 1, then the person who prefers parkour must be in position 2.

### Combining Both Clues:
- If the person with the hobby of puzzles is in position 1, then the person who prefers parkour must be in position 2 (from clue 2).
- Therefore, the person driving the trike must be in position 1 (from clue 1).

So, we can place:
- Position 1: Puzzles, Trike
- Position 2: Parkour, Lacrosse

Now, let's assign the remaining items (Chess, Lacrosse, Scooter) to the remaining slots.

### Final Table:
```
|             |    1     |    2    |
| Hobby       |  Puzzles |  Chess  |

| Transport   |  Trike   |  Scooter |
```

This configuration satisfies both clues:
1. The person driving the trike (position 1) is not to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles (position 1).
2. The person who prefers parkour (position 2) is to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles (position 1).

Lv8-3x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information step-by-step into the table.

### Clues:
1. The person eating cranberry is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
2. The Mexican is on the left of the person eating pineapple.

### Table Structure:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Nationality   |           |            |
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The person eating cranberry is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
This means that if someone is eating cranberry, they cannot be in position 1 if the person watching fantasy movies is in position 1.

#### Clue 2: The Mexican is on the left of the person eating pineapple.
This means that the Mexican must be in position 1 if the person eating pineapple is in position 2.

Let's start placing the information based on these clues:

1. **Nationality:**
   - Since the Mexican must be on the left of the person eating pineapple, the Mexican must be in position 1 and the person eating pineapple must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the Mexican is in position 1 for nationality, and the Italian (the only other nationality) must be in position 2 for nationality.

2. **Food:**
   - If the Mexican is in position 1, the person eating pineapple must be in position 2. This leaves cranberry for position 1 and pineapple for position 2 for food.
   - Therefore, the cranberry is in position 1 for food, and the pineapple is in position 2 for food.

3. **Movie-Genre:**
   - We need to ensure that the person eating cranberry (position 1 for food) is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
   - This means the person watching fantasy movies cannot be in position 1. So, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 1 for movie-genre.

Now, let's fill in the table with the information we have:

```
|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Cranberry | Pineapple  |

Lv8-3x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly. Let's break down the clues and determine the correct arrangement:

### Clues:
1. The person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person eating apple.
2. The person whose sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** ""The person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person eating apple.""
   - This means that if someone is eating an apple, they cannot be in position 2 (right side) if they are driving a snowmobile.

2. **Clue 2:** ""The person whose sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.""
   - This means the person doing ice-hockey cannot be in position 1 (left side) if the person driving the taxi is in position 2 (right side).

### Possible Arrangements:

Let's denote:
- Apple as A
- Pomegranate as P
- Cricket as C
- Ice-hockey as I
- Snowmobile as S
- Taxi as T

We need to place these in the grid:

| Food        | 1      | 2      |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Sport       |        |        |
| Transport   |        |        |

From Clue 1:
- If someone is eating an apple (A), they cannot be in position 2 if they are driving a snowmobile (S).

From Clue 2:
- The person doing ice-hockey (I) must be to the right of the person driving the taxi (T).

### Possible Placements:

1. **Apple (A) and Pomegranate (P):**
   - Since A cannot be in position 2 if driving S, A can only be in position 1.
   - Therefore, P must be in position 2.

2. **Cricket (C) and Ice-hockey (I):**
   - I must be to the right of T, so I can only be in position 2, and T must be in position 1.

3. **Transport:**
   - Given the constraints, S must be in position 1 (left side) because A is in position 1 and cannot be driven by S.
   - Therefore, T must be in position 2 (right side) because it is the only option left for T.

### Final Solution Table:

```plaintext
#############
| Food        | 1      | 2      |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Sport       | Cricket| Ice-hockey|
| Transport   | Snowmobile| Taxi    |
#############
```

This placement satisfies both clues:
1. The person driving the snowmobile (S) is in position 1, and the person eating apple (A) is also in position 1, so the condition is met.
2. The person doing ice-hockey (I) is in position 2, which is to the right of the person driving the taxi (T) in position 1."

3. **Analyze the clues:**

   - Clue 1: The person watching western movies is not to the left of the Colombian.
     - This means if someone watches western movies, they cannot be in position 1 (left) and the Colombian must be in position 2 (right).

   - Clue 2: The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the Colombian.
     - This means the person with the hobby of puzzles must be in position 1 and the Colombian must be in position 2.

4. **Determine the positions based on the clues:**

   - Since the person with the hobby of puzzles must be on the left of the Colombian, we can place:
     - Puzzles in position 1.
     - Colombian in position 2.

5. **Determine the remaining elements:**

   - The person in position 2 (Colombian) cannot watch western movies (Clue 1), so they must watch superhero movies.
   - Therefore, the person in position 1 (puzzles) must watch western movies.

6. **Determine the remaining hobbies and nationalities:**

   - The remaining hobby for position 2 is writing.
   - The remaining nationality for position 1 is Japanese.
   - The remaining nationality for position 2 is Colombian.

""The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.""

This means that if ""epic"" is in column 1, ""classical"" cannot be in column 1. Therefore, ""classical"" must be in column 2 and ""epic"" can be either in column 1 or 2, but if it's in column 1, ""classical"" must be in column 2.

#### Clue 2: 
""The fan of classical is not to the left of the person driving the train.""

This means that the person who likes classical music cannot be in column 1 if the driver of the train is in column 1. So, the person who likes classical music must be in column 2 if the driver of the train is in column 1, or in column 1 if the driver of the train is in column 2.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given these clues, we need to find a consistent arrangement. Let's start by placing ""classical"" and ""epic"" based on clue 1 and then fit the rest with clue 2.

1. If ""epic"" is in column 1, ""classical"" must be in column 2.
2. If ""classical"" is in column 2, the driver of the train cannot be in column 1 (from clue 2).

Let's try the arrangement where ""epic"" is in column 1 and ""classical"" is in column 2:

|               |     1     |   2   |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Movie-Genre   | Epic      | Family |
| Music-Genre   | Classical | Disco  |
| Transport     | Train     | Van    |

Now, let's check if this arrangement satisfies both clues:
- Clue 1: The person watching epic movies (Epic) is to the right of the fan of classical (Classical). This is satisfied.
- Clue 2: The fan of classical (Classical) is not to the left of the person driving the train (Train). This is also satisfied because Classical is in column 2 and Train is in column 1.

Therefore, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1     |   2   |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Movie-Genre   | Epic      | Family |
| Music-Genre   | Classical | Disco  |
| Transport     | Train     | Van    |

Lv8-3x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and systematically place the information into the table.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the hamster is not to the right of the owner of the goat.
2. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person driving the car.
3. The person eating pomegranate is in an odd position (position 1).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3:
- The person eating pomegranate is in position 1.
- Therefore, the person in position 1 must be eating pomegranate.

|             |      1      |  2   |
| Food        | Pomegranate |      |
| Pet         |            |      |
| Transport   |            |      |

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the hamster is not to the right of the owner of the goat.
- This means if the goat is in position 1, the hamster cannot be in position 2.

Since position 1 is occupied by pomegranate, we need to determine who has the goat and who has the hamster. Let's denote:
- Goat as G
- Hamster as H

If the goat were in position 2, then the hamster would have to be in position 1, which is not possible because position 1 is already occupied by pomegranate. Therefore, the goat must be in position 2.

|             |      1      |  2   |
| Food        | Pomegranate |      |
| Pet         | Goat        | H    |
| Transport   |            |      |

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person driving the car.
- Since the hamster is in position 2, the person driving the car must be in position 1.

|             |      1      |  2   |
| Food        | Pomegranate |      |
| Pet         | Goat        | Hamster |
| Transport   | Car         |      |

### Final Table:
```
|             |      1      |  2   |
| Food        | Pomegranate | Lime  |
| Pet         | Goat        | Hamster |
| Transport   | Car         | Motorbike |
```"
