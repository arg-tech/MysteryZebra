|               |    1    |     2     |     3      |     4     |
| Food          | Brazilian | Banana, Rat | Funk       | Lettuce, Funk, Pakistani |

Lv4-4x4-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning of Woodworking:**
   - The person with the hobby of woodworking is in an even position (2 or 4).

2. **Indian Position:**
   - The Indian is on the left of the person who prefers climbing.
   - This means the Indian cannot be in position 4 (since there would be no one to the right).

3. **Collecting and Kale:**
   - The person who collects is on the right of the person eating kale.
   - The person eating kale is in an odd position (1 or 3).

4. **Colombian Position:**
   - The Colombian eats eggplant.
   - The Colombian is next to the Mexican (either left or right).

5. **Volleyball and Carrot:**
   - The person who plays volleyball is on the right of the person eating carrot.
   - This means the person eating carrot cannot be in position 4 (since there would be no one to the right).

6. **Mexican Position:**
   - The Mexican is either in position 1 or 4.
   - The Colombian is next to the Mexican.

7. **Peas and Kale:**
   - The person eating peas is on the right of the person eating kale.
   - Since kale is in an odd position, peas must be in an even position (2 or 4).

8. **Spanish and Biathlon:**
   - The Spanish is next to the person who prefers biathlon.
   - This means the person who prefers biathlon cannot be in position 1 or 4.

9. **Mexican Position Revisited:**
   - If the Mexican is in position 1, then the Colombian must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the Mexican is in position 4, then the Colombian must be in position 3 or 2.

### Filling in the Table:

Let's start with the positions:
- Position 1: Mexican
- Position 2: Colombian
- Position 3: (to be determined)
- Position 4: (to be determined)

Since the Colombian is next to the Mexican, we need to check the other conditions.

#### Position 1 (Mexican):
- The Mexican is the person who's hobby is drawing (from clue 11).
- The Mexican is in an odd position (clue 9).

#### Position 2 (Colombian):
- The Colombian eats eggplant (clue 4).
- The Colombian is next to the Mexican (clue 6).

#### Position 3 and 4:
- The person eating kale is in an odd position (clue 10), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Since the Mexican is in position 1, the person eating kale must be in position 3.
- The person eating peas is on the right of the person eating kale (clue 7), so the person eating peas is in position 4.
- The person who plays volleyball is on the right of the person eating carrot (clue 5), so the person eating carrot is in position 1 or 3.
- Since the Mexican is in position 1, the person eating carrot cannot be in position 1 (it must be in position 3).

So, the person eating carrot is in position 3, and the person playing volleyball is in position 4.

#### Remaining Hobbies and Sports:
- The person with the hobby of woodworking is in an even position (position 2 or 4).
- Since position 4 is taken by the person playing volleyball, the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in position 2.
- The person who plays biathlon is next to the Spanish (clue 8), and since the Spanish cannot be in position 1 or 4, they must be in position 3.
- Therefore, the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in position 2, and the person who plays biathlon must be in position 3.

### Final Table:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The writer drinks juice and is in an even position (2 or 4).
2. **Clue 8**: Since the writer is in an even position, the writer can only be in position 2 or 4.
3. **Clue 7**: The owner of the dog is the Italian.
4. **Clue 9**: The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the British. This means the British must be in an even position (2 or 4) since mirinda is on the left.
5. **Clue 10**: The owner of the dog (Italian) is the person drinking mirinda. Therefore, the Italian is in position 1 or 3 (since mirinda is on the left of the British, and the British cannot be in position 1 or 3).

- **Position 2**: Egyptian (social worker)
- **Position 3**: British (since the mirinda drinker is on the left of the British, and the British must be in an even position, this fits with the mirinda drinker being in position 1 or 3)

Now, let's assign the beverages:

- **Position 1**: Sprite (Italian, dog owner)

Lv4-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table with the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person 1 (P1)**
   - From constraint 6: P1's sport is parkour.
   - From constraint 9: P1's hobby is chess.
   - From constraint 7: P1 drinks water.
   - From constraint 10: P1 is on the left of the person who plays cycling, so P2 must play cycling.

2. **Person 2 (P2)**
   - From constraint 10: P2's sport is cycling.
   - From constraint 2: The person whose hobby is sudoku is to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games. Since P1 has chess (odd), P2 must have card-games.
   - From constraint 4: P2's hobby is card-games, which is in an even position, so it fits here.

3. **Person 3 (P3)**
   - From constraint 3: P3 eats corn.
   - From constraint 3: P3 is also to the left or right of the person who plays parkour (P1).
   - From constraint 8: P3 eats either lime or zucchini, and P3 is to the left or right of the person eating zucchini.
   - From constraint 12: The person eating zucchini is to the left or right of the person eating corn, so P3 must be eating corn, and P4 must eat zucchini.

4. **Person 4 (P4)**
   - From constraint 12: P4 eats zucchini.
   - From constraint 5: P4's sport is surfing.
   - From constraint 1: P4 drinks iced-tea.
   - From constraint 11: P4 drinks sprite, but from constraint 5, P4 drinks iced-tea, so there's a contradiction unless we re-evaluate. Given that P4 drinks iced-tea, P3 must drink sprite.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Turtle Owner**: From clue 1, the turtle owner is in position 1 or 3.

### Deduction Process:

- **Position 1**: Turtle owner (clue 1). Since the dog owner is between the turtle owner and the horse owner (clue 2), the dog owner cannot be in position 1.
- **Position 3**: Turtle owner (clue 1). Horse owner must be in position 1.
- **Position 2 or 4**: Traveling hobbyist (clue 11).

Since the dog owner is between the American and the fantasy movie watcher (clue 9) and the dancing hobbyist is to the left of the dog owner (clue 10), we can deduce the following:

- If the dog owner is in position 2, the American must be in position 1, and the fantasy movie watcher must be in position 3.
- If the dog owner is in position 4, the American must be in position 3, and the fantasy movie watcher must be in position 2.

### Final Placement:

Let's try with the dog owner in position 2:

- Position 1: Turtle owner (clue 1)
- Position 2: Dog owner
- Position 3: Fantasy movie watcher
- Position 4: Traveling hobbyist (clue 11)

From clue 9, the dog owner is between the American and the fantasy movie watcher, so:

- Position 1: Turtle owner
- Position 2: Dog owner
- Position 3: Fantasy movie watcher
- Position 4: Traveling hobbyist

Now, let's place the other elements:

- The horse owner is in position 1 (clue 2).
- The American is to the left of the puzzles hobbyist (clue 3).
- The Spanish is to the right of the Nigerian (clue 5).
- The epic movie watcher is next to the dancing hobbyist (clue 6).
- The horse owner is to the left of the puzzles hobbyist (clue 7).
- The dancing hobbyist is to the left of the Australian (clue 8).
- The epic movie watcher is next to the chess hobbyist (clue 12).

After placing all the elements, we get:

- Position 1: Turtle owner (American)
- Position 2: Dog owner
- Position 3: Fantasy movie watcher
- Position 4: Traveling hobbyist (Spanish)

Now, filling in the hobbies and movie genres:

- Position 1: American - Puzzles - Epic
- Position 2: Dog owner - Dancing - Fantasy
- Position 3: Fantasy movie watcher - Chess - Sports
- Position 4: Traveling hobbyist (Spanish) - Traveling - Zombie
