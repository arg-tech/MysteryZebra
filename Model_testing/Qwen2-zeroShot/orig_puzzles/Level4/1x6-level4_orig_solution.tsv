Lv4-1x6-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the music genres accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of disco is on the left or right of the fan of house**.
2. **The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of folk**.
3. **The fan of house is on the right of the fan of folk**.
4. **The fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of rock**.
5. **The fan of house is in an odd position**.
6. **The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of folk** (This is redundant with clue 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The fan of house is in an odd position. Therefore, house can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

2. **Clue 3**: The fan of house is on the right of the fan of folk. This means folk must be in a position to the left of house.

3. **Clue 2**: The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of folk. This means rock cannot be in any position to the right of folk.

4. **Clue 4**: The fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of rock. This means gospel cannot be in any position to the right of rock.

5. **Clue 1**: The fan of disco is on the left or right of the fan of house.

### Possible Positions for House:
- If house is in position 1, folk cannot be in position 2 because there would be no room for rock to be to the left of folk. Therefore, house cannot be in position 1.
- If house is in position 3, then folk must be in position 1 or 2. But if folk is in position 1, rock cannot be to its left (since rock must be to the left of folk). So, folk must be in position 2. Then, rock must be in position 1, which contradicts folk being in position 2. Therefore, house cannot be in position 3.
- If house is in position 5, then folk must be in position 3 or 4. If folk is in position 3, rock must be in position 2 or 1. But gospel must be to the left of rock, so rock cannot be in position 2 (because gospel would need to be in position 1, leaving no room for house). Thus, rock must be in position 1, which is not possible since folk is in position 3. Therefore, folk must be in position 4. Then, rock must be in position 2. Gospel must be in position 1. This leaves position 6 for disco, which fits all clues.

So, the only valid arrangement is:
- Position 1: Gospel
- Position 2: Rock
- Position 3: Folk
- Position 4: House
- Position 5: None (or another genre, but not used here)
- Position 6: Disco

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv4-1x6-2	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to solve the puzzle:

1. **Clue 1:** The firefighter is between the software-developer and the electrician.
   - This means the sequence must be either S-D-F-E or E-F-D-S.

2. **Clue 2:** The chef is on the far left or far right.
   - This means the chef can only be in position 1 or 6.

3. **Clue 3:** The chef is in an odd position.
   - Since the chef can only be in position 1 or 6, and it must be in an odd position, the chef must be in position 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The accountant is on the left or right of the project-manager.
   - This means the accountant and the project-manager must be adjacent.

5. **Clue 5:** The electrician is on the right of the firefighter.
   - This means if the sequence is F-D-E or E-F-D, the electrician must be to the right of the firefighter.

6. **Clue 6:** The software-developer is between the firefighter and the accountant.
   - This means the sequence involving the software-developer, firefighter, and accountant must be S-F-A or A-F-S.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the elements:

- Position 1 is occupied by the chef (Clue 3).
- The firefighter must be between the software-developer and the electrician (Clue 1), and the electrician must be to the right of the firefighter (Clue 5).

Considering Clue 6, the software-developer must be next to the firefighter and the accountant. Let's test the possible sequences:

### Testing Sequence 1:
- Chef (position 1)
- Software-developer (position 2)
- Firefighter (position 3)
- Accountant (position 4)
- Electrician (position 5)
- Project-manager (position 6)

This sequence fits all the given clues:
- The firefighter is between the software-developer and the electrician.
- The chef is in position 1.
- The accountant is to the right of the project-manager.
- The electrician is to the right of the firefighter.
- The software-developer is between the firefighter and the accountant.

Thus, the final solution is:

```

Lv4-1x6-3	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. **The paramedic is between the manager and the bartender.**
2. **The bartender is on the right of the engineer.**
3. **The musician is on the left or right of the manager.**
4. **The manager is in an even position.**
5. **The photographer is on the far right.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Photographer is on the far right (position 6).**
   - This means the job in position 6 is ""photographer.""

2. **Manager is in an even position.**
   - The possible positions for the manager are 2, 4, or 6. Since position 6 is taken by the photographer, the manager can only be in position 2 or 4.

3. **Paramedic is between the manager and the bartender.**
   - If the manager is in position 2, then the bartender must be in position 4 or 6, but position 6 is taken by the photographer, so the bartender must be in position 4.
   - If the manager is in position 4, then the bartender must be in position 2 or 6, but position 6 is taken by the photographer, so the bartender must be in position 2.
   
   Let's test both scenarios:
   - Scenario A: Manager in position 2, Bartender in position 4.
   - Scenario B: Manager in position 4, Bartender in position 2.

4. **Bartender is on the right of the engineer.**
   - In Scenario A, the bartender is in position 4, so the engineer must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
   - In Scenario B, the bartender is in position 2, so the engineer must be in position 1 or 3.

5. **Musician is on the left or right of the manager.**
   - In Scenario A, the manager is in position 2 and the bartender is in position 4, so the musician must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
   - In Scenario B, the manager is in position 4 and the bartender is in position 2, so the musician must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

### Testing Scenarios:

**Scenario A:**
- Position 1: Engineer
- Position 2: Manager
- Position 3: Musician
- Position 4: Bartender
- Position 5: ?
- Position 6: Photographer

We need to fill in position 5 with one of the remaining jobs: musician, paramedic, or engineer (but engineer is already in position 1).

Since the musician is on the left or right of the manager, position 3 must be the musician. Therefore:
- Position 1: Engineer
- Position 2: Manager
- Position 3: Musician
- Position 4: Bartender
- Position 5: Paramedic
- Position 6: Photographer

This scenario fits all the clues.

**Scenario B:**
- Position 1: Engineer
- Position 2: Bartender
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: Manager
- Position 5: ?
- Position 6: Photographer

We need to fill in positions 3 and 5 with the remaining jobs: musician, paramedic, and engineer (but engineer is already in position 1).

Since the musician is on the left or right of the manager, position 3 must be the musician. Therefore:
- Position 1: Engineer
- Position 2: Bartender
- Position 3: Musician
- Position 4: Manager
- Position 5: Paramedic
- Position 6: Photographer

This scenario also fits all the clues.

However, since we need to ensure that the bartender is on the right of the engineer and the manager is in an even position, Scenario A is more consistent with the given clues.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|       |    1     |     2     |     3     |    4    |    5     |      6       |

Lv4-1x6-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

1. **The owner of the goat is on the right of the owner of the pony.**
   - This means the pony cannot be in the last position (6), and the goat must be to the right of the pony.

2. **The owner of the turtle is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the mouse.**
   - This means the positions for the ferret, turtle, and mouse must be consecutive, with the turtle in the middle.

3. **The owner of the ferret is in an even position.**
   - The even positions are 2, 4, and 6. Since the turtle is between the ferret and the mouse, the ferret cannot be in position 6 (as there would be no room for the turtle and mouse). So, the ferret must be in position 2 or 4.

4. **The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the cat.**
   - This means the cat must be to the right of the goat.

5. **The owner of the mouse is on the far right.**
   - This means the mouse is in position 6.

Now, let's place the mouse first:
- Position 6: Mouse

Next, we know the turtle is between the ferret and the mouse. Since the mouse is in position 6, the turtle must be in position 5 and the ferret in position 4 (since it's an even position).

- Position 4: Ferret
- Position 5: Turtle

Since the ferret is in position 4, the turtle is in position 5, and the mouse is in position 6, the only even position left for the ferret is position 4, confirming our placement.

Now, we need to place the pony and goat. We know the goat is to the left of the pony and the pony cannot be in position 6 (as the goat must be to its left).

- Position 2: Pony (since it must be to the left of the goat and the ferret is already in position 4)
- Position 3: Goat (to the left of the pony)

Finally, the only pet left is the cat, which must be in position 1 since the goat is to the left of the cat.

So, the final arrangement is:

```
|       |  1   |  2   |  3  |   4    |   5    |   6   |
| Pet   | Cat  | Pony | Goat| Ferret | Turtle | Mouse |

Lv4-1x6-5	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating pear is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Pear

2. **Clue 6:** The person eating orange is on the far right.
   - Position 6: Orange

3. **Clue 2:** The person eating pepper is in an even position (4).
   - Position 4: Pepper

4. **Clue 3:** The person eating tomato is on the left of the person eating radish.
   - Since the person eating radish must be to the right of the person eating tomato, and we already have positions 1 and 6 filled, the only possible positions for tomato and radish are 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 (but 4 is already taken by pepper). Therefore, tomato and radish must be in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
   - Position 2: Tomato
   - Position 3: Radish

5. **Clue 4:** The person eating watermelon is on the right of the person eating radish.
   - Since the person eating radish is in position 3, the person eating watermelon must be in position 5.
   - Position 5: Watermelon

Now, let's summarize all the positions:

- Position 1: Pear
- Position 2: Tomato
- Position 3: Radish
- Position 4: Pepper
- Position 5: Watermelon
- Position 6: Orange

The final solution table is as follows:

Lv4-1x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. The software-developer is in an even position (Clue 1).
2. The journalist is on the right of the project-manager (Clue 2).
3. The project-manager is between the journalist and the engineer (Clue 3).
4. The engineer is on the right of the doctor (Clue 4).
5. The engineer is on the right of the doctor (Clue 5) - This is a repeat of Clue 4.
6. The software-developer is on the right of the journalist (Clue 6).
7. The project-manager is the project-manager (Clue 7) - This is redundant information.
8. The project-manager is on the left of the journalist (Clue 8).

From Clue 2, we know that the order must be:
\[ \text{Project-Manager} - \text{Journalist} \]

From Clue 3, since the project-manager is between the journalist and the engineer, the order must be:
\[ \text{Project-Manager} - \text{Engineer} - \text{Journalist} \]

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the order involving the doctor and the engineer:
\[ \text{Doctor} - \text{Engineer} \]

From Clue 6, the software-developer must be to the right of the journalist:
\[ \text{Journalist} - \text{Software-Developer} \]

Now, let's combine all the information:

- The project-manager is between the journalist and the engineer.
- The engineer is to the right of the doctor.
- The software-developer is to the right of the journalist.

Since the software-developer is in an even position (Clue 1), and the project-manager is also in an even position (as part of the sequence), the only possible positions for these roles are 2 and 4, or 4 and 6. Given that the software-developer must be on the right of the journalist and the project-manager must be on the left of the journalist, the only feasible arrangement is:

1. Doctor
2. Project-Manager
3. Engineer
4. Journalist
5. Software-Developer
6. Fisherman

So, the final solution is:

Lv4-1x6-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct arrangement of beverages.

1. **The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.**
   - This means if Iced-tea is at position \(x\), then Milk must be at position \(x+1\).

2. **The person drinking coffee is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking cola.**
   - Coffee must be in the middle of Soy-milk and Cola.

3. **The person drinking cola is in an even position.**
   - Possible positions for Cola are 2, 4, or 6.

4. **The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking cola.**
   - Fanta can be immediately before or after Cola.

5. **The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking milk.**
   - If Milk is at position \(x+1\), then Fanta must be at position \(x+2\) or later.

6. **The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking cola.**
   - This reiterates that Fanta can be immediately before or after Cola.

Given these clues, let's start with possible positions for Cola (even positions):

### Case 1: Cola at Position 2
- If Cola is at position 2, then:
  - Fanta can be at position 1 or 3.
  - Coffee must be between Soy-milk and Cola, so Coffee must be at position 1 (impossible as Fanta cannot be at 1) or 3 (impossible as it would not fit the order constraints).
  - Milk must be at position 3 (impossible as Coffee cannot be at 3).

### Case 2: Cola at Position 4
- If Cola is at position 4, then:
  - Fanta can be at position 3 or 5.
  - Coffee must be between Soy-milk and Cola, so Coffee must be at position 3 (impossible as Fanta cannot be at 3) or 5 (impossible as it would not fit the order constraints).
  - Milk must be at position 5 (impossible as Coffee cannot be at 5).

### Case 3: Cola at Position 6
- If Cola is at position 6, then:
  - Fanta can be at position 5 or 7 (but there is no 7th position, so only position 5).
  - Coffee must be between Soy-milk and Cola, so Coffee must be at position 5 (impossible as Fanta cannot be at 5).
  - Milk must be at position 5 (impossible as Coffee cannot be at 5).

### Correcting the Approach:
- Let's reconsider the positions more carefully:

If we place Cola at position 4:
- Fanta can be at position 3 or 5.
- Coffee must be between Soy-milk and Cola, so Coffee must be at position 3 (if Fanta is at 5) or 5 (if Fanta is at 3).

#### Sub-case 1: Fanta at Position 5
- Coffee must be at position 3.
- Milk must be at position 4 (impossible as Cola is at 4).

#### Sub-case 2: Fanta at Position 3
- Coffee must be at position 5.
- Milk must be at position 6.

Now, we have:
- Cola at position 4
- Fanta at position 3
- Coffee at position 5
- Milk at position 6

We need to place Soy-milk and Iced-tea:
- Iced-tea cannot be at position 5 or 6.
- Iced-tea must be at position 1 or 2.
- Soy-milk must be at position 2 (since Iced-tea cannot be at 2 and it needs to be between Coffee and Cola).

So the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Iced-tea
- Position 2: Soy-milk
- Position 3: Fanta
- Position 4: Cola
- Position 5: Coffee
- Position 6: Milk

Final Solution Table:

Lv4-1x6-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step and place the hobbies accordingly:

1. **The person who's hobby is photography is between the person who's hobby is board-games and the person who's hobby is skydiving.**
   - This means the order must be Board-Games, Photography, Skydiving or Skydiving, Photography, Board-Games.

2. **The person who's hobby is photography is in an even position.**
   - Since photography is in an even position (2, 4, or 6), and considering clue 1, the only possible arrangement is Photography in position 4.

3. **The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games.**
   - Given Photography is in position 4, and considering the possible positions for skydiving and video-games, skydiving must be in position 2, and video-games must be in position 6.

4. **The person who's hobby is photography is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person who's hobby is board-games.**
   - From clues 1 and 3, we already deduced that skydiving is in position 2, photography in position 4, and video-games in position 6. Therefore, board-games must be in position 1.

5. **The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left or far right.**
   - We've placed board-games in position 1, which satisfies this clue.

6. **The person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing.**
   - The only remaining positions are 3 and 5. Since fishing is to the left of camping, fishing must be in position 3, and camping must be in position 5.

7. **The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.**
   - We've placed fishing in position 3 and camping in position 5, which satisfies this clue.

Now, let's fill in the table with the hobbies:

Lv4-1x6-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

1. **The person drinking tea is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).**
2. **The person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola.**
3. **The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.**
4. **The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.**
5. **The person drinking almond-milk is on the far right.**
6. **The person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking cola.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The person drinking almond-milk is on the far right (position 6).
   - This gives us:
   ```
   |            |    1    |   2   |    3     |  4   |  5  |      6      |
   | Beverage   |         |       |          |      |     | almond-milk |
   ```

2. **Clue 6:** The person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking cola.
   - Since the person drinking cola cannot be in position 6 (as the person drinking tea must be to the right of the person drinking cola), we need to consider positions 1 through 5 for both cola and tea.

3. **Clue 1:** The person drinking tea is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
   - This means the person drinking tea could be in position 1, 3, or 5.

4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
   - If the person drinking tea is in position 1, then cola can only be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the person drinking tea is in position 3, then cola can only be in position 2 or 4.
   - If the person drinking tea is in position 5, then cola can only be in position 4.

5. **Clue 2:** The person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola.
   - This means lemonade, juice, and cola must occupy three consecutive positions.

6. **Clue 3:** The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.
   - Since almond-milk is in position 6, tea must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

### Combining Clues:

- Let's start with the possible positions for tea and cola:
  - If tea is in position 1, cola can be in position 2 or 3.
  - If tea is in position 3, cola can be in position 2 or 4.
  - If tea is in position 5, cola can be in position 4.

Let's test these scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Tea in Position 1, Cola in Position 2
- Tea (1), Cola (2)
- Lemonade, Juice, and Mirinda must occupy positions 3, 4, and 5 consecutively.
- This leaves no room for the third beverage, which contradicts the given clues.

#### Scenario 2: Tea in Position 1, Cola in Position 3
- Tea (1), Cola (3)
- Lemonade, Juice, and Mirinda must occupy positions 2, 4, and 5 consecutively.
- This leaves no room for the third beverage, which contradicts the given clues.

#### Scenario 3: Tea in Position 1, Cola in Position 4
- Tea (1), Cola (4)
- Lemonade, Juice, and Mirinda must occupy positions 2, 3, and 5 consecutively.
- This is a valid scenario.

#### Scenario 4: Tea in Position 3, Cola in Position 2
- Tea (3), Cola (2)
- Lemonade, Juice, and Mirinda must occupy positions 1, 4, and 5 consecutively.
- This is not valid because it contradicts the position of tea being on the left or right of almond-milk.

#### Scenario 5: Tea in Position 3, Cola in Position 4
- Tea (3), Cola (4)
- Lemonade, Juice, and Mirinda must occupy positions 1, 2, and 5 consecutively.
- This is a valid scenario.

#### Scenario 6: Tea in Position 5, Cola in Position 4
- Tea (5), Cola (4)
- Lemonade, Juice, and Mirinda must occupy positions 1, 2, and 3 consecutively.
- This is a valid scenario.

### Final Solution:

From the valid scenarios, we can choose one that fits all clues. Let's choose the first valid scenario where tea is in position 1 and cola is in position 4.

```
|            |    1    |   2   |    3     |  4   |  5  |      6      |
| Beverage   |   tea   | lemonade | juice   | cola | mirinda | almond-milk |

Lv4-1x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the movie genres accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies.**
   - This means that the positions of satire and mystery are adjacent to each other.

2. **The person watching spy movies is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - This means spy is to the left of martial-arts.

3. **The person watching romance movies is in an odd position.**
   - Possible positions for romance: 1, 3, 5.

4. **The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.**
   - This means documentary is to the left of satire.

5. **The person watching mystery movies is on the far right.**
   - Mystery must be in position 6.

6. **The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - This means martial-arts is to the left of romance.

7. **The person watching spy movies is in an odd position.**
   - Possible positions for spy: 1, 3, 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Mystery (6):** From clue 5, mystery is in position 6.
   
2. **Romance (Odd Position):** From clues 3 and 6, romance must be in one of the odd positions (1, 3, 5).

3. **Spy (Odd Position):** From clue 7, spy must also be in one of the odd positions (1, 3, 5).

4. **Satire and Mystery (Adjacent):** Since mystery is in position 6, satire must be in position 5.

5. **Spy and Martial-Arts (Spy Left of Martial-Arts):** Spy must be in an odd position, and since position 5 is taken by satire, spy can only be in position 1 or 3. Martial-arts must be to the right of spy, so if spy is in position 1, martial-arts would be in position 2, but then we cannot fit romance and documentary into the remaining spots. Thus, spy must be in position 3, and martial-arts in position 4.

6. **Documentary and Satire (Satire Right of Documentary):** Since satire is in position 5 and documentary must be to the left of satire, documentary must be in position 1.

7. **Romance and Martial-Arts (Romance Right of Martial-Arts):** Since martial-arts is in position 4 and romance must be to the right of martial-arts, romance must be in position 5, but position 5 is already taken by satire. Therefore, the only remaining spot for romance is position 3, and the only remaining spot for documentary is position 2.
