Lv4-7x4-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to fill in the table step by step.

Let's start by organizing the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing.
2. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
3. The person watching romance movies is on the right of the owner of the mouse.
4. The person who's sport is basketball is in an even position.
5. The person who's sport is golf is in an odd position.
6. The Spanish is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
7. The person eating banana is on the right of the Dutch.
8. The person who's sport is rowing is on the left or right of the fan of techno.
9. The person watching superhero movies is in an odd position.
10. The person eating potato is on the right of the owner of the goldfish.
11. The fan of d&b is on the right of the Dutch.
12. The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the Canadian.
13. The person who's hobby is board-games is in an odd position.
14. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
15. The Canadian is between the person who's hobby is hiking and the person who's sport is golf.
16. The fan of folk is between the person watching disaster movies and the owner of the mouse.
17. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the far left or far right.
18. The person eating watermelon is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.

Now let's solve it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the positions of sports
- Sports: basketball (even), golf (odd)
- Therefore, sports can only be in positions 2, 4 for basketball and 1, 3 for golf.

### Step 2: Determine the positions of hobbies
- Hobbies: board-games (odd), hiking (left of rock-climbing), traveling (far left or right)

Since board-games is in an odd position (1 or 3) and it must be adjacent to rowing:
- Board-games: 1 (since it needs to be adjacent to rowing, which is in an even position)
- Rowing: 2

Hiking and rock-climbing must be in positions 3 and 4 respectively (since hiking is left of rock-climbing).

### Step 3: Determine the positions of genres
- Genres: disaster (odd), romance (right of mouse), superhero (odd)
- Superhero must be in an odd position (1 or 3). Since board-games is already in 1, superhero must be in 3.
- Disaster must be in an odd position (1 or 3). Since superhero is in 3, disaster must be in 1.
- Romance must be in an even position (2 or 4) and is right of mouse.

### Step 4: Determine the positions of nationalities and pets
- Nationalities: Canadian, Dutch, Nigerian, Spanish
- Pets: chinchilla, goldfish, mouse, rabbit
- Spanish must be in an odd position (1 or 3). Since disaster is in 1, Spanish must be in 3.
- Goldfish must be next to the owner of the mouse, and since Spanish is in 3, mouse must be in 2.
- Dutch must be on the right of the fan of d&b (clue 11).
- Canadian must be between the person who's hobby is hiking and the person who's sport is golf (clue 15). Since golf is in 1, hiking must be in 2, and Canadian must be in 3.

### Placing the Information:

1. **Clue 14:** The person drinking fanta is on the far left. So, we place fanta in position 1.
2. **Clue 15:** The person eating peach is between the Colombian and the person drinking fanta. Since fanta is in position 1, the person eating peach must be in position 2, and the Colombian must be in position 3 or 4.

4. **Clue 18:** The dressmaker is on the far right. So, the dressmaker is in position 4.
5. **Clue 17:** The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since fanta is in position 1, lemonade must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

7. **Clue 7:** The person watching sports movies is the person eating peas. The person eating peas is the pilot. So, the pilot is in position 2, and the person watching sports movies is in position 2.
8. **Clue 5:** The person eating peas is the pilot. So, the pilot is in position 2.
9. **Clue 3:** The Dutch is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the Dutch cannot be in position 4 (dressmaker), they must be in position 1 or 2. But position 2 is already taken by the Canadian and the pilot, so the Dutch must be in position 1.

12. **Clue 13:** The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2.

14. **Clue 12:** The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching sports movies is in position 2, the person watching epic movies must be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is already taken by the Dutch, so the person watching epic movies must be in position 3, and the person watching romance movies must be in position 1.
15. **Clue 4:** The person watching epic movies is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since the person watching epic movies is in position 3, this is consistent.
16. **Clue 2:** The architect is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching spy movies must be in position 1, the architect must be in position 3.
17. **Clue 8:** The Canadian is on the left or right of the doctor. Since the Canadian is in position 2 and the doctor is in position 3, this is consistent.
18. **Clue 1:** The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi. Since the person drinking water must be in position 3 and the person eating kiwi must be in position 4, this is consistent.
