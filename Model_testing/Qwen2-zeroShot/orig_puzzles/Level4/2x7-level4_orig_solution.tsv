Lv4-2x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step-by-step. Let's start by organizing the information and filling in what we can.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The Spanish is the fan of d&b.
   - Spanish -> d&b

2. **Clue 7**: The Colombian is on the far left or far right.
   - This means the Colombian is either in position 1 or 7.

3. **Clue 11**: The fan of d&b is on the right of the Nigerian.
   - Since the Spanish (d&b) is not the Nigerian, the Nigerian must be somewhere to the left of the Spanish.
   - This implies that the Nigerian cannot be in position 1 because then the Spanish would have no room to the right.

4. **Clue 9**: The Nigerian is in an odd position.
   - Possible positions for the Nigerian: 1, 3, 5, 7.

5. **Clue 12**: The fan of metal is the Indonesian.
   - Indonesian -> metal

6. **Clue 8**: The fan of metal is in an even position.
   - Possible positions for the Indonesian: 2, 4, 6.

7. **Clue 6**: The Brazilian is in the middle.
   - The middle position is 4.
   - Brazilian -> 4

8. **Clue 10**: The Nigerian is on the left or right of the Spanish.
   - Since the Spanish is in position 4, the Nigerian could be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

9. **Clue 14**: The fan of punk is on the left or right of the fan of metal.
   - Possible positions for the fan of punk: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.
   - Possible positions for the fan of metal: 2, 4, 6.
   - If the Indonesian is in position 2 or 6, the punk fan could be in adjacent positions.

10. **Clue 13**: The fan of trance is on the right of the fan of soul.
    - Possible pairs: (soul, trance) in (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6).

11. **Clue 2**: The Chinese is on the right of the Indonesian.
    - Since the Indonesian is the metal fan, the Chinese must be in a position to the right of the metal fan.

12. **Clue 1**: The Chinese is on the left of the fan of trance.
    - The Chinese cannot be in position 7 (since the metal fan is in an even position).

13. **Clue 3**: The Chinese is on the left or right of the fan of metal.
    - Since the metal fan is the Indonesian, the Chinese must be in a position next to the Indonesian.

Let's summarize the possible positions:

- **Spanish** (d&b): 4
- **Indonesian** (metal): 2 or 6
- **Brazilian**: 4 (middle)
- **Chinese**: Next to the Indonesian (either 1, 3, 5, or 7)

Now, let's place the remaining positions:

- **Colombian**: 1 or 7
- **Nigerian**: 1, 3, 5
- **Punk fan**: Adjacent to the metal fan (if Indonesian is in 2, punk can be 1 or 3; if Indonesian is in 6, punk can be 5 or 7)
- **Trance fan**: Right of the soul fan (possible pairs: 1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6)

Given all constraints, let's try placing them:

- **Spanish** (d&b): 4
- **Indonesian** (metal): 6
- **Chinese**: 5 (next to Indonesian)
- **Nigerian**: 3 (left of Chinese)
- **Punk fan**: 5 (next to Indonesian)
- **Trance fan**: 7 (right of soul fan)
- **Soul fan**: 6 (left of trance fan)
- **Colombian**: 1 (far left)

So the final arrangement is:

|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |    6    |    7    |
| Music-Genre   |   Colombian  |   punk     |  Nigerian  |  Spanish  |  Chinese   |  metal  |  trance  |
| Nationality   |   Colombian  |   punk     |  Nigerian  |  Spanish  |  Chinese   |  Indonesian |  trance  |

   - F -> 1

2. **Journalist (J) is the person eating artichoke (A) and is on the far right (Position 7).**
   - J -> A -> 7

3. **Project-Manager (PM) is the person eating onion (O).**
   - PM -> O

4. **Police-Officer (PO) is in an odd position and must be between Eggplant (E) and Onion (O).**
   - PO -> 3 or 5
   - Since PM (O) is at 7 and F is at 1, PO can only be at 3.

Lv4-2x7-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to place the hobbies and jobs into the correct positions based on the given clues. Let's go through each clue step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
2. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
3. The paramedic is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
4. The writer is on the far left or far right.
5. The person who's hobby is card-games is in an even position.
6. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the fisherman.
7. The paramedic is in an odd position.
8. The designer is on the far right.
9. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography.
10. The videographer is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
11. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.
12. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left.
13. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the teacher.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Dancing (far left)**: From clue 12.
2. **Reading**: From clue 11, it must be in position 2 because dancing is in position 1.
3. **Paramedic**: From clue 3, it must be in an odd position and also from clue 7, it must be in an odd position. Therefore, it can only be in position 3.
4. **Photography**: From clue 9, it must be to the left of the card-games hobbyist, and since the card-games hobbyist is in an even position (clue 5), photography can be in position 4.
5. **Board-games**: From clue 10, the videographer is on the left of the person with board-games. Since the videographer cannot be in position 1 (dancing) or 2 (reading), it can only be in position 5, making board-games in position 6.
6. **Card-games**: From clue 5, it must be in an even position. Since photography is in position 4, card-games can be in position 2 or 6. But since the board-games hobbyist is in position 6, card-games must be in position 2.
7. **Puzzles**: From clue 1, it must be next to board-games (position 6). Therefore, puzzles can be in position 5 or 7. Since the fisherman is on the left or right of puzzles (clue 6), and the only remaining positions for puzzles are 5 or 7, puzzles must be in position 5, and the fisherman must be in position 4 (since photography is in 4).
8. **Woodworking**: From clue 13, it must be on the left or right of the teacher. The only positions left are 1 and 7. Since dancing is in 1, woodworking must be in position 7, and the teacher must be in position 6.
9. **Writer**: From clue 4, it must be on the far left or far right. Since position 1 is taken by dancing and position 7 is taken by woodworking, the writer must be in position 7.

Lv4-2x7-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct nationality and movie genre in the appropriate positions. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **The Egyptian is on the left or right of the Mexican**:
   - This means Egyptian and Mexican must be next to each other.

2. **The Spanish is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies**:
   - This means Spanish and disaster must be next to each other.

3. **The person watching thriller movies is in the middle (position 4)**:
   - Thriller is in position 4.

4. **The Spanish is in an odd position**:
   - The possible positions for Spanish are 1, 3, or 5.

5. **The person watching drama movies is on the left of the Australian**:
   - Drama is to the left of Australian.

6. **The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies**:
   - Horror is to the left of Disaster.

7. **The Australian is on the left of the person watching epic movies**:
   - Australian is to the left of Epic.

8. **The Polish is in an odd position**:
   - The possible positions for Polish are 1, 3, or 5.

9. **The person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right**:
   - Epic is in position 1 or 7.

10. **The Mexican is on the far left or far right**:
    - Mexican is in position 1 or 7.

11. **The person watching action movies is on the left of the British**:
    - Action is to the left of British.

12. **The Chinese is on the right of the person watching thriller movies**:
    - Chinese is to the right of Thriller (which is in position 4).

Given these constraints, let's start placing elements based on the positions:

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **Position 4**: Thriller
2. **Position 1 or 7**: Epic or Mexican
3. **Position 1 or 7**: Polish (since it needs to be in an odd position)
4. **Position 1 or 7**: Mexican (since it needs to be in an odd position)

Let's assume Mexican is in position 1 (we can verify later if this assumption leads to a contradiction):

- Position 1: Mexican
- Position 4: Thriller

Since Polish needs to be in an odd position and not in position 1 (because Mexican is there), Polish must be in position 3 or 5.

### Checking Clues:

5. **Spanish is in an odd position** (1, 3, or 5):
   - If Spanish is in position 3, then disaster must be in position 2 or 4.
   - If Spanish is in position 5, then disaster must be in position 4 or 6.

Since Thriller is in position 4, disaster cannot be in position 4. Thus, if Spanish is in position 3, disaster must be in position 2.

- Position 2: Disaster
- Position 3: Spanish

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

6. **Spanish is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies** (already satisfied as Spanish is in position 3 and disaster is in position 2).

7. **The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies**:
   - Horror must be in position 1 or 2, but position 1 is Mexican and position 2 is Disaster. So, horror must be in position 1 (contradiction with Mexican in position 1).

Re-evaluate the assumption that Mexican is in position 1:

If Mexican is in position 7, then:

- Position 7: Mexican
- Position 4: Thriller

Polish must be in position 1 or 3. Since Mexican is in position 7, Polish must be in position 1 or 3. Given the constraint that Polish is in an odd position, Polish must be in position 3.

- Position 1: Polish
- Position 3: Spanish
- Position 4: Thriller

8. **The Spanish is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies** (satisfied as Spanish is in position 3 and disaster is in position 2).

9. **The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies**:
   - Horror must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is Polish and position 2 is Disaster, Horror must be in position 2.

- Position 2: Horror

10. **The person watching drama movies is on the left of the Australian**:
    - Drama must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is Polish and position 2 is Horror, Drama must be in position 1.

- Position 1: Polish
- Position 2: Horror
- Position 3: Spanish
- Position 4: Thriller

11. **The person watching action movies is on the left of the British**:
    - Action must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is Polish and position 2 is Horror, Action must be in position 2.

- Position 2: Horror

12. **The Chinese is on the right of the person watching thriller movies**:
    - Chinese must be in position 6 or 7. Since position 7 is Mexican, Chinese must be in position 6.

- Position 6: Chinese

13. **The Australian is on the left of the person watching epic movies**:
    - Australian must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is Polish and position 2 is Horror, Australian must be in position 5.

- Position 5: Australian

14. **The person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right**:
    - Epic must be in position 1 or 7. Since position 1 is Polish and position 7 is Mexican, Epic must be in position 7.

- Position 7: Mexican

15. **The person watching action movies is on the left of the British**:
    - Action must be in position 2 or 3. Since position 2 is Horror and position 3 is Spanish, Action must be in position 3.

- Position 3: Spanish

16. **The person watching romance movies is the only one left**:
    - Romance must be in position 4.

- Position 4: Thriller

- This means kale can be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 7.

11. **Clue 9**: The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the fan of salsa.
- Salsa is in position 4, so pumpkin must be in position 3.

12. **Clue 10**: The person eating broccoli is between the person eating pumpkin and the person eating raspberry.
- Pumpkin is in position 3, so broccoli must be in position 2 or 4.
- But since punk is in position 2, broccoli must be in position 4.
- This means raspberry must be in position 5.

13. **Clue 13**: The fan of r&b is the person eating kale.
- So kale must be in position 7.

Now let's summarize the positions:

```"
Lv4-2x7-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Fan of r&b is on the far right**:
   - r&b must be in position 7.
   
2. **Fan of indie is on the left of the fan of salsa**:
   - The fan of indie and the fan of salsa must be adjacent to each other with indie on the left.
   
3. **Fan of indie is on the far left or far right**:
   - Since r&b is already in position 7, indie must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, salsa must be in position 2.
   
4. **Person who's sport is tennis is in an odd position**:
   - The person who's sport is tennis must be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
   - Since indie (position 1) is the fan of indie, the fan of pop must be in position 3 or 5 (from constraint 6).
   - Since the person who's sport is tennis is the fan of pop (constraint 12), the fan of pop must be in position 3 or 5.
   - The only possible odd position for the fan of pop (and thus tennis) is position 5.
   - Therefore, the fan of pop is in position 5 and the person who's sport is tennis is also in position 5.
   
5. **Person who's sport is golf is on the right of the fan of salsa**:
   - Since the fan of salsa is in position 2, the person who's sport is golf must be in position 3 or 4.
   - The person who's sport is golf cannot be in position 3 because the fan of pop is in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person who's sport is golf must be in position 4.
   
6. **Person who's sport is swimming is in an even position**:
   - The person who's sport is swimming must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 8.
   - Since positions 2 and 4 are occupied, the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 6.
   
7. **Person who's sport is surfing is in the middle**:
   - The person who's sport is surfing must be in position 4.
   - But we already determined that the person who's sport is golf is in position 4, so there's a contradiction unless we re-evaluate.
   - Let's correct: the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 4, and the person who's sport is golf must be in position 3.
   
8. **Person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the fan of salsa**:
   - The person who's sport is climbing must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since indie is in position 1, the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 1.
   
9. **Person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the fan of pop**:
   - The fan of pop is in position 5, so the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 4 or 6.
   - Since the person who's sport is golf is in position 3 and the person who's sport is swimming is in position 6, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 4.
   
10. **Person who's sport is tennis is the fan of pop**:
    - This is consistent with our previous steps.
    
11. **Person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the fan of salsa**:
    - This is consistent with our previous steps.

15. **7up is next to golf (3).**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Rugby is in position 4 and is 7up (clue 11).**
   - Beverage 4: 7up
   - Sport 4: Rugby

2. **Rugby is next to juice (clue 4), so juice must be in position 3 or 5.**
   - Since Rugby is in 4, Juice must be in 3.
   - Beverage 3: Juice

3. **Cola is next to juice (clue 2), so Cola must be in position 2 or 5.**
   - Since Juice is in 3, Cola must be in 2.
   - Beverage 2: Cola

4. **Almond-milk is right of hot-chocolate (clue 7), so hot-chocolate must be in position 5, and almond-milk in 6.**
   - Beverage 5: Hot-chocolate
   - Beverage 6: Almond-milk

5. **Coffee is in an even position (clue 6), so Coffee must be in 2, 4, or 6.**
   - Since 2 is Cola, 4 is 7up, and 6 is Almond-milk, Coffee must be in 6.
   - Beverage 6: Coffee

6. **Parkour is in the middle (clue 5), so Parkour must be in 4.**
   - But we already have 7up in 4, which means there's a contradiction unless we reassess. Let's check other positions.
   - Since 7up is in 4, Parkour must be in 3, but we already have Juice in 3. Thus, let's recheck.

7. **Rugby is left of parkour (clue 8), so Parkour must be in 5.**
   - Beverage 5: Parkour

8. **Fanta is left of badminton (clue 9), so Fanta must be in 1, 2, or 3.**
   - Since 2 is Cola and 3 is Juice, Fanta must be in 1.
   - Beverage 1: Fanta

9. **Badminton is next to almond-milk (clue 12), so Badminton must be in 5 or 6.**
   - Since 5 is Parkour and 6 is Almond-milk, Badminton must be in 5.
   - But 5 is already Parkour, so Badminton must be in 6.
   - Sport 6: Badminton

10. **Badminton is left of handball (clue 3), so Handball must be in 7.**
    - Sport 7: Handball

11. **Basketball is right of coffee (clue 13), so Basketball must be in 7.**
    - But Handball is in 7, so this must be reassessed. Let's check again.

12. **7up is left of coffee (clue 14), so Coffee must be in 6, but it's already in 6.**

13. **7up is next to golf (clue 15), so Golf must be in 3 or 5.**
    - Since 3 is Juice and 5 is Parkour, Golf must be in 3.
    - Sport 3: Golf

14. **Final check and placement:**
    - Beverage 1: Fanta
    - Beverage 2: Cola
    - Beverage 3: Juice
    - Beverage 4: 7up
    - Beverage 5: Parkour
    - Beverage 6: Coffee
    - Beverage 7: Almond-milk

    - Sport 1: Handball
    - Sport 2: Basketball
    - Sport 3: Golf
    - Sport 4: Rugby (7up)
    - Sport 5: Parkour
    - Sport 6: Badminton
    - Sport 7: Handball (recheck)

Lv4-2x7-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the Clues

1. The security-guard is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket.
2. The person who's sport is biathlon is between the person who's sport is cycling and the fisherman.
3. The security-guard is on the far left or far right.
4. The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the doctor.
5. The person who's sport is baseball is in an odd position.
6. The fisherman is in an odd position.
7. The software-developer is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing.
8. The entrepreneur is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket.
9. The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
10. The police-officer is the person who's sport is biathlon.
11. The entrepreneur is between the software-developer and the person who's sport is cricket.

### Step 2: Deduce Positions

From clue 3:
- The security-guard must be in position 1 or 7.

From clue 10:
- The police-officer has biathlon as their sport.

From clue 9:
- The person with basketball is to the right of the biathlete (police-officer).

From clue 2:
- Biathlon is between cycling and fishing. Since the police-officer has biathlon, cycling and fishing must be adjacent to each other, but we need more information to determine their exact order.

From clue 6:
- The fisherman is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

From clue 4:
- The person with surfing is on the left of the doctor, and they are in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

From clue 7:
- The software-developer is on the left of the person with surfing.

From clue 5:
- The person with baseball is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

From clue 8:
- The entrepreneur is on the left or right of the person with cricket.

From clue 11:
- The entrepreneur is between the software-developer and the person with cricket.

### Step 3: Assign Sports and Jobs

Let's start placing the sports and jobs based on the constraints:

1. Security-guard must be at position 1 or 7 (clue 3).
2. Police-officer (biathlon) can't be in position 1 or 7 due to clue 3.
3. Fisherman must be in an odd position (clue 6).
4. Surfing must be in an odd position and to the right of the doctor (clue 4).
5. Baseball and cricket must be in odd positions (clue 5 and 8).

Considering all these constraints, let's try:

- Position 1: Security-guard
- Position 3: Fisherman
- Position 5: Baseball
- Position 7: Cricket

This leaves positions 2, 4, and 6 for the remaining sports and jobs.

Now, let's place the sports:

- Position 2: Cycling
- Position 4: Basketball
- Position 6: Surfing

Since the software-developer must be to the left of surfing, they must be in position 2 or 4. But since basketball is in position 4, the software-developer must be in position 2.

- Software-developer: Position 2 (cycling)
- Entrepreneur: Between software-developer and cricket (clue 11), so they must be in position 4 (basketball).

Finally, the doctor must be in position 6 (surfing).

So, the arrangement is:

- Position 1: Security-guard
- Position 2: Software-developer (cycling)
- Position 3: Fisherman
- Position 4: Entrepreneur (baseball)
- Position 5: Police-officer (biathlon)
- Position 6: Doctor (surfing)
- Position 7: Cricket

Lv4-2x7-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The fan of house is in an even position (4).
2. The fan of house is on the right of the owner of the mouse.
3. The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of house.
4. The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
5. The fan of trance is between the fan of r&b and the owner of the cat.
6. The owner of the hamster is on the far left or far right.
7. The fan of country is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.
8. The owner of the rabbit is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.
9. The fan of country is on the far left.
10. The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of trance.
11. The fan of funk is in an even position (4).
12. The owner of the fish is the fan of r&b.
13. The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Fan of House in Position 4**:
   - House fan = 4

2. **Fan of House on Right of Owner of Mouse**:
   - Mouse owner ≠ 4, and House fan (4) must be to the right of Mouse owner.

3. **Fan of Rock on Left of Fan of House**:
   - Rock fan < 4

4. **Owner of Ferret on Left or Right of Fan of R&B**:
   - R&B fan can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.

5. **Fan of Trance Between R&B and Owner of Cat**:
   - R&B fan and Cat owner must have Trance fan between them.

6. **Owner of Hamster on Far Left or Far Right**:
   - Hamster owner = 1 or 7.

7. **Fan of Country on Left or Right of Owner of Frog**:
   - Frog owner and Country fan can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.

8. **Owner of Rabbit on Left or Right of Owner of Frog**:
   - Rabbit owner and Frog owner can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.

9. **Fan of Country on Far Left**:
   - Country fan = 1.

10. **Fan of House on Left or Right of Fan of Trance**:
    - Trance fan and House fan (4) must be adjacent.

11. **Fan of Funk in Even Position (4)**:
    - Funk fan = 4 (same as House fan).

12. **Owner of Fish is Fan of R&B**:
    - R&B fan = Fish owner.

13. **Owner of Cat on Left or Right of Owner of Ferret**:
    - Cat owner and Ferret owner must be adjacent.

### Final Table Setup:

We start with:
- **Country fan = 1**
- **House fan = 4**
- **Funk fan = 4**

Since House fan is at 4, and it's on the right of the owner of the mouse, the mouse owner cannot be 4. Also, since House fan is on the left of the fan of rock, the rock fan must be 3.

Given the constraints, let's place the remaining elements:

1. **Hamster owner = 1 or 7**: Since Country fan is at 1, Hamster owner = 7.
2. **R&B fan = Fish owner**: R&B fan can be 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7. Since Hamster owner is 7, R&B fan = 2 (Fish owner).
3. **Trance fan between R&B and Cat owner**: Since R&B fan is 2, Trance fan must be 3 (Rock fan is 3), and Cat owner must be 5 (since 3 is between 2 and 5).
4. **Owner of Ferret on left or right of R&B**: Since R&B fan is 2, Ferret owner can be 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Given the adjacency and other constraints, Ferret owner = 6.
5. **Owner of Rabbit on left or right of Frog owner**: Since Frog owner and Rabbit owner must be adjacent, and they can't be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7 (already taken), they must be 6 and 7. Since Ferret owner is 6, Rabbit owner = 7 (Hamster owner).

### Final Solution:

```plaintext
#############
|               |    1    |  2   |   3   |   4   |   5    |  6   |    7    |
