Let's start filling the table:

|               |     1      |       2       |      3       |      4      |     5      |     6      |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Food          |            |               |              |             |            |            |
| Hobby         |            |               |              |             |            |            |
| Job           |            |               |              |             |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |               |              |             |            |            |
| Pet           |            |               |              |             |            |            |
| Transport     |            |               |              |             |            |            |

### Step-by-Step Filling:

1. **Clue 3:** The person driving the van is the person eating kale. So, van = 3, kale = 3.
   - |               |     1      |       2       | **3**       |      4      |     5      |     6      |
   - | ------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
   - | Food          |            |               | **kale**    |             |            |            |
   - | Hobby         |            |               | **van**     |             |            |            |
   - | Job           |            |               | **van**     |             |            |            |
   - | Nationality   |            |               | **van**     |             |            |            |
   - | Pet           |            |               | **van**     |             |            |            |
   - | Transport     |            |               | **van**     |             |            |            |

2. **Clue 16:** The Argentine is in an even position. So, Argentine = 2 or 4 or 6.
3. **Clue 1:** The Argentine is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage. So, if Argentine = 2, cabbage can be 1 or 3; if Argentine = 4, cabbage can be 3 or 5; if Argentine = 6, cabbage can be 5 or 7 (but 7 is not possible).

4. **Clue 17:** The Mexican is the owner of the rabbit. So, Mexican = 1, 3, 5, or 6.
5. **Clue 19:** The firefighter is the Mexican. So, Mexican = 1, 3, 5, or 6.

Combining Clues 16 and 19:
- If Argentine = 2, then Mexican = 4 or 6.
- If Argentine = 4, then Mexican = 2 or 6.
- If Argentine = 6, then Mexican = 2 or 4.

Since Mexican cannot be 6 (because it must be in an odd position), we have:
- If Argentine = 2, then Mexican = 4.
- If Argentine = 4, then Mexican = 2.
- If Argentine = 6, then Mexican = 2 or 4.

6. **Clue 21:** The Dutch is the person driving the roller. So, Dutch = 1, 3, 5, or 6.
7. **Clue 2:** The person driving the roller is on the far left or far right. So, Dutch = 1 or 6.
8. **Clue 20:** The owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, if Dutch = 1, then roller = 6; if Dutch = 6, then roller = 1.

Since Dutch = 1 or 6 and roller = 1 or 6, we can deduce:
- If Dutch = 1, then roller = 6.
- If Dutch = 6, then roller = 1.

Let's assume Dutch = 1, roller = 6:
- |               |     1      |       2       | **3**       |      4      |     5      | **6**      |
- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
- | Food          |            |               | **kale**    |             |            |            |
- | Hobby         |            |               | **van**     |             |            |            |
- | Job           |            |               | **van**     |             |            |            |
- | Nationality   |            |               | **van**     |             |            |            |
- | Pet           |            |               | **van**     |             |            |            |
- | Transport     | **Dutch**  |               | **van**     |             |            | **roller** |

Continuing with other clues and filling the table step-by-step, we get:

|               |     1      |       2       |      3      |      4      |     5      |     6      |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Food          | apricot   |               | kale       |             |            |            |
| Hobby         | dancing   |               | van        |             |            |            |
| Job           | hiking    |               | van        |             |            |            |
| Nationality   | mexican   |               | van        |             |            |            |
| Pet           | rabbit    |               | van        |             |            |            |

After solving all the clues, we get the final solution:

```
|               |     1      |       2       |      3      |      4      |     5      |     6      |
