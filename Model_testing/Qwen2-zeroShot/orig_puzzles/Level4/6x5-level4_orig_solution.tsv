Lv4-6x5-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Positioning Clues
1. The fisherman is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
2. The person watching musical movies is on the far left or far right.
3. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the coach.
4. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
5. The fisherman is in an even position.
6. The person watching family movies is the fan of blues.
7. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the security-guard.
8. The coach is in the middle (position 3).
9. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the coach.
10. The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
11. The person driving the boat is on the left of the fan of electronic.
12. The person who's hobby is skydiving is the person watching sports movies.

14. The fan of blues is on the left of the fan of classical.
15. The person who's hobby is board-games is between the person driving the boat and the owner of the rat.

### Step 2: Deductions from Clues
From clue 5, the fisherman must be in positions 2 or 4 (even positions).

From clue 1, if the fisherman is in position 2, the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 3 (the middle), but that contradicts clue 8 (coach in the middle). Therefore, the fisherman must be in position 4, and the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 5.

From clue 4, the person with the hobby of board-games must be in position 1 (leftmost) or 2 (since the coach is in the middle and the person with the hobby of board-games is to the left of the coach).

From clue 6, the person watching musical movies must be in position 1 or 5.

From clue 2, the owner of the lizard must be to the right of the fan of funk. Since the fan of funk cannot be in position 5 (as it would not leave room for the person watching musical movies), the fan of funk can only be in position 1, 2, or 3. The owner of the lizard must then be in position 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 7, the person watching family movies is the fan of blues, so the fan of blues must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (since the person watching musical movies is either in position 1 or 5).

From clue 10, the fisherman is in position 4, and the person driving the jet-ski is in position 5.

From clue 11, the person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. This does not directly help yet, but will be useful later.

From clue 12, the person with the hobby of writing is on the left or right of the coach (position 3).

From clue 13, the person with the hobby of skydiving is on the left of the security-guard. This means the security-guard must be in position 4 or 5 (but we already know the fisherman and the person driving the jet-ski are there).

From clue 14, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is the police-officer, and the police-officer must be in position 3 (coach).

From clue 15, the person watching sports movies is the owner of the dog, and the person watching sports movies is also the person with the hobby of skydiving.

From clue 16, the photographer is on the left of the person driving the van, so the photographer must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the person driving the van must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 17, the person watching musical movies is the owner of the hedgehog.

From clue 18, the person with the hobby of skydiving is the person watching sports movies.

From clue 19, the person watching sports movies is the owner of the dog.

From clue 20, the fan of blues is on the left of the fan of classical.

From clue 21, the coach is in the middle (position 3).

From clue 22, the person driving the boat is on the left of the fan of electronic.

From clue 23, the person with the hobby of board-games is between the person driving the boat and the owner of the rat.

### Final Solution:
Based on all these deductions, the final arrangement is:

| Hobby          | Job            | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre | Pet           | Transport     |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|

| Camping        | Police-officer | Musical       | Classical   | Rabbit        | Jet-ski       |
| Magic-tricks   | Coach          | Scientific    | Funk        | Lizard        | Motorbike     |
| Skydiving      | Security-guard | Sports        | Pop         | Dog           | Taxi          |
| Writing        | Fisherman      | Drama         | Electronic  | Rat           | Van           |
|                | Fan of Blues   |               |             |               |               |
