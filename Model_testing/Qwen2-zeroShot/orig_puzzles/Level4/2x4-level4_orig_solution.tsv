Lv4-2x4-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and use it to fill in the table step-by-step.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.**
2. **The person drinking 7up is on the left of the owner of the goat.**
3. **The person drinking water is in an odd position.**
4. **The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse.**
5. **The person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5:
- The person drinking 7up is either in position 1 or 4.
- Let's assume the person drinking 7up is in position 1 (we will test both positions later).

#### Clue 3:
- The person drinking water is in an odd position.
- Therefore, the person drinking water must be in position 1 or 3.
- Since position 1 is already taken by the person drinking 7up, the person drinking water must be in position 3.

#### Clue 2:
- The person drinking 7up (position 1) is on the left of the owner of the goat.
- This means the owner of the goat cannot be in position 1, so the owner of the goat must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
- If the owner of the mouse is in position 1, then the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2.
- However, since position 1 is occupied by the person drinking 7up, the owner of the mouse cannot be in position 1.

#### Clue 4:
- The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse.
- Given the positions we have so far, let's place the owner of the mouse in position 2 (since it's the only available position for now).
- Then the owner of the horse can be in position 1 or 3, but position 1 is taken by the person drinking 7up, so the owner of the horse must be in position 3.

Now, let's summarize the positions:

- Position 1: 7up
- Position 2: Mouse
- Position 3: Horse
- Position 4: Water

We need to assign the beverages and pets:

1. **Beverages:**
   - Position 1: 7up
   - Position 2: Lemonade (since the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person drinking lemonade)
   - Position 3: Coffee (since the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse, and the only remaining beverage is coffee)
   - Position 4: Water

2. **Pets:**
   - Position 1: Goat (since the person drinking 7up is on the left of the owner of the goat)
   - Position 2: Mouse
   - Position 3: Horse
   - Position 4: Dog (since the only remaining pet is the dog)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |  1  |   2    |   3   |    4     |
| Beverage   | 7up | Lemonade| Coffee|  Water   |
| Pet        | Goat| Mouse   | Horse |  Dog    |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv4-2x4-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching musical movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.
2. **Clue 2**: The French is on the left of the Nigerian.
3. **Clue 3**: The Nigerian is in an odd position (1 or 3).
4. **Clue 4**: The French is the person watching crime movies.
5. **Clue 5**: The German is on the right of the Nigerian.
6. **Clue 6**: The French is the person watching crime movies.

From Clues 4 and 6, we know that the French person is watching crime movies.

From Clue 2, since the French is on the left of the Nigerian, and the Nigerian is in an odd position (Clue 3), the possible positions for the Nigerian are 1 or 3.

- If the Nigerian is in position 1, then the French must be in position 2 (since the French is to the left of the Nigerian). But this would place the German in position 3 or 4 (to the right of the Nigerian), which would leave no valid position for the person watching musical or superhero movies.
- Therefore, the Nigerian must be in position 3, and the French must be in position 2.

So, the Nigerian is in position 3, and the French is in position 2. Since the French is watching crime movies, the Nigerian cannot be watching crime movies.

From Clue 1, the person watching musical movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. This means:
- Position 1 must be either musical or superhero.
- Position 2 (French) must be crime.
- Position 3 (Nigerian) must be either musical or superhero.
- Position 4 must be the other genre (superhero if position 1 is musical, or musical if position 1 is superhero).

Since the Nigerian is in position 3 and the French is in position 2, the remaining positions (1 and 4) must be filled with musical and superhero. Given that the person in position 1 must be on the left of the person in position 3, and considering the order from Clue 1, the only valid arrangement is:
- Position 1: Musical
- Position 3: Superhero
- Position 4: Scientific (the only remaining genre)

Thus, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |     1      |   2    |    3     |     4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical    | Crime  | Superhero| Scientific|
| Nationality   | French     | Russian| Nigerian | German    |

Lv4-2x4-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the person watching western movies.**
   - This means that if someone is eating watermelon, they are either to the left or to the right of the person who is watching western movies.

2. **The person eating pomegranate is in an even position.**
   - This means the person eating pomegranate must be in position 2 or 4.

3. **The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person eating grapes.**
   - This means that if someone is watching western movies, they are either to the left or to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

4. **The person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching spy movies.**
   - This means the person watching western movies is in a position to the right of the person watching spy movies.

5. **The person watching animation movies is in an odd position.**
   - This means the person watching animation movies must be in position 1 or 3.

6. **The person eating grapes is on the right of the person eating pomegranate.**
   - This means the person eating grapes must be in a position to the right of the person eating pomegranate.

### Filling in the Table:

Given the constraints, let's start filling in the table:

- From constraint 2, the person eating pomegranate is in position 2 or 4.
- From constraint 5, the person watching animation movies is in position 1 or 3.

Since the person eating pomegranate is in an even position (2 or 4), and the person watching animation movies is in an odd position (1 or 3), the only way to satisfy both is:
- The person eating pomegranate is in position 2.
- The person watching animation movies is in position 1.

Now, we have:
```
|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |      4      |
| Food          | Animation  | Pomegranate |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |            |             |           |             |
```

Next, let's place the remaining items:

- From constraint 4, the person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching spy movies. This means the person watching western movies cannot be in position 1 or 2 because those positions are already taken. So, the person watching spy movies must be in position 3, and the person watching western movies must be in position 4.
- From constraint 6, the person eating grapes is on the right of the person eating pomegranate. Since the person eating pomegranate is in position 2, the person eating grapes must be in position 3 or 4. But since position 3 is occupied by the person watching spy movies, the person eating grapes must be in position 4.
- From constraint 1, the person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since the person watching western movies is in position 4, the person eating watermelon must be in position 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
```
|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |      4      |
| Food          | Animation  | Pomegranate | Grapes   | Watermelon |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy        |             | Western  | Documentary |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |      4      |
| Food          | Animation  | Pomegranate | Grapes   | Watermelon |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy        |             | Western  | Documentary |

Lv4-2x4-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is drawing is between the fan of blues and the fan of reggae.**
   - This means the order for these three (drawing, blues, reggae) must be either:
     - Blues -> Drawing -> Reggae
     - Reggae -> Drawing -> Blues

2. **The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.**
   - This means woodworking cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and cooking cannot be in position 1.

3. **The fan of indie is in an odd position.**
   - Indie can only be in positions 1 or 3.

4. **The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of reggae.**
   - This means if someone is a fan of folk, the next person must be a fan of reggae.

5. **The fan of folk is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of cooking must be to the left of the person who is a fan of folk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Indie must be in an odd position:**
   - Possible positions for indie: 1 or 3.

2. **Fan of folk is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking:**
   - Let's denote the person with cooking as C and the person with folk as F.
   - If C is in position 1, then F must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - If C is in position 2, then F must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If C is in position 3, then F must be in position 4.

3. **Fan of folk is on the left of the fan of reggae:**
   - This means if F is in position 2, R must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If F is in position 3, R must be in position 4.

4. **Drawing is between blues and reggae:**
   - Possible orders: Blues -> Drawing -> Reggae or Reggae -> Drawing -> Blues.

5. **Woodworking is on the left of cooking:**
   - W must be in positions 1 or 2, and C must be in positions 2 or 3.

### Combining Clues:

- Since indie is in an odd position (1 or 3), let's start with indie in position 1:
  - Position 1: Indie
  - This leaves positions 2, 3, and 4 for the other hobbies and music genres.

- If indie is in position 1, then:
  - Cooking must be in position 3 or 4 (since woodworking is on the left of cooking).
  - Folk must be to the right of cooking, so if cooking is in position 3, folk must be in position 4.
  - Folk is on the left of reggae, so reggae must be in position 4.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Indie
- Position 3: Cooking
- Position 4: Folk and Reggae (Folk on the left of Reggae)

Since folk and reggae must be in positions 3 and 4, and drawing must be between blues and reggae, we have two possibilities:
- Blues -> Drawing -> Reggae
- Reggae -> Drawing -> Blues

Given that folk is on the left of reggae, the only valid sequence is:
- Blues -> Drawing -> Reggae

So the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Indie
- Position 2: Woodworking (left of cooking)
- Position 3: Cooking
- Position 4: Folk and Reggae (Folk on the left of Reggae)

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|               |      1      |    2    |    3    |    4    |
| Hobby         | Indie       | Woodwork| Cooking | Folk    |
| Music-Genre   | Blues       | Drawing | Reggae  |        |

Lv4-2x4-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 4**: The fan of hip-hop is on the far left.
   - This means Hip-Hop is in position 1.

2. **Clue 2**: The Australian is the fan of punk.
   - This means Punk is in position 2.

3. **Clue 5**: The fan of jazz is in an odd position and it is also to the right of the Russian.
   - Since the fan of jazz is in an odd position, it can only be in position 1 or 3. But since position 1 is occupied by Hip-Hop, the fan of jazz must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, Jazz is in position 3 and the Russian cannot be in position 1 (since position 3 is occupied by Jazz).

4. **Clue 1**: The fan of jazz is on the right of the Russian.
   - Since Jazz is in position 3, the Russian must be in position 1 or 2.
   - But Hip-Hop is in position 1, so the Russian must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 3**: The Indian is on the right of the fan of folk.
   - Since the Russian is in position 2 and the Australian is in position 2 (Clue 2), the Indian cannot be in position 2.
   - The only remaining positions for the Indian are 3 or 4. But position 3 is occupied by Jazz, so the Indian must be in position 4.
   - Therefore, the fan of folk must be in position 3, which is already occupied by Jazz. This means there's a contradiction unless we reconsider the positions.

Let's recheck:
- Position 1: Hip-Hop
- Position 2: Russian
- Position 3: Jazz (from Clue 5)
- Position 4: Indian (from the above reasoning)

Since the Indian is in position 4 and the fan of folk must be to the left of the Indian, the fan of folk must be in position 3, but that's already occupied by Jazz. This indicates a misinterpretation. Let's correct it:

Revisiting Clue 3:
- The fan of folk must be to the left of the Indian, who is in position 4.
- The only possible position for the fan of folk is position 2, making the Indian in position 4.

So, the correct positions are:
- Position 1: Hip-Hop
- Position 2: Folk
- Position 3: Jazz
- Position 4: Indian

Now, let's assign the nationalities based on the clues:
- Clue 2: The Australian is the fan of punk, so the Australian must be in position 2.
- Clue 6: The American is on the far left or far right, and since position 1 is Hip-Hop, the American must be in position 4 (the other option being position 1, which is taken by Hip-Hop).
- The remaining nationality (Russian) must be in position 2, which contradicts our previous placement of the Australian.

Revising again:
- Position 1: Hip-Hop
- Position 2: Russian (from Clue 1 and 2)
- Position 3: Jazz
- Position 4: Indian

And the nationalities:
- Position 1 (Hip-Hop): American
- Position 2 (Russian): Australian
- Position 3 (Jazz): Indian
- Position 4 (Folk): American

Final solution:

```
|               |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4      |
| Music-Genre   | Hip-Hop  | Russian | Jazz   | Folk       |
| Nationality   | American | Australian | Indian | American  |

Lv4-2x4-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The Italian is in an even position (2 or 4).**
2. **The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the Italian.**
   - If the Italian is in position 2, then the person watching time-travel must be in position 4.
   - If the Italian is in position 4, then there would be no room for the time-travel movie watcher to be on the right, so the Italian must be in position 2.
3. **The person watching epic movies is in an odd position (1 or 3).**
4. **The Indonesian is on the left of the person watching animation movies.**
5. **The Japanese is on the left or right of the Indonesian.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Italian:**
   - The Italian is in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 4.

2. **Positioning the Epic Movie Watcher:**
   - The epic movie watcher is in an odd position (1 or 3).
   - Since position 1 and 3 are still available, we need to place the epic movie watcher in one of these positions.

3. **Placing the Indonesian and Animation Watcher:**
   - The Indonesian is on the left of the person watching animation movies.
   - This means the Indonesian must be in a position to the left of the animation watcher.

4. **Placing the Japanese:**
   - The Japanese is on the left or right of the Indonesian.
   - We need to ensure that this condition is met while satisfying all other conditions.

### Possible Arrangements:

Let's start with placing the Italian in position 2 and the time-travel watcher in position 4:

| Movie-Genre |     1     |      2      |      3      |     4     |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Nationality |           | Italian     |             | time-travel |

Now, let's place the epic movie watcher in position 1 or 3:

#### Case 1: Epic Movie Watcher in Position 1
- The Indonesian cannot be in position 1 because it needs to be to the left of the animation watcher.
- Therefore, the epic movie watcher must be in position 3.

| Movie-Genre |     1     |      2      |      3      |     4     |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Nationality | epic      | Italian     |             | time-travel |

Now, we need to place the Indonesian and the animation watcher:
- The Indonesian must be to the left of the animation watcher.
- The Japanese can be on the left or right of the Indonesian.

Since position 1 is taken by the epic movie watcher, the Indonesian can only be in position 3 or 4. But position 4 is already occupied by the time-travel watcher, so the Indonesian must be in position 3.

This places the Indonesian in position 3, which means the animation watcher must be in position 4, but position 4 is already occupied by the time-travel watcher. This is a contradiction.

#### Case 2: Epic Movie Watcher in Position 3
- The Indonesian must be in position 1 (since it needs to be to the left of the animation watcher).

| Movie-Genre |     1     |      2      |      3      |     4     |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Nationality | Indonesian | Italian     | epic        | time-travel |

Now, the Japanese can be in position 2 or 4. Since position 2 is occupied by the Italian, the Japanese must be in position 4.

| Movie-Genre |     1     |      2      |      3      |     4     |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Nationality | Indonesian | Italian     | epic        | time-travel |

And the animation watcher must be in position 1.

| Movie-Genre |     1     |      2      |      3      |     4     |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Nationality | animation | Italian     | epic        | time-travel |

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions.

### Final Solution:

```
| Movie-Genre |     1     |      2      |      3      |     4     |

Lv4-2x4-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
1. The person driving the ship is in an odd position.
2. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the car.
3. The person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.
4. The person driving the ship is the person watching epic movies.
5. The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person driving the car.
6. The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the car.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of the Ship Driver
From clue 1, the person driving the ship is in an odd position. Therefore, the person driving the ship must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2: Ship Driver is Watching Epic Movies
From clue 4, the person driving the ship is also the person watching epic movies.

So, position 1 or 3 must have ""epic"" and ""ship"".

#### Step 3: Position of the Roller Driver
From clue 2, the person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the car. This means the person driving the roller cannot be in position 4.

#### Step 4: Position of the Car Driver
From clue 6, the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the car. This means the person driving the car cannot be in position 4.

#### Step 5: Position of Western and Mystery Movies
From clue 3, the person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. This means if one is in position 1, the other must be in position 2.

#### Step 6: Combining Clues
Given that the ship driver (position 1 or 3) is watching epic movies, let's assume the ship driver is in position 1 (we will check this assumption later).

- Position 1: ""epic"" and ""ship""
- Position 2: ""western"" (since it has to be on the left of ""mystery"")
- Position 3: ""mystery"" (since it has to be on the right of ""western"")
- Position 4: ""family"" (remaining genre)

Now we need to fit the transports into these positions:

- From clue 2, the roller driver is on the left of the car driver.
- From clue 6, the quad-bike driver is on the right of the car driver.

This means:
- Position 2 can only be ""western"" (as it fits the left-right requirement for the car and quad-bike).
- Position 3 can only be ""mystery"" (as it fits the left-right requirement for the car and quad-bike).
- Position 4 can only be ""family"" (remaining genre).

So far, the table looks like this:
```
| Movie-Genre | 1   | 2    | 3    | 4     |
|-------------|-----|------|------|-------|
| Transport   |     |      |      |       |
|             | epic| western| mystery| family|
```

Now, we place the transports based on the remaining clues:

- From clue 2, the roller driver is on the left of the car driver.
- From clue 6, the quad-bike driver is on the right of the car driver.

Since the car driver cannot be in position 4 (clue 6), and the roller driver cannot be in position 4 (clue 2), the only possible placements are:
- Position 1: ""ship""
- Position 2: ""car""
- Position 3: ""quad-bike""
- Position 4: ""roller""

Thus, the final table is:
```
| Movie-Genre | 1   | 2    | 3    | 4     |
|-------------|-----|------|------|-------|
| Transport   | ship| car  | quad-bike| roller|
|             | epic| western| mystery| family|
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Movie-Genre | 1   | 2    | 3    | 4     |
|-------------|-----|------|------|-------|
| Transport   | ship| car  | quad-bike| roller|
|             | epic| western| mystery| family|

Lv4-2x4-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the pilot.
2. The teacher is in an odd position.
3. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the teacher.
4. The teacher is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
5. The coach is between the teacher and the pilot.
6. The owner of the fish is in an odd position.
7. The owner of the fish is between the coach and the owner of the goat.
8. The coach is on the left or right of the pilot.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of the Teacher
- From clue 2, the teacher must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

#### Step 2: Position of the Owner of the Guinea-Pig
- From clue 4, the teacher is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
- Therefore, if the teacher is in position 3, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 1.
- If the teacher is in position 1, this would contradict clue 4 because there would be no room for the owner of the guinea-pig to be on the left of the teacher.
- Hence, the teacher must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|       |   1   |     2      |    3    |        4        |
| Job   |       |            |  Teacher|                 |
| Pet   |       |            |         |                 |
```

#### Step 3: Position of the Owner of the Guinea-Pig
- From clue 4, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 1.
```
|       |   1   |     2      |    3    |        4        |
| Job   |       |            |  Teacher|                 |
| Pet   | Guinea-pig |            |         |                 |
```

#### Step 4: Position of the Coach
- From clue 5, the coach is between the teacher and the pilot.
- Since the teacher is in position 3, the coach must be in position 2 and the pilot in position 4.
```
|       |   1   |     2      |    3    |        4        |
| Job   |       | Coach      |  Teacher|  Pilot          |
| Pet   | Guinea-pig |            |         |                 |
```

#### Step 5: Position of the Owner of the Fish
- From clue 6, the owner of the fish is in an odd position.
- The only odd positions left are 1 and 3.
- Since position 1 is already occupied by the owner of the guinea-pig, the owner of the fish must be in position 3.
- However, position 3 is occupied by the teacher, so the owner of the fish must be in position 1.
```
|       |   1   |     2      |    3    |        4        |
| Job   | Fish  | Coach      |  Teacher|  Pilot          |
| Pet   | Guinea-pig |            |         |                 |
```

#### Step 6: Position of the Owner of the Goat
- From clue 7, the owner of the fish is between the coach and the owner of the goat.
- The owner of the fish is in position 1 and the coach is in position 2.
- Therefore, the owner of the goat must be in position 4.
```
|       |   1   |     2      |    3    |        4        |
| Job   | Fish  | Coach      |  Teacher|  Pilot          |
| Pet   | Guinea-pig |            |         | Goat            |
```

#### Step 7: Position of the Project Manager
- The only job left is the project manager, which must be in position 2.
```
|       |   1   |     2      |    3    |        4        |
| Job   | Fish  | Project Manager |  Teacher|  Pilot          |
| Pet   | Guinea-pig |            |         | Goat            |
```

Lv4-2x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the information into the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage.**
   - This means the positions of the person eating pepper and the person eating cabbage must be adjacent to each other.

2. **The person eating cabbage is on the right of the person eating mango.**
   - This means the person eating mango must be in a position to the left of the person eating cabbage.

3. **The owner of the cat is between the owner of the hamster and the person eating pepper.**
   - This means the owner of the cat is in the middle of the owner of the hamster and the person eating pepper.

4. **The owner of the cat is in an odd position.**
   - Since there are four positions (1, 2, 3, 4), the possible odd positions for the owner of the cat are 1 or 3.

5. **The person eating pepper is the owner of the mouse.**
   - The person eating pepper owns the mouse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning Cabbage and Pepper:**
   - From clue 2, we know the person eating mango is to the left of the person eating cabbage.
   - From clue 1, the person eating pepper is adjacent to the person eating cabbage.
   - Therefore, the only possible positions for the person eating cabbage and the person eating pepper are:
     - Cabbage at 2, Pepper at 1 (since 1 and 2 are adjacent)
     - Cabbage at 3, Pepper at 4 (since 3 and 4 are adjacent)

2. **Positioning Cat and Hamster:**
   - From clue 3, the owner of the cat is between the owner of the hamster and the person eating pepper.
   - From clue 4, the owner of the cat is in an odd position (1 or 3).

   Let's test both possibilities from the previous step:
   
   - If Cabbage is at 2 and Pepper is at 1:
     - The person eating mango must be at 1 (leftmost) or 2 (right of the person eating cabbage).
     - The owner of the cat must be at 3 (since it is between the owner of the hamster and the person eating pepper, who is at 1).
     - This would place the owner of the hamster at 4 (since the owner of the cat is at 3 and the person eating pepper is at 1).

   - If Cabbage is at 3 and Pepper is at 4:
     - The person eating mango must be at 2 (right of the person eating cabbage).
     - The owner of the cat must be at 1 (since it is between the owner of the hamster and the person eating pepper, who is at 4).
     - This would place the owner of the hamster at 2 (since the owner of the cat is at 1 and the person eating pepper is at 4).

3. **Assigning Foods and Pets:**
   - From clue 5, the person eating pepper is the owner of the mouse.
   - If Cabbage is at 2 and Pepper is at 1:
     - Person at 1 eats Pepper and owns Mouse.
     - Person at 2 eats Cabbage.
     - Person at 3 must eat Mango (since it is to the left of Cabbage).
     - Person at 4 must eat Watermelon (the remaining food).

   - If Cabbage is at 3 and Pepper is at 4:
     - Person at 1 eats Pepper and owns Mouse.
     - Person at 2 eats Mango.
     - Person at 3 eats Cabbage.
     - Person at 4 eats Watermelon.

Given that the owner of the cat must be in an odd position (1 or 3), the only valid solution is:

- **Cabbage at 2, Pepper at 4, Mango at 1, Watermelon at 3**
- **Owner of the cat at 1, Owner of the hamster at 3**

### Final Solution Table:

```
|        |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |
| Food   | Watermelon | Cabbage | Mango   | Pepper |
| Pet    | Cat        | Hamster | Turtle  | Mouse  |

Lv4-2x4-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking almond-milk is the fan of jazz.
2. The fan of disco is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
3. The fan of jazz is between the fan of disco and the person drinking juice.
4. The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position (positions 1 or 3).
5. The fan of jazz is on the left or right of the fan of disco.
6. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1:
- The person drinking almond-milk is the fan of jazz.

#### Clue 4:
- The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position (positions 1 or 3).

Since the person drinking almond-milk must be in an odd position, we have two possible positions for them: 1 or 3.

#### Clue 2:
- The fan of disco is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

If the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1, then the fan of disco would be in position 2. However, this does not fit with Clue 3 because there is no position 0 to place the fan of jazz between.

If the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3, then the fan of disco would be in position 4. This fits with Clue 3 since the fan of jazz can be placed in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 3: Almond-milk (Jazz fan)
- Position 4: Disco

#### Clue 3:
- The fan of jazz is between the fan of disco and the person drinking juice.

Given that the fan of jazz is in position 2, the fan of disco is in position 4, and the person drinking juice must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Juice
- Position 2: Jazz (Jazz fan)
- Position 3: Almond-milk (Jazz fan)
- Position 4: Disco

#### Clue 5:
- The fan of jazz is on the left or right of the fan of disco.

This is already satisfied as the fan of jazz is in position 2 and the fan of disco is in position 4.

#### Clue 6:
- The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep.

We need to assign cola and dubstep to the remaining positions. Since positions 1 and 4 are taken by juice and disco, and position 2 is taken by jazz, the only positions left are 2 and 3, but 2 is already taken by jazz. Therefore, cola and dubstep must be in positions 1 and 4, but we already have juice in position 1 and disco in position 4. So, we need to reassess:

- Position 1: Juice
- Position 2: Jazz (Jazz fan)
- Position 3: Almond-milk (Jazz fan)
- Position 4: Disco

Since cola and dubstep need to be in positions 2 and 3, and we already have jazz in position 2, the only remaining option is:
- Position 2: Cola
- Position 3: Dubstep

Thus, the final arrangement is:

|               |     1      |    2    |      3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | Juice      | Cola    | Dubstep     | Disco    |
| Music-Genre   | Jazz       | Jazz    | Jazz        | Disco    |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |      3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | Juice      | Cola    | Dubstep     | Disco    |
| Music-Genre   | Jazz       | Jazz    | Jazz        | Disco    |
