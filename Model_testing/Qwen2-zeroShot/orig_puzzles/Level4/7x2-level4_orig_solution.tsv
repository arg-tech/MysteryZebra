Lv4-7x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the appropriate categories. Let's break down the clues one by one:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person driving the bus.
   - This means the person with the hobby ""gardening"" is in position 1 (left) and the person driving the bus is in position 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is volleyball is in an odd position ##4.
   - This means the person playing volleyball is in either position 1 or 3. Since we already know that the person with the hobby ""gardening"" is in position 1, the person playing volleyball must be in position 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking sprite is on the left of the accountant.
   - This means the person drinking sprite is in position 1 and the accountant is in position 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching sports movies is on the left of the fan of classical.
   - This means the person watching sports movies is in position 1 and the fan of classical is in position 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 1, we know:
   - Position 1: Gardening
   - Position 2: Driving the bus

2. From Clue 2, we know:
   - Position 3: Volleyball

3. From Clue 3, we know:
   - Position 1: Drinking Sprite
   - Position 2: Accountant

4. From Clue 4, we know:
   - Position 1: Watching Sports Movies
   - Position 2: Fan of Classical

Now, let's combine all the information:

- Position 1: Gardening, Drinking Sprite, Watching Sports Movies
- Position 2: Driving the Bus, Accountant, Fan of Classical

Since there are only two positions for each category, and we have conflicting categories in position 1, we need to resolve these conflicts:

- Position 1: Gardening, Drinking Sprite, Watching Sports Movies
- Position 2: Driving the Bus, Accountant, Fan of Classical

Given the constraints, we can infer:
- Position 1: Gardening, Drinking Sprite, Watching Sports Movies
- Position 2: Driving the Bus, Accountant, Fan of Classical

This means:
- Position 1: Gardening, Drinking Sprite, Watching Sports Movies
- Position 2: Driving the Bus, Accountant, Fan of Classical

We now fill in the remaining categories:

- Position 3: Volleyball

Thus, the final table looks like this:

```

Lv4-7x2-2	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person watching adventure movies is on the far left or far right.
2. The owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating strawberry.
3. The person watching romance movies is in an odd position.
4. The Turkish is on the left of the manager.
5. The person drinking cola is in an even position.
6. The person driving the van is on the left of the person driving the ship.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Adventure Movies
Since the person watching adventure movies is on the far left or far right, we can place them in positions 1 or 7.

#### Step 2: Positioning Romance Movies
The person watching romance movies is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). This helps us to place them once we know more about other positions.

#### Step 3: Positioning Cola Drinkers
The person drinking cola is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

#### Step 4: Positioning Rat Owner
The owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating strawberry. This means if the rat owner is in position 1, the strawberry eater must be in position 2, and so on.

#### Step 5: Positioning Turkish and Manager
The Turkish is on the left of the manager. This means if the Turkish is in position 1, the manager must be in position 2, and so on.

#### Step 6: Positioning Van and Ship Drivers
The person driving the van is on the left of the person driving the ship. This means if the van driver is in position 1, the ship driver must be in position 2, and so on.

### Initial Placement Based on Clues:

Let's start by placing some known elements:

1. **Adventure Movies**: We can place this in either position 1 or 7.
2. **Cola Drinkers**: We can place this in positions 2, 4, or 6.
3. **Romance Movies**: We can place this in positions 1, 3, or 5.
4. **Rat Owner**: Must be on the left of the strawberry eater.
5. **Turkish and Manager**: Turkish is on the left of the manager.
6. **Van and Ship Drivers**: Van driver is on the left of the ship driver.

### Solving with Constraints:

1. Let's assume the adventure movie watcher is at position 1. Then the romance movie watcher must be in an odd position (3 or 5).
2. Since the cola drinker is in an even position, let's try position 2 for cola.
3. The rat owner must be on the left of the strawberry eater, so if the rat owner is in position 1, the strawberry eater must be in position 2, but that conflicts with the cola drinker being in position 2. So, let's try the rat owner in position 3 and the strawberry eater in position 4.
4. The Turkish must be on the left of the manager, so if the Turkish is in position 1, the manager must be in position 2, but that conflicts with the cola drinker being in position 2. So, let's try the Turkish in position 3 and the manager in position 4.
5. The van driver must be on the left of the ship driver, so if the van driver is in position 1, the ship driver must be in position 2, but that conflicts with the cola drinker being in position 2. So, let's try the van driver in position 3 and the ship driver in position 4.

Based on these constraints, let's fill in the table:

Lv4-7x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.**
   - This means that if someone likes video-games, they are in position 1, and the person who prefers rowing is in position 2.

2. **The owner of the hamster is in an odd position ##4.**
   - The hamster owner must be in position 1 or 3 (since these are the odd positions).

3. **The person watching musical movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee.**
   - This means that if someone watches musical movies, they are in position 1, and the person drinking coffee is in position 2.

4. **The paramedic is on the left or right of the journalist.**
   - The paramedic and journalist can be in any adjacent positions (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6).

5. **The paramedic is on the left of the person driving the car.**
   - The paramedic must be to the left of the person who drives a car.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's start with the positions:

- From clue 1, we know:
  - Position 1: Hobbie (Video-Games)
  - Position 2: Sport (Rowing)

- From clue 2, since the hamster owner is in an odd position, and we already have position 1 taken by Video-Games, the hamster owner must be in position 3.

- From clue 3, we know:
  - Position 1: Movie-Genre (Musical)
  - Position 2: Beverage (Coffee)

- From clue 4, the paramedic and journalist must be in adjacent positions, but we need to fit them with other clues.

- From clue 5, the paramedic must be to the left of the car driver.

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- We already have:
  - Position 1: Movie-Genre (Musical) and Hobbie (Video-Games)
  - Position 2: Beverage (Coffee) and Sport (Rowing)
  - Position 3: Pet (Hamster)

We need to place the remaining items (journalist, paramedic, job, pet, and transport) in positions 4, 5, and 6.

Given that the paramedic must be to the left of the car driver, and the journalist must be either to the left or right of the paramedic, let's try placing them:

- If we place the paramedic in position 1 and the journalist in position 2, the car driver must be in position 3.
- But this conflicts with the hamster owner being in position 3.

So, let's try placing the paramedic in position 2 and the journalist in position 3. The car driver must then be in position 4.

This gives us:
- Position 1: Movie-Genre (Musical)
- Position 2: Beverage (Coffee)
- Position 3: Pet (Hamster)
- Position 4: Transport (Car)
- Position 5: Job (Paramedic)
- Position 6: Job (Journalist)

Finally, the remaining sport (cycling) and pet (horse) can be placed in positions 1 and 2 respectively.

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |    Coffee   |   Water    |
| Hobby         |  Video-Games|   Reading  |
| Job           | Paramedic   | Journalist |
| Movie-Genre   |   Musical   |  Zombie    |
| Pet           |  Hamster    |   Horse    |
| Sport         |  Cycling    |   Rowing   |
| Transport     |    Car      | Snowmobile |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."

Lv4-7x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each category (Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Sport, Transport) into the table based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

1. **The fisherman is on the far right.**
   - This means the fisherman is in column 2.

2. **The owner of the lizard is on the right of the Russian.**
   - Since the fisherman is in column 2, the Russian cannot be in column 2. The only way for the owner of the lizard to be on the right of the Russian is if the Russian is in column 1 and the lizard owner is in column 2. However, since the fisherman is already in column 2, the Russian must be in column 1, and the lizard owner must be in column 2.

3. **The person watching romance movies is in an odd position.**
   - This means the person watching romance movies can only be in position 1 or 3. Given that the Russian is in position 1, the person watching romance movies must be in position 3.

4. **The person driving the car is the person watching mystery movies.**
   - This means the person in position 3 (watching mystery movies) is also driving the car.

5. **The British is the person who's sport is volleyball.**
   - This means the British person is in the sport column with volleyball.

6. **The fan of rock is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.**
   - Since the British is in the sport column with volleyball, the person who likes skateboarding must be either in position 1 or 2. If the person who likes skateboarding is in position 1, then the rock fan must be in position 2. If the person who likes skateboarding is in position 2, then the rock fan must be in position 1.

7. **The fisherman is on the far right.**
   - Reaffirming that the fisherman is in column 2.

Now, let's fill in the table step-by-step:

- **Position 1:**
  - Russian
  - Watches romance movies
  - Drives a helicopter (since the person driving the car is in position 3)
  - Sport is skateboarding (since the British has volleyball)

- **Position 2:**
  - Fisherman
  - Watches mystery movies
  - Drives a car
  - Music genre is rock (since the rock fan is next to the skateboarding fan)

- **Position 3:**
  - British
  - Watches mystery movies
  - Drives a car
  - Sport is volleyball

- **Position 4:**
  - (Unknown)
  - Watches (unknown)
  - Music genre is (unknown)
  - Nationality is (unknown)
  - Pet is (unknown)
  - Sport is (unknown)
  - Transport is (unknown)

- **Position 5:**

  - Pet is (unknown)
  - Sport is (unknown)

  - (Unknown)
  - Watches (unknown)
  - Music genre is (unknown)
  - Nationality is (unknown)
  - Pet is (unknown)
  - Sport is (unknown)
  - Transport is (unknown)

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- Position 1: Russian, Romance, Helicopter, Skateboarding
- Position 2: Fisherman, Mystery, Car, Rock
- Position 3: British, Mystery, Car, Volleyball

We need to determine the remaining categories for positions 4, 5, and 6. Since the fisherman and British are already placed, and the Russian and their preferences are known, the remaining categories can be filled in any order as long as they do not conflict with the given clues.

Here is the final solution table:

```

#### Step 1: Determine Positions for Nationality, Food, and Transport
- Since the American is in an odd position (1 or 3), and the person eating pear is also in an odd position (1 or 3), the American must be in position 1 (since only one can be in position 1). Therefore, the person in position 3 must be Dutch.
- Since the person driving the tram is in an odd position (1 or 3), and we already placed the American in position 1, the person in position 3 must be driving the tram.

So, we have:
- Position 1: American, Food = Pear
- Position 3: Dutch, Transport = Tram

#### Step 2: Determine the Remaining Elements
- The person in position 1 is eating pear, so the person in position 2 must be eating corn.
- The person in position 3 is driving the tram, so the person in position 2 must be driving the snowmobile.

So, we have:
- Position 1: American, Food = Pear, Transport = Tram
- Position 2: ?, Food = Corn, Transport = Snowmobile
- Position 3: Dutch, Transport = Tram

#### Step 3: Determine Beverage and Pet
- The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person drinking juice. Since the American is in position 1, the guinea-pig cannot be in position 1. The Dutch is in position 3, so the guinea-pig must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the person in position 2 must be drinking juice.

So, we have:
- Position 1: American, Food = Pear, Transport = Tram, Beverage = ?
- Position 2: ?, Food = Corn, Transport = Snowmobile, Beverage = Juice, Pet = Guinea-Pig
- Position 3: Dutch, Transport = Tram, Beverage = ?

Since the American is not drinking juice, they must be drinking milk. So, we have:
- Position 1: American, Food = Pear, Transport = Tram, Beverage = Milk

#### Step 4: Determine Movie-Genre and Hobby
- The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the American is in position 1, the person in position 2 must be watching animation movies, and the person in position 1 must have rock-climbing as a hobby.
- Therefore, the person in position 3 must have traveling as a hobby and prefer satire as a movie genre.

So, we have:
- Position 1: American, Food = Pear, Transport = Tram, Beverage = Milk, Hobby = Rock-Climbing, Movie-Genre = Animation
- Position 2: ?, Food = Corn, Transport = Snowmobile, Beverage = Juice, Pet = Guinea-Pig, Movie-Genre = Satire, Hobby = Traveling
- Position 3: Dutch, Transport = Tram, Beverage = ?, Hobby = Traveling, Movie-Genre = Satire

Since the Dutch is in position 3, they must be drinking milk and watching satire.

So, we have:
- Position 1: American, Food = Pear, Transport = Tram, Beverage = Milk, Hobby = Rock-Climbing, Movie-Genre = Animation
- Position 2: ?, Food = Corn, Transport = Snowmobile, Beverage = Juice, Pet = Guinea-Pig, Movie-Genre = Satire, Hobby = Traveling
- Position 3: Dutch, Transport = Tram, Beverage = Milk, Hobby = Traveling, Movie-Genre = Satire

Finally, the remaining person in position 2 must be:
- Position 2: Dutch, Food = Corn, Transport = Snowmobile, Beverage = Juice, Pet = Frog, Movie-Genre = Satire, Hobby = Traveling

Lv4-7x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each element based on the given clues. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Broccoli on the right of the librarian**
2. **Chinchilla on the left of the fan of soul**
3. **7up on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku**
4. **Mystery movie preference is in an odd position (i.e., either 1 or 3)**

We will start by placing the elements based on these clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Broccoli on the right of the librarian
This means if someone likes broccoli, they must be seated to the right of the librarian.

#### 2. Chinchilla on the left of the fan of soul
This means if someone has a chinchilla, they must be seated to the left of the person who prefers soul music.

#### 3. 7up on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku
This means if someone drinks 7up, they must be seated to the left of the person who enjoys sudoku.

#### 4. Mystery movie preference is in an odd position
This means the person who prefers mystery movies can only be in position 1 or 3.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet]
- Position 2: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet]

### Initial Setup:
Let's start with the positions for the genres and hobbies:
- Since the mystery movie preference is in an odd position, let's assume it's in position 1.
- The job of librarian must be on the right of the person who eats broccoli.
- The person with chinchilla must be on the left of the person who likes soul music.
- The person who drinks 7up must be on the left of the person who likes sudoku.

### Placing Elements:
1. **Position 1 (Odd Position):** Mystery Movie
2. **Position 2 (Even Position):** Fantasy Movie (since it's the only other genre)

Now, let's place the rest of the elements based on the given clues:

- **Broccoli and Librarian:** Since the librarian is on the right of the person who eats broccoli, the librarian cannot be in position 1 (since it would not leave room for the broccoli eater). So, the librarian must be in position 2, and the broccoli eater must be in position 1.
  
  - Position 1: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet] = [BROCCOLI, ?, ?, LIBRARIAN, MYSTERY, ?, ?]
  - Position 2: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet] = [?, ?, ?, ?, FANTASY, ?, ?]

- **Chinchilla and Soul Music:** The chinchilla owner must be on the left of the soul music lover. This means the chinchilla owner is in position 1, and the soul music lover is in position 2.

  - Position 1: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet] = [CHINCHILLA, ?, ?, LIBRARIAN, MYSTERY, SOUL, ?]
  - Position 2: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet] = [?, ?, ?, ?, FANTASY, ROCK, ?]

- **7up and Sudoku:** The 7up drinker must be on the left of the sudoku enthusiast. This means the 7up drinker is in position 1, and the sudoku enthusiast is in position 2.

  - Position 1: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet] = [7UP, ?, SUDOKU, LIBRARIAN, MYSTERY, SOUL, ?]
  - Position 2: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet] = [?, ?, ?, ?, FANTASY, ROCK, ?]

- **Jobs and Pets:** The librarian is already placed, so the electrician must be in position 2. The chinchilla owner (position 1) cannot have a pet since it's already specified. Therefore, the pony owner must be in position 2.

  - Position 1: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet] = [7UP, BROCCOLI, SUDOKU, LIBRARIAN, MYSTERY, SOUL, CHINCHILLA]
  - Position 2: [Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet] = [PEPPER, PEPPER, SINGING, ELECTRICIAN, FANTASY, ROCK, PONY]

### Final Table:
```
|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | 7UP        |  PEPPER    |
| Food          | BROCCOLI   |  PEPPER    |
| Hobby         | SUDOKU     |  SINGING   |

Lv4-7x2-10	"Let's break down the clues and place the information step by step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The American is on the right of the person whose hobby is card-games.
2. The person watching scientific movies is in an odd position (position 1 or 2).
3. The person driving the subway is on the right of the person whose sport is basketball.
4. The mechanic is in an even position (position 1 or 2).
5. The person whose hobby is reading drinks 7up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- If the American is on the right of the person whose hobby is card-games, then we can denote this as:
  - Position 1: American or someone with card-games hobby.
  - Position 2: Someone else.

#### Clue 2:
- The person watching scientific movies is in an odd position (position 1 or 2).

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the subway is on the right of the person whose sport is basketball.

#### Clue 4:
- The mechanic is in an even position (position 1 or 2).

#### Clue 5:
- The person whose hobby is reading drinks 7up.

### Initial Setup:
Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?

#### Using Clue 5:
- The person whose hobby is reading drinks 7up.
- Since the person with the reading hobby drinks 7up, and there are only two beverages (7up, hot chocolate), the other person must drink hot chocolate.
- Therefore, if the person in position 1 has the reading hobby, they drink 7up, and the person in position 2 drinks hot chocolate.
- Or vice versa.

#### Using Clue 1:
- If the American is on the right of the person whose hobby is card-games, then:
  - Position 1: American or someone with card-games hobby.
  - Position 2: Someone else.

Since the American cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate Clue 1), the American must be in position 2, and the person with the card-games hobby must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Card-games hobby, drinks 7up (or hot chocolate depending on the reading hobby)
- Position 2: American, drinks hot chocolate (or 7up depending on the reading hobby)

#### Using Clue 5:
- If the person in position 1 has the reading hobby, they drink 7up, and the person in position 2 drinks hot chocolate.
- So, Position 1: Reading, drinks 7up
- Position 2: American, drinks hot chocolate

This satisfies Clue 5 and Clue 1.

#### Using Clue 2:
- The person watching scientific movies is in an odd position (position 1 or 2).
- Since position 1 already has the reading hobby, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2 (American).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Reading, drinks 7up
- Position 2: American, watches scientific movies, drinks hot chocolate

#### Using Clue 4:
- The mechanic is in an even position (position 1 or 2).
- Since position 2 is already taken by the American, the mechanic must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Mechanic, reads, drinks 7up
- Position 2: American, watches scientific movies, drives subway, drinks hot chocolate

#### Using Clue 3:
- The person driving the subway is on the right of the person whose sport is basketball.
- Since the mechanic is in position 1, the person in position 2 (American) must drive the subway.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Mechanic, reads, drinks 7up
- Position 2: American, watches scientific movies, drives subway, drinks hot chocolate

Now, we need to assign the remaining details:
- The person in position 1 (mechanic) must have the card-games hobby.
- The person in position 2 (American) must have the basketball sport.

Thus, the final setup is:
- Position 1: Mechanic, reads, drinks 7up, hobby: card-games, job: mechanic, movie-genre: scientific, nationality: american, sport: basketball, transport: subway
- Position 2: American, watches scientific movies, drives subway, drinks hot chocolate, hobby: reading, job: unknown, movie-genre: unknown, nationality: american, sport: basketball, transport: subway

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | 7up          | hot-chocolate |
| Hobby         | card-games   | reading   |
| Job           | mechanic     | unknown   |
| Movie-Genre   | scientific   | unknown   |
| Nationality   | american     | american   |
| Sport         | basketball   | basketball|
| Transport     | subway       | subway    |
