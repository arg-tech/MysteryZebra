Lv4-2x2-2	"Sure, let's break down the information provided and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two different favorite beverages: coffee and soy-milk.
2. There are two different types of sports: sailing and weightlifting.
3. The person who's sport is sailing is in an odd position (i.e., position 1).
4. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking coffee.

### Initial Setup:
Let's denote the positions as follows:

|            |    1     |       2       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Beverage   |   ?     |               |
| Sport      |   ?     |               |

From point 3, we know that the person who prefers sailing is in position 1. So, the setup becomes:

|            |    1     |       2       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Beverage   |   ?     |               |
| Sport      |  Sailing |               |

From point 4, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking coffee. This means the beverage in position 1 must be soy-milk, and the beverage in position 2 must be coffee.

So, the final solution is:

|            |    1     |       2       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Coffee        |
| Sport      | Sailing  | Weightlifting |

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-2x2-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

We have the following information:
- There are two music genres: ambient and house.
- There are two nationalities: Canadian and Turkish.
- The Canadian is in an odd position (i.e., position 1).
- The fan of house is on the left of the fan of ambient.

Given this, we can start filling in the table:

|               |    1     |    2    |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Music-Genre   |          |         |
| Nationality   | Canadian |         |

From the second piece of information, we know that the fan of house is on the left of the fan of ambient. This means that if one person likes house, the other must like ambient, and they must be in adjacent positions.

Since the Canadian is in position 1, the only way to satisfy both conditions is to place the fan of house in position 1 and the fan of ambient in position 2.

So, the final table looks like this:

|               |    1     |    2    |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Music-Genre   | House    | Ambient |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Turkish |

Lv4-2x2-4	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.

We have:
- Two beverages: 7up and lemonade
- Two types of food: broccoli and mango

The given clues are:
1. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
2. The person eating mango is in an even position (which means position 2).

Given the structure of the table:

|            |    1     |    2     |
| Beverage   |          |          |
| Food       |          |          |

Let's break it down:

1. From clue 2, the person eating mango is in position 2. So, we can fill that in:
   
   |            |    1     |    2     |
   | Beverage   |          |          |
   | Food       |          | mango    |

2. From clue 1, the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since position 2 is occupied by mango, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1, and the person drinking 7up must be in position 2. Therefore, we can fill in the beverages as follows:

   |            |    1     |    2     |
   | Beverage   | lemonade | 7up      |
   | Food       |          | mango    |

### Applying the Clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The Dutch person is in an even position.
   - This means the Dutch person must be in Position 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The social-worker is on the right of the fisherman.
   - Since there are only two positions, this means the fisherman must be in Position 1 and the social-worker must be in Position 2.

3. **Nationalities:**
   - From Clue 1, we know that the Dutch person is in Position 2.
   - Therefore, the Polish person must be in Position 1.

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-2x2-6	"Let's break down the information provided and solve the puzzle step by step.

1. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: climbing, rugby.
2. The people use 2 different means of transport: motorbike, ship.
3. The person driving the motorbike is in an even position (Position 2).
4. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person whose sport is climbing.

Given these points, let's fill in the table:

|             |   1   |     2     |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Sport       |       |           |
| Transport   |       |           |

From point 3, we know:
- The person driving the motorbike is in Position 2.

From point 4, we know:
- The person driving the ship is on the left of the person whose sport is climbing.

Since there are only two positions and one is already occupied by the motorbike driver, the ship must be driven by the person in Position 1. This means the person in Position 1 has the sport that is not climbing (since the person with climbing is to the right).

Therefore, the person in Position 1 must have the sport ""rugby"" and the person in Position 2 must have the sport ""climbing"".

Now, let's place the sports and transport accordingly:

- Since the ship is in Position 1, the person in Position 1 must be using the ship.
- Since the motorbike is in Position 2, the person in Position 2 must be using the motorbike.

So, the completed table looks like this:

|             |   1   |     2     |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Sport       | Rugby | Climbing  |
| Transport   | Ship  | Motorbike |

Final Solution Table:

Lv4-2x2-8	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

We have:
- Two nationalities: Australian and Pakistani.
- Two pets: Dog and Frog.
- The owner of the frog is in an odd position (i.e., position 1).
- The Australian is to the left of the Pakistani.

Let's set up the table with the given information:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   |            |           |
| Pet           |            |           |
```

From the clues:
1. The owner of the frog is in position 1.
2. The Australian is to the left of the Pakistani.

Since the owner of the frog is in position 1, we can fill that in:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   | Pakistani  |           |
| Pet           | Frog       |           |
```

Now, since the Australian must be to the left of the Pakistani, the only option for position 1 is the Pakistani, and the Australian must be in position 2.

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |

Lv4-2x2-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the information given and place it into a structured format:

1. The Canadian is in an even position.
2. The Electrician is to the right of the Doctor.

We need to fill in the table with the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions:**
   - Position 1: Can be either the Doctor or the Electrician.
   - Position 2: Can be either the Doctor or the Electrician.

2. **Apply the first constraint:**
   - The Canadian must be in position 2 (the only even position available).

3. **Apply the second constraint:**
   - The Electrician must be to the right of the Doctor.
   - Since the Canadian is in position 2, the Doctor must be in position 1 (as the Electrician cannot be in position 1 and still be to the right of the Doctor).

So, we can conclude:
- Position 1: Doctor
- Position 2: Canadian

Since the only job left for the German is the Electrician, he must be in position 2 (but we already know the Canadian is there). Therefore, the Electrician must be in position 1.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Doctor (German)
- Position 2: Canadian (Electrician)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1    |      2      |
| Job           | Doctor | Electrician |
| Nationality   | German | Canadian    |

Lv4-2x2-10	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

We have two pieces of information:
1. The fan of folk is the person eating corn.
2. The fan of country is in an even position (position 2).

Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), we can deduce the following:

- Since the fan of country is in an even position, the fan of country must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the fan of folk must be in position 1 because the fan of folk is the person eating corn.

Let's summarize this information:

- Position 1: Fan of folk, eating corn
- Position 2: Fan of country, eating blueberry (since there are only two types of food: corn and blueberry)

Now, we can fill in the table:

```
