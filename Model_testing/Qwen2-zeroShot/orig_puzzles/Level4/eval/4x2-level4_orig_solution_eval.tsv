Lv4-4x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step to determine the final solution.

### Given Information:
1. There are 2 different favorite beverages: coffee, fanta.
2. The people prefer 2 different movie genres: crime, spy.
3. The people prefer 2 different types of sports: cycling, surfing.
4. The people use 2 different means of transport: jet-ski, taxi.
5. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.
6. The person drinking fanta is in an even position.
7. The person watching spy movies is the person drinking coffee.
8. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of fanta and coffee
- From clue 6, the person drinking fanta is in an even position. Therefore, fanta can only be in position 2.
- From clue 7, the person drinking coffee watches spy movies. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 2, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1.

#### Step 2: Determine the movie genre for each person
- Position 1 (drinking coffee) watches spy movies.
- Position 2 (drinking fanta) watches crime movies.

#### Step 3: Determine the sport for each person
- From clue 3, the person drinking coffee (position 1) is watching spy movies, so this person is not the one surfing.
- The person surfing must be in position 2 because they are the only one left.
- Therefore, the person in position 1 is cycling.

#### Step 4: Determine the transportation for each person
- From clue 8, the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
- The person in position 2 is surfing, so they cannot be driving the taxi.
- Therefore, the person in position 1 must be driving the jet-ski, and the person in position 2 must be driving the taxi.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |    2    |
| Beverage      | Coffee  | Fanta   |

| Transport     |             |         |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The owner of the rat is in an odd position.
- This means the pet ""rat"" must be in position 1.

|               |      1      |    2    |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Food          |             |         |

| Pet           | rat         |         |
| Transport     |             |         |

#### Clue 2: The person watching action movies is the person driving the tram.
- This means that the person in position 2 for both ""Movie-Genre"" and ""Transport"" must be ""action"" and ""tram"" respectively.

|               |      1      |    2    |

| Transport     |             | tram    |

#### Clue 3: The person eating cabbage is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
- This means the person eating cabbage (position 2) is to the right of the person watching documentary movies (position 1).

Since position 1 for ""Movie-Genre"" must be ""documentary"", the person in position 2 for ""Food"" must be ""cabbage"".

|               |      1      |    2    |

| Transport     |             | tram    |

Now we need to fill in the remaining details for ""Pet"" and ""Transport"":

- Since the person with the rat is in position 1 for ""Pet"", the person in position 2 for ""Pet"" must be ""dog"".
- The person in position 1 for ""Transport"" must be ""motorbike"" because the person in position 2 for ""Transport"" is ""tram"".

Lv4-4x2-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the given information into the table and deduce the correct positions for each category. Let's break down the clues and see how they fit together.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the entrepreneur.
2. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the entrepreneur.
3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Entrepreneur's Position
- From clue 2, the owner of the lizard must be on the right of the entrepreneur.
- From clue 1, the person driving the helicopter can be either on the left or right of the entrepreneur.

Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and the owner of the lizard must be on the right of the entrepreneur, the entrepreneur must be in position 1. Therefore, the owner of the lizard is in position 2.

#### Step 2: Determine the Helicopter Driver's Position
- Since the entrepreneur is in position 1, the helicopter driver must be in position 2 (as the owner of the lizard is in position 2).

#### Step 3: Determine the Beverage Consumption
- From clue 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position.
- Since the owner of the lizard (and thus the person drinking hot-chocolate) is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Determine the Remaining Information
- Now that we know the positions of the entrepreneur (1), the owner of the lizard (2), the person drinking hot-chocolate (2), and the helicopter driver (2), we can fill in the remaining categories.

Given that:
- Position 1: Entrepreneur, Drinking Soy-Milk
- Position 2: Owner of Lizard, Driving Helicopter, Drinking Hot-Chocolate

We need to assign the remaining categories (accountant, frog) to the positions 1 and 2.

Since the entrepreneur has a job and a pet, and we don't have any specific constraints for these yet, we can assume:
- Position 1 (Entrepreneur): Job - Accountant, Pet - Frog
- Position 2 (Owner of Lizard): Job - Entrepreneur, Pet - Lizard

### Final Table:
```plaintext
|             |      1       |       2       |

| Pet         | Frog         | Lizard        |
| Transport   | Bike         | Helicopter    |

Lv4-4x2-4	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
2. The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
3. The fan of pop is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine Hobbies
- From clue 1, we know that the person with the hobby of cooking is to the right of the person with the hobby of card-games. Therefore, we can place these two hobbies as follows:
  - Card-games (1)
  - Cooking (2)

#### Step 2: Determine Food and Beverages
- From clue 2, the person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Therefore, we can place these two items as follows:
  - Zucchini (1)
  - Almond-milk (2)

#### Step 3: Determine Music-Genres
- From clue 3, the fan of pop is in an even position. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), the fan of pop must be in position 2. This means the other person must be the fan of classical.
  - Pop (2)
  - Classical (1)

### Final Table Configuration

Now, we need to fit all the information into the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Classical  | Almond-milk |

Lv4-4x2-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the positions and constraints:**
   - There are two columns (1 and 2) and four rows (Beverage, Job, Movie-Genre, Pet).
   - The person watching disaster movies is to the right of the person drinking hot chocolate.
   - The owner of the frog is in an odd position (positions 1 or 2).
   - The engineer is in an odd position (positions 1 or 2).

2. **Determine the positions for the frog and engineer:**
   - Since both the owner of the frog and the engineer must be in odd positions, they can only be in position 1.
   - Therefore, both the frog and the engineer must be in position 1.

3. **Determine the movie genre for the engineer:**
   - The engineer cannot be in the disaster movie genre because the person watching disaster movies is to the right of the person drinking hot chocolate.
   - Thus, the engineer must prefer mystery movies.

4. **Determine the beverage for the owner of the frog:**
   - The person who owns the frog is in position 1, and since the person in position 2 watches disaster movies, the person in position 1 must drink hot chocolate.

5. **Determine the remaining details:**
   - The person in position 2 watches disaster movies and drinks milk.
   - This leaves the person in position 1 with the chinchilla as their pet.

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Milk       |
| Job           | Engineer      | Dancer     |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery       | Disaster   |
| Pet           | Chinchilla    | Frog       |

Lv4-4x2-6	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is soccer is in an even position.
2. **Clue 2:** The Egyptian is on the far left or far right.
3. **Clue 3:** The electrician is the Dutch.
4. **Clue 4:** The owner of the cat is on the left of the Egyptian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- Soccer is in an even position (position 2).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The Egyptian is either in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The electrician is the Dutch.
- This means the Dutch person is the electrician.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The owner of the cat is to the left of the Egyptian.

Since the Egyptian is either in position 1 or 2 and soccer is in position 2, the only way for the cat owner to be to the left of the Egyptian is if the Egyptian is in position 2. Therefore:
- The Egyptian is in position 2.
- The person in position 1 is not the Egyptian, so they must be the Dutch electrician.

Now we have:
```
|               |      1      |    2     |
| Job           | Electrician |          |
| Nationality   | Dutch       | Egyptian |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the remaining positions
- Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the sport in position 2 is soccer.
- The person in position 1 is the Dutch electrician.

So, we now know:
```
|               |      1      |    2     |
| Job           | Electrician |          |
| Nationality   | Dutch       | Egyptian |
| Sport         |            | Soccer   |
```

#### Step 6: Apply Clue 4
- The cat owner is to the left of the Egyptian, which means the cat owner is in position 1.
- Since the Dutch electrician is already placed in position 1, the cat owner must be someone else.

Given that the electrician is the Dutch and the Egyptian is in position 2, the remaining options for the cat owner are the coach and the person from another nationality. However, since the Dutch is already the electrician, the nationality must be different.

Let's denote the remaining nationality as ""Other"" (since we don't yet know if it's Dutch or Egyptian, but it can't be Dutch or Egyptian):

```
|               |      1      |    2     |
| Job           | Coach       | Electrician |
| Nationality   | Other       | Egyptian  |
| Sport         | Climbing    | Soccer    |
```

#### Step 7: Determine the Pet
- The cat owner (position 1) is the coach (since the electrician is the Dutch).
- The horse is the other pet, so the cat owner must have the cat.

Final solution:
```
|               |      1      |    2     |
| Job           | Coach       | Electrician |
| Nationality   | Other       | Egyptian  |
| Pet           | Cat         | Horse     |
| Sport         | Climbing    | Soccer    |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |      1      |    2     |
| Job           | Coach       | Electrician |

    - So, the person eating avocado is in position 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
    - If someone is watching crime movies, the person drinking iced-tea must be to their right.
    - This means if the person in position 1 is watching crime, the person in position 2 must be drinking iced-tea.

3. **Clue 3:** The dancer is on the left or right of the person eating avocado.
    - Since the person eating avocado is in position 1, the dancer can be in position 2.

Lv4-4x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding information into the table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of trance is in an odd position.
   - This means the fan of trance can be in position 1 or 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The coach is on the left or right of the fan of classical.
   - This means if the fan of classical is in position 1, the coach must be in position 2.
   - If the fan of classical is in position 2, the coach must be in position 1.
   - If the fan of classical is in position 3, the coach must be in position 4.
   - If the fan of classical is in position 4, the coach must be in position 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
   - This means if the person drinking fanta is in position 1, the person driving the airplane must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - If the person drinking fanta is in position 2, the person driving the airplane must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the person drinking fanta is in position 3, the person driving the airplane must be in position 4.

Let's start by placing the fan of trance based on Clue 1.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Case 1: Fan of Trance is in Position 1
- **Position 1: Trance**
- According to Clue 2, the fan of classical cannot be in position 1 (since the coach would be in position 2, which is not possible as there are only two positions for the fan of classical and the coach).
- Therefore, the fan of classical must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

If the fan of classical is in position 2:
- The coach must be in position 1, but that's already taken by the fan of trance. So this is not possible.

If the fan of classical is in position 3:
- The coach must be in position 4.

Now let's check Clue 3:
- The person drinking fanta must be on the left of the person driving the airplane.
- If the fan of trance is in position 1, the person drinking fanta could be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- If the person drinking fanta is in position 2, the person driving the airplane must be in position 3 or 4.
- If the person drinking fanta is in position 3, the person driving the airplane must be in position 4.

Let's try the fan of trance in position 1 and the fan of classical in position 3:
- **Position 1: Trance**
- **Position 2: Classical**
- **Position 3: Coach**
- **Position 4:**

We need to fit the remaining items (fanta, sprite, airplane, van) into the remaining positions.

- The person drinking fanta must be on the left of the person driving the airplane.
- If the person drinking fanta is in position 2, the person driving the airplane must be in position 3 or 4.
- If the person drinking fanta is in position 3, the person driving the airplane must be in position 4.

Let's try the person drinking fanta in position 2 and the person driving the airplane in position 4:
- **Position 1: Trance**
- **Position 2: Fanta**
- **Position 3: Coach**
- **Position 4: Airplane**

This fits all the clues:
- The fan of trance is in an odd position (position 1).
- The coach is on the left of the fan of classical (position 3 is on the left of position 2).
- The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person driving the airplane (position 2 is on the left of position 4).

Therefore, the final solution is:

```
|               |   1    |     2     |
| Beverage      | Fanta  | Sprite    |

Lv4-4x2-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place them in the table step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person whose hobby is skydiving owns the bird.
2. The person drinking 7up is in an odd position (i.e., position 1).
3. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person whose hobby is skydiving.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person drinking 7up is in position 1.
   - This means the first row (Beverage) for position 1 is 7up.
   
2. **Clue 1**: The person whose hobby is skydiving owns the bird.
   - This means the person with the hobby ""skydiving"" has the pet ""bird"".
   
3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the roller is on the right of the person whose hobby is skydiving.
   - Since the person with the hobby ""skydiving"" must be in position 2 (because the roller driver cannot be in position 1), the person with the hobby ""skydiving"" is in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person in position 1 must be driving the van (since the roller driver is in position 2).

Lv4-4x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to place the given information into the table and use the clues to determine the correct positions for each item.

Let's start by summarizing the information and clues:

1. **Beverages**: 7up, lemonade
2. **Food**: banana, papaya
3. **Jobs**: architect, writer
4. **Movie-Genres**: action, spy

Clues:
1. The architect is on the right of the person eating banana.
2. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching action movies.
3. The architect is in an even position (which means the architect must be in position 2).

Given that the architect is in position 2, let's fill in the table accordingly:

|               |    1     |     2     |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| Beverage      |  lemonade|  7up      |
| Food          |  papaya  |  banana  |
| Job           |  writer  |  architect|
| Movie-Genre   |  spy     |  action   |

Now, let's verify if this arrangement satisfies all the clues:

1. **The architect is on the right of the person eating banana**:
   - The architect is in position 2.
   - The person eating banana is also in position 2.
   - This clue is satisfied because both are in the same position.

2. **The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching action movies**:
   - The person drinking lemonade is in position 1.
   - The person watching action movies is in position 2.
   - This clue is satisfied because the person drinking lemonade is in position 1 and the person watching action movies is in position 2.

3. **The architect is in an even position**:
   - The architect is in position 2.
   - This clue is satisfied.

Since all the clues are satisfied with this arrangement, the final solution is:

```
