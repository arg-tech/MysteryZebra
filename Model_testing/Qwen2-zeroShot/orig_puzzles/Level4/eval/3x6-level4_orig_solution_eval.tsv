Lv4-3x6-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will systematically go through each clue and fill in the table accordingly. Let's start by organizing the clues and filling in what we know.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person driving the jet-ski is the fan of dubstep.
2. The Canadian is the person driving the car.
3. The Chinese is on the left of the Polish.
4. The fan of pop is on the right of the Turkish.
5. The person driving the train is the fan of country.
6. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the fan of blues.
7. The Canadian is on the left of the Chinese.
8. The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter.
9. The person driving the van is on the left of the fan of punk.
10. The fan of punk is in an even position.
11. The person driving the train is the fan of country (redundant with clue 5).
12. The Dutch is on the left of the person driving the helicopter.
13. The fan of blues is in an odd position.
14. The Polish is the person driving the motorbike.
15. The person driving the jet-ski is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Positions for Specific People and Genres
- From Clue 2: The Canadian drives the car (Position 1).
- From Clue 5: The person driving the train is the fan of country (Position 5).
- From Clue 14: The Polish drives the motorbike (Position 6).
- From Clue 1: The person driving the jet-ski is the fan of dubstep (Position 1 or 6).

Since the jet-ski driver must be in Position 1 or 6, and the Polish is in Position 6, the jet-ski must be in Position 1. Therefore:
- Jet-ski (Position 1) = Dubstep.

#### Step 2: Determine Remaining Positions
- The Canadian is in Position 1, so the Chinese must be in Position 2 (Clue 3 and Clue 7).
- The Polish is in Position 6, so the Dutch must be in Position 2 (Clue 12).
- The person driving the train (Country) is in Position 5.

Now we have:
```
|               |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5     |    6     |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep|            |          |         | Country   |          |
| Nationality   | Canadian| Chinese    |          |         | Polish    | Dutch    |
| Transport     | Jet-ski|            |          |         | Train     | Motorbike|
```

#### Step 3: Fan of Pop and Punk
- The fan of pop is on the right of the Turkish (Clue 4).
- The fan of punk is in an even position (Clue 10) and on the left of the fan of punk (Clue 9).

The only even positions available are 4 and 6. Since the fan of punk cannot be in Position 6 (as it would conflict with the Polish), the fan of punk must be in Position 4. Therefore:
- Fan of punk = Position 4.

The fan of pop must be in Position 3 (since the fan of punk is in Position 4 and the Turkish is on the left of the fan of pop). Therefore:
- Fan of pop = Position 3.

Now we have:
```
|               |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5     |    6     |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep|            | Pop      |         | Country   |          |
| Nationality   | Canadian| Chinese    |          |         | Polish    | Dutch    |
| Transport     | Jet-ski|            |          |         | Train     | Motorbike|
```

#### Step 4: Determine Remaining Nationalities and Genres
- The fan of blues is in an odd position (Clue 13). The only remaining odd positions are 1 and 3. Since Position 1 is taken by dubstep, the fan of blues must be in Position 3. However, Position 3 is already occupied by pop. Therefore, the fan of blues must be in Position 1. This conflicts with our previous assignment, so let's re-evaluate.

Re-evaluating:
- The fan of blues is in Position 3 (Pop was reassigned to another position).

The fan of blues is in Position 3. The remaining positions for the fan of blues and the Turkish are 2 and 4. Since the fan of pop is in Position 3, the Turkish must be in Position 2. Therefore:
- Turkish = Position 2.
- Fan of blues = Position 3.

Now we have:
```
|               |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5     |    6     |
| Music-Genre   | Blues  |            | Pop      |         | Country   |          |
| Nationality   | Canadian| Chinese    | Turkish  |         | Polish    | Dutch    |
| Transport     | Jet-ski|            |          |         | Train     | Motorbike|
```

#### Step 5: Finalize Remaining Transport and Genres
- The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (Clue 8). The only remaining positions for these are 4 and 5. Since the fan of punk is in Position 4, the person driving the van must be in Position 5. Therefore:
- Van = Position 5.
- Helicopter = Position 4.

Now we have:
```
|               |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5     |    6     |
| Music-Genre   | Blues  |            | Pop      | Punk    | Country   |          |
| Nationality   | Canadian| Chinese    | Turkish  |         | Polish    | Dutch    |
| Transport     | Jet-ski|            |          | Helicopter| Van      | Motorbike|
```

#### Step 6: Finalize Remaining Genre
- The only remaining genre is trance, which must be in Position 6.

Final solution:
```
|               |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5     |    6     |

| Nationality   | Canadian| Chinese    | Turkish  |         | Polish    | Dutch    |
| Transport     | Jet-ski|            |          | Helicopter| Van      | Motorbike|
```

### Final Table:

Lv4-3x6-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's go through the clues step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 3**: The person driving the bike is on the far left.
   - This means the bike is in position 1.

2. **Clue 11**: The person driving the bike is in an odd position.
   - Since the bike is already in position 1 (which is odd), this confirms our previous placement.

3. **Clue 12**: The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the French.
   - This means the French is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

4. **Clue 7**: The French is on the right of the Nigerian.
   - Since the French must be in an even position, and the Nigerian cannot be in position 6 (since the French is to the right), the possible positions for the French are 2, 4. Thus, the Nigerian can only be in position 1 or 3.

5. **Clue 10**: The Turkish is on the far right.
   - This means the Turkish is in position 6.

6. **Clue 14**: The person driving the ship is on the right of the Polish.
   - This means the Polish cannot be in position 6 (Turkish) and must be in an even position. Given that the ship must be to the right of the Polish, the Polish can only be in position 2 or 4.

7. **Clue 15**: The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.
   - Since the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the French, and the French can only be in position 2 or 4, the person watching mystery movies can only be in position 3 or 5. Therefore, the skateboard driver can only be in position 1 or 2.

8. **Clue 6**: The person watching time-travel movies is the Polish.
   - This means the Polish is in position 3 (since the Polish cannot be in position 1 or 4 due to Clue 14).

9. **Clue 8**: The French is on the right of the Nigerian.
   - Given that the French can only be in position 2 or 4, and the Nigerian can only be in position 1 or 3, if the French is in position 4, the Nigerian must be in position 3. If the French is in position 2, the Nigerian must be in position 1.

10. **Clue 4**: The person watching thriller movies is between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the bike.
    - Since the bike is in position 1, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3 (where the Polish is). Therefore, the snowmobile driver must be in position 2 (French) or 4 (Nigerian).

11. **Clue 13**: The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person driving the ship.
    - Since the Polish is in position 3, the ship must be driven by the Nigerian in position 2, and the skateboard is driven by the French in position 4.

12. **Clue 9**: The British is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies.
    - Given the placements so far, the British must be in position 5, and the person watching disaster movies must be in position 4 (Nigerian).

   - This satisfies constraint 14.
   
2. **The person driving the skateboard is on the far left or far right.**
   - Since the owner of the pony is already in position 1, the skateboard must be in position 6.
   
3. **The person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the turtle.**
   - From constraint 6, the owner of the turtle drinks soy-milk.
   
4. **The person driving the van is in an even position.**
   - Possible positions for the van are 2, 4, or 6. But position 6 is already taken by the skateboard.
   - Therefore, the van can only be in position 2 or 4.
   
5. **The person drinking fanta is in an odd position.**
   - Possible positions for fanta are 1, 3, or 5.
   - Position 1 is already taken by the pony.
   - So, fanta can be in position 3 or 5.
   
6. **The person drinking fanta is on the left of the owner of the hamster.**
   - If fanta is in position 3, the hamster can be in position 4, 5, or 6.
   - If fanta is in position 5, the hamster can be in position 6.
   
7. **The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking coffee.**
   - Possible pairs are (coffee, lemonade) in (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6).
   - Since position 1 is taken by the pony, it can only be (coffee, lemonade) in (3, 4) or (5, 6).
   
8. **The person drinking sprite is the person driving the subway.**
   - Possible positions for the subway are 2, 4, or 6. But position 6 is already taken by the skateboard.
   - Therefore, the subway can only be in position 2 or 4.
   
9. **The person driving the car is between the owner of the frog and the owner of the horse.**
   - Possible positions for the car are 3, 4, or 5.
   - The car cannot be in position 4 because the subway is there.
   - So, the car can be in position 3 or 5.
   
10. **The owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person driving the trike.**
    - Possible positions for the trike are 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    - The car cannot be in position 3 or 5 because the car is between the frog and the horse.
    - So, the trike can be in position 2.
    
11. **The person drinking 7up is on the left of the owner of the bird.**
    - Possible positions for 7up and the bird are (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6).
    - Position 1 is taken by the pony.
    - So, possible pairs are (7up, bird) in (3, 4) or (5, 6).
    
12. **The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking coffee.**
    - From above, we have (coffee, lemonade) in (3, 4) or (5, 6).
    - If (coffee, lemonade) is in (3, 4), then 7up and the bird must be in (5, 6).
    - If (coffee, lemonade) is in (5, 6), then 7up and the bird must be in (3, 4).

### Final Solution:

Based on all constraints, let's place the items:

1. Pony (owner)
2. Van (transport)
3. Coffee (beverage)
4. Lemonade (beverage)
5. 7up (beverage)
6. Sprite (beverage)

1. Turtle (pet) - drinks soy-milk
2. Frog (pet) - on the left or right of the trike
3. Bird (pet) - 7up drinker
4. Hamster (pet) - fanta drinker
5. Horse (pet) - between the owner of the frog and the owner of the turtle
6. Trike (transport) - owner of the frog

So, the final solution is:
