- Therefore, Japanese must be in position 2 (left of Cycling).

- Turkish is on the right of Thai, so Turkish must be in position 5 (next to Thai in position 3).

- Milk is on the far right, so Milk must be in position 7.

- **Position 6**: ?
- **Position 7**: Subway (Dubstep)

Now, **d&b** cannot be in position 7, so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's try **d&b** in position 1:

- **Position 1**: d&b
- **Position 2**: ?
- **Position 3**: ?
- **Position 4**: Jet-ski (Funk)
- **Position 5**: ?
- **Position 6**: ?
- **Position 7**: Subway (Dubstep)

Since **Snowboarding (Reggae)** is before **Bike** and **Skiing (Motorbike)** is in an odd position, we can place **Skiing (Motorbike)** in position 3:

- **Position 1**: d&b
- **Position 2**: ?
- **Position 3**: Skiing (Motorbike)
- **Position 4**: Jet-ski (Funk)
- **Position 5**: ?
- **Position 6**: ?
- **Position 7**: Subway (Dubstep)

Since **Bike** must be after **Snowboarding (Reggae)**, and **Skiing (Motorbike)** is in position 3, **Bike** must be in position 5 or 6. Given **Cycling (Skateboard)** is in an even position (2, 4, 6), and **Jet-ski (Funk)** is in position 4, **Bike** must be in position 6:

- **Position 1**: d&b
- **Position 2**: Cycling (Skateboard)
- **Position 3**: Skiing (Motorbike)
- **Position 4**: Jet-ski (Funk)
- **Position 5**: ?
- **Position 6**: Bike
- **Position 7**: Subway (Dubstep)

Now, **Sailing** must be on the left of **Ice-Hockey** and not in position 4, 6, or 7. So, **Sailing** can be in position 2 or 5. Since **Cycling (Skateboard)** is in position 2, **Sailing** must be in position 5:

- **Position 1**: d&b
- **Position 2**: Cycling (Skateboard)
- **Position 3**: Skiing (Motorbike)
- **Position 4**: Jet-ski (Funk)
- **Position 5**: Sailing
- **Position 6**: Bike
- **Position 7**: Subway (Dubstep)

Finally, **Cricket (Funk)** must be in position 1, but since **d&b** is in position 1, **Cricket (Funk)** cannot be in position 1. Therefore, **Cricket (Funk)** must be in position 2, but **Cycling (Skateboard)** is already there. Thus, **Cricket (Funk)** must be in position 5:

- **Position 1**: d&b
- **Position 2**: Cycling (Skateboard)
- **Position 3**: Skiing (Motorbike)
- **Position 4**: Jet-ski (Funk)
- **Position 5**: Cricket (Funk)
- **Position 6**: Bike
- **Position 7**: Subway (Dubstep)

Now, we need to place the remaining sports and genres:

- **Handball**: Not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
- **Ice-Hockey**: Must be in position 4 (Jet-ski is there).
- **Handball**: Not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
- **Sailing**: In position 5 (Cricket is there).
- **Ice-Hockey**: Must be in position 6 (Bike is there).
- **Handball**: Must be in position 7 (Subway is there).

Thus, the final solution is:

### Applying Clues:

1. **Clue 1 & 2:** The person driving the jet-ski and the owner of the snake are in odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7). Since the owner of the snake cannot be in position 1 (as it would conflict with clue 9), they must be in position 3 or 5.

10. **Clue 15:** The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. So, the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be in position 2 or 3.
11. **Clue 17:** The owner of the snake is between the owner of the horse and the person who's sport is baseball. So, the owner of the horse must be in position 2, and the person who's sport is baseball must be in position 5.
