Lv4-1x4-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The Russian is in an odd position.
2. The Turkish is between the German and the Russian.
3. The Turkish is on the right of the German.

### Analysis:

- **Clue 1**: The Russian is in an odd position. This means the Russian can be in position 1 or 3.
- **Clue 2 & 3**: The Turkish must be between the German and the Russian, and the Turkish must be to the right of the German. This implies that if we have positions for the German and the Russian, the Turkish must fit in between them and to the right of the German.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Russian**:
   - If the Russian is in position 1, then the German and Turkish need to be placed such that the Turkish is between them and to the right of the German.
     - Possible sequence: German (2), Turkish (3), Russian (1)
     - But this doesn't fit because the Russian is not in an odd position (it's in position 1).

2. **If the Russian is in position 3**:
   - Then the German and Turkish need to be placed such that the Turkish is between them and to the right of the German.
     - Possible sequence: German (1), Turkish (2), Russian (3)

This sequence fits all the clues:
- The Russian is in an odd position (position 3).
- The Turkish is between the German and the Russian.
- The Turkish is to the right of the German.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1    |    2    |    3    |  4   |
| Nationality   |  German|  Turkish|  Russian|  Thai |
```

The Thai nationality is left for position 4 as it was not specified in the clues and there were no restrictions on it."	{'nationality': ['german', 'turkish', 'russian', 'thai']}	True	4	True
Lv4-1x4-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the foods in the correct positions.

1. **The person eating avocado is on the left of the person eating potato.**
2. **The person eating banana is in an odd position (1 or 3).**
3. **The person eating banana is on the left or right of the person eating avocado.**

Let's start with clue 2: The person eating banana must be in either position 1 or 3.

### Case 1: Banana is in position 1
- If banana is in position 1, then according to clue 3, the person eating avocado must be in position 2 because it is the only position left that allows the person eating avocado to be on the left or right of the person eating banana.
- This leaves positions 3 and 4 for lemon and potato. According to clue 1, the person eating avocado (position 2) must be on the left of the person eating potato, so the person eating potato must be in position 4.
- Therefore, the person eating lemon must be in position 3.

So, the arrangement would be:
- Position 1: Banana
- Position 2: Avocado
- Position 3: Lemon
- Position 4: Potato

This satisfies all the given clues.

### Case 2: Banana is in position 3
- If banana is in position 3, then according to clue 3, the person eating avocado must be in position 2 or 4 because it is the only positions left that allow the person eating avocado to be on the left or right of the person eating banana.
- However, if the person eating avocado is in position 2, then the person eating potato must be in position 3, which conflicts with the banana being in position 3.
- Therefore, the person eating avocado must be in position 4, and the person eating potato must be in position 3.
- This leaves positions 1 and 2 for banana and lemon. Since banana cannot be in position 1 (it would violate clue 3), banana must be in position 2, and lemon must be in position 1.

So, the arrangement would be:
- Position 1: Lemon
- Position 2: Banana
- Position 3: Potato
- Position 4: Avocado

However, this does not satisfy clue 3 because the person eating banana (position 2) is not on the left or right of the person eating avocado (position 4).

Thus, the only valid arrangement is from Case 1:

```

Lv4-1x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The person watching drama movies is in an odd position (i.e., either position 1 or 3).
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching zombie movies and the person watching martial-arts movies.

Let's break down these clues to find the correct arrangement:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Clue 2:** Since the person watching drama movies is in an odd position, they can only be in position 1 or 3.

2. **Clue 1:** If the person watching drama movies is in position 1, then the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2 or 3. However, if the person watching drama movies is in position 3, then the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching zombie movies and the person watching martial-arts movies. This means that if the person watching zombie movies is in position 2, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 3, and the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 4. Alternatively, if the person watching zombie movies is in position 3, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2, and the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 4.

### Possible Arrangements

#### Case 1: Drama in Position 1
- Drama in Position 1
- Zombie in Position 2 or 3
- Mystery in between Zombie and Martial-Arts

If Zombie is in Position 2:
- Mystery in Position 3
- Martial-Arts in Position 4

This gives us:
- Position 1: Drama
- Position 2: Zombie
- Position 3: Mystery
- Position 4: Martial-Arts

If Zombie is in Position 3:
- Mystery in Position 2
- This would place the Mystery between Zombie and Martial-Arts, which contradicts the requirement that Mystery must be between Zombie and Martial-Arts when Zombie is in Position 3.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement for Drama in Position 1 is:
- Position 1: Drama
- Position 2: Zombie
- Position 3: Mystery
- Position 4: Martial-Arts

#### Case 2: Drama in Position 3
- Drama in Position 3
- Zombie in Position 2
- Mystery in between Zombie and Martial-Arts

This gives us:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: Zombie
- Position 3: Drama
- Position 4: ?

Since Mystery must be between Zombie and Martial-Arts, and Drama is already in Position 3, the only remaining positions are 1 and 4. Thus:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: Zombie
- Position 3: Drama
- Position 4: Martial-Arts

However, there is no valid genre for Position 1 in this case because all other positions are already filled.

### Final Solution

The only valid arrangement based on the given clues is:
- Position 1: Drama
- Position 2: Zombie
- Position 3: Mystery
- Position 4: Martial-Arts

Here is the final solution table:

```
|               |   1   |   2    |    3    |      4       |

Lv4-1x4-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person who's sport is baseball.
2. The person who's sport is soccer is in an even position (i.e., position 2 or 4).
3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is soccer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2 Analysis:
- The person who's sport is soccer is in an even position, so soccer can be in position 2 or 4.

#### Clue 3 Analysis:
- The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is soccer.
- This means that if soccer is in position 2, then baseball must be in position 1 and weightlifting in position 3.
- If soccer is in position 4, then baseball must be in position 3 and weightlifting in position 2.

#### Clue 1 Analysis:
- The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person who's sport is baseball.
- This means that if baseball is in position 1, snowboarding can be in position 2 or 3.
- If baseball is in position 3, snowboarding can be in position 2 or 4.
- If baseball is in position 4, snowboarding can only be in position 3 (since it cannot be to the right of baseball).

### Possible Configurations:
1. **Soccer in Position 2:**
   - Baseball in Position 1
   - Weightlifting in Position 3
   - Snowboarding can be in Position 2 or 3 (but it must be on the right of baseball, so snowboarding must be in Position 3)
   - This configuration is not possible because it would place snowboarding in both positions 2 and 3.

2. **Soccer in Position 4:**
   - Baseball in Position 3
   - Weightlifting in Position 2
   - Snowboarding can be in Position 2 or 4 (but it must be on the right of baseball, so snowboarding must be in Position 4)

This configuration works as follows:
- Position 1: Unknown
- Position 2: Weightlifting
- Position 3: Baseball
- Position 4: Soccer
- Snowboarding must be in Position 1.

Lv4-1x4-5	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the correct positions for each sport.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The person who's sport is handball is in an even position.**
   - This means handball can be in position 2 or 4.

2. **The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is handball.**
   - If handball is in position 2, then sailing must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If handball is in position 4, then sailing must be in position 3.

3. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing.**
   - Lacrosse can be either to the left or to the right of sailing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Case 1: Handball in Position 2
- Handball is in position 2.
- Sailing must be in position 3 or 4.
- Let's check both sub-cases for sailing.

##### Sub-case 1.1: Sailing in Position 3
- If sailing is in position 3, lacrosse can be in position 1 or 4.
  - If lacrosse is in position 1, then water-polo must be in position 4 (since all sports must be used).
  - If lacrosse is in position 4, then water-polo must be in position 1.

  Let's test both:
  - **Lacrosse in Position 1 and Water-Polo in Position 4:**
    - Positions: 1 (Lacrosse), 2 (Handball), 3 (Sailing), 4 (Water-Polo)
    - This satisfies all conditions.
  - **Lacrosse in Position 4 and Water-Polo in Position 1:**
    - Positions: 1 (Water-Polo), 2 (Handball), 3 (Sailing), 4 (Lacrosse)
    - This does not satisfy the condition that lacrosse is on the left or right of sailing.

##### Sub-case 1.2: Sailing in Position 4
- If sailing is in position 4, then lacrosse must be in position 3 (since it must be on the left or right of sailing).
- Water-polo must be in position 1.

  Positions: 1 (Water-Polo), 2 (Handball), 3 (Lacrosse), 4 (Sailing)
  - This also satisfies all conditions.

#### Case 2: Handball in Position 4
- Handball is in position 4.
- Sailing must be in position 3.
- Lacrosse can be in position 1 or 2.

##### Sub-case 2.1: Lacrosse in Position 1
- Water-polo must be in position 2.

  Positions: 1 (Lacrosse), 2 (Water-Polo), 3 (Sailing), 4 (Handball)
  - This satisfies all conditions.

##### Sub-case 2.2: Lacrosse in Position 2
- Water-polo must be in position 1.

  Positions: 1 (Water-Polo), 2 (Lacrosse), 3 (Sailing), 4 (Handball)
  - This does not satisfy the condition that lacrosse is on the left or right of sailing.

### Final Solution:
From the above analysis, we have two valid solutions:

1. **Solution 1:**
   - 1 (Lacrosse), 2 (Handball), 3 (Sailing), 4 (Water-Polo)

2. **Solution 2:**
   - 1 (Water-Polo), 2 (Handball), 3 (Sailing), 4 (Lacrosse)

Since both solutions satisfy all the given conditions, we can present them as follows:

```
|         |     1      |    2     |    3    |    4     |

### Given Information:
1. The Chinese is on the far right.
2. The Chinese is on the left or right of the Thai.
3. The Colombian is in an odd position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of the Chinese:**
   - From clue 1, the Chinese must be in position 4 (the far right).

2. **Position of the Thai:**
   - From clue 2, the Thai can be either to the left of the Chinese (positions 1, 2, or 3) or next to the Chinese (position 3). Since the Chinese is in position 4, the Thai can only be in position 3.

3. **Position of the Colombian:**
   - From clue 3, the Colombian must be in an odd position (1 or 3).
   - However, position 3 is already taken by the Thai, so the Colombian must be in position 1.

4. **Position of the Brazilian:**
   - The remaining position (2) must be occupied by the Brazilian.

### Final Arrangement:
- Position 1: Colombian
- Position 2: Brazilian
- Position 3: Thai

Lv4-1x4-7	"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement of the jobs.

### Clues Recap:
1. The analyst is on the left or right of the writer.
2. The writer is in an odd position.
3. The firefighter is between the analyst and the dressmaker.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 2: Writer is in an odd position
- The possible positions for the writer are 1 or 3 (since they must be in an odd position).

#### Clue 1: Analyst is on the left or right of the writer
- If the writer is in position 1, the analyst can be in position 2 or 4.
- If the writer is in position 3, the analyst can be in position 2 or 4.

#### Clue 3: Firefighter is between the analyst and the dressmaker
- This means that the firefighter must be in a position where there is one job before and one job after it.

### Possible Arrangements:

#### Case 1: Writer in position 1
- If the writer is in position 1, the analyst can be in position 2 or 4.
  - **Subcase 1.1: Analyst in position 2**
    - The firefighter must be between the analyst (position 2) and the dressmaker.
    - Possible positions for the firefighter are 3 (since 4 is not valid as it would leave no space for the dressmaker).
    - Therefore, the firefighter is in position 3, and the dressmaker is in position 4.
    - The remaining job (firefighter) goes to position 2.
    - This gives us: **Firefighter, Writer, Analyst, Dressmaker**.
  - **Subcase 1.2: Analyst in position 4**
    - The firefighter must be between the analyst (position 4) and the dressmaker.
    - This is not possible since there is no position between 4 and any other position for the firefighter.

#### Case 2: Writer in position 3
- If the writer is in position 3, the analyst can be in position 2 or 4.
  - **Subcase 2.1: Analyst in position 2**
    - The firefighter must be between the analyst (position 2) and the dressmaker.
    - Possible positions for the firefighter are 1 (since 3 is occupied by the writer and 4 is not valid as it would leave no space for the dressmaker).
    - Therefore, the firefighter is in position 1, and the dressmaker is in position 4.
    - The remaining job (writer) goes to position 2.
    - This gives us: **Firefighter, Analyst, Writer, Dressmaker**.
  - **Subcase 2.2: Analyst in position 4**
    - The firefighter must be between the analyst (position 4) and the dressmaker.
    - This is not possible since there is no position between 4 and any other position for the firefighter.

### Conclusion:
From the above analysis, we find two valid arrangements:
1. **Firefighter, Writer, Analyst, Dressmaker**
2. **Firefighter, Analyst, Writer, Dressmaker**

Since both arrangements satisfy all the clues, let's choose the first one for simplicity:

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-1x4-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The entrepreneur is in an even position.
2. The freelancer is on the right of the entrepreneur.
3. The chef is on the right of the freelancer.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- Since the entrepreneur is in an even position (2 or 4), and the freelancer must be to the right of the entrepreneur, the possible positions for the entrepreneur and freelancer are:
  - Entrepreneur in position 2, Freelancer in position 3.
  - Entrepreneur in position 4, Freelancer in position 3 (not possible because the chef would need to be to the right of the freelancer, but there's no room).

So, the only valid option is:
- Entrepreneur in position 2, Freelancer in position 3.

Now, since the chef needs to be to the right of the freelancer, the chef must be in position 4.

This leaves the first position open for the fisherman.

Therefore, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Fisherman
- Position 2: Entrepreneur
- Position 3: Freelancer
- Position 4: Chef

Here is the final solution table:

```
|       |     1     |      2       |     3      |  4   |

Lv4-1x4-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The fan of rock is on the left or right of the fan of disco.**
   - This means that the positions of rock and disco are adjacent to each other but not necessarily in that order.

2. **The fan of d&b is between the fan of disco and the fan of folk.**
   - This implies that if we have the sequence \( \text{disco} - \text{d&b} - \text{folk} \) or \( \text{folk} - \text{d&b} - \text{disco} \).

3. **The fan of d&b is in an odd position.**
   - The odd positions are 1 and 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of d&b:**
   - Since d&b must be in an odd position (either 1 or 3), let's consider both possibilities.

2. **Case 1: d&b is in position 1.**
   - If d&b is in position 1, then the sequence for the remaining genres would be \( \text{d&b} - \text{disco} - \text{folk} - \text{rock} \) or \( \text{d&b} - \text{folk} - \text{disco} - \text{rock} \).
   - However, this does not satisfy the condition that rock must be either to the left or right of disco because it would place rock in an even position (4).

3. **Case 2: d&b is in position 3.**
   - If d&b is in position 3, then the sequence for the remaining genres would be \( \text{disco} - \text{rock} - \text{d&b} - \text{folk} \) or \( \text{folk} - \text{rock} - \text{d&b} - \text{disco} \).
   - Let's check these sub-cases:
     - \( \text{disco} - \text{rock} - \text{d&b} - \text{folk} \): Here, rock is to the right of disco, which satisfies the first clue.
     - \( \text{folk} - \text{rock} - \text{d&b} - \text{disco} \): Here, rock is to the right of disco, which also satisfies the first clue.

Both sub-cases in Case 2 satisfy all the given conditions.

Lv4-1x4-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling.
   - This means that if one person has sudoku, the other person with traveling must be either to their immediate left or right.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is photography is between the person who's hobby is baking and the person who's hobby is traveling.
   - This means that the order must be Baking -> Photography -> Traveling or Traveling -> Photography -> Baking.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is baking is in an even position.
   - Since there are 4 positions (1, 2, 3, 4), and the even positions are 2 and 4, the person with baking must be in either position 2 or 4.

Now, let's use these clues to deduce the correct arrangement:

- From Clue 3, the person with baking can only be in position 2 or 4.
- From Clue 2, we know that photography must be between baking and traveling. Therefore:
  - If baking is in position 2, then photography must be in position 3 and traveling must be in position 4.
  - If baking is in position 4, then photography must be in position 3 and traveling must be in position 2.

Let's test both scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Baking in Position 2
- Baking -> Photography -> Traveling
- Sudoku must be in position 1 or 3 based on Clue 1.

This gives us:
1. Sudoku
2. Baking
3. Photography
4. Traveling

Checking Clue 1:
- Sudoku is in position 1, and traveling is in position 4, which satisfies the condition that Sudoku is on the left or right of Traveling.

This arrangement works for all clues.

### Scenario 2: Baking in Position 4
- Baking -> Photography -> Traveling
- Sudoku must be in position 1 or 3 based on Clue 1.

This gives us:
1. Sudoku
2. Traveling
3. Photography
4. Baking

Checking Clue 1:
- Sudoku is in position 1, and traveling is in position 2, which does not satisfy the condition that Sudoku is on the left or right of Traveling.

This arrangement does not work.

Therefore, the only valid solution is:

1. Sudoku
2. Baking
3. Photography
4. Traveling
