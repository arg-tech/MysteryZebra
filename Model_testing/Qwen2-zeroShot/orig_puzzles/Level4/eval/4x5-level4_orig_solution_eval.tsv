2. **The Analyst is in an odd position.**
   - The Analyst can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

3. **The fan of Ambient is on the left of the Indonesian.**

   - If the fan of Salsa is in position \(j\), then the person drinking Tea must be in position \(j+1\).

5. **The person drinking Hot-Chocolate is on the left or right of the Analyst.**
   - This means the person drinking Hot-Chocolate is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 if the Analyst is in an odd position.

6. **The fan of Salsa is on the right of the person drinking Hot-Chocolate.**
   - This means the person drinking Hot-Chocolate is in a position before the fan of Salsa.

7. **The Project-Manager is on the right of the fan of House.**
   - If the fan of House is in position \(k\), then the Project-Manager must be in position \(k+1\).

10. **The fan of House is the Firefighter.**
    - The Firefighter is the fan of House.

11. **The fan of D&B is on the left of the person drinking Milk.**
    - If the person drinking Milk is in position \(m\), then the fan of D&B must be in position \(m-1\).

    - This is redundant with clue 5.

13. **The person drinking Tea is on the right of the Indonesian.**

14. **The Turkish is on the left of the fan of Trance.**
    - If the fan of Trance is in position \(p\), then the Turkish must be in position \(p-1\).

15. **The fan of Salsa is the person drinking Sprite.**
    - The person drinking Sprite is the fan of Salsa.

16. **The fan of Salsa is on the right of the person drinking Hot-Chocolate.**
    - This is redundant with clue 6.

### Solving the Puzzle:

Let's start placing the information based on the clues:

1. **Positioning the Analyst:**
   - Analyst is in an odd position: 1, 3, or 5.
   
2. **Positioning the Project-Manager:**
   - Nigerian is on the left or right of the Project-Manager.
   - Project-Manager is on the right of the fan of House.
   - Let's assume the Project-Manager is in position 5 (since it's the last odd position available for the Analyst).
   - Therefore, the Nigerian must be in position 1.

3. **Positioning the Fan of House:**
   - The fan of House is the Firefighter and must be on the left of the Project-Manager.
   - So, the fan of House is in position 4.
   - The Project-Manager is in position 5.

4. **Positioning the Fan of Ambient:**
   - The fan of Ambient is on the left of the Indonesian.
   - Since the Indonesian cannot be in position 1 (Nigerian) or 5 (Project-Manager), let's assume the Indonesian is in position 3.
   - Therefore, the fan of Ambient must be in position 2.

5. **Positioning the Fan of Salsa:**
   - The fan of Salsa is the person drinking Sprite and must be on the right of the person drinking Hot-Chocolate.
   - The person drinking Hot-Chocolate must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Let's assume the person drinking Hot-Chocolate is in position 1.
   - Therefore, the fan of Salsa (Sprite drinker) is in position 2.

6. **Positioning the Turkish:**
   - The Turkish is in an even position: 2 or 4.
   - Since position 2 is taken by the fan of Salsa, the Turkish must be in position 4.

7. **Positioning the British:**
   - The British is on the left or right of the Mechanic.
   - The Mechanic cannot be in position 1 (Hot-Chocolate) or 5 (Project-Manager).
   - Let's assume the Mechanic is in position 3 (Ambient fan).
   - Therefore, the British must be in position 2 (Salsa drinker) or 4 (Turkish).
   - Since position 2 is taken by the Salsa drinker, the British must be in position 4 (Turkish).

8. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The person drinking Tea must be on the right of the fan of Salsa (Sprite drinker).
   - Therefore, the person drinking Tea is in position 3 (Ambient fan).
   - The Firefighter (fan of House) is in position 4.
   - The Mechanic is in position 3 (Ambient fan).
   - The British is in position 4 (Turkish).

9. From **Clue 6**, the person driving the trike is the person eating banana. This means the person eating banana is at position 4.
10. From **Clue 17**, the person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the trike (banana) is at position 4, the person driving the ship must be at position 2 (as the person eating corn is at position 4).

### Clues Analysis and Placement

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the helicopter is the Pakistani.
2. **Clue 2:** The Pakistani is in an odd position (i.e., position 1 or 3 or 5).
3. **Clue 3:** The accountant is on the left or right of the Indonesian.
4. **Clue 4:** The mechanic is the Brazilian.
5. **Clue 5:** The security-guard is on the left or right of the paramedic.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who's hobby is gardening is the Brazilian.
8. **Clue 8:** The accountant is on the left or right of the person driving the subway.
9. **Clue 9:** The accountant is the person driving the motorbike.
10. **Clue 10:** The paramedic is on the right of the person driving the boat.
11. **Clue 11:** The person driving the taxi is on the far left.
12. **Clue 12:** The American is on the left or right of the paramedic.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who's hobby is cooking is in an odd position (i.e., position 1 or 3 or 5).
14. **Clue 14:** The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the Nigerian.
15. **Clue 15:** The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person driving the helicopter.
16. **Clue 16:** The accountant is in an odd position (i.e., position 1 or 3 or 5).
17. **Clue 17:** The Nigerian is the person driving the motorbike.
18. **Clue 18:** The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the Indonesian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 11 and Clue 17:** The Nigerian drives the motorbike.
2. **From Clue 6:** The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the boat.
3. **From Clue 10:** The paramedic is on the right of the person driving the boat.
4. **From Clue 16:** The accountant is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
5. **From Clue 2:** The Pakistani is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and drives the helicopter.
6. **From Clue 9:** The accountant is the person driving the motorbike, so the accountant cannot be the person driving the helicopter (since the Nigerian drives the motorbike). Therefore, the accountant must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
7. **From Clue 13:** The person who's hobby is cooking is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

Let's place the Nigerian and the Pakistani:
- If the Pakistani is in position 1, then the Nigerian would be in position 2, but this violates Clue 6 (Nigerian is to the left of the person driving the boat). So, the Pakistani cannot be in position 1.
- If the Pakistani is in position 3, then the Nigerian would be in position 2, but this also violates Clue 6. So, the Pakistani cannot be in position 3.
- Therefore, the Pakistani must be in position 5, and the Nigerian must be in position 4.

So, we have:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: Nigerian
- Position 5: Pakistani (driving the helicopter)

Next, let's place the accountant:
- The accountant must be in an odd position (1 or 3) and cannot be the Pakistani.
- Since the Nigerian is in position 4, the accountant must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Accountant (driving the motorbike)
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: Nigerian
- Position 5: Pakistani (driving the helicopter)

Now, let's place the other positions:
- From Clue 4, the mechanic is the Brazilian, so the Brazilian must be in position 2 or 3.
- From Clue 7, the Brazilian has the hobby of gardening, so the Brazilian (mechanic) must be in position 2 or 3.
- From Clue 17, the Nigerian drives the motorbike, so the Nigerian must be in position 4.
- From Clue 15, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person driving the helicopter (Pakistani), so the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 3.
- From Clue 14, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the Nigerian (position 4), so the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 3.
- From Clue 18, the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the Indonesian, so the Indonesian must be in position 2 and the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Accountant (driving the motorbike)
- Position 2: Indonesian
- Position 3: Drawing (Brazilian)
- Position 4: Nigerian
- Position 5: Pakistani (driving the helicopter)

Now, we need to place the remaining roles:
- The paramedic is on the right of the person driving the boat, so the paramedic must be in position 3 or 4. Since the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 3, the paramedic must be in position 4.
- The security-guard is on the left or right of the paramedic, so the security-guard must be in position 2 or 3. Since the Indonesian is in position 2 and the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 3, the security-guard must be in position 2.
- The accountant is the person driving the motorbike, so the accountant is in position 1.
- The person who's hobby is cooking is in an odd position (1 or 3), and since position 1 is the accountant, the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 3 (Brazilian).
- The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the Indonesian, so the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 4 (paramedic).

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Accountant (driving the motorbike)
- Position 2: Security-guard (Indonesian)
- Position 3: Drawing (Brazilian)
- Position 4: Paramedic (Indonesian)
- Position 5: Pakistani (driving the helicopter)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Ship Driver
- From Clue 2, the person driving the ship is in Position 5.
- From Clue 1, the Dutch is between the ship driver and the Russian. So, the Dutch must be in Position 3, and the Russian must be in Position 4.

|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |
| Food          |         |            |             |            |            |
| Nationality   |         |            | Dutch       | Russian    |            |
| Sport         |         |            |             |            |            |
| Transport     |         |            |             |            | Ship       |

#### Step 2: Positioning the Subway Driver
- From Clue 3, the person driving the subway is on the left of the Dutch. So, the person driving the subway must be in Position 1.

|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |
| Food          |         |            |             |            |            |
| Nationality   | Dutch   |            | Dutch       | Russian    |            |
| Sport         |         |            |             |            |            |
| Transport     | Subway  |            |             |            | Ship       |

#### Step 3: Positioning the Helicopter Driver
- From Clue 6, the person driving the helicopter is the person whose sport is surfing.
- From Clue 4, the person whose sport is surfing is between the person eating pomegranate and the person whose sport is parkour.
- From Clue 11, the person eating corn is the person whose sport is basketball.
- From Clue 9, the person whose sport is basketball is on the right of the person whose sport is water-polo.
- From Clue 12, the person whose sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person whose sport is cricket.

Since the person eating corn is on the far left or far right (Clue 14), and it's already in Position 1, the person whose sport is basketball must be in Position 1. This means the person whose sport is water-polo must be in Position 2, and the person whose sport is cricket must be in Position 3 or 4.

|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |
| Food          | Corn    |            |             |            |            |

| Transport     | Subway  |            |             |            | Ship       |

#### Step 4: Positioning the Roller Driver
- From Clue 8, the Indonesian is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the Indonesian cannot be in Position 4 (Russian) or 5 (Ship), they must be in Position 3 or 4. But since the person driving the roller must be in Position 2, the Indonesian must be in Position 4.

|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |
| Food          | Corn    |            |             |            |            |

| Transport     | Subway  | Roller    |             | Indonesian | Ship       |

#### Step 5: Positioning the Person Eating Apricot
- From Clue 5, the person eating apricot is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since Positions 1, 3, and 5 are already occupied, this clue is redundant given our current positions.

#### Step 6: Positioning the Person Eating Carrot
- From Clue 10, the Indonesian is on the left or right of the person eating carrot. Since the Indonesian is in Position 4, the person eating carrot must be in Position 2.

|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |

| Transport     | Subway  | Roller    |             | Indonesian | Ship       |

#### Step 7: Positioning the Person Eating Pomegranate
- From Clue 4, the person whose sport is surfing is between the person eating pomegranate and the person whose sport is parkour. Since the person whose sport is surfing is in Position 2, the person eating pomegranate must be in Position 1.

|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |

| Transport     | Subway  | Roller    |             | Indonesian | Ship       |

#### Step 8: Positioning the Person Eating Cabbage
- From Clue 13, the person eating cabbage is on the right of the person whose sport is parkour. Since the person whose sport is parkour is in Position 3, the person eating cabbage must be in Position 4.

|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |
| Food          | Pomegranate | Carrot     | Cabbage    |            |            |

| Transport     | Subway  | Roller    |             | Indonesian | Ship       |

#### Step 9: Finalizing the Remaining Details
- From Clue 15, the person eating corn is on the left or right of the person eating carrot. Since the person eating corn is in Position 1 and the person eating carrot is in Position 2, this is consistent.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 14:** The software-developer is driving the helicopter.
2. **From Clue 8:** The firefighter is driving the taxi.
3. **From Clue 12:** The firefighter (position 1) is on the left of the person eating eggplant.
4. **From Clue 13:** The librarian (position 2) is on the left of the person driving the taxi (firefighter at position 1), so the librarian must be in position 2.
5. **From Clue 4:** The person eating carrot is the librarian (position 2).
6. **From Clue 11:** The writer is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
7. **From Clue 3:** The person drinking fanta is on the left of the writer. Since the writer can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5, and the person drinking fanta must be to the left of the writer, the writer cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the writer must be in position 3 or 5.
8. **From Clue 6:** The person drinking juice is between the person driving the helicopter (software-developer) and the person eating carrot (librarian). This means the person drinking juice must be in position 3.

13. **From Clue 9:** The person drinking juice (position 3) is on the left or right of the person eating avocado. Since the person drinking juice is in position 3, the person eating avocado must be in position 5.
14. **From Clue 1:** The software-developer is either in position 1 or 5. Since the software-developer is driving the helicopter and is not in position 1 (firefighter), the software-developer must be in position 5.
15. **From Clue 11:** The writer must be in position 3 since it’s the only remaining odd position.
