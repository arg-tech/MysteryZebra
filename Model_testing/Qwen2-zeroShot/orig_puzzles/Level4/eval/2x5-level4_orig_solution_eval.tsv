Lv4-2x5-1	"Let's break down the clues step by step to solve this puzzle:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of soul is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
2. **Clue 2:** The fan of soul is in the middle (position 3).
3. **Clue 3:** The person eating radish is on the left or right of the fan of pop (position 3).
4. **Clue 4:** The person eating lettuce is on the right of the person eating pumpkin.
5. **Clue 5:** The person eating cauliflower is between the fan of soul and the fan of salsa (positions 2 and 4).
6. **Clue 6:** The person eating radish is in the middle (position 3).
7. **Clue 7:** The fan of soul is on the right of the fan of trance.
8. **Clue 8:** The person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the person eating radish (position 3).

From Clue 2 and Clue 6, we know that the fan of soul is in position 3.

From Clue 3, since the fan of soul is in position 3, the person eating radish must be in either position 2 or 4.

From Clue 5, the person eating cauliflower must be between the fan of soul and the fan of salsa. Since the fan of soul is in position 3, the fan of salsa must be in position 2 and the person eating cauliflower must be in position 4.

From Clue 7, the fan of soul is on the right of the fan of trance. Since the fan of soul is in position 3, the fan of trance must be in position 1.

From Clue 8, the person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the person eating radish. Since the person eating radish is in position 2 or 4, and the person eating cauliflower is in position 4, the person eating pumpkin must be in position 2.

Now let's summarize:
- Position 1: Fan of trance
- Position 2: Person eating pumpkin
- Position 3: Fan of soul
- Position 4: Person eating cauliflower
- Position 5: Person eating radish

We need to assign the foods and music genres accordingly:
- From Clue 4, the person eating lettuce must be on the right of the person eating pumpkin. Since the person eating pumpkin is in position 2, the person eating lettuce must be in position 5.
- This leaves the person eating garlic for position 1.

So the final assignments are:
- Position 1: Garlic (Trance)
- Position 2: Pumpkin (Salsa)
- Position 3: Soul
- Position 4: Cauliflower (Trance)
- Position 5: Radish (Pop)

Now, let's fill in the table with the final solution:

Lv4-2x5-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The person drinking almond-milk is in an even position (i.e., position 2 or 4).
2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person whose sport is swimming.
3. The person drinking water is in the middle (position 3).
4. The person whose sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
5. The person whose sport is badminton is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person whose sport is swimming.
6. The person whose sport is surfing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
7. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking tea.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Water
- From clue 3, the person drinking water is in position 3.
- Therefore, the table looks like this so far:
```
|            |      1       |     2     |    3     |      4      |    5    |
| Beverage   |              |           | water    |             |         |
| Sport      |              |           |          |             |         |
```

#### Step 2: Positioning Almond-Milk
- From clue 1, the person drinking almond-milk is in an even position (2 or 4).
- From clue 2, the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person whose sport is swimming.
- From clue 6, the person whose sport is surfing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

This means that the person drinking almond-milk cannot be in position 4 because then there would be no room for the person whose sport is surfing. So, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2.

- Therefore, the table now looks like this:
```
|            |      1       |     2     |    3     |      4      |    5    |
| Beverage   |              | almond-milk | water    |             |         |
| Sport      |              |           |          |             |         |
```

#### Step 3: Positioning Swimming and Surfing
- From clue 2, the person drinking almond-milk (position 2) is on the right of the person whose sport is swimming.
- Therefore, the person whose sport is swimming must be in position 1.
- From clue 6, the person whose sport is surfing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (position 2), so they must be in position 4.

- Therefore, the table now looks like this:
```
|            |      1       |     2     |    3     |      4      |    5    |
| Beverage   |              | almond-milk | water    |             |         |
| Sport      | swimming     |           |          | surfing     |         |
```

#### Step 4: Positioning Badminton
- From clue 5, the person whose sport is badminton is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person whose sport is swimming.
- Since the person whose sport is swimming is in position 1, the person whose sport is badminton must be in position 2, but we already have almond-milk in position 2.
- Therefore, the person whose sport is badminton must be in position 3, which is occupied by water. This means the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 4 and the person whose sport is badminton in position 5.

- Therefore, the table now looks like this:
```
|            |      1       |     2     |    3     |      4      |    5    |
| Beverage   |              | almond-milk | water    | iced-tea    |         |
| Sport      | swimming     | badminton |          | surfing     | tennis  |
```

#### Step 5: Positioning Tea and Final Verification
- From clue 7, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking tea.
- Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 5, which is already occupied by tennis.

- Therefore, the only beverage left is fanta, and it must be in position 1.

- Therefore, the final table looks like this:
```
|            |      1       |     2     |    3     |      4      |    5    |
| Beverage   | fanta        | almond-milk | water    | iced-tea    | tea     |
| Sport      | swimming     | badminton  |          | surfing     | tennis  |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |      1       |     2     |    3     |      4      |    5    |
| Beverage   | fanta        | almond-milk | water    | iced-tea    | tea     |

Lv4-2x5-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of reggae is the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - This means card-games is associated with reggae.
   
2. **Clue 2**: The fan of electronic is in an even position (i.e., 2 or 4).
   - This means electronic can only be in positions 2 or 4.
   
3. **Clue 3**: The fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of metal.
   - If electronic is in position 2, then metal must be in position 1.
   - If electronic is in position 4, then metal must be in position 3.
   
4. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the fan of blues.
   - This means blues could be adjacent to filmmaking.
   
5. **Clue 5**: The fan of metal is on the left or right of the fan of blues.
   - This means blues could also be adjacent to metal.
   
6. **Clue 6**: The fan of trance is on the left or right of the fan of electronic.
   - This means electronic could be adjacent to trance.
   
7. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - Since card-games is already assigned to reggae, magic-tricks must be on the right of reggae.
   
8. **Clue 8**: The person who's hobby is video-games is on the far left or far right.
   - This means video-games can only be in position 1 or 5.

Let's start by placing the known elements:

- Position 1: Video-games (from Clue 8)
- Position 5: Magic-tricks (from Clue 7)

Since card-games is reggae (Clue 1), and magic-tricks is on the right of reggae, reggae cannot be in position 5. So, reggae must be in position 2 or 4.

If reggae is in position 2:
- Position 1: Video-games
- Position 2: Reggae (card-games)
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: Magic-tricks

Now, let's place electronic and metal:
- From Clue 3, if reggae is in position 2, then metal must be in position 1.
- From Clue 6, trance must be on the right of electronic.

Since electronic can only be in position 2 (reggae is there) or 4, and it must be on the right of metal:
- Position 1: Metal
- Position 2: Reggae (card-games)
- Position 3: Electronic
- Position 4: Trance
- Position 5: Magic-tricks

This satisfies all the conditions so far:
- Clue 2: Electronic is in an even position (position 3).
- Clue 3: Electronic is on the right of metal.
- Clue 6: Trance is on the right of electronic.
- Clue 7: Magic-tricks is on the right of reggae.
- Clue 8: Video-games is on the far left.

Now we need to fill in the remaining hobbies:
- Position 1: Video-games
- Position 2: Reggae (card-games)
- Position 3: Electronic
- Position 4: Trance
- Position 5: Magic-tricks

The remaining hobbies are filmmaking and reading. Filmmaking can be in position 3 or 4 because blues must be adjacent to filmmaking (Clue 4).

If blues is in position 3, then filmmaking must be in position 4:
- Position 1: Video-games
- Position 2: Reggae (card-games)
- Position 3: Blues
- Position 4: Filmmaking
- Position 5: Magic-tricks

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 4: Filmmaking is on the right of blues.
- Clue 5: Blues is not next to metal (metal is in position 1).

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1      |      2       |     3      |     4      |      5      |

Lv4-2x5-4	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in the middle (position 3).
2. The person watching adventure movies is in an even position (position 4).
3. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far right (position 5).
4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person watching martial-arts movies.
5. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person watching spy movies.
6. The person who's hobby is puzzles is between the person watching satire movies and the person who's hobby is woodworking.
7. The person watching spy movies is the person who's hobby is sudoku.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 3 (rock-climbing)**
   - Hobbies: rock-climbing
   - Movie-Genres: (Not yet determined)

2. **Position 4 (adventure movies)**
   - Hobbies: (Not yet determined)
   - Movie-Genres: adventure

3. **Position 5 (martial-arts movies)**
   - Hobbies: woodworking
   - Movie-Genres: martial-arts

4. **Position 1 (spy movies)**
   - Hobbies: sudoku
   - Movie-Genres: (Not yet determined)

5. **Position 2 (satire movies)**
   - Hobbies: (Not yet determined)
   - Movie-Genres: satire

6. **Position 3 (puzzles)**
   - Hobbies: puzzles
   - Movie-Genres: (Not yet determined)

From clue 5, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since rock-climbing is in position 3, the person watching spy movies must be in position 2.

From clue 6, the person who's hobby is puzzles is between the person watching satire movies and the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is in position 5, puzzles must be in position 4 (which is already occupied by adventure movies). Therefore, the person with puzzles as a hobby must be in position 2.

From clue 7, the person watching spy movies is the person who's hobby is sudoku. So, position 1 must be sudoku.

Now we can fill in the positions:

- Position 1: Sudoku (Spy movies)
- Position 2: Puzzles (Satire movies)
- Position 3: Rock-climbing (Adventure movies)
- Position 4: Woodworking (Martial-arts movies)
- Position 5: (No new information needed for this position)

Let's summarize the final table:

Lv4-2x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information step-by-step into the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).**
2. **The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the australian.**
3. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the japanese.**
4. **The canadian is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade (3).**
5. **The japanese is on the far right (5).**
6. **The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the egyptian.**
7. **The brazilian is in an even position (2 or 4).**
8. **The person drinking mirinda is on the far right (5).**

From clue 8, we know:
- The person drinking mirinda is in position 5.
- Therefore, the Japanese must be in position 5 as well (clue 5).

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |          |          |            |           | mirinda  |
| Nationality   |          |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 6, since the Japanese is in position 5, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 4 (because they are on the right of the Egyptian).
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |          |          |            | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   |          |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 3, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the Japanese. Since the Japanese is in position 5, the soy-milk drinker must be in position 4, but that is already occupied by iced-tea. Thus, the soy-milk drinker must be in position 3.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |          |          | soy-milk   | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   |          |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 1, the person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position, and we have already placed iced-tea in position 4. So, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 1.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea |          | soy-milk   | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   |          |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 6, the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the Egyptian. Since the iced-tea drinker in position 1 cannot be on the right of the Egyptian, the Egyptian must be in position 2.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea |          | soy-milk   | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   | egyptian |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 7, the Brazilian is in an even position. Since position 4 is already taken by iced-tea, the Brazilian must be in position 2.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea | brazilian | soy-milk   | iced-tea  | mirinda  |
| Nationality   | egyptian |          |            |           | japanese |
```

From clue 2, the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the australian. Since the Brazilian is in position 2 and the Japanese is in position 5, the only positions left for the australian and the lemonade drinker are 3 and 4 respectively.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea | brazilian | lemonade   | australian| mirinda  |
| Nationality   | egyptian |          |            |           | japanese |
```

Finally, from clue 4, the Canadian is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the lemonade drinker is in position 3, the Canadian must be in position 4.
So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea | brazilian | lemonade   | australian| mirinda  |
| Nationality   | egyptian | canadian |            |           | japanese |
```

Since all the clues are satisfied, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea | brazilian | lemonade   | australian| mirinda  |

Lv4-2x5-6	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to find the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking cola is on the far left (position 1).
2. **Clue 2**: The engineer is between the software-developer and the person drinking lemonade.
3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the engineer.
5. **Clue 5**: The paramedic is the person drinking lemonade.
6. **Clue 6**: The paramedic is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).
7. **Clue 7**: The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
8. **Clue 8**: The security-guard is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.

From Clue 5 and Clue 6, we know:
- The paramedic (drinking lemonade) is in positions 2, 4, or 6.

Since the paramedic is drinking lemonade (Clue 5), and from Clue 4, the engineer must be to the left of the paramedic, and from Clue 2, the software-developer must be to the right of the paramedic.

### Positioning the Paramedic:
- If the paramedic is in position 2, then the engineer must be in position 1 (but position 1 is already taken by cola), so this is not possible.
- If the paramedic is in position 4, then the engineer must be in position 3, and the software-developer must be in position 5. This fits all the conditions so far.
- If the paramedic is in position 6, then the engineer must be in position 5, and the software-developer must be in position 4. However, this would place the security-guard to the right of the paramedic, which contradicts Clue 8 because the security-guard must be in position 5. Therefore, this is also not possible.

Thus, the paramedic must be in position 4, with the engineer in position 3 and the software-developer in position 5.

### Remaining Positions:
- Position 1: Cola (from Clue 1)
- Position 2: (to be determined, but not the paramedic)
- Position 4: Paramedic (drinking lemonade)
- Position 5: Software-developer
- Position 3: Engineer

From Clue 3, the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the paramedic (lemonade) is in position 4, the mirinda drinker must be in position 5, and the 7up drinker must be in position 3.

This leaves position 2 for the remaining beverage, which is 7up.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Cola
- Position 2: 7up
- Position 3: Mirinda
- Position 4: Lemonade (paramedic)
- Position 5: 7up (mirinda)

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-2x5-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step and determine the positions of the beverages and jobs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person drinking lemonade is in the middle (position 3).**
   - This means Lemonade is in position 3.

2. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right (position 5).**
   - This means Hot-Chocolate is in position 5.

3. **The firefighter is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).**
   - Since position 3 is taken by Lemonade and position 5 by Hot-Chocolate, the firefighter must be in position 1 or 3.
   - But position 3 is already taken, so the firefighter must be in position 1.

4. **The paramedic is on the right of the electrician.**
   - This means the electrician cannot be in position 5 (where Hot-Chocolate is) and must be to the left of the paramedic.

5. **The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the electrician.**
   - This means the sprite drinker must be adjacent to the electrician.

6. **The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
   - Since hot-chocolate is in position 5, the sprite drinker must be in position 4.

7. **The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
   - This confirms that Sprite is in position 4.

8. **The person drinking lemonade is in the middle (position 3).**
   - We already know Lemonade is in position 3.

9. **The doctor is on the left or right of the person drinking water.**
   - This means the doctor must be adjacent to the water drinker.

10. **The paramedic is on the right of the electrician.**
    - This means if the electrician is in position 2, the paramedic must be in position 4 or 5, but position 4 is occupied by Sprite, so the electrician must be in position 2 and the paramedic in position 4.

Given these constraints, let's place the beverages and jobs:

- Position 1: Firefighter (from constraint 5)
- Position 2: Electrician (since paramedic is in 4 and must be right of electrician)
- Position 3: Lemonade (from constraint 3)
- Position 4: Sprite (from constraint 4)
- Position 5: Hot-Chocolate (from constraint 2)

Now, we need to assign the jobs:

- Position 1: Firefighter
- Position 2: Electrician
- Position 3: Lemonade
- Position 4: Sprite
- Position 5: Hot-Chocolate

Next, we need to place the jobs based on the remaining constraints:

- **Doctor and Librarian**:
  - The librarian is on the far right (position 5), so the librarian is Hot-Chocolate.
  - The doctor is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
  - Water must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
  - Since firefighter (1), electrician (2), and librarian (5) are already placed, the only job left for position 3 is the librarian.
  - Therefore, the doctor must be in position 1 or 2.
  - Given the doctor is on the left or right of the water drinker, the doctor must be in position 2 (Electrician).

So, the final placement is:

- Position 1: Firefighter
- Position 2: Doctor (Electrician)
- Position 3: Librarian (Lemonade)
- Position 4: Paramedic
- Position 5: Hot-Chocolate

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-2x5-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding beverage and movie genre in the appropriate positions.

Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

1. **The person watching mystery movies is the person drinking water.**
   - This means the person in position 5 drinks water and watches mystery movies.

2. **The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.**
   - This means if the person in position \(x\) drinks coffee, then the person in position \(x+1\) watches scientific movies.

3. **The person drinking sprite is in an even position.**
   - Sprite can only be in positions 2 or 4.

4. **The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - If the person in position \(y\) drinks lemonade, then the person in position \(y+1\) watches martial-arts movies.

5. **The person watching martial-arts movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching superhero movies.**
   - This means the order for these genres must be: scientific -> martial-arts -> superhero or superhero -> martial-arts -> scientific.

6. **The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies.**
   - Since the person watching mystery movies is in position 5, the person watching musical movies must be in position 4.

7. **The person watching mystery movies is on the far right.**
   - This reiterates that the person in position 5 is watching mystery movies and drinking water.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 7, the person in position 5 drinks water and watches mystery movies.
   ```
   |               |     1     |      2       |     3      |    4    |    5    |
   | Beverage      |           |              |            |         | water  |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |              |            |         | mystery|
   ```

2. From clue 6, the person in position 4 watches musical movies.
   ```
   |               |     1     |      2       |     3      |    4    |    5    |
   | Beverage      |           |              |            |         | water  |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |              |            | musical | mystery|
   ```

3. From clue 1, the person in position 5 drinks water and watches mystery movies, which aligns with our previous placement.

4. From clue 2, the person drinking coffee is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. The only possible positions for coffee and scientific movies are:
   - Coffee in position 1, Scientific in position 2 (or)
   - Coffee in position 2, Scientific in position 3 (or)
   - Coffee in position 3, Scientific in position 4 (or)
   - Coffee in position 4, Scientific in position 5 (but 5 is already taken by water and mystery)

5. From clue 3, the person drinking sprite is in an even position. Sprite can only be in positions 2 or 4.
   - If sprite is in position 2, then the person in position 3 cannot be scientific (as it would conflict with clue 2).
   - If sprite is in position 4, then the person in position 3 must be scientific (as it fits with clue 2).

6. From clue 4, the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. The only possible positions for lemonade and martial-arts movies are:
   - Lemonade in position 1, Martial-arts in position 2 (or)
   - Lemonade in position 2, Martial-arts in position 3 (or)
   - Lemonade in position 3, Martial-arts in position 4 (or)
   - Lemonade in position 4, Martial-arts in position 5 (but 5 is already taken by water and mystery)

7. From clue 5, the person watching martial-arts movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching superhero movies. This means the order must be:
   - Scientific -> Martial-arts -> Superhero (or)
   - Superhero -> Martial-arts -> Scientific

### Final Placement:

- Let's place sprite in position 4:
  - Sprite in position 4 means the person in position 3 watches scientific movies.
  - The person in position 2 drinks coffee.
  - The person in position 1 drinks lemonade.
  - The person in position 3 watches superhero movies.

This placement satisfies all the clues:
```
|               |     1     |      2       |     3      |    4    |    5    |
| Beverage      | lemonade  | coffee       | scientific | sprite  | water  |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero | martial-arts | scientific | musical | mystery|
```

Thus, the final solution is:

```

#### Clue 5:
The Egyptian is the owner of the fish, and they must be in an even position (2 or 4). Since position 4 is already taken by the Indonesian, the Egyptian must be in position 2.
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

#### Clue 6:
The Indian is between the Egyptian and the Chinese. Given the positions, the Indian can only be in position 3, and the Chinese must be in position 4.
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

```

#### Clue 7:
The owner of the pony is on the right of the Indian. Since the Indian is in position 3, the pony must be in position 4.
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

| Pet           |      | Fish     | Pony       | Horse   |            |
```

#### Clue 8:
The owner of the goat is on the far left or far right. Position 1 is not occupied yet, so the goat must be in position 1.
```
|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |

Lv4-2x5-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the lawyer.
2. The person who's sport is soccer is on the far left or far right.
3. The person who's sport is sailing is the accountant.
4. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the accountant.
5. The person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position.
6. The lawyer is on the left of the dancer.
7. The firefighter is in the middle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Firefighter
From clue 7, we know that the firefighter is in the middle (position 3).

|         |   1    |   2    | **3**   |     4      |    5    |

| Sport   |        |        | **Firefighter** |            |         |

#### Step 2: Positioning the Sailing Accountant
From clue 3, the person who's sport is sailing is the accountant.

|         |   1    |   2    | **3**   |     4      |    5    |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|------------|---------|

| Sport   | **Sailing** |        | **Firefighter** |            |         |

#### Step 3: Positioning the Swimming Sport
From clue 5, the person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position. Since position 3 is already taken, the possible positions for swimming are 1 or 5.

#### Step 4: Positioning the Soccer Sport
From clue 2, the person who's sport is soccer is on the far left or far right. Therefore, it can be in position 1 or 5.

#### Step 5: Positioning the Tennis Sport
From clue 1, the person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the lawyer. This means the lawyer must be in a position to the left of the tennis player.

#### Step 6: Positioning the Rowing Sport
From clue 4, the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the accountant (position 3). So, rowing cannot be in position 3 and must be in a position to the right of 3.

#### Step 7: Positioning the Lawyer and Dancer
From clue 6, the lawyer is on the left of the dancer. Combining this with clue 1, the tennis player must be in position 4 or 5.

Let's try placing the soccer sport in position 1 and see if we can fit everything else.

|         | **Soccer** |   2    | **3**   |     4      |    5    |
|---------|------------|--------|--------|------------|---------|

| Sport   | **Soccer** |        | **Firefighter** |            |         |

Now, place the accountant in position 2 since they do sailing.

|         | **Soccer** | **Accountant** | **3**   |     4      |    5    |
|---------|------------|----------------|--------|------------|---------|
| Job     | **Soccer** | **Accountant** | **Firefighter** |            |         |
| Sport   | **Soccer** | **Sailing**    | **Firefighter** |            |         |

Now, place the rowing sport to the right of the accountant (position 4).

|         | **Soccer** | **Accountant** | **3**   | **Rowing** |    5    |
|---------|------------|----------------|--------|------------|---------|
| Job     | **Soccer** | **Accountant** | **Firefighter** |            |         |
| Sport   | **Soccer** | **Sailing**    | **Firefighter** | **Rowing** |         |

The remaining sports are tennis and swimming. Since the tennis player must be to the right of the lawyer and the lawyer is to the left of the dancer, the only position for the lawyer is 1 and the dancer is 5.

|         | **Soccer** | **Accountant** | **3**   | **Rowing** | **Tennis** |
|---------|------------|----------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Job     | **Soccer** | **Accountant** | **Firefighter** |            | **Dancer** |
| Sport   | **Soccer** | **Sailing**    | **Firefighter** | **Rowing** | **Tennis** |

Finally, place the swimming sport in position 5.

|         | **Soccer** | **Accountant** | **3**   | **Rowing** | **Swimming** |
|---------|------------|----------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Job     | **Soccer** | **Accountant** | **Firefighter** |            | **Dancer**  |
| Sport   | **Soccer** | **Sailing**    | **Firefighter** | **Rowing** | **Swimming** |

So, the final solution is:
