Lv4-2x6-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct arrangement of pets and transport modes.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Positions:**
   - The person driving the scooter (Pet 1) is the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - The owner of the pony (Pet 2) drives the tram.
   - The owner of the horse (Pet 3) is to the right of the owner of the rabbit (Pet 4).
   - The person driving the scooter is between the person driving the tram and the person driving the taxi.
   - The person driving the taxi is in an even position.
   - The person driving the ship is on the far right.
   - The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - The owner of the snake (Pet 6) drives the skateboard.
   - The owner of the guinea-pig is to the right of the owner of the horse.

2. **Determine the Order:**
   - From clue 4, we know that the person driving the scooter is between the person driving the tram and the person driving the taxi. This means the order must be:
     - Person driving the scooter (odd position)
     - Person driving the tram (even position)
     - Person driving the taxi (even position)

3. **Assign Even and Odd Positions:**
   - Since the person driving the scooter is between the person driving the tram and the person driving the taxi, and the person driving the taxi is in an even position, the person driving the scooter must be in an odd position.
   - The person driving the tram is in an even position.
   - The person driving the taxi is in an even position.
   - The person driving the ship is on the far right, which is position 6.

4. **Assign Positions Based on Clues:**
   - Position 6 (Ship) is driven by someone who is either to the left or right of the skateboard driver. Since the skateboard driver is the owner of the snake (clue 8), the ship driver cannot be in position 5 because it would violate the condition that the ship driver is to the left or right of the skateboard driver. Therefore, the ship driver must be in position 6.
   - The person driving the taxi must be in an even position, and since position 6 is taken by the ship, the only remaining even positions are 4 and 2.
   - The person driving the scooter is between the tram and the taxi, so if the taxi is in position 4, the tram must be in position 2, and the scooter in position 1.
   - The person driving the scooter (position 1) is the owner of the guinea-pig (clue 1).
   - The person driving the tram (position 2) is the owner of the pony (clue 2).
   - The person driving the taxi (position 4) is in an even position and must be between the scooter and the tram. Therefore, the person driving the taxi is the owner of the rabbit (clue 3).
   - The owner of the horse (clue 3) is to the right of the owner of the rabbit, so the owner of the horse must be in position 5.
   - The owner of the snake (clue 8) is the person driving the skateboard, and the skateboard driver is in an odd position, so the skateboard driver must be in position 3.
   - The owner of the guinea-pig is to the right of the owner of the horse (clue 9), which is already satisfied with the current arrangement.

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv4-2x6-2	"Let's break down the clues and use logical deduction to solve this puzzle step-by-step.

### Clue Breakdown:
1. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the Brazilian.
2. The Dutch is on the far left or far right.
3. The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the Brazilian.
4. The Japanese is on the right of the person watching scientific movies.
5. The person watching mystery movies is the Dutch.
6. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
7. The Chinese is on the far left or far right.
8. The Italian is in an even position.
9. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the Italian.
10. The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions for the Dutch and Chinese
- From clue 2, the Dutch is on the far left or far right.
- From clue 7, the Chinese is on the far left or far right.
- Since the Dutch and Chinese cannot be in the same position (as they are distinct), one must be on the far left and the other on the far right.

Let's assume:
- Dutch is on the far left (position 1)
- Chinese is on the far right (position 6)

#### Step 2: Determine the positions for the Brazilian and Mystery
- From clue 5, the Dutch (position 1) is the person watching mystery movies.
- From clue 1, the person watching horror movies is on the left of the Brazilian.
- From clue 3, the person watching mystery movies (Dutch) is on the right of the Brazilian.
- Therefore, the Brazilian must be in position 2 (left of the Dutch).

So, we have:
```
|   | Dutch (mystery) |   |   |   | Chinese (mystery) |
|   1 |                | 2 |   |   |                  |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the positions for Horror and Comedy
- From clue 1, the person watching horror movies is on the left of the Brazilian (position 2).
- Therefore, the person watching horror movies must be in position 1, which is already taken by the Dutch (contradiction). So, re-evaluate:
- The horror movie-watcher must be in position 3 (left of the Brazilian).

So, we have:
```
|   | Dutch (mystery) |   | Horror |   | Chinese (mystery) |
|   1 |                | 2 |        |   |                  |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the positions for Comedy and Satire
- From clue 6, the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
- From clue 9, the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the Italian.
- From clue 8, the Italian is in an even position.
- The only even positions available are 4 and 6. Since Chinese is in position 6, the Italian must be in position 4.

So, we have:
```
|   | Dutch (mystery) |   | Horror |   | Chinese (mystery) |
|   1 |                | 2 |        | 4 |                  |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the positions for Satire and Scientific
- From clue 10, the person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.
- From clue 4, the Japanese is on the right of the person watching scientific movies.
- The only positions left are 3 and 5.
- If the Japanese is in position 5, then the person watching scientific movies must be in position 3, and the person watching satire movies can be in position 5.

So, we have:
```
|   | Dutch (mystery) | Comedy | Horror | Satire | Japanese (scientific) | Chinese (mystery) |
|   1 |                |        |        |        |                      |                  |
```

#### Step 6: Determine the positions for Comedy and Italian
- From clue 9, the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the Italian.
- The only position left for the Italian is 4, but it is already taken by the Japanese.

Re-evaluate:
- The person watching comedy movies must be in position 3, and the Italian must be in position 4.

So, we have:
```
|   | Dutch (mystery) | Comedy | Horror | Satire | Japanese (scientific) | Chinese (mystery) |
|   1 |                |        |        |        |                      |                  |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|   | Dutch (mystery) | Comedy | Horror | Satire | Japanese (scientific) | Chinese (mystery) |

Lv4-2x6-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding elements in the appropriate positions. Let's break down the clues and solve step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Basketball** is on the left of **Golf**.
2. **R&B** is on the left or right of **Weightlifting**.
3. **Golf** is on the left or right of **R&B**.
4. **Rock** is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
5. **Soul** is on the left or right of **Rock**.
6. **Salsa** is on the left or right of **Basketball**.
7. **Cycling** is on the left of **Metal**.
8. **Basketball** is on the far left or far right.
9. **Handball** is the fan of **Soul**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Basketball** must be at either position 1 or 6 due to Clue 8.
2. Since **Basketball** is on the left of **Golf**, if **Basketball** is at position 1, **Golf** can only be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If **Basketball** is at position 6, **Golf** can only be at position 5, 4, 3, or 2.
3. From Clue 2, **R&B** is on the left or right of **Weightlifting**. From Clue 3, **Golf** is on the left or right of **R&B**. This means **R&B** cannot be next to **Weightlifting** and **Golf**.
4. **Rock** is in an odd position (Clue 4), so it can be at position 1, 3, or 5.
5. **Soul** is on the left or right of **Rock** (Clue 5), so if **Rock** is at position 1, **Soul** can be at position 2 or 3; if **Rock** is at position 3, **Soul** can be at position 2 or 4; if **Rock** is at position 5, **Soul** can be at position 4 or 6.
6. **Salsa** is on the left or right of **Basketball** (Clue 6). If **Basketball** is at position 1, **Salsa** can be at position 2; if **Basketball** is at position 6, **Salsa** can be at position 5.
7. **Cycling** is on the left of **Metal** (Clue 7).

Let's start with placing **Basketball** at position 1 and see if it fits all conditions:

- **Basketball** at position 1:
  - **Golf** can be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  - **Rock** can be at position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 1 since **Basketball** is there).
  - **Salsa** can be at position 2 (since **Basketball** is at 1).

Now let's try to fit the other elements:

- If **Rock** is at position 3, then **Soul** can be at position 2 or 4.
- If **Salsa** is at position 2, **Golf** cannot be at position 2 or 3 (because **Basketball** is at 1 and **Golf** is to the right of **Basketball**). So, **Golf** can be at position 4 or 5.
- If **Golf** is at position 4, then **R&B** can be at positions 3 or 5. But **Rock** is at 3, so **R&B** must be at position 5.
- Now, **Soul** can only be at position 4, and **Handball** is the fan of **Soul**, so **Handball** is at position 4.
- **Cycling** is on the left of **Metal**, so **Cycling** can be at position 2 and **Metal** at position 3, but **R&B** is already at 5, so this placement doesn't work.

Let's try **Basketball** at position 6:

- **Golf** can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- **Rock** can be at position 1, 3, or 5.
- **Salsa** can be at position 5 (since **Basketball** is at 6).

Now let's try to fit the other elements:

- If **Rock** is at position 5, then **Soul** can be at position 4 or 6 (but **Basketball** is at 6, so **Soul** must be at 4).
- **Handball** is the fan of **Soul**, so **Handball** is at position 4.
- **Golf** can be at position 1, 2, or 3.
- If **Golf** is at position 1, then **R&B** can be at positions 2 or 3. But **Rock** is at 5, so **R&B** must be at 2.
- **Cycling** is on the left of **Metal**, so **Cycling** can be at position 2 and **Metal** at position 3, but **R&B** is already at 2, so this placement doesn't work.

Finally, let's try:

- **Basketball** at position 1:
  - **Golf** at position 2.
  - **Rock** at position 3.
  - **Salsa** at position 4.
  - **Soul** at position 5.
  - **Handball** at position 5 (since **Soul** is the fan of **Handball**).
  - **R&B** at position 6.
  - **Cycling** at position 2 and **Metal** at position 3.

This fits all the conditions:

Lv4-2x6-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis

1. **The person driving the boat is on the far right.**
   - This means the person driving the boat is in position 6.

2. **The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person driving the train.**
   - The person driving the train is in an even position (Clue 4), so possible positions for the train are 2, 4, or 6.
   - Since the boat is in position 6, the train cannot be in position 6.
   - Therefore, the train can only be in positions 2 or 4.

3. **The person watching action movies is on the far left.**
   - This means the person watching action movies is in position 1.

4. **The person driving the skateboard is the person watching family movies.**
   - This means the person watching family movies is also the one driving the skateboard.

5. **The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person watching family movies.**
   - Since the person watching family movies is also the one driving the skateboard, the motorbike driver must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies.**
   - This means the person watching satire movies must be in a position to the left of the person watching scientific movies.

7. **The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.**
   - Since the person watching action movies is in position 1, the person watching drama movies must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching drama movies.**
   - This means the person watching drama movies must be in a position to the right of the person driving the van.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Position 1:** Action movies
2. **Position 6:** Boat (Clue 1)
3. **Position 4:** Train (even position, and not 6, so it must be 4)
4. **Position 2 or 5:** Motorbike (Clue 6, and must be on the left or right of the skateboard driver)
5. **Position 3 or 5:** Family/Skateboard (Clue 4, and must be on the left or right of the motorbike driver)
6. **Position 2 or 3:** Scientific/Satire (Clue 7, and scientific is to the right of satire)

Given these constraints, let's try to fit everything together:

- Position 1: Action
- Position 2: Motorbike
- Position 3: Satire
- Position 4: Train
- Position 5: Family
- Position 6: Boat

Now, we need to check if this fits all the conditions:
- The person driving the boat (position 6) is correct.
- The person watching scientific movies (position 5) is on the right of the person driving the train (position 4).
- The person watching action movies (position 1) is on the far left.
- The person driving the skateboard (position 5) is the person watching family movies.
- The person driving the motorbike (position 2) is on the left of the person watching family movies.
- The person watching scientific movies (position 5) is on the right of the person watching satire movies (position 3).
- The person watching action movies (position 1) is on the left of the person watching drama movies.
- The person driving the van (not explicitly mentioned but inferred from the remaining positions) would be in position 3 or 4, but since position 3 is already taken by satire, it must be in position 2 or 5. However, position 2 is taken by motorbike, so it must be in position 5, which is the same as the person watching family movies. This doesn't conflict with any other clues.

Thus, the solution is:

```

10. The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person driving the bike.
11. The person watching musical movies is on the far right.
12. The person driving the skateboard is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11:** The person watching musical movies is on the far right.
   - This means the person watching musical movies is in position 6.

2. **Clue 2:** The person watching musical movies is the person driving the train.
   - Therefore, the train is in position 6.

3. **Clue 12:** The person driving the skateboard is in an even position.
   - Possible positions for the skateboard: 2, 4, or 6 (but 6 is taken by the train).

4. **Clue 3:** The person watching musical movies (train) is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - Since the train is in position 6, the snowmobile must be in position 4 or 2.

5. **Clue 4:** The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person watching western movies.
   - If the snowmobile is in position 4, the western movies must be in position 2.
   - If the snowmobile is in position 2, the western movies must be in position 1.

6. **Clue 5:** The person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - Since the train is in position 6, the snowmobile cannot be in position 4 (as it would violate Clue 5). Therefore, the snowmobile must be in position 2, and the western movies must be in position 1.

7. **Clue 3 (revisited):** The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - Confirmed with previous steps.

8. **Clue 7:** The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - The skateboard is in position 4, so the documentary movies can be in position 3 or 5.

   - If the documentary movies are in position 3, the scientific movies must be in position 1 or 2 (but 2 is taken by the western movies).
   - If the documentary movies are in position 5, the scientific movies must be in position 1 or 3 (but 1 is taken by the western movies).

10. **Clue 8:** The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
    - If the scientific movies are in position 3, the time-travel movies must be in position 1 or 2 (but 2 is taken by the western movies).
    - If the scientific movies are in position 5, the time-travel movies must be in position 1 or 3 (but 1 is taken by the western movies).

11. **Clue 9:** The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person watching western movies.
    - Confirmed with previous steps.

12. **Clue 10:** The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person driving the bike.
    - The remaining positions are 3 and 5. The only way to satisfy all conditions is:
        - Helicopter in position 3 and Bike in position 5.
        - Documentaries in position 3 and Time-travel in position 5.

Lv4-2x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct information in the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The British is the fan of disco.**
   - This means that in row 1 (Music-Genre), position 1 (1) should be ""disco"" and in row 2 (Nationality), position 1 (1) should be ""British"".

2. **The Turkish is on the left of the Polish.**
   - This means that if the Turkish person is in position \(x\), the Polish person must be in position \(x+1\).

3. **The Argentine is on the right of the fan of jazz.**
   - This means that if the fan of jazz is in position \(y\), the Argentine is in position \(y+1\).

4. **The fan of indie is on the left of the fan of rock.**
   - This means that if the fan of indie is in position \(z\), the fan of rock is in position \(z+1\).

5. **The fan of indie is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the fan of indie is either in position 1 or 6.

6. **The fan of gospel is in an odd position.**
   - This means the fan of gospel is in one of positions 1, 3, or 5.

7. **The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of gospel.**
   - This means that if the fan of trance is in position \(a\), the fan of gospel is in position \(a+1\).

8. **The fan of jazz is the Russian.**
   - This means that in row 1 (Music-Genre), position 4 (4) should be ""jazz"" and in row 2 (Nationality), position 4 (4) should be ""Russian"".

9. **The fan of indie is on the far left or far right.**
   - Repeated from clue 5.

10. **The Turkish is on the left of the fan of rock.**
    - This means that if the Turkish person is in position \(b\), the fan of rock is in position \(b+1\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 1, we know:
   - Music-Genre (1): Disco
   - Nationality (1): British

2. From clue 8, we know:
   - Music-Genre (4): Jazz
   - Nationality (4): Russian

3. From clue 9, the fan of indie is on the far left or far right. Let's assume it's on the far left (position 1 for now):
   - Music-Genre (1): Indie
   - Nationality (1): Argentine (from clue 3)

4. The Turkish is on the left of the Polish, and the Turkish is also on the left of the fan of rock. Since the fan of indie is in position 1, the Turkish cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the Turkish must be in position 2 or 3. Let's try position 2:
   - Music-Genre (2): Turkish
   - Nationality (2): Polish

5. The fan of rock is to the right of the Turkish, so it must be in position 3:
   - Music-Genre (3): Rock
   - Nationality (3): Fan of rock

Lv4-2x6-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each job and sport based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **The person who's sport is tennis is the writer.**
   - Writer is in position 6 (since tennis is at position 6).

2. **The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the project-manager.**
   - This means that the project-manager and snowboarding are adjacent.

3. **The person who's sport is badminton is on the left or right of the writer.**
   - Since the writer is in position 6, badminton can be in positions 5 or 1.

4. **The person who's sport is cricket is on the far left.**
   - Cricket is in position 1.

5. **The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the writer.**
   - Since the writer is in position 6, badminton must be in position 5.

6. **The software-developer is on the right of the engineer.**
   - This means the engineer is in an odd position, and the software-developer is in an even position to the right of the engineer.

7. **The engineer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket.**
   - Since cricket is in position 1, the engineer can be in positions 2 or 3.

8. **The nurse is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.**
   - The nurse is in position 5 (since the writer is in position 6 and the nurse is to the left of the writer).

9. **The analyst is in an even position.**
   - The analyst can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

10. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby.**
    - This means lacrosse and rugby are adjacent, with lacrosse to the right.

Let's summarize the information and place the jobs and sports accordingly:

- Position 1: Cricket (clue 4)
- Position 2: Engineer (clue 7, since it's the only even position left for the engineer)
- Position 3: Project-Manager (clue 2, since it must be next to snowboarding)
- Position 4: Analyst (clue 9, since it's an even position and not yet placed)
- Position 5: Nurse (clue 8, since it's to the left of the writer)
- Position 6: Writer (clue 1)

Now let's place the sports:
- Position 1: Cricket
- Position 2: (to be determined)
- Position 3: Snowboarding (adjacent to project-manager)
- Position 4: (to be determined)
- Position 5: Badminton (clue 5, since it's to the left of the writer)
- Position 6: Tennis (clue 1)

Since the engineer is in position 2 and the software-developer is to the right of the engineer, the software-developer must be in position 4. The remaining sports are lacrosse and rugby, which must be in positions 3 and 4, but since snowboarding is already in position 3, the only option is:
- Position 3: Snowboarding
- Position 4: Software-Developer

Finally, the only remaining sports are lacrosse and rugby, which must be in positions 2 and 3 respectively:
- Position 2: Lacrosse
- Position 3: Rugby

So, the final arrangement is:

|         |        1        |      2       |         3          |    4     |     5     |   6    |

Lv4-2x6-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step-by-step. Let's break it down:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left or far right.
2. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
3. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
4. The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
5. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking water.
6. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person drinking water.
7. The person who's sport is volleyball is in an odd position.
8. The person drinking milk is in an even position.
9. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
10. The person who's sport is cricket is in an odd position.
11. The person drinking sprite is on the far right.
12. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11**: The person drinking sprite is on the far right.
   - Position 6: Sprite

2. **Clue 12**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.
   - Since volleyball is in an odd position (Clue 7), and weightlifting must be on the left, weightlifting cannot be in position 1 or 3 (since volleyball is in an odd position). Therefore, weightlifting must be in position 2, and volleyball in position 4.

3. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is volleyball is in an odd position.
   - Positions for volleyball: 1 or 3. Given that weightlifting is in position 2, volleyball must be in position 3.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
   - Volleyball is in position 3, so snowboarding must be in position 5 or 6. But since sprite is in position 6, snowboarding must be in position 5.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left or far right.
   - Since snowboarding is in position 5, it cannot be on the far left. So, snowboarding must be on the far right, which contradicts our previous placement. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions:
   - Snowboarding must be in position 1.
   - Volleyball is still in position 3.
   - Weightlifting is in position 2.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
   - Surfing must be in position 2 or 3, but weightlifting is in position 2. So, surfing must be in position 4, and swimming in position 5.

7. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - Swimming is in position 5, so iced-tea must be in position 4.

8. **Clue 5**: The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking water.
   - Iced-tea is in position 4, so water must be in position 6 (but sprite is already there, contradiction).

Re-evaluating:
- iced-tea must be in position 2, and water in position 3 (volleyball).

9. **Clue 8**: The person drinking milk is in an even position.
   - Milk must be in position 2 or 4. Since iced-tea is in position 2, milk must be in position 4.

10. **Clue 9**: The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
    - Hot-chocolate must be in position 2, and milk in position 4.

11. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person drinking water.
    - Water must be in position 4, and volleyball in position 3.

12. **Clue 10**: The person who's sport is cricket is in an odd position.
    - Cricket must be in position 1 or 3. Since snowboarding is in position 1, cricket must be in position 3 (volleyball).

10. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking milk.
11. The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 9**: The person drinking almond-milk is the person driving the train. So, Train (1) = Almond-Milk.
2. **Clue 4**: The person drinking water is the person driving the ship. So, Ship (5) = Water.
3. **Clue 10**: The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking cola is on the far right (6), the person drinking milk must be in position 5 (Ship). This contradicts clue 4, so we need to re-evaluate.
4. **Clue 2**: The person driving the train is on the far left (1). So, Train (1) = Almond-Milk.
5. **Clue 4**: The person drinking water is the person driving the ship. So, Ship (5) = Water.
6. **Clue 5**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position 5 (Ship), the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 4 or 6.
7. **Clue 6**: The person driving the scooter is on the far right (6). So, Scooter (6) = Cola.
8. **Clue 7**: The person driving the scooter is the person drinking cola. So, Cola (6) = Scooter.
9. **Clue 8**: The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the scooter is in position 6 (rightmost), the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
10. **Clue 10**: The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking cola is in position 6, the person drinking milk must be in position 4.
11. **Clue 1**: The person driving the ship is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is in position 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 3.
12. **Clue 5**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 3.
13. **Clue 11**: The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since positions 1 and 3 are already occupied, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 5 (Ship).
14. **Clue 4**: The person drinking water is the person driving the ship. So, Ship (5) = Water.
15. **Clue 3**: The person driving the van is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. The only remaining positions for van and quad-bike are 2 and 3, but since position 3 is already taken by hot-chocolate, the person driving the van must be in position 2 and the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 4.
