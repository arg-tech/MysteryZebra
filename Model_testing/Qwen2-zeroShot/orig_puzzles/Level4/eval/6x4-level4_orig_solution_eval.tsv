### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 12:** The person who watches action movies is the person driving the train.
2. **Clue 3:** The fan of punk is on the left of the person driving the train (from Clue 12). Therefore, the person driving the train must be in position 4 (since the fan of punk can only be in positions 1 or 2).
3. **Clue 13:** The person driving the quad-bike is on the far left or far right (position 1 or 4). Since position 4 is taken by the train driver, the quad-bike driver must be in position 1.
4. **Clue 1:** The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the fan of punk. Since the train driver is in position 4 and the fan of punk is to the left of the train driver, the fan of punk must be in position 3 (the only remaining position that allows for the action movie watcher to be in position 2 or 4).
5. **Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is board-games is the fan of reggae.
6. **Clue 5:** The person whose hobby is board-games is the owner of the guinea-pig. Therefore, the person in position 3 (fan of punk) owns the guinea-pig.
7. **Clue 6:** The fan of electronic is the person whose hobby is camping. Therefore, the person in position 3 (fan of punk) is also the fan of electronic and has a hobby of camping.

9. **Clue 14:** The owner of the mouse is the person watching spy movies. Therefore, the person in position 3 (fan of punk) is also the owner of the mouse.
10. **Clue 15:** The person drinking lemonade is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since position 1 is the quad-bike driver, position 3 is the fan of punk, and position 5 is the only remaining odd position, the person in position 5 drinks lemonade.
11. **Clue 11:** The person drinking lemonade is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). We already know the person in position 5 drinks lemonade.
12. **Clue 7:** The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person drinking juice. Since the train driver is in position 4, the snowmobile driver must be in position 3 (the only position to the right of the person drinking juice).
13. **Clue 2:** The person drinking soy-milk is in an even position (2 or 4). Since position 4 is the train driver, the person in position 2 drinks soy-milk.
14. **Clue 8:** The person drinking juice is on the left or right of the owner of the frog. Since the train driver is in position 4, the person drinking juice must be in position 3 (the only position where the owner of the frog could be in position 2 or 4).

16. **Clue 16:** The person whose hobby is writing is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the person in position 3 (fan of punk) watches spy movies and the person in position 2 drinks juice, the person in position 1 (quad-bike driver) must watch martial-arts movies and the person in position 2 (juice drinker) has a hobby of writing.
17. **Clue 17:** The fan of punk is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is writing. Since the person in position 3 (fan of punk) is to the left of the person in position 2 (writer), this condition is satisfied.

18. **Clue 18:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
19. **Clue 19:** The Italian is in an even position.

### Initial Setup:
Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Leftmost
- Position 2: Second from the left
- Position 3: Middle
- Position 4: Rightmost

#### Clues Analysis:
- **Spanish** must be next to the fan of techno and can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- **Fan of Techno** must be one position to the left of the Spanish.
- **Person Drinking Tea** must be in position 1 or 4.
- **Puzzles** and **Water-Polo** are linked; the person with puzzles has water-polo as their sport.
- **Spanish** is the person with puzzles.
- **Soy-Milk** must be on the left of the fan of d&b.
- **Classical** must be in an even position (2 or 4).
- **Owner of Dog** is the fan of classical.
- **Frog** must be on the right of the person with board-games.
- **Horse** must be on the left or right of the fan of folk.
- **Weightlifting** is on the right of rock-climbing.
- **Italian** must be in an even position.

### Deductions:
1. Since the Spanish is the person with puzzles, and they have water-polo as their sport, and they are next to the fan of techno, let's assume:
   - Spanish = Puzzles, Water-Polo
   - Techno = Position 2, Spanish = Position 3 or 4.
   - If Spanish is in position 4, then Techno is in position 3.
   - If Spanish is in position 3, then Techno is in position 2.

2. The person drinking tea is in position 1 or 4. Since Spanish is in position 3 or 4, tea cannot be in position 4 if Spanish is in position 3. Thus, Spanish is in position 4, and tea is in position 1.

3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the fan of d&b. Since Spanish is in position 4, the person drinking soy-milk is in position 2, and the fan of d&b is in position 3.

4. The fan of classical is in an even position, and the owner of the dog is the fan of classical. So, the fan of classical is in position 2 or 4. Since Spanish is in position 4, the fan of classical is in position 2, and the owner of the dog is Spanish.

5. The owner of the frog is on the right of the person with board-games. Since Spanish is the owner of the dog, the person with board-games is in position 3, and the owner of the frog is in position 4.

6. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the fan of folk. Since the fan of folk is in position 3 (classical), the owner of the horse is in position 2 or 4. Since the owner of the dog is in position 4, the owner of the horse is in position 2.

7. The person who's sport is golf is on the right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of d&b is in position 3, the person with golf is in position 4, which is the Spanish.

8. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the person with rock-climbing is in position 1, the person with weightlifting is in position 4, which is the Spanish.

9. The Italian is in an even position. Since position 2 is occupied by the fan of classical (Spanish), the Italian is in position 4.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 18:** The Argentine is on the far left (1). So, the Argentine is in position 1.
2. **Clue 14:** The Librarian is on the far left or far right. Since the Argentine is already in position 1, the Librarian must be in position 4.
3. **Clue 16:** The Librarian is on the right of the person driving the airplane. Therefore, the person driving the airplane must be in position 1 (Argentine), which contradicts the previous step. This indicates that the Librarian is in position 4 and the person driving the airplane must be in position 3.
4. **Clue 13:** The person driving the airplane is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since position 1 is occupied by the Argentine, the person driving the airplane must be in position 3.
5. **Clue 15:** The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the Entrepreneur. Since the person driving the airplane is in position 3, the person driving the bus must be in position 2 or 4.

10. **Clue 11:** The person eating tomato is the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person eating cucumber is in position 2 (American), the person eating tomato must be in position 1 (Argentine). Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1 (Argentine).
11. **Clue 3:** The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since position 1 is occupied by the Argentine, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3 (Polish). But the Polish is in position 3, so the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1 (Argentine).
12. **Clue 7:** The person drinking 7up is on the left of the police-officer. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1 (Argentine), the person drinking 7up must be in position 2 (American) or 4 (Librarian). But the American is in position 2, so the person drinking 7up must be in position 4 (Librarian).

Since the Argentine is in position 1 and the Polish is in position 3, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 1 (Argentine) or 3 (Polish). But the Polish is in position 3, so the person watching documentary movies must be in position 1 (Argentine).
15. **Clue 10:** The Doctor is in an even position (2 or 4). Since the American is in position 2 and the Librarian is in position 4, the Doctor must be in position 2 (American) or 4 (Librarian). But the American is in position 2, so the Doctor must be in position 4 (Librarian).
16. **Clue 2:** The person watching family movies is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person watching documentary movies is in position 1 (Argentine), the person watching family movies must be in position 2 (American) or 3 (Polish).

17. **Clue 17:** The person eating raspberry is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since the Argentine is in position 1 and the Polish is in position 3, the person eating raspberry must be in position 1 (Argentine) or 3 (Polish). But the Polish is in position 3, so the person eating raspberry must be in position 1 (Argentine).
18. **Clue 19:** The person eating nectarine is in an odd position (1 or 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person 1 (leftmost) and Person 4 (rightmost):**
   - From clues 2 and 12, we know that the person drinking tea is either in position 1 or 4.
   - From clue 13, the Spanish is on the right of the fan of blues, so the fan of blues cannot be in position 4.
   - Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 1.

2. **Position 1:**
   - The person drinking tea is in position 1.
   - From clue 3, the Spanish owns the goldfish, but from clue 15, the Argentine is the fan of techno, so the Spanish cannot be in position 1.
   - Thus, the person drinking tea must be one of the other three positions (2, 3, or 4).

3. **Position 4:**
   - The person drinking tea is in position 4 (from clue 12).
   - The person drinking tea is also in position 1 (from clue 2), which contradicts the earlier conclusion.

   - The person drinking tea is in position 1 (from clue 12).
