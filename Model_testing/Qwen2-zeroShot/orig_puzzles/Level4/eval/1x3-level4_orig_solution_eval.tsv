Lv4-1x3-1	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

### Given Information:
1. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
2. The person who's sport is rugby is on the far right.
3. The person who's sport is rugby is in an odd position (position 1).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of Rugby**:
   - According to point 3, the person who's sport is rugby must be in position 1 because it is the only odd position available.

   So, we have:
   ```
   | Sport   | Rugby  |       2       | Surfing|
   ```

2. **Position of Skateboarding and Surfing**:
   - According to point 1, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
   - From the above setup, the only positions left for skateboarding and surfing are positions 2 and 3.
   - Since skateboarding is on the right of surfing, the only possible arrangement is:
   
   ```
   | Sport   | Rugby  | Skateboarding | Surfing|
   ```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Sport   | Rugby  | Skateboarding | Surfing |
```

This satisfies all the given conditions:
- The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
- The person who's sport is rugby is on the far right.
- The person who's sport is rugby is in position 1, which is an odd position.

Thus, the final solution is:

```
| Sport   | Rugby  | Skateboarding | Surfing |

Lv4-1x3-2	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

We have three positions (1, 2, and 3) and three types of food: cabbage, carrot, and watermelon. The clues provided are:

1. The person eating carrot is in an odd position.
2. The person eating cabbage is on the far left.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating cabbage must be in position 1. So, we can fill that in:

```
|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage |            |        |
```

From clue 1, we know that the person eating carrot is in an odd position. Since position 1 is already occupied by cabbage, the only remaining odd position is position 3. Therefore, the person in position 3 must be eating carrot:

```
|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage |            | Carrot |
```

This leaves position 2 as the only remaining position for the person eating watermelon. Thus, the final arrangement is:

```
|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage | Watermelon | Carrot |
```

Here is the final solution table surrounded by `#############`:

```

Lv4-1x3-3	"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct placement of the hobbies.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person who's hobby is drawing is in an even position.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 2.

2. **The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.**
   - Since the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 2, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be either in position 1 (left) or 3 (right).

3. **The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in position 1 because the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 2. Therefore, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 3.

### Conclusion:
- Position 1: The person with the hobby of magic-tricks.
- Position 2: The person with the hobby of drawing.
- Position 3: The person with the hobby of board-games (since the only remaining hobby is board-games).

### Final Table:
```markdown
|         |      1      |    2    |      3       |
| Hobby   | Magic-Tricks| Drawing | Board-Games  |
```

### Solution:
```markdown
|         |      1      |    2    |      3       |

Lv4-1x3-4	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

Given:
1. The fan of jazz is in an odd position.
2. The fan of techno is on the left of the fan of jazz.

We need to determine the positions for each music genre (country, jazz, techno) in the three slots provided.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Odd Position for Jazz:**
   - Since there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), the possible odd positions for jazz are 1 or 3.
   
2. **Techno Left of Jazz:**
   - If jazz is in position 1, then techno must be in position 2.
   - If jazz is in position 3, then techno must be in position 2.

Let's evaluate both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Jazz in Position 1
- Jazz is in position 1.
- Techno must be in position 2 (since it is on the left of jazz).
- This leaves position 3 for country.

This scenario fits all the conditions:
- Jazz is in an odd position (position 1).
- Techno is on the left of jazz (techno in position 2).

#### Scenario 2: Jazz in Position 3
- Jazz is in position 3.
- Techno must be in position 2 (since it is on the left of jazz).
- This leaves position 1 for country.

This scenario also fits all the conditions:
- Jazz is in an odd position (position 3).
- Techno is on the left of jazz (techno in position 2).

### Final Solution Table

Both scenarios are valid, but we typically present one solution. Here is one valid solution:

```markdown
|               |    1    |   2    |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | Country | Techno | Jazz |
```

So, the final solution table is:

```markdown
|               |    1    |   2    |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | Country | Techno | Jazz |

Lv4-1x3-5	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

### Given Information:
1. There are three different types of food: kiwi, onion, and papaya.
2. The person eating onion is on the left of the person eating papaya.
3. The person eating onion is in an odd position (1 or 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the possible positions for the person eating onion:**
   - Since the person eating onion must be in an odd position, they can either be in position 1 or position 3.

2. **Consider each case separately:**

   - **Case 1: Person eating onion is in position 1.**
     - In this case, the person eating papaya must be in position 2 or 3 (since they must be to the right of the person eating onion).
     - However, if the person eating papaya is in position 2, there would be no room for the person eating kiwi (since all three positions would be filled). Therefore, this case is invalid.

   - **Case 2: Person eating onion is in position 3.**
     - In this case, the person eating papaya must be in position 2 (since they must be to the right of the person eating onion).
     - This leaves position 1 for the person eating kiwi.

### Final Configuration:
- Position 1: Kiwi
- Position 2: Papaya
- Position 3: Onion

### Final Solution Table:
```
|        |   1   |   2    |  3   |
| Food   | Kiwi  | Papaya | Onion|

Lv4-1x3-6	"Certainly! Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position.

Given these clues, we can deduce the positions and beverages as follows:

- From clue 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2 (since it's the only even position available).

- From clue 1, the person drinking mirinda must be on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3.

- This leaves position 1 for the person drinking 7up.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: 7up
- Position 2: Hot-chocolate
- Position 3: Mirinda

Here is the final solution table:

```
|            |  1  |       2       |    3    |
| Beverage   | 7up | Hot-chocolate | Mirinda |

Lv4-1x3-7	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the positions of the three jobs.

### Clues:
1. The engineer is on the right of the designer.
2. The engineer is in an even position (position 2).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Engineer in an Even Position**:
   - Since the engineer is in an even position, they must be in position 2.

2. **Engineer on the Right of the Designer**:
   - Given that the engineer is in position 2, the designer must be in position 1 because the engineer needs to be on the right of the designer.

3. **Determine the Analyst**:
   - Positions 1 and 2 are already assigned to the designer and the engineer respectively. Therefore, the analyst must be in position 3.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|       |    1     |    2     |    3    |
| Job   | Designer | Engineer | Analyst |
```

This arrangement satisfies both clues provided in the puzzle."	{'job': ['designer', 'engineer', 'analyst']}	True	3	True
Lv4-1x3-8	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the correct positions for each job.

### Given Information:
1. The teacher is in an odd position.
2. The paramedic is the paramedic (this is just stating the obvious and doesn't provide new information).
3. The teacher is on the right of the paramedic.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Odd Position for the Teacher**:
   - Since the teacher must be in an odd position, they can only be in position 1 or 3.

2. **Teacher on the Right of the Paramedic**:
   - This means the paramedic cannot be in position 3 if the teacher is in position 1 (since there would be no space to the right).

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If the teacher is in position 1, then the paramedic must be in position 2 (because the teacher needs to be on the right of the paramedic). This leaves position 3 for the designer.
- If the teacher is in position 3, then the paramedic must be in position 2 (again, because the teacher needs to be on the right of the paramedic), but this contradicts the fact that the teacher must be in an odd position (position 3 is odd, but we need to check the other conditions).

So, the only valid scenario is:
- Teacher in position 1
- Paramedic in position 2
- Designer in position 3

### Final Solution Table:
```
|       |    1     |     2     |    3    |
| Job   | Teacher  | Paramedic | Designer|

Lv4-1x3-9	"Let's analyze the given conditions step by step to determine the correct arrangement of the beverages.

### Conditions:
1. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking cola.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 2**: The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position.
   - This means that the person drinking iced-tea can only be in position 1 or 3.

2. **Condition 1**: The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking cola.
   - If the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1, then the person drinking cola must be in position 2 (since there is no position 0).
   - If the person drinking iced-tea is in position 3, then the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

### Possible Arrangements:
- If the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1:
  - The person drinking cola would be in position 2.
  - Position 3 must be filled with either cola or fanta, but since cola is already taken, it must be fanta.

- If the person drinking iced-tea is in position 3:
  - The person drinking cola would be in position 2.
  - Position 1 must be filled with either cola or fanta, but since cola is already taken, it must be fanta.

### Conclusion:
- In both scenarios, the person drinking cola is in position 2 and the person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position (either 1 or 3).

Given these constraints, the only valid arrangement is:
- Position 1: Fanta (since iced-tea cannot be here as per condition 2)
- Position 2: Cola
- Position 3: Iced-tea

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |   1   |  2   |    3     |
| Beverage   | Fanta | Cola | Iced-tea |

Lv4-1x3-10	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We have three positions (1, 2, and 3) and three types of food: papaya, pepper, and plum. We need to place these foods according to the given clues:

1. The person eating pepper is on the left of the person eating papaya.
2. The person eating papaya is in an even position (i.e., position 2).

Given these clues, let's deduce the arrangement:

- Since the person eating papaya must be in position 2, we can place ""papaya"" in position 2.
- The person eating pepper must be on the left of the person eating papaya, so the person eating pepper must be in position 1.
- This leaves position 3 for the person eating plum.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Pepper
- Position 2: Papaya
- Position 3: Plum

Here is the final solution table:
