Lv4-6x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct arrangement.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Positions and Clues:**
   - We need to place each person (1, 2, 3) in the corresponding categories (Food, Job, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport, Transport).
   - Each category has three options (e.g., Food: broccoli, papaya, spinach).

2. **Clue Analysis:**
   - **Clue 1:** The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person eating spinach.
   - **Clue 2:** The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person whose sport is skateboarding.
   - **Clue 3:** The dressmaker is on the right of the fan of rock.
   - **Clue 4:** The person eating papaya is the fan of r&b.
   - **Clue 5:** The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person whose sport is tennis.
   - **Clue 6:** The dressmaker is on the far left or far right.
   - **Clue 7:** The accountant is the person eating broccoli.
   - **Clue 8:** The person driving the boat is the owner of the goldfish.
   - **Clue 9:** The person eating spinach is between the owner of the goldfish and the person driving the van.
   - **Clue 10:** The person driving the boat is in an odd position.
   - **Clue 11:** The accountant is the owner of the rat.
   - **Clue 12:** The software-developer is the person driving the train.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **From Clue 7:**
   - The accountant eats broccoli.
   - So, the accountant is in Position 1 (since it’s the far left or far right and the accountant must be in one of these positions due to Clue 6).

2. **From Clue 12:**
   - The software-developer drives the train.
   - So, the software-developer is in Position 3 (since it’s the far right).

3. **From Clue 6:**
   - The dressmaker is either in Position 1 or Position 3.
   - Since the accountant is already in Position 1, the dressmaker must be in Position 3.

4. **From Clue 11:**
   - The accountant owns the rat.
   - So, the accountant is in Position 1 with the rat.

5. **From Clue 8:**
   - The person driving the boat is the owner of the goldfish.
   - So, the person driving the boat is in Position 3 with the goldfish.

6. **From Clue 10:**
   - The person driving the boat is in an odd position.
   - This confirms that the person driving the boat is in Position 3.

7. **From Clue 9:**
   - The person eating spinach is between the owner of the goldfish and the person driving the van.
   - Since the person driving the boat (goldfish) is in Position 3, the person eating spinach must be in Position 2.
   - Therefore, the person driving the van must be in Position 1.

8. **From Clue 4:**
   - The person eating papaya is the fan of r&b.
   - So, the person eating papaya cannot be the accountant (broccoli) or the person driving the boat (goldfish).

9. **From Clue 1:**
   - The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person eating spinach.
   - Since the person eating spinach is in Position 2, the person eating papaya must be in Position 1 or 3.
   - But Position 1 is taken by the accountant (broccoli), so the person eating papaya must be in Position 3.
   - Therefore, the person eating spinach must be in Position 2.

10. **From Clue 3:**
    - The dressmaker is on the right of the fan of rock.
    - Since the dressmaker is in Position 3, the fan of rock must be in Position 1.
    - Therefore, the person eating broccoli (accountant) is the fan of rock.

11. **From Clue 5:**
    - The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person whose sport is tennis.
    - Since the dressmaker (Position 3) is the owner of the goldfish, the owner of the chinchilla must be in Position 2.
    - Therefore, the person whose sport is tennis must be in Position 1.

12. **From Clue 2:**
    - The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person whose sport is skateboarding.
    - Since the person driving the boat is in Position 3, the person whose sport is skateboarding must be in Position 1 or 2.
    - But Position 1 is taken by the accountant (rock), so the person whose sport is skateboarding must be in Position 2.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating kiwi is the person watching documentary movies.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the trike.
3. The fan of r&b is in an odd position (Clue 4 is redundant as it's already covered by this).

8. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating peach.
9. The person eating orange is on the far left or far right.
10. The fan of trance is the person watching crime movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- Kiwi -> Documentary

#### Clue 4 & Clue 8:
- Peach -> Ambient
- Kiwi -> Right of Peach
- Therefore, Peach must be in position 1 or 2, and Kiwi must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 9:
- Orange -> Far left or far right
- Since Peach is in position 1 or 2, Orange must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 5:
- Trike -> Between Kiwi and Crime Movies
- Kiwi -> Right of Peach, so Peach is in position 1, Kiwi is in position 2, and Trike must be in position 3 or 4.
- Crime Movies -> Between Kiwi and Trike.

#### Clue 6:
- Hedgehog -> Between Orange and Skateboard
- If Orange is in position 1, Hedgehog must be in position 2, and Skateboard in position 3.
- If Orange is in position 3, Hedgehog must be in position 2, and Skateboard in position 1.

#### Clue 2:
- Iced Tea -> Left of Trike
- If Trike is in position 3, Iced Tea must be in position 1 or 2.
- If Trike is in position 4, Iced Tea must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 7:
- Milk -> Mouse Owner
- This can be placed later once other positions are filled.

#### Clue 10:
- Trance -> Crime Movies
- Crime Movies -> Between Kiwi and Trike, and Trance -> Crime Movies.

### Combining all clues:

1. **Position 1**: Orange (from Clue 9)
2. **Position 2**: Kiwi (from Clue 1 and Clue 8)
3. **Position 3**: Trike (from Clue 5)
4. **Position 4**: Skateboard (from Clue 6)

This leaves us with:
- Position 1: Orange
- Position 2: Kiwi
- Position 3: Trike
- Position 4: Skateboard

Now, we need to fill in the remaining details:
- Iced Tea -> Left of Trike, so Iced Tea must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since Orange is in position 1, Iced Tea must be in position 2, but Kiwi is in position 2, so Iced Tea must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Iced Tea
- Position 2: Kiwi
- Position 3: Trike
- Position 4: Skateboard

Now we need to assign the rest:
- Peach -> Ambient (Clue 4)
- Hedgehog -> Between Orange and Skateboard (Clue 6)
- Mouse -> Milk Owner (Clue 7)
- Trance -> Crime Movies (Clue 10)
- Disaster -> Crime Movies (from Clue 10 and Clue 5)

### Final Table:

Lv4-6x3-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.**
   - This means disaster is to the right of documentary.

2. **The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.**
   - This means fanta is to the right of cooking.

3. **The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.**

   - This means d&b is in position 2, with golf on one side and reading on the other.

6. **The Mexican is on the far right.**
   - The Mexican is in position 3 (rightmost).

7. **The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.**
   - This means iced-tea is either to the left or right of sprite.

8. **The person watching adventure movies is the person who's sport is baseball.**
   - Adventure corresponds to baseball.

9. **The British is in an odd position.**
   - The British can be in position 1 or 3.

10. **The Spanish is in an even position.**
    - The Spanish can be in position 2 or 3.

11. **The Mexican is on the far left or far right.**
    - We already know the Mexican is on the far right (position 3).

12. **The person who's hobby is reading is the person drinking iced-tea.**
    - Reading corresponds to iced-tea.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 3:**
   - From clue 6, the Mexican is in position 3.
   - From clue 4, soul is in position 3.
   - Therefore, the Mexican and soul are in position 3.

2. **Position 2:**
   - From clue 5, d&b is between golf and reading.
   - From clue 12, reading is iced-tea.
   - Therefore, d&b must be in position 2, and golf is in position 1 or 3 (but 3 is taken by the Mexican and soul, so golf is in position 1).
   - This means the person drinking iced-tea (reading) is in position 2.

3. **Position 1:**
   - From clue 8, adventure corresponds to baseball.
   - Therefore, the person watching adventure movies is in position 1.
   - From clue 3, cooking is to the left of golf.
   - Since golf is in position 1, cooking cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - Therefore, cooking must be in position 2 (which is occupied by reading), so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate positions.
   - Given that reading is in position 2, cooking must be in position 3 (but 3 is taken by soul and the Mexican, so cooking must be in position 1).
   - Therefore, the person whose hobby is cooking is in position 1.

4. **Position 3:**
   - From clue 1, disaster is to the right of documentary.
   - Since the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies, and the only available positions for documentary and disaster are 1 and 2, documentary must be in position 1 and disaster in position 2.
   - But we already have the person whose hobby is cooking in position 1, which conflicts. So we need to re-evaluate.
   - Given the constraints, the only logical placement is:
     - Documentary in position 1 (British, since it's an odd position)
     - Disaster in position 2 (Spanish, since it's an even position)
     - Cooking in position 3 (Mexican, since it's an odd position)

5. **Final Arrangement:**
   - Position 1: British (Documentary)
   - Position 2: Spanish (Disaster)
   - Position 3: Mexican (Soul)

6. **Beverages:**
   - From clue 2, fanta is to the right of cooking.
   - From clue 7, iced-tea is to the left or right of sprite.
   - From clue 12, iced-tea is reading.
   - Therefore, fanta must be in position 3 (Mexican) and sprite in position 2 (Spanish).
   - This leaves sprite in position 2 (Spanish) and fanta in position 3 (Mexican).

7. **Sports:**
   - From clue 8, adventure corresponds to baseball.
   - Therefore, the person watching adventure movies is in position 1 (British).

8. **Music-Genres:**
   - From clue 5, d&b is between golf and reading.
   - From clue 12, reading is iced-tea.
   - Therefore, d&b is in position 2 (Spanish) and gospel in position 1 (British).

#### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 11 & 8:** The person driving the airplane is on the far right (Clue 11) and the person driving the airplane is on the far left or far right (Clue 8). Therefore, the person driving the airplane must be in position 3.

5. **Clue 3:** The person watching time-travel movies is the fan of dubstep. Since the fan of electronic is in position 2, the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 3 (the owner of the snake).
   
6. **Clue 6:** The police-officer is on the right of the fan of electronic. Since the fan of electronic is in position 2, the police-officer must be in position 3 (the owner of the snake).
   
7. **Clue 5:** The Thai is on the left of the freelancer. Since the American is in position 2, the Thai must be in position 1 (owner of the rat) and the freelancer in position 2 (fan of electronic).
   
8. **Clue 4:** The owner of the rat is the fan of jazz. So, the American is the fan of jazz.
   
9. **Clue 2:** The American is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since the American is in position 1, the person watching animation movies must be in position 3 (the owner of the snake).
   
10. **Clue 7:** The owner of the snake is in an odd position, which we already know is position 3.
   
11. **Clue 3 & 12:** The person watching time-travel movies (position 3) is the fan of dubstep. The fan of electronic (position 2) is on the right of the person watching animation movies (position 3).

   - Clue 1: \( \text{Beverage (Hot-Chocolate)} = \text{Food (Pepper)} \)

2. **The person whose hobby is collecting is to the right of the owner of the horse.**
   - Clue 2: If \( \text{Hobby (Collecting)} = i \), then \( \text{Pet (Horse)} = i+1 \) or \( \text{Pet (Horse)} = i-1 \).

3. **The person eating zucchini is the person driving the scooter.**
   - Clue 3: \( \text{Food (Zucchini)} = \text{Transport (Scooter)} \)

4. **The person driving the boat is to the right of the fan of R&B.**

   - Clue 5: If \( \text{Music-Genre (Techno)} = k \), then \( \text{Beverage (Milk)} = k \) or \( \text{Beverage (Milk)} = k+1 \) or \( \text{Beverage (Milk)} = k-1 \).

6. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the lizard.**
   - Clue 6: \( \text{Beverage (Hot-Chocolate)} = \text{Pet (Lizard)} \)

7. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left or right of the person whose hobby is card-games.**
   - Clue 7: If \( \text{Beverage (Hot-Chocolate)} = m \), then \( \text{Hobby (Card-Games)} = m \) or \( \text{Hobby (Card-Games)} = m+1 \) or \( \text{Hobby (Card-Games)} = m-1 \).

8. **The fan of R&B is in an even position.**

9. **The fan of Disco is to the right of the fan of R&B.**
   - Clue 9: If \( \text{Music-Genre (R&B)} = n \), then \( \text{Music-Genre (Disco)} = n+1 \).

10. **The fan of R&B is to the left of the person drinking coffee.**
    - Clue 10: If \( \text{Music-Genre (R&B)} = p \), then \( \text{Beverage (Coffee)} = p+1 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine positions for R&B and Disco:**
   - From Clue 8, R&B must be in an even position. So, it can only be in position 2.
   - From Clue 9, Disco must be in position 3.
   - From Clue 10, Coffee must be in position 4.

2. **Determine the positions for Hot-Chocolate:**
   - From Clue 1, Hot-Chocolate and Pepper must be in the same position.
   - From Clue 6, Hot-Chocolate and Lizard must be in the same position.
   - Therefore, Hot-Chocolate must be in position 1.
   - Pepper and Lizard must also be in position 1.

3. **Determine the positions for Horse:**
   - From Clue 2, Collecting must be in position 3 since Horse is in position 2.
   - Therefore, Collecting must be in position 3.

4. **Determine the positions for Zucchini and Scooter:**
   - From Clue 3, Zucchini and Scooter must be in the same position.
   - The only remaining positions for Zucchini and Scooter are 2 and 3, but Zucchini cannot be in position 3 because Collecting is there.
   - Therefore, Zucchini must be in position 2 and Scooter must be in position 2.

5. **Determine the positions for Milk and Techno:**
   - From Clue 5, Milk must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Since Zucchini is in position 2, Milk must be in position 3.
   - From Clue 5, Techno must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since Hot-Chocolate is in position 1, Techno must be in position 2.

6. **Final Check:**
   - Verify all conditions:
     - Clue 1: Hot-Chocolate (1) = Pepper (1)
     - Clue 2: Collecting (3) = Horse (2)
     - Clue 3: Zucchini (2) = Scooter (2)
     - Clue 4: Boat (4) = R&B (2) + 1 = 3
     - Clue 5: Techno (2) = Milk (3) - 1
     - Clue 6: Hot-Chocolate (1) = Lizard (1)
     - Clue 7: Card-Games (3) = Hot-Chocolate (1) - 1 or 1 + 1
     - Clue 8: R&B (2) is in an even position
     - Clue 9: Disco (3) = R&B (2) + 1
     - Clue 10: Coffee (4) = R&B (2) + 1

Lv4-6x3-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The fan of jazz is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile.
2. The dancer is the person eating plum.
3. The person whose sport is golf is in an even position.
4. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.
5. The person driving the train is the person eating kiwi.
6. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left.
7. The security-guard is on the right of the fan of blues.
8. The person whose sport is golf is between the person whose sport is surfing and the security-guard.
9. The fan of jazz is on the far right.
10. The person eating lime is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6**: The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Iced-tea

2. **Clue 9**: The fan of jazz is on the far right.
   - Position 3: Jazz

3. **Clue 2**: The dancer is the person eating plum.
   - Position 2: Plum (Dancer)

4. **Clue 5**: The person driving the train is the person eating kiwi.
   - Position 2: Kiwi (Train)

From Clues 2 and 5, we know that the dancer eats plum and the person driving the train eats kiwi. Therefore, the remaining food for Position 3 must be lime.

5. **Clue 10**: The person eating lime is in an even position.
   - Position 2: Lime

Now, let's place the remaining foods and drinks:
- Position 1: Iced-tea
- Position 2: Lime (Dancer)
- Position 3: Plum (Jazz)

6. **Clue 3**: The person whose sport is golf is in an even position.
   - Position 2 or 4: Golf

Since Position 2 is already occupied by the dancer, the person whose sport is golf must be in Position 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The person whose sport is golf is between the person whose sport is surfing and the security-guard.
   - Positions 2, 4, and 3: Surfing, Golf, Security-Guard

Given that Position 2 is occupied by the dancer and Position 4 by golf, the only remaining position for surfing and security-guard is 1 and 3. Since the security-guard is to the right of the fan of blues, and the fan of jazz is in Position 3, the security-guard must be in Position 1, and the fan of blues must be in Position 2.

8. **Clue 4**: The fan of blues is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - Position 2: Blues (Dancer), Lime
   - Position 1: Iced-tea
   - Position 3: Plum (Jazz)

Since the fan of blues is in Position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in Position 1 or 3. But since Position 1 has iced-tea, the person drinking soy-milk must be in Position 3.

9. **Clue 7**: The security-guard is on the right of the fan of blues.
   - Position 1: Security-Guard (Surfing)
   - Position 2: Blues (Dancer)
   - Position 3: Plum (Jazz), Soy-Milk

Since Position 3 is occupied by plum, the person drinking soy-milk must be in Position 1.

10. **Clue 3**: The person whose sport is golf is in an even position.
    - Position 2: Blues (Dancer)
    - Position 4: Golf

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |    1     |     2      |       3        |
| Beverage      | Iced-tea |            |                |
| Food          | Soy-milk | Lime (Dancer) | Plum (Jazz)    |
| Job           | Security-guard (Surfing) | Blues (Dancer) | Plum (Jazz)    |

Lv4-6x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The fan of gospel is in an even position.
2. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the dressmaker.
3. The person whose hobby is gardening is the person watching zombie movies.
4. The person drinking juice is between the person drinking almond-milk and the project-manager.
5. The fan of techno is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.
6. The project-manager is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is collecting.
7. The person watching zombie movies is on the far right.
8. The person driving the roller is the fan of trance.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 7: The person watching zombie movies is on the far right.
This means:
- Position 3 (rightmost) is the person watching zombie movies.
- Hobbies: Gardening
- Jobs: Project-manager

#### Clue 3: The person whose hobby is gardening is the person watching zombie movies.
This confirms that:
- Position 3: Gardening (Hobby), Project-manager (Job), Watching Zombie Movies

#### Clue 1: The fan of gospel is in an even position.
This means:
- Position 2 must be the fan of gospel.

#### Clue 8: The person driving the roller is the fan of trance.
This means:
- Position 2: Gospel (Music Genre), Trance (Music Genre), Roller (Transport)

#### Clue 4: The person drinking juice is between the person drinking almond-milk and the project-manager.
Since the project-manager is in position 3, the person drinking juice must be in position 1 or 2.
- If the person drinking juice is in position 1, then the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2, but this would conflict with clue 2.
- Therefore, the person drinking juice must be in position 2, and the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.

So:
- Position 1: Almond-milk (Beverage)
- Position 2: Juice (Beverage), Gospel (Music Genre), Trance (Music Genre), Roller (Transport)

#### Clue 2: The person watching epic movies is on the right of the dressmaker.
This means:
- The dressmaker cannot be in position 3 (since the project-manager is there).
- Therefore, the dressmaker must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since position 1 has almond-milk and the person watching epic movies is to the right of the dressmaker, the dressmaker must be in position 1.
- Position 1: Almond-milk (Beverage), Dressmaker (Job), Epic (Movie Genre)

#### Clue 5: The fan of techno is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.
This means:
- The person driving the motorbike must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since position 2 is already taken by the fan of gospel, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 3.
- Position 3: Gardening (Hobby), Project-manager (Job), Watching Zombie Movies, Trance (Music Genre), Roller (Transport)

Therefore, the person driving the motorbike must be the fan of techno.

#### Clue 6: The project-manager is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is collecting.
Since the project-manager is in position 3, the person whose hobby is collecting must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the dressmaker is in position 1, the person whose hobby is collecting must be in position 2.
- Position 2: Juice (Beverage), Gospel (Music Genre), Trance (Music Genre), Roller (Transport), Collecting (Hobby)

Finally, the only job left for position 2 is the firefighter.

Lv4-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The journalist is on the far left or far right.
2. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the far left.
3. The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the entrepreneur.
4. The person watching romance movies is in an even position (positions 2 or 3).
5. The journalist is on the far right.
6. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person driving the roller.
7. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
8. The person watching action movies is in an odd position (positions 1 or 3).
9. The person watching family movies is in an odd position (positions 1 or 3).
10. The fan of pop is in an even position (positions 2 or 3).
11. The person driving the train is the fan of ambient.
12. The fan of pop is on the left of the person driving the car.
13. The entrepreneur is on the left or right of the fan of blues.
14. The fan of blues is the person watching family movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 1 and Clue 5**: The journalist must be in position 1 (since they are on the far right and there are only three positions).

2. **From Clue 2**: The person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 1, but we already know that the journalist is in position 1, so this is a contradiction unless we consider that the person with the hobby of fishing is the same as the journalist, which is not possible since they have different roles. Therefore, the person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 2.

3. **From Clue 3**: The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the entrepreneur. This means the entrepreneur cannot be in position 3 (the last position), so the entrepreneur must be in position 1 or 2. Since the journalist is in position 1, the entrepreneur must be in position 2.

4. **From Clue 4 and Clue 9**: The person watching romance movies is in an even position (2 or 3). The person watching family movies is also in an even position (2 or 3). Since the person watching romance movies and family movies cannot be in the same position, one must be in position 2 and the other in position 3.

5. **From Clue 10**: The fan of pop is in an even position (2 or 3). Since the person watching family movies is in an even position, the fan of pop must be in position 3, and the person watching family movies must be in position 2.

6. **From Clue 6**: The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis, the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 1 (the journalist) or 2 (the entrepreneur). But the journalist is in position 1, so the person who's sport is tennis must be the entrepreneur in position 2. This means the person driving the roller is in position 3 (the person watching family movies), and the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 2.

7. **From Clue 7**: The person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis, confirming the previous deductions.

8. **From Clue 8**: The person watching action movies is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since the person watching family movies is in position 2, the person watching action movies must be in position 1 (the journalist).

9. **From Clue 11**: The person driving the train is the fan of ambient. Since the person driving the roller is in position 3 (watching family movies), the person driving the train must be in position 1 (journalist), making the journalist the fan of ambient.

10. **From Clue 12**: The fan of pop is on the left of the person driving the car. Since the fan of pop is in position 3, the person driving the car must be in position 2 (the entrepreneur).

11. **From Clue 13**: The entrepreneur is on the left or right of the fan of blues. Since the entrepreneur is in position 2, the fan of blues must be in position 3 (the person watching family movies).

12. **From Clue 14**: The fan of blues is the person watching family movies, confirming the previous deduction.

### Final Table:
