Lv4-5x2-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given constraints:

1. **The Pakistani is on the right of the person watching epic movies.**
   - This means the Pakistani and the person watching epic movies must be in consecutive positions.

2. **The owner of the horse is on the far left.**
   - The person with the horse must be in position 1.

3. **The fan of electronic is in an even position.**
   - This means the electronic fan must be in either position 2.

4. **The person who's sport is skiing is in an odd position.**
   - This means the skiing person must be in either position 1 or 3.

Given these constraints, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1     |     2      |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| Movie-Genre   |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |
| Pet           | horse    |            |
| Sport         |          |            |

From constraint 4, we know the skiing person must be in position 1 or 3. Since the owner of the horse is in position 1 (constraint 2), the skiing person cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the skiing person must be in position 3.

From constraint 1, the Pakistani is to the right of the person watching epic movies. Given that the skiing person is in position 3, the Pakistani cannot be in position 3. So, the Pakistani must be in position 2 and the person watching epic movies must be in position 1.

From constraint 3, the electronic fan is in an even position, so the electronic fan must be in position 2. Therefore, the person watching family movies must be in position 1.

Now we have:

|               |    1     |     2      |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| Movie-Genre   | family   | electronic |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |
| Nationality   |          | pakistani  |
| Pet           | horse    |            |
| Sport         | skiing   |            |

We need to determine the remaining values for music genre, nationality, and sport.

- From constraint 3, the electronic fan is in position 2.
- From constraint 4, the skiing person is in position 3.

This leaves us with:
- Position 1: family movies, electronic fan
- Position 2: electronic, pakistani
- Position 3: skiing
- Position 4: needs to be filled with the remaining nationality and music genre
- Position 5: needs to be filled with the remaining nationality and music genre

Since there are only two nationalities (Nigerian and Pakistani) and two music genres (Electronic and Rock), and we already have Pakistani in position 2, the remaining nationality must be Nigerian. Also, since electronic is in position 2, the remaining music genre must be Rock.

Thus, the final table looks like:

|               |    1     |     2      |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| Movie-Genre   | family   | electronic |
| Music-Genre   | rock     | electronic |
| Nationality   | nigerian | pakistani  |
| Pet           | horse    |            |
| Sport         | skiing   |            |

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | family   | electronic |
| Music-Genre   | rock     | electronic |
| Nationality   | nigerian | pakistani  |
| Pet           | horse    |            |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2:** The person driving the helicopter is on the far left.
   - This means the person in position 1 uses the helicopter.

2. **Clue 4:** The dressmaker is the person driving the skateboard.
   - This means the person in position 2 uses the skateboard and is a dressmaker.

3. **Clue 5:** The person whose sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person whose sport is basketball.
   - This means if one person's sport is basketball, the other person's sport must be lacrosse and they are next to each other.

4. **Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is Sudoku is in an odd position.
   - Since the person in position 1 already has the helicopter (even position), the person with Sudoku must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 1:** The Mexican is on the left or right of the person whose sport is lacrosse.
   - We know from Clue 5 that the lacrosse and basketball positions are next to each other. So, the Mexican must be in either position 1 or 2 since the person with Sudoku is in position 2.

6. **Determine the remaining details:**
   - From Clue 5, if the person with lacrosse is in position 2, then the person with basketball must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the Mexican must be in position 1 (since the person with Sudoku is in position 2).

7. **Assign the remaining information:**
   - Position 1: Mexican, Helicopter, Basketball
   - Position 2: Sudoku, Skateboard, Dressmaker, Lacrosse

8. **Check the nationalities and jobs:**

Lv4-5x2-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The fan of blues is on the right of the person whose sport is cycling.
2. The person eating cranberry is on the right of the person watching action movies.
3. The Nigerian is in an odd position (1 or 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3: The Nigerian is in an odd position.
This means the Nigerian can be either in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 1: The fan of blues is on the right of the person whose sport is cycling.
This means if the sport is cycling, then the person who prefers blues must be to its right.

#### Clue 2: The person eating cranberry is on the right of the person watching action movies.
This means if the movie genre is action, then the person eating cranberry must be to its right.

### Let's try the possible positions for the Nigerian:

**Case 1: Nigerian is in position 1**
- This means the other positions will be filled with the remaining people.

#### Position 1: Nigerian
- The fan of blues cannot be in position 1 because the Nigerian is in position 1 and the fan of blues must be to the right of the person whose sport is cycling.
- Therefore, the Nigerian cannot be in position 1.

**Case 2: Nigerian is in position 3**
- This means the other positions will be filled with the remaining people.

#### Position 3: Nigerian
- The fan of blues must be in position 2 (since it has to be to the right of the person whose sport is cycling).
- The person eating cranberry must be in position 2 (since it has to be to the right of the person watching action movies).

So, let's place these in the table:

|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Food          |          |   Cranberry   |               |
| Movie-Genre   |          |   Action      |   Blues       |
| Music-Genre   |          |               |               |
| Nationality   |          |   Nigerian    |   Italian     |
| Sport         |          |               |   Cycling     |

Now we need to fill in the remaining details:

- Since the person eating cranberry is in position 2, the person eating kiwi must be in position 1.
- Since the person watching action movies is in position 2, the person watching horror movies must be in position 1.
- The person who prefers blues is in position 2, so the person who prefers pop must be in position 1.

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |

2. The person watching romance movies is in an odd position.
3. The teacher is on the right of the Malaysian.
4. The person driving the motorbike is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Position of the Person Driving the Motorbike
From clue 4, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the far right. So, let's place ""Motorbike"" in position 2 for transport.

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          |            |             |
| Job           |            |             |

| Nationality   |            |             |
| Transport     |            | Motorbike   |

#### Step 2: Determine the Position of the Teacher
From clue 3, the teacher is on the right of the Malaysian. Since the teacher cannot be in position 2 (as it is occupied by the motorbike), the teacher must be in position 1 and the Malaysian must be in position 2.

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          |            |             |

| Transport     |            | Motorbike   |

#### Step 3: Determine the Position of the Person Watching Romance Movies
From clue 2, the person watching romance movies is in an odd position. Since position 1 is already taken by the teacher, the only remaining odd position is 1 for the movie genre.

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          |            |             |

| Nationality   |            |             |
| Transport     |            | Motorbike   |

#### Step 4: Determine the Position of the Person Eating Pomegranate
From clue 1, the Malaysian is either to the left or right of the person eating pomegranate. Since the Malaysian is in position 2, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 1.

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          | Pomegranate| Malaysian   |
| Job           | Teacher    | Malaysian   |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance    |             |
| Nationality   |            |             |
| Transport     |            | Motorbike   |

#### Step 5: Determine the Remaining Details
- The remaining job is ""pilot,"" which must be in position 1.
- The remaining nationality is ""pakistani,"" which must be in position 2.
- The remaining food is ""strawberry,"" which must be in position 2.

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          | Pomegranate| Strawberry  |

| Nationality   | Pakistani  | Malaysian   |
| Transport     |            | Motorbike   |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-5x2-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

Given:
1. There are two different favorite beverages: cola, sprite.
2. There are two different types of food: cucumber, grapefruit.
3. The people prefer two different movie genres: adventure, romance.
4. The people prefer two different music genres: disco, rock.
5. The people use two different means of transport: roller, van.
6. The fan of rock is on the right of the person driving the van.
7. The person watching adventure movies is in an even position (2nd position).

We need to place these items into the table while satisfying all conditions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person watching adventure movies is in an even position (2nd position):**
   - So, the person watching adventure movies is in position 2 for either Beverage, Food, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, or Transport.

2. **Fan of rock is on the right of the person driving the van:**
   - This means if someone is driving the van, the person who likes rock must be in the next column to the right.

3. **Determine the positions:**
   - Since the person watching adventure movies is in position 2, we can start placing other items around it.

### Let's assign the items to columns:

#### Column 1:
- Since the person watching adventure movies is in position 2, let's place ""Adventure"" in position 2 for Movie-Genre.
- Now, the person in position 1 for Movie-Genre could be ""Romance.""

#### Column 2:
- We need to place the remaining items in this column.
- The fan of rock must be on the right of the person driving the van, so let's place ""Rock"" in the second row of Column 2.

Now we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |          |            |
| Food          |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance  | Adventure  |
| Music-Genre   |          | Rock       |
| Transport     |          | Van        |
```

#### Determining the remaining items:
- We need to place cola and sprite, cucumber and grapefruit, disco and roller in the remaining positions.

Since the fan of rock is in the second row of Column 2, the person driving the van must be in the first row of Column 2. Therefore, the person driving the van is associated with ""Van"" and the person who likes rock is associated with ""Rock.""

So, the remaining items can be placed as follows:
- Cola and Sprite: Since the person drinking sprite is on the right of the person eating cucumber, we can place them in Column 1.
- Cucumber and Grapefruit: We can place them in Column 2.
- Disco and Roller: Since roller is associated with the person driving the van, we place ""Roller"" in Column 1 and ""Disco"" in Column 2.

Thus, the final table looks like this:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola     | Sprite     |
| Food          | Cucumber | Grapefruit |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance  | Adventure  |
| Music-Genre   | Disco    | Rock       |
| Transport     | Roller   | Van        |
```

Lv4-5x2-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the rabbit is in an even position.
2. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the nurse.
3. The person driving the subway is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
4. The Indonesian is the owner of the rabbit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The owner of the rabbit is in an even position.
- This means the rabbit owner must be in position 2 (since positions are 1 and 2).

#### Clue 4: The Indonesian is the owner of the rabbit.
- Therefore, the Indonesian must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Hobby         |         |             |
| Job           |         |             |
| Nationality   |         | Indonesian  |
| Pet           |         | Rabbit      |
| Transport     |         |             |
```

#### Clue 3: The person driving the subway is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
- This means the person with the hobby of sudoku cannot be in position 2 (since the Indonesian is there), so they must be in position 1.
- Let's denote the person with the hobby of sudoku as ""S"" and the person driving the subway as ""D"".

So, we have:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Hobby         | S       |             |
| Job           |         |             |
| Nationality   |         | Indonesian  |
| Pet           |         | Rabbit      |
| Transport     | D       |             |
```

#### Clue 2: The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the nurse.
- Since the person with the hobby of sudoku (S) is in position 1, the person with the hobby of board-games (B) can be in position 1 or 2.
- The nurse (N) cannot be in position 1 because the hobby of board-games must be either in position 1 or 2.

Let's consider the possibilities for the nurse:
- If the nurse is in position 2, then the board-games person must be in position 1.
- If the nurse is in position 1, then the board-games person must be in position 2, but this would conflict with the rabbit owner being in position 2.

Thus, the nurse must be in position 2, and the board-games person must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Hobby         | B       | Sudoku      |
| Job           |         |             |
| Nationality   |         | Indonesian  |
| Pet           |         | Rabbit      |
| Transport     | D       |             |
```

#### Final Clue: The person driving the subway is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
- The person with the hobby of sudoku (S) is in position 2.
- The person driving the subway (D) must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |
| Hobby         | Board-Games | Sudoku      |

| Pet           | Rabbit     | Rat         |

```

### Clues:
1. The electrician is in an odd position.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person watching spy movies.
3. The person whose hobby is collecting is the writer.
4. The fan of house is on the far left.
5. The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of indie.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Positioning the Electrician
- Since the electrician is in an odd position, he can only be in position 1 (left) or 3 (middle), but since we have only two positions to fill for each category, the electrician must be in position 1.

#### 2. Positioning the Hot-Chocolate Drinker
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person watching spy movies.
- This means the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in position 1 (since there's no one to the left).

Lv4-5x2-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and the structure of the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating cabbage is in an odd position (1).
2. The fan of house is on the far left or far right (2).
3. The person whose hobby is camping is on the left of the fan of soul (3).
4. The Polish person is on the left of the person driving the bus (4).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:**
   - The person eating cabbage is in an odd position.
   - Therefore, the person eating cabbage must be in position 1.

2. **Clue 2:**
   - The fan of house is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the person eating cabbage is in position 1, the fan of house cannot be in position 1 (because it must be on the far left or far right).
   - Therefore, the fan of house must be in position 2.

3. **Clue 3:**
   - The person whose hobby is camping is on the left of the fan of soul.
   - Since the fan of house is in position 2, the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 1, and the person with the hobby of soul must be in position 2.
   - This conflicts with our previous placement of the fan of house in position 2. So, let's correct this:
   - If the fan of house is in position 2, then the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 1, and the person with the hobby of soul must be in position 2.
   - But we already placed the person eating cabbage in position 1, so the fan of house must be in position 2, and the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 1.

4. **Clue 4:**
   - The Polish person is on the left of the person driving the bus.
   - Since the person with the hobby of camping is in position 1, they can either be Polish or not. Let's consider both cases.

### Assigning Values:

1. **Position 1:**
   - Person with the hobby of camping (either Polish or not)
   - Eats cabbage (since it's in an odd position)

2. **Position 2:**
   - Fan of house
   - Hobby: Soul

3. **Position 3:**
   - Either the Polish person or the person driving the bus (but not both yet)

4. **Position 4:**
   - Either the other nationality (not Polish) or the other hobby (not camping or house)

5. **Position 5:**
   - The remaining nationality or hobby

Given the constraints, let's assign the values:

- **Position 1:** Camping (Polish)
- **Position 2:** House
- **Position 3:** Bus (Polish)
- **Position 4:** Soul (Not Polish)
- **Position 5:** Filmmaking (Not Polish)
