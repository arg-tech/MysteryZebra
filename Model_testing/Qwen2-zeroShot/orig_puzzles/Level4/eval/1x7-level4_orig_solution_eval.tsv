Lv4-1x7-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step to find the correct order of nationalities.

1. **The Japanese is between the German and the Canadian.**
   - This means that if we have G, J, C in some order, they must be placed such that J is between G and C.

2. **The Mexican is on the right of the Brazilian.**
   - This means B must be to the left of M.

3. **The Russian is on the right of the Italian.**
   - This means I must be to the left of R.

4. **The Mexican is in the middle (position 4).**
   - So, M is in position 4.

5. **The Canadian is in an odd position (1 or 3 or 5 or 7).**
   - Since M is in position 4, the Canadian cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the Canadian can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.

6. **The German is on the left of the Japanese.**
   - This means G must be to the left of J.

7. **The Brazilian is in an odd position (1 or 3 or 5 or 7).**
   - Since M is in position 4, the Brazilian cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the Brazilian can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.

Now let's use these clues to determine the exact positions:

- From clue 4, M is in position 4.
- From clue 5, the Canadian can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.
- From clue 7, the Brazilian can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.
- Since M is in position 4, the Canadian and Brazilian must be in one of the remaining odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7).

Let's assume the Canadian is in position 1:
- The Brazilian would then be in position 3 (since both are in odd positions).
- The Japanese, German, and Italian need to fit into positions 2, 5, 6, and 7 with the given constraints.

From clue 6, the German is on the left of the Japanese, so G and J must be in positions 2 and 5 or 2 and 6. But since the Mexican is in position 4, the only valid positions for G and J are 2 and 5.

This leaves us with:
- Position 1: Canadian
- Position 2: German
- Position 3: Brazilian
- Position 4: Mexican
- Position 5: Japanese
- Position 6: Italian
- Position 7: Russian

Let's check all the conditions:
- Clue 1: The Japanese (5) is between the German (2) and the Canadian (1).
- Clue 2: The Mexican (4) is on the right of the Brazilian (3).
- Clue 3: The Russian (7) is on the right of the Italian (6).
- Clue 4: The Mexican (4) is in the middle.
- Clue 5: The Canadian (1) is in an odd position.
- Clue 6: The German (2) is on the left of the Japanese (5).
- Clue 7: The Brazilian (3) is in an odd position.

All conditions are satisfied with this arrangement. Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1    |    2    |     3     |    4    |   5    |    6     |    7     |

Lv4-1x7-2	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left.
2. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.
3. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
4. The person who's sport is golf is in an even position (position 4).
5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
6. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton.

Let's place the sports based on these clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Snowboarding is on the far left**:
   - Position 1: Snowboarding

2. **Golf is in an even position (position 4)**:
   - Position 4: Golf

3. **Sailing is on the left of Golf**:
   - Position 3: Sailing

4. **Climbing is on the right of Soccer**:
   - This means Soccer must be to the left of Climbing.

5. **Snowboarding is on the left of Badminton**:
   - Since Snowboarding is at position 1, Badminton must be at position 2.

6. **Soccer is on the left or right of Badminton**:
   - Given that Badminton is at position 2, Soccer must be at position 6 (since it can only be to the left or right of Badminton and cannot be in position 1 or 3 as those are already occupied).

7. **Remaining sports are Volleyball and Sailing**:
   - Since positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are already filled, the remaining positions (5 and 7) must be for the remaining sports.
   - We need to check if we can fit Volleyball and Sailing into positions 5 and 7 without violating any conditions.

Given the above steps, we can fill in the positions as follows:

|         |      1       |     2     |   3    |    4     |    5    |  6   |     7      |
| Sport   | Snowboarding | Badminton | Sailing | Golf     | Volleyball | Soccer | Climbing  |

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:
- Snowboarding (1) is on the far left.
- Sailing (3) is to the left of Golf (4).
- Climbing (7) is to the right of Soccer (6).
- Golf (4) is in an even position.
- Snowboarding (1) is to the left of Badminton (2).
- Soccer (6) is to the right of Badminton (2).

So, the final solution is:

```
|         |      1       |     2     |   3    |    4     |    5    |  6   |     7      |
| Sport   | Snowboarding | Badminton | Sailing | Golf     | Volleyball | Soccer | Climbing  |

Lv4-1x7-3	"Let's analyze and solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The paramedic is on the right of the videographer.
2. The firefighter is on the left of the software-developer.
3. The musician is on the left or right of the pilot.
4. The software-developer is on the left or right of the videographer.
5. The pilot is on the left of the firefighter.
6. The firefighter is on the left of the software-developer (repeated from clue 2).
7. The paramedic is in an even position.
8. The firefighter is on the left of the software-developer (repeated from clue 2).

From clues 2, 6, and 8, we can deduce that the firefighter must be to the immediate left of the software-developer. This means they must be in consecutive positions.

From clue 1, the paramedic must be immediately to the right of the videographer. This also means they must be in consecutive positions.

From clue 5, the pilot must be to the immediate left of the firefighter.

From clue 3 and 4, the musician can be either to the left or right of the pilot, and the software-developer can be either to the left or right of the videographer. However, since the firefighter and software-developer must be next to each other, and the paramedic and videographer must be next to each other, we need to fit these constraints into the available positions.

### Positioning the Jobs:
- From clue 7, the paramedic must be in an even position. The possible even positions are 2, 4, 6.
- Since the firefighter and software-developer must be next to each other, and the paramedic and videographer must be next to each other, let's try placing the paramedic in position 4 (an even position).

If the paramedic is in position 4, then the videographer must be in position 3 or 5.

#### Scenario 1: Paramedic in position 4, Videographer in position 3
- Firefighter and software-developer must be in positions 1 and 2 or 5 and 6.
- Pilot must be in position 2 if firefighter and software-developer are in positions 1 and 3 (not possible since paramedic is in 4 and videographer in 3), or in position 5 if they are in 5 and 6.

If pilot is in position 5 and firefighter and software-developer are in 6 and 7, it fits all clues:
- Paramedic (4) is to the right of videographer (3)
- Firefighter (6) is to the left of software-developer (7)
- Pilot (5) is to the left of firefighter (6)
- Software-developer (7) is to the left of videographer (3) (this is not possible as videographer is in 3)

#### Scenario 2: Paramedic in position 4, Videographer in position 5
- Firefighter and software-developer must be in positions 1 and 2 or 3 and 6.
- Pilot must be in position 2 if firefighter and software-developer are in positions 1 and 3 (not possible), or in position 3 if they are in 3 and 6.

If pilot is in position 3 and firefighter and software-developer are in 2 and 1:
- Paramedic (4) is to the right of videographer (5)
- Firefighter (2) is to the left of software-developer (1) (not possible as firefighter cannot be left of software-developer in this order)

#### Correct Scenario:
- Paramedic in position 4, Videographer in position 3
- Firefighter in position 2, Software-developer in position 1
- Pilot in position 5
- Musician in position 6 (left or right of pilot, but not needed for final solution)

So, the correct arrangement is:
1. Pilot
2. Firefighter
3. Videographer
4. Paramedic
5. Teacher (since no specific clue mentions teacher, we can place it here)
6. Musician
7. Software-developer

### Final Solution Table:
```
|       |    1     |   2   |      3      |         4          |      5       |     6     |    7    |
| Job   |  Pilot   | Firefighter |  Videographer |  Paramedic        |  Teacher    | Musician | Software-developer |

Lv4-1x7-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the sports accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **The person who's sport is cycling is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means cycling can be either in position 1 or 7.

2. **The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.**
   - This means if swimming is in position \(x\), lacrosse must be in position \(x-1\) or \(x+1\).

3. **The person who's sport is ice-hockey is in an even position.**
   - Ice-hockey must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 6.

4. **The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.**
   - If ice-hockey is in position \(y\), golf must be in position \(y+1\).

5. **The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.**
   - If cycling is in position 1, tennis must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - If cycling is in position 7, tennis must be in position 6.

6. **The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.**
   - If ice-hockey is in position \(z\), soccer must be in position \(z-1\).

7. **The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.**
   - This is already covered by clue 4.

8. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.**
   - If tennis is in position \(w\), lacrosse must be in position \(w+1\).

Let's start placing the sports based on these clues:

- From clue 1, cycling is in position 1 or 7.
- From clue 3, ice-hockey is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
- From clue 4, ice-hockey is left of golf.
- From clue 6, ice-hockey is right of soccer.
- From clue 5, tennis is right of cycling.
- From clue 8, lacrosse is right of tennis.

Let's assume cycling is in position 1:
- Tennis must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Lacrosse must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Ice-hockey must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6) and be left of golf.
- Soccer must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and be left of ice-hockey.
- Swimming must be left or right of lacrosse.

Let's try placing ice-hockey in position 2:
- Golf must be in position 3.
- Soccer must be in position 1 (contradicts cycling being in 1).

Let's try placing ice-hockey in position 4:
- Golf must be in position 5.
- Soccer must be in position 3.
- Tennis must be in position 2 or 5 (but 5 is taken by golf).
- Tennis must be in position 2.
- Lacrosse must be in position 3.
- Swimming must be in position 1 or 5 (but 5 is taken by golf).
- Swimming must be in position 1.

This configuration works:
- Position 1: Cycling
- Position 2: Tennis
- Position 3: Lacrosse
- Position 4: Ice-hockey
- Position 5: Golf
- Position 6: Soccer
- Position 7: Swimming

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv4-1x7-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking lemonade is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).
2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left (position 1).
3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.
4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right (positions 1 or 7).
5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.
6. **Clue 6**: The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.

From Clue 2, we know:
- Position 1: Iced-tea

From Clue 4, since position 1 is already taken by iced-tea, the person drinking sprite must be in position 7:
- Position 7: Sprite

From Clue 5, the person drinking milk can be either to the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea is at position 1, milk could be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we need to consider the other clues to narrow it down.

From Clue 1, the person drinking lemonade is in an even position (2, 4, or 6). Let's consider these positions one by one.

### Case 1: Lemonade in position 2
- Position 2: Lemonade
- From Clue 3, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1 (but iced-tea is there), so this case is invalid.

### Case 2: Lemonade in position 4
- Position 4: Lemonade
- From Clue 3, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2 or 3.
- From Clue 6, the person drinking fanta must be to the right of the person drinking lemonade, so fanta must be in position 5 or 6.

Let's try mirinda in position 2:
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 4: Lemonade
- Position 6: Fanta (since it has to be to the right of lemonade)
- Now, we have positions 3 and 5 left for milk and sprite. From Clue 5, milk can be in position 3 or 5, but since sprite is at position 7, milk must be in position 5.
- Position 3: Milk
- Position 5: Sprite (already placed)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- Position 1: Iced-tea
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 3: Milk
- Position 4: Lemonade
- Position 5: Fanta
- Position 6: Sprite
- Position 7: Sprite

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |

Lv4-1x7-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is basketball is in the middle.
   - This means basketball is in position 4.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left or far right.
   - Since basketball is in position 4, water-polo cannot be in position 4 (middle). So, it must be either in position 1 or 7.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour.
   - This means ice-hockey and parkour must be adjacent to each other.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
   - If water-polo is on the right, then ice-hockey must be to its left.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
   - This means volleyball and snowboarding must be adjacent to each other.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball.
   - Since basketball is in position 4, volleyball can only be in positions 3 or 5.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is rugby is on the far left.
   - This means rugby is in position 1.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is water-polo is in an odd position.
   - Since water-polo is in an odd position and we know it's not in position 1 (because rugby is there), it must be in position 3 or 5. But since volleyball is adjacent to basketball (position 4) and volleyball cannot be in position 4, volleyball must be in position 3 or 5. Therefore, water-polo must be in position 5.

Now let's place the sports based on these deductions:

- Position 1: Rugby (from Clue 7)
- Position 2: (to be determined)
- Position 3: Water-polo (from Clue 8 and Clue 4)
- Position 4: Basketball (from Clue 1)
- Position 5: Water-polo (already placed in position 3, so this is a contradiction, let's recheck)
- Position 6: (to be determined)
- Position 7: (to be determined)

Revisiting Clue 4 and Clue 8:
- Water-polo is in position 3, so ice-hockey must be in position 2.
- Volleyball must be in position 6 because it is adjacent to basketball (position 4) and not in position 4.

So, the correct placements are:
- Position 1: Rugby
- Position 2: Ice-hockey
- Position 3: Water-polo
- Position 4: Basketball
- Position 5: Parkour (since ice-hockey is in position 2, parkour must be in position 5)
- Position 6: Volleyball
- Position 7: Snowboarding

Final solution:

Lv4-1x7-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person drinking 7up.**
2. **The person drinking tea is in the middle (position 4).**
3. **The person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.**
4. **The person drinking mirinda is the person drinking mirinda.** (This is redundant and doesn't provide new information.)
5. **The person drinking water is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking tea.**
6. **The person drinking water is in an odd position.**
7. **The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 4 must be occupied by tea.**
   - From clue 2.

2. **Soy-milk must be to the left of tea.**
   - From clue 3, since tea is in position 4, soy-milk must be in position 3.

3. **Water must be in an odd position and between lemonade and tea.**
   - The only odd positions available are 1, 3, 5, and 7.
   - Since position 3 is already taken by soy-milk, water can be in position 1, 5, or 7.
   - Water cannot be in position 1 because there would be no room for lemonade to the left of it (since 1, 3, and 4 are taken).
   - Water cannot be in position 7 because it would not be between lemonade and tea.
   - Therefore, water must be in position 5.

4. **Mirinda must be on the right of 7up.**
   - Mirinda and 7up must be in positions 2 and 3 or 3 and 4, but 3 is taken by soy-milk, so they must be in positions 1 and 2.

5. **Lemonade and coffee must be such that coffee is on the left or right of lemonade.**
   - With water in position 5, lemonade and coffee must occupy positions 6 and 7 or 7 and 6.
   - If lemonade were in position 6, then coffee would have to be in position 7, which would place them next to each other, satisfying clue 7.
   - If lemonade were in position 7, then coffee would have to be in position 6, but this would violate clue 7 as there would be no space for them to be adjacent.

Thus, lemonade must be in position 6 and coffee in position 7.

### Final Arrangement:

|            |  1  |    2    |    3     |  4  |   5   |    6     |   7    |

Lv4-1x7-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down and analyze each clue step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Singing (S) is to the right of Woodworking (W)**.
2. **Hiking (H) is to the left of Traveling (T)**.
3. **Traveling (T) is to the left of Camping (C)**.
4. **Baking (B) is to the left of Hiking (H)**.
5. **Baking (B) is either to the left or right of Hiking (H)**. This clue is redundant with clue 4 since it already states B is to the left of H.
6. **Board-Games (BG) is in an odd position**.
7. **Woodworking (W) is to the right of Camping (C)**.
8. **Woodworking (W) is in an even position**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### From Clue 8:
- Since W is in an even position, possible positions for W are 2, 4, or 6.

#### From Clue 7:
- W is to the right of C. So if W is at 2, C must be at 1; if W is at 4, C must be at 3; if W is at 6, C must be at 5.

#### From Clue 1:
- S is to the right of W. So if W is at 2, S can be at 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7; if W is at 4, S can be at 5, 6, or 7; if W is at 6, S can only be at 7.

#### From Clue 2:
- H is to the left of T. And from Clue 3, T is to the left of C. So H, T, and C must be in that order.

#### From Clue 4:
- B is to the left of H. So B must come before H in the sequence.

#### From Clue 6:
- BG is in an odd position. Possible positions for BG are 1, 3, or 5.

### Combining All Clues:
Let's start with the most restrictive clues and build the sequence:

1. If W is at 2, then C must be at 1, and S can be at 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. But if S is at 3, 4, 5, or 6, there's no room for B and H in between. So S must be at 7.
2. If W is at 4, then C must be at 3, and S can be at 5, 6, or 7. But if S is at 5 or 6, there's no room for B and H in between. So S must be at 7.
3. If W is at 6, then C must be at 5, and S can only be at 7.

Now we need to place H, T, and C in the correct order, and B before H.

- If W is at 2, C is at 1, S is at 7, and the sequence must be: 1-C, 2-W, 3-?, 4-?, 5-?, 6-W, 7-S. The only way to fit H, T, and B is: 1-C, 2-W, 3-H, 4-T, 5-B, 6-W, 7-S.
- If W is at 4, C is at 3, S is at 7, and the sequence must be: 1-C, 2-?, 3-W, 4-W, 5-?, 6-?, 7-S. The only way to fit H, T, and B is: 1-C, 2-B, 3-W, 4-W, 5-H, 6-T, 7-S.
- If W is at 6, C is at 5, S is at 7, and the sequence must be: 1-?, 2-?, 3-?, 4-?, 5-C, 6-W, 7-S. The only way to fit H, T, and B is: 1-B, 2-H, 3-T, 4-C, 5-W, 6-W, 7-S.

Since W is in an even position and cannot be at 2, the only valid sequence is:

1. Baking (B)
2. Hiking (H)
3. Traveling (T)
4. Camping (C)
5. Woodworking (W)
6. Woodworking (W)
7. Singing (S)

Lv4-1x7-9	"Let's analyze and solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given conditions.

### Conditions Recap:
1. The owner of the horse is the owner of the horse.
2. The owner of the fish is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
3. The owner of the rabbit is on the left or right of the owner of the fish.
4. The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
5. The owner of the fish is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
6. The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the fish.
7. The owner of the snake is in an even position.
8. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.
9. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the lizard.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Horse
From condition 1, we know that the horse must be in one of the positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

#### Step 2: Positioning the Fish
From condition 2, the fish must be next to the horse. This means the fish can only be in positions (1, 3, 5, 7) if the horse is in (2, 4, 6). If the horse is in (1), then the fish can be in (2); if the horse is in (7), then the fish can be in (6).

#### Step 3: Positioning the Rabbit
From condition 3, the rabbit must be next to the fish. This means the rabbit can only be in positions (1, 2, 4, 5, 7) if the fish is in (2, 3, 6). If the fish is in (1), then the rabbit can be in (2); if the fish is in (3), then the rabbit can be in (2, 4); if the fish is in (6), then the rabbit can be in (5, 7).

#### Step 4: Positioning the Snake
From condition 7, the snake must be in an even position. So, the possible positions for the snake are (2, 4, 6).

#### Step 5: Positioning the Chinchilla
From condition 4, the chinchilla must be to the right of the snake. So, if the snake is in (2), the chinchilla can be in (3, 4, 5, 6, 7); if the snake is in (4), the chinchilla can be in (5, 6, 7); if the snake is in (6), the chinchilla can be in (7).

#### Step 6: Positioning the Lizard
From condition 8, the chinchilla must be next to the lizard. So, if the chinchilla is in (3), the lizard can be in (2, 4); if the chinchilla is in (4), the lizard can be in (3, 5); if the chinchilla is in (5), the lizard can be in (4, 6); if the chinchilla is in (7), the lizard can be in (6).

#### Step 7: Positioning the Rabbit and Lizard
From condition 9, the rabbit must be to the right of the lizard. We need to check which combinations fit all conditions.

### Final Solution:
Let's try placing the horse in position 3 and the fish in position 4 (since they are next to each other):
- Horse: 3
- Fish: 4
- Rabbit: 2 (next to the fish)
- Snake: 6 (even position)
- Chinchilla: 5 (right of the snake)
- Lizard: 1 (left of the rabbit)

This configuration satisfies all conditions:
1. Horse is at 3.
2. Fish is at 4, next to the horse.
3. Rabbit is at 2, next to the fish.
4. Snake is at 6, to the left of the chinchilla.
5. Fish is at 4, next to the rabbit.
6. Rabbit is at 2, to the left of the fish.
7. Snake is at 6, an even position.
8. Chinchilla is at 5, next to the lizard.
9. Rabbit is at 2, to the right of the lizard.

### Final Table:
```
|       |    1     |   2   |     3      |   4    |   5    |  6   |   7   |
| Pet   | lizard   | rabbit | horse      | fish   | chinchilla | snake |

Lv4-1x7-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 2:** The fan of gospel is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Gospel

2. **Clue 4:** The fan of funk is in the middle.
   - Position 4: Funk

3. **Clue 3:** The fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of funk.
   - Since funk is in position 4, soul can be in positions 3 or 5.

4. **Clue 1:** The fan of r&b is on the right of the fan of classical.
   - This means classical cannot be in position 7 (rightmost), and r&b must be to the right of classical.

5. **Clue 6:** The fan of classical is in an even position.
   - Classical can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

6. **Clue 5:** The fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of classical.
   - If classical is in position 2, then soul can be in position 3 or 5.
   - If classical is in position 6, then soul can be in position 5 or 7.
   - Since funk is in position 4, and soul must be next to funk, if funk is in position 4, soul must be in position 3 or 5.

7. **Clue 7:** The fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of indie.
   - Since gospel is already in position 1, indie must be in a position to the right of 1.

Now let's place the elements based on these constraints:

- Gospel is in position 1.
- Funk is in position 4.
- Soul must be in position 3 or 5 because it has to be next to funk.
- Classical must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6), but since funk is in position 4, classical can only be in position 2 or 6.
- If classical is in position 2, then r&b must be in position 3 (since r&b is to the right of classical).
- If classical is in position 6, then r&b must be in position 7.
- Indie must be to the right of gospel (position 1).

Let's try placing classical in position 2:
- Gospel: 1
- Classical: 2
- R&B: 3
- Funk: 4
- Soul: 5 (since it has to be next to funk)
- Indie: 6
- Remaining: 7

So the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Gospel
- Position 2: Classical
- Position 3: R&B
- Position 4: Funk
- Position 5: Soul
- Position 6: Indie
- Position 7: Remaining (indeterminate from given clues)

| Music-Genre   | Gospel | Classical | R&B  | Funk | Soul | Indie     |     |
