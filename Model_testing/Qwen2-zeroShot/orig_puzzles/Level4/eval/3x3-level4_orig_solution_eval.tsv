Lv4-3x3-1	"Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. The person who's sport is skateboarding is in an even position (2).
2. The Thai is on the left of the Indian.
3. The fan of classical is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
4. The Thai is in an even position (2).
5. The fan of pop is on the far left (1).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Position of the Thai
- From point 4, the Thai must be in position 2.
- From point 2, the Indian must be to the right of the Thai, so the Indian must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |           |               |          |
| Nationality   | Pop       | Thai          | Indian   |
| Sport         |           | Badminton    | Skateboarding |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the Sport for the Person Who Likes Classical
- From point 3, the fan of classical is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
- Since the person with badminton is in position 2, the fan of classical must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |           |               | Classical |
| Nationality   | Pop       | Thai          | Indian   |
| Sport         |           | Badminton    | Skateboarding |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the Sport for the Person Who Likes House
- The only remaining sport is skateboarding, which we already know is in position 3.

Since the person who likes house cannot be in position 3, they must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   | House     |               | Classical |
| Nationality   | Pop       | Thai          | Indian   |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Badminton    | Skateboarding |
```

This doesn't make sense because the same sport cannot be repeated. Let's correct this:

- The person who likes house must be in position 2 since the only other position left for house is 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   | House     |               | Classical |
| Nationality   | Pop       | Thai          | Indian   |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Badminton    | House    |
```

Now, the only sport left is pop, which must be in position 1.

So, the final table is:

```
|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   | Pop       | House         | Classical |
| Nationality   | Pop       | Thai          | Indian   |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Badminton    | House    |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   | Pop       | House         | Classical |

### Clues:
1. The teacher is the person eating nectarine.
2. The person whose hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the teacher.
3. The person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating cabbage.
4. The musician is on the right of the person whose hobby is collecting.
5. The teacher is in an even position.
6. The teacher is on the right of the person whose hobby is video-games.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5: The teacher is in an even position.
Since there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), the teacher must be in position 2.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Food    |             | **nectarine** |          |
| Hobby   |             | **teacher** |          |
| Job     |             | **teacher** |          |

#### Clue 1: The teacher is the person eating nectarine.
This confirms that the teacher is in position 2 and is eating nectarine.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Food    |             | **nectarine** |          |
| Hobby   |             | **teacher** |          |
| Job     |             | **teacher** |          |

#### Clue 3: The person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating cabbage.
Since the person eating nectarine (position 2) is on the left of the person eating cabbage, the person eating cabbage must be in position 3.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Food    |             | **nectarine** | **cabbage** |
| Hobby   |             | **teacher** |          |
| Job     |             | **teacher** |          |

#### Clue 2: The person whose hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the teacher.
Since the teacher is in position 2, the person with the hobby of video-games must be either in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 6: The teacher is on the right of the person whose hobby is video-games.
Since the teacher is in position 2 and must be to the right of the person with the hobby of video-games, the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 1.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Food    |             | **nectarine** | **cabbage** |
| Hobby   | **video-games** | **teacher** |          |
| Job     |             | **teacher** |          |

#### Clue 4: The musician is on the right of the person whose hobby is collecting.
Since the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 1, the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 2, and the musician must be in position 3.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |

| Hobby   | **video-games** | **collecting** | **musician** |
| Job     |             | **teacher** | **musician** |

#### Assigning the remaining foods and jobs:
- The person in position 1 (with the hobby of video-games) cannot eat cabbage or nectarine, so they must eat avocado.
- The person in position 3 (the musician) cannot eat nectarine, so they must eat cabbage.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |

| Hobby   | **video-games** | **collecting** | **musician** |
| Job     |             | **teacher** | **musician** |

#### Determining the job for each person:
- The person in position 1 (hobby: video-games) cannot be a teacher or musician, so they must be a dancer.
- The person in position 3 (musician) cannot be a teacher, so they must be a dancer or teacher. Since the teacher is already assigned to position 2, the musician must be a dancer.
- The person in position 2 (teacher) has no remaining job, so they must be a teacher.

Lv4-3x3-3	"Let's break down the information given and use it to fill in the table step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is in an even position**:
   - This means the person who plays lacrosse is in position 2.
   
2. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person eating apple**:
   - This means the person in position 3 eats apple and plays weightlifting.

3. **The fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of funk**:
   - This means the person who likes reggae is in position 3 (right) and the person who likes funk is in position 1 (left).

4. **The person eating plum is on the right of the person eating apple**:
   - Since the person eating apple is in position 3, the person eating plum must be in position 2.

5. **The person eating plum is on the left or right of the fan of reggae**:
   - Since the person eating plum is in position 2 and the fan of reggae is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

Now, let's summarize the positions:
- Position 1: The person who likes funk
- Position 2: The person who eats plum and could be the fan of reggae
- Position 3: The person who eats apple and plays weightlifting and likes reggae

Since the fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of funk and the fan of reggae is in position 3, the fan of funk must be in position 1.

### Final Table:

```

Lv4-3x3-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the owner of the snake.
2. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the writer.
3. The social-worker is in an odd position (1 or 3).
4. The person drinking coffee is on the far left.
5. The writer is on the far left or far right.
6. The teacher is on the right of the writer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4:
- The person drinking coffee is on the far left.
- This means the beverage column for position 1 is **coffee**.

|            | Coffee |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage   |   X    |          |               |
| Job        |        |          |               |
| Pet        |        |          |               |

#### Clue 5:
- The writer is on the far left or far right.
- Since position 1 is already occupied by coffee, the writer must be in position 3.

|            | Coffee |    2     | Writer      |
| Beverage   |   X    |          |             |
| Job        |        |          |             |
| Pet        |        |          |             |

#### Clue 6:
- The teacher is on the right of the writer.
- Therefore, the teacher must be in position 2.

|            | Coffee | Teacher  | Writer      |
| Beverage   |   X    |          |             |
| Job        |        |          |             |
| Pet        |        |          |             |

#### Clue 3:
- The social-worker is in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Since position 1 and 3 are already occupied, there is no valid position for the social-worker based on this clue alone. However, we can infer that the social-worker must be in position 2 since it's the only remaining odd position.

|            | Coffee | Social-worker | Writer      |
| Beverage   |   X    |              |             |
| Job        |        |              |             |
| Pet        |        |              |             |

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the writer.
- Since the writer is in position 3, the owner of the goldfish must be in position 2.

|            | Coffee | Social-worker | Writer      |
| Beverage   |   X    | Goldfish     |             |
| Job        |        |              |             |
| Pet        |        |              |             |

#### Clue 1:
- The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the owner of the snake.
- The only remaining positions for mirinda and snake are 1 and 3, but position 1 is already occupied by coffee. Therefore, mirinda must be in position 2 and the snake in position 3.

|            | Mirinda| Social-worker | Snake       |
| Beverage   |   X    | Goldfish     |             |
| Job        |        |              |             |
| Pet        |        |              |             |

#### Final Step:
- The only remaining job for the social-worker is the social-worker, the only remaining job for the teacher is the teacher, and the only remaining job for the writer is the writer.

|            | Mirinda| Social-worker | Snake       |
| Beverage   | Coffee | Goldfish     |             |
| Job        | Social-worker | Teacher  | Writer      |
| Pet        |        |              |             |

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-3x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct placement of each element (movie genre, nationality, and pet) for each position (1, 2, 3).

Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clue Breakdown:
1. The American is on the left or right of the owner of the bird.
2. The Australian is on the left of the owner of the mouse.
3. The owner of the bird is on the right of the person watching romance movies.
4. The owner of the bird is in an odd position.
5. The person watching time-travel movies is on the far left.
6. The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The person watching time-travel movies is on the far left (Position 1).
   - So, Position 1 is ""Time-travel"".

2. **Clue 4:** The owner of the bird is in an odd position (1 or 3) and on the right of the person watching romance movies.
   - Since Position 1 is ""Time-travel"", the bird must be in Position 3 because it needs to be on the right of the person watching romance movies.
   - Therefore, Position 3 is ""Bird"".

3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the bird is on the right of the person watching romance movies.
   - Since the bird is in Position 3, the person watching romance movies must be in Position 2.

4. **Clue 6:** The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies.
   - The person watching romance movies is in Position 2, so the person watching satire movies can be in Position 1 or 2.
   - But Position 1 is already ""Time-travel"", so the person watching satire movies must be in Position 2.
   - Therefore, Position 2 is ""Satire"".

5. **Clue 2:** The Australian is on the left of the owner of the mouse.
   - The Australian cannot be in Position 1 (Time-travel) or Position 2 (Satire), so the Australian must be in Position 3.
   - The owner of the mouse cannot be in Position 3 (since the bird is there), so the mouse must be in Position 1.
   - Therefore, Position 1 is ""Mouse"" and Position 3 is ""Australian"".

6. **Clue 1:** The American is on the left or right of the owner of the bird.
   - The bird is in Position 3, so the American must be in Position 1 or 2.
   - Since Position 1 is ""Mouse"" and Position 2 is ""Satire"", the American must be in Position 2.
   - Therefore, Position 2 is ""American"".

7. **Final Check:**
   - Position 1: Mouse (Australian)
   - Position 2: Satire (American)
   - Position 3: Bird (Chinese)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel |    Satire | Time-travel |
| Nationality   |     Mouse   |    Satire |     Bird  |
| Pet           |    Mouse    |   Chinchilla |   Bird   |
```

Note: There seems to be a typo in the puzzle where ""Time-travel"" appears twice in the solution for Position 3. Given the constraints, the correct placement should be:

```
|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel |    Satire |    Romance |
| Nationality   |     Mouse   |    Satire |     Bird  |
| Pet           |    Mouse    |   Chinchilla |   Bird   |
```

So, the corrected final solution table is:

```
|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |

Lv4-3x3-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking cola is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person whose hobby is singing.
2. **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is board-games is the person drinking milk.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking cola is on the left of the person whose hobby is board-games.
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the car is in an even position (position 2).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
- The person whose hobby is board-games is the person drinking milk.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- The person driving the car is in position 2.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The person drinking cola is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person whose hobby is singing.
- This means the person drinking cola cannot be in position 1 or 3 if the other two are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 3
- The person drinking cola is on the left of the person whose hobby is board-games.
- Since the person whose hobby is board-games is in position 2 (from Clue 4), the person drinking cola must be in position 1.

#### Step 5: Determine Positions
- From Clue 1, since the person drinking cola is in position 1 and the person whose hobby is board-games is in position 2, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 3 (because the person drinking cola is between them).
- Therefore:
  - Position 1: Cola
  - Position 2: Board-games
  - Position 3: Quad-bike

#### Step 6: Determine Beverages and Hobbies
- From Clue 2, the person whose hobby is board-games drinks milk.
- Therefore:
  - Position 1: Cola
  - Position 2: Milk
  - Position 3: Sprite (since there are only three beverages and the others are already assigned)

#### Step 7: Determine Hobbies and Transports
- We know the person whose hobby is board-games is in position 2, so the hobby for position 2 is board-games.
- From Clue 3, the person drinking cola (in position 1) is on the left of the person whose hobby is board-games (in position 2), so the person in position 3 must have the remaining hobby, which is singing.
- Therefore:
  - Position 1: Cola
  - Position 2: Milk, Board-games
  - Position 3: Sprite, Singing

#### Step 8: Determine Transports
- From Clue 4, the person driving the car is in position 2.
- Therefore:
  - Position 1: Cola, Boat (since the car is in position 2)
  - Position 2: Milk, Board-games, Car
  - Position 3: Sprite, Singing, Quad-bike

### Final Table:

```
|             |    1    |   2   |      3      |
| Beverage    |   Cola  |  Milk |   Sprite    |
| Hobby       |   Boat  |Board-games|   Singing   |
| Transport   |   Boat  |   Car |  Quad-bike  |

   - This means if skateboarding is in position 2, the rat must be in position 3. If skateboarding is in position 1, the rat must be in position 2. If skateboarding is in position 3, it doesn't make sense as there would be no space for the rat to the right.

3. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is in an even position.**
   - Since skateboarding is in an even position (2), the rat must be in position 3.

4. **The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.**
   - This means if tennis is in position 1, sports movies must be in position 2 or 3. If tennis is in position 2, sports movies must be in position 3. If tennis is in position 3, it contradicts the previous clue that sports movies is on the right of tennis.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Sport:**
   - From clue 3, skateboarding is in position 2.
   - From clue 2, the rat is in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person in position 1 must be doing tennis.

2. **Positioning the Movie-Genres:**
   - From clue 4, the person watching sports movies must be on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
   - Since tennis is in position 1 and skateboarding is in position 2, the person watching sports movies must be in position 3.
   - This fits with clue 1, as the person watching sports movies (position 3) is between the owner of the frog (position 1) and the person watching western movies (position 2).

3. **Assigning Pets:**
   - The owner of the rat is in position 3.
   - The owner of the frog must be in position 1 (since the person watching sports movies is between the owner of the frog and the person watching western movies).
   - Therefore, the person watching western movies must be in position 2.

Lv4-3x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating corn.
2. The person who's sport is lacrosse is between the pilot and the person eating potato.
3. The photographer is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
4. The person eating potato is in an odd position.
5. The person who's sport is tennis is the person eating potato.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4 & 5:
- The person eating potato is in an odd position.
- The person who's sport is tennis is the person eating potato.
So, the person eating potato must be in position 1 (since it is the only odd position available).

#### Clue 5:
- The person who's sport is tennis is the person eating potato.
So, the person in position 1 eats potato and their sport is tennis.

#### Clue 2:
- The person who's sport is lacrosse is between the pilot and the person eating potato.
Since the person in position 1 eats potato, the person with lacrosse must be in position 2 or 3. But since the person in position 1 has tennis, the lacrosse person cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the lacrosse person must be in position 2, and the pilot must be in position 3.

#### Clue 3:
- The photographer is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
Since the lacrosse person is in position 2, the photographer must be in position 3. This means the pilot (position 3) is the photographer.

#### Clue 1:
- The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating corn.
Since the person in position 1 eats potato and the person in position 2 does lacrosse, the person in position 3 (the photographer/pilot) cannot eat corn or pineapple. So, the person in position 1 (potato) and the person in position 2 (lacrosse) must be corn and pineapple. Given that the person in position 2 (lacrosse) is on the right of the person in position 1 (potato), the person in position 2 must eat pineapple, and the person in position 1 must eat corn.

Now we know:
- Position 1: Corn (tennis)
- Position 2: Pineapple (lacrosse)
- Position 3: Potato (tennis)

But since the person in position 3 (pilot/photographer) is not eating potato, the only remaining sport for the person in position 1 (corn) and position 2 (pineapple) is determined as follows:
- Position 1: Corn (tennis)
- Position 2: Pineapple (lacrosse)
- Position 3: Potato (skating)

Since the person in position 3 (pilot/photographer) is not eating potato, the person in position 3 must have the remaining job and sport:
- Position 1: Corn (tennis)
- Position 2: Pineapple (lacrosse)
- Position 3: Potato (skating, but since the person in position 3 is the photographer, the sport must be skating)

Thus, the final arrangement is:

|         |   1    |     2     |      3       |
| Food    |  Corn  |  Pineapple|  Potato     |
| Job     |  Musician | Photographer | Pilot     |
| Sport   |  Tennis |  Lacrosse |  Skating   |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |   1    |     2     |      3       |
| Food    |  Corn  |  Pineapple|  Potato     |
| Job     |  Musician | Photographer | Pilot     |

Lv4-3x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step:

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting.
2. The Pakistani is in an odd position (1 or 3).
3. The Polish is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
4. The Pakistani is on the right of the Polish.
5. The person who's hobby is camping is between the owner of the goat and the person who's hobby is collecting.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
- From Clue 2: The Pakistani is in an odd position (1 or 3).
- From Clue 4: The Pakistani is on the right of the Polish.
  
  Since the Pakistani must be in an odd position, and they are to the right of the Polish, the only possible positions for the Pakistani are:
  - Position 3 (rightmost)
  - Position 1 (leftmost)

  However, if the Pakistani were in position 1, the Polish would have to be in position 2, but there is no position 0. Therefore, the Pakistani must be in position 3, and the Polish must be in position 1.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 5
- The person with the hobby of camping is between the owner of the goat and the person with the hobby of collecting.
- Given that the Pakistani is in position 3, and the Polish is in position 1, the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 2.

  So, we have:
  - Position 1: Polish
  - Position 2: Camping
  - Position 3: Pakistani

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 5
- From Clue 1: The person with the hobby of camping is on the right of the person with the hobby of collecting.
- From Clue 5: The person with the hobby of camping is in position 2, so the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 1.

  This conflicts with our previous conclusion that the Polish is in position 1 and has the hobby of camping. Therefore, the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 1, and the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 2.

  So, we correct it to:
  - Position 1: Collecting
  - Position 2: Camping
  - Position 3: Pakistani

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 3 and Clue 5
- From Clue 3: The Polish is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
- From Clue 5: The Pakistani is in position 3, and the Polish is in position 1.

  This means the owner of the rabbit must be in position 2, which is the same as the position of the person with the hobby of camping.

  So, we have:
  - Position 1: Collecting
  - Position 2: Camping (rabbit owner)
  - Position 3: Pakistani

#### Step 5: Assign Nationalities and Pets
- The Pakistani is in position 3, so the Thai must be in position 1 (since the Pakistani is on the right of the Polish, and the Polish is in position 1).

  So, we have:
  - Position 1: Thai (Collecting)
  - Position 2: Goat (Camping)
  - Position 3: Pakistani (Rabbit)

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |    2    |       3       |
| Hobby         | Collecting | Camping | Rabbit        |
| Nationality   | Thai       |         | Pakistani     |
| Pet           | Goat       |         | Rabbit        |

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."	{'hobby': ['collecting', 'camping', 'rabbit'], 'nationality': ['thai', '', 'pakistani'], 'pet': ['goat', '', 'rabbit']}	True	4	False
Lv4-3x3-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step-by-step:

### Clue Breakdown:
1. The nurse is on the far right (Position 3).
2. The person watching martial-arts movies is the person watching martial-arts movies (This is redundant and doesn't provide new information).
3. The German is on the left or right of the Thai.
4. The chef is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
5. The Thai is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies.
6. The person watching time-travel movies is in an even position (Position 2).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Position Analysis:
- **Position 1**: Can be either German or Thai.
- **Position 2**: Must be the person watching time-travel movies and can only be Thai or Chef.
- **Position 3**: Nurse.

From clue 6, we know that the person watching time-travel movies must be in Position 2. From clue 5, the Thai is to the left of the person watching time-travel movies, so the Thai cannot be in Position 2. Therefore, the Thai must be in Position 1, and the person watching time-travel movies (Chef) must be in Position 2.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Thai
- Position 2: Chef
- Position 3: Nurse

From clue 4, the chef is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the chef is in Position 2, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in Position 1 (Thai). However, we already placed the Thai in Position 1, so this means the person watching martial-arts movies cannot be the chef.

Since the chef is in Position 2 and the Thai is in Position 1, the only remaining job for Position 1 is the nurse, which contradicts our initial placement. Therefore, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in Position 3 (Nurse).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Thai
- Position 2: Chef
- Position 3: Nurse

From clue 3, the German is on the left or right of the Thai. Since the Thai is in Position 1, the German must be in Position 2 or 3. But since Position 2 is already occupied by the Chef, the German must be in Position 3.

Thus, we have:
- Position 1: Thai
- Position 2: Chef
- Position 3: German
