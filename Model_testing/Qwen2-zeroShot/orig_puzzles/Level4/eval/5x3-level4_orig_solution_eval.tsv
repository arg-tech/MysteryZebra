Lv4-5x3-1	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Summary:
1. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person whose hobby is traveling.
2. The person driving the bus is on the far left.
3. The librarian is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies.
4. The Chinese is on the far left.
5. The librarian is the person driving the taxi.
6. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is in an even position.
7. The scientist is on the right of the Mexican.
8. The person watching scientific movies is the scientist.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Position 1:
- The Chinese is on the far left (Clue 4).
- The person driving the bus is on the far left (Clue 2).

So, Position 1 must be:
- Chinese (Nationality)
- Bus (Transport)

#### Position 2:
- The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person whose hobby is traveling (Clue 1).
- The librarian is the person driving the taxi (Clue 5).

So, Position 2 must be:
- Librarian (Job)
- Taxi (Transport)

#### Position 3:
- The scientist is on the right of the Mexican (Clue 7).
- The person watching scientific movies is the scientist (Clue 8).

So, Position 3 must be:
- Scientist (Job)
- Scientific (Movie-Genre)
- Mexican (Nationality)

#### Position 2 Revisited:
- Since Position 2 is the Librarian, the person whose hobby is rock-climbing must be in an even position (Clue 6). Therefore, Position 2 cannot be the one with the hobby of rock-climbing. It must be the hobby of collecting.

So, Position 2 must be:
- Collecting (Hobby)

#### Position 3 Revisited:
- The remaining job for Position 3 is the Scientist.
- The remaining nationality for Position 3 is the Mexican.
- The remaining movie genre for Position 3 is the Scientific.

#### Final Placement:
- Position 1: Chinese (Nationality), Bus (Transport)
- Position 2: Librarian (Job), Taxi (Transport), Collecting (Hobby)
- Position 3: Scientist (Job), Scientific (Movie-Genre), Mexican (Nationality)

Lv4-5x3-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **The American is on the far right.**
   - This means the American is in position 3.

2. **The person whose hobby is fishing is the person watching sports movies.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of fishing is also watching sports movies.

3. **The person eating lemon is on the right of the person whose hobby is fishing.**
   - Since the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 3 (American), the person eating lemon must be in position 2.

4. **The Nigerian is in an even position.**
   - The only even positions available are 2 and 4. Since position 2 is already taken by the person eating lemon, the Nigerian must be in position 4.

5. **The person whose hobby is gardening is the person eating orange.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of gardening is also eating orange.

6. **The person watching comedy movies is the person whose hobby is woodworking.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of woodworking is also watching comedy movies.

7. **The pilot is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies.**
   - Since the person watching comedy movies is in position 2 (gardening/orange) and the pilot can only be in position 1 or 3, and we know the American (position 3) is not the pilot, the pilot must be in position 1.

8. **The person watching sports movies is between the person eating orange and the mechanic.**
   - From clue 3, we know the person eating lemon (position 2) is to the right of the person with the hobby of fishing (position 3). Therefore, the person watching sports movies (fishing) must be in position 2, and the mechanic must be in position 1 since the person eating lemon (position 2) is between the person watching sports movies (position 2) and the mechanic (position 1).

Now let's fill in the table based on these deductions:

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |

| Movie-Genre   | comedy      | sports   | spy         |
| Nationality   | american    | nigerian | colombian   |

Since there are no more clues involving positions 2 and 4, we can conclude that the remaining nationality for position 2 is Colombian and for position 4 is Nigerian.

7. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left.
8. The bartender is between the social-worker and the person watching epic movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person who's sport is handball is on the far left**:
   - Position 1 must be the handball player.

2. **Fan of ambient is the person who's sport is handball**:
   - Position 1 is also the fan of ambient.

3. **Person who's sport is handball is the person watching western movies**:
   - Position 1 is watching western movies.

4. **The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left**:
   - Position 1 is also the person with the hobby of dancing.

5. **The bartender is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing**:
   - Since position 1 is handball and the bartender is to the left of the rower, the bartender must be in position 2.

6. **The bartender is between the social-worker and the person watching epic movies**:
   - Position 2 is the bartender, so the social-worker and the person watching epic movies must be in positions 1 and 3, but since position 1 is already taken by the handball player, the social-worker and the epic movie watcher must be in positions 2 and 3.

7. **The person who's hobby is collecting is in an odd position (1 or 3)**:
   - Since position 1 is already taken by the handball player (and thus also the fan of ambient and the one watching western movies), the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 3.

8. **The person watching superhero movies is between the person who's sport is handball and the fan of country**:
   - Position 1 is handball and the fan of ambient, and position 3 is the person with the hobby of collecting. So, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 2 (the bartender).

9. **Summarizing the positions**:
   - Position 1: Handball (dancing, ambient, western)
   - Position 2: Bartender (superhero)
   - Position 3: Collecting (odd position, not specified)

Lv4-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is swimming is the engineer.
2. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far right and also eats broccoli.
3. **Clue 1**: The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
4. **Clue 4**: The person eating radish is in an even position.
5. **Clue 7**: The person eating eggplant is the paramedic.
6. **Clue 8**: The owner of the horse is the person eating broccoli.
7. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is swimming is the engineer.
8. **Clue 9**: The person driving the tram is on the right of the owner of the goldfish.

From Clues 2, 3, and 6:
- The person who's sport is snowboarding (far right) is the person eating broccoli (also the owner of the horse).
- The person who's sport is swimming (engineer) is not on the far right or far left because Clue 3 and Clue 6 place the snowboarder and the broccoli eater respectively.

From Clue 1:
- The person driving the jet-ski must be on the far left, and the person driving the taxi must be on the far right.

From Clue 4:
- The person eating radish must be in position 2 (since it's an even position).

From Clue 5:
- The person eating eggplant is the paramedic.

From Clue 8:
- The owner of the horse (broccoli eater) is the person on the far right.

Now let's assign the positions and roles:

- Position 1: Jet-ski driver (far left)
- Position 2: Radish eater (even position)
- Position 3: Tram driver (right of the goldfish owner)

Since the person eating broccoli (position 3) owns the horse, and the person driving the tram is to the right of the goldfish owner, we can deduce:

- Position 1: Jet-ski driver (not eating broccoli or eggplant, so must be radish or swimming)
- Position 2: Radish eater (must be the paramedic)
- Position 3: Tram driver (right of the goldfish owner, so not eating radish, broccoli, or eggplant, must be swimming)

So, the remaining roles and foods are:
- Position 1: Jet-ski driver (swimming, not eating radish, broccoli, or eggplant)
- Position 2: Eggplant eater (paramedic)
- Position 3: Tram driver (swimming, not eating radish, broccoli, or eggplant)

Thus, we can fill in the table as follows:

```
|             |     1      |    2     |         3          |
| Food        | Broccoli   | Eggplant | Radish             |
| Job         | Paramedic  | Engineer | Software-developer |
| Pet         | Horse      | Guinea-pig | Goldfish           |
| Sport       | Snowboarding | Swimming | Cricket            |
| Transport   | Jet-ski    | Taxi     | Tram               |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 and 6
- The fan of r&b is in an odd position (either 1 or 3).
- The fan of r&b is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
- Therefore, the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to their left).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2 and 6
- The person who's hobby is puzzles is the person watching superhero movies.
- The fan of r&b is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
- Therefore, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in position 3 (since it's the only even position left for the person who's hobby is puzzles).

#### Step 3: Place Puzzles and Superhero Movies
- Position 3: Hobbies - Puzzles
- Position 3: Movie-Genres - Superhero

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 1 and 4
- The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the owner of the rat.
- The owner of the mouse is the person who's sport is baseball.
- Therefore, the person who's sport is baseball cannot have the hobby of board-games (since they are in the same row as the owner of the rat).

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 5 and 7
- The fan of folk is on the left of the person watching documentary movies.
- The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the fan of folk.

#### Step 6: Place Water-Polo and Folk
- Position 3: Sports - Water-polo
- Position 2: Music-Genres - Folk (since the fan of folk is on the left of the person watching documentary movies)

#### Step 7: Place Documentary Movies
- Since position 3 is already occupied by ""Superhero"", the remaining genre must be ""Documentary"".
- Position 1: Movie-Genres - Documentary

#### Step 8: Place R&b and Puzzles
- The fan of r&b is in an odd position and on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
- The person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 3.
- Therefore, the fan of r&b must be in position 1.

#### Step 9: Place Board-Games and Rat
- The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the owner of the rat.
- Since position 3 is occupied by puzzles, the board-games owner must be in position 2.
- The rat owner must be in position 1.

#### Step 10: Place Mouse and Baseball
- The owner of the mouse is the person who's sport is baseball.
- The person who's sport is baseball must be in position 3 (but we already placed water-polo there).
- Therefore, the owner of the mouse must be in position 2.

#### Step 11: Fill Remaining Hobbies and Pets
- The only remaining hobby is ""gardening"".
- The only remaining pet is ""goldfish"".
