Lv4-3x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
1. There are two nationalities: Colombian and Mexican.
2. There are two sports: Skiing and Water Polo.
3. There are two modes of transport: Roller and Taxi.
4. The person who prefers skiing is to the right of the person using the roller.
5. The Mexican is in an odd position (1st or 3rd).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of the Mexican**:
   - Since the Mexican is in an odd position, he can only be in position 1 or 3.

2. **Skiing and Roller**:
   - The person who prefers skiing must be to the right of the person using the roller.

3. **Possible Arrangements**:
   - If the Mexican is in position 1, then the Colombian must be in position 2.
   - If the Mexican is in position 3, then the Colombian must be in position 4 (but there is no position 4, so this is not possible).

Thus, the Mexican must be in position 1, and the Colombian must be in position 2.

4. **Sport Assignment**:
   - The person in position 1 (Mexican) cannot have skiing because the person with skiing is to the right of the roller user.
   - Therefore, the Mexican must have water polo.
   - The person in position 2 (Colombian) must have skiing.

5. **Transport Assignment**:
   - The person in position 1 (Mexican) cannot have roller because the roller user is to the left of the skier.
   - Therefore, the Mexican must have taxi.
   - The person in position 2 (Colombian) must have roller.

### Final Table:

Lv4-3x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and systematically place the information into the table.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
2. The Canadian is in an even position (position 2).

### Table Setup:
|               |    1    |     2     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Beverage      |         |           |
| Nationality   |         |           |
| Transport     |         |           |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2: The Canadian is in an even position.
This means the Canadian must be in position 2.

|               |    1    |     2     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Beverage      |         |           |
| Nationality   |         | **Canadian** |
| Transport     |         |           |

#### Clue 1: The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
Since the Canadian is in position 2, the person in position 1 must be driving the train (because they are on the left of the person in position 2).

|               |    1    |     2     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Beverage      |         |           |
| Nationality   | **Turkish** | **Canadian** |
| Transport     | **Train** |           |

Now, we know that the person in position 1 is driving the train, so the person in position 2 cannot be driving the train. Therefore, the person in position 2 must be drinking mirinda.

|               |    1    |     2     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Beverage      |         | **Mirinda** |
| Nationality   | **Turkish** | **Canadian** |
| Transport     | **Train** |           |

Finally, since there are only two nationalities and two beverages, the remaining nationality (Turkish) must be in position 1, and the remaining beverage (Sprite) must be in position 1.

|               |    1    |     2     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Beverage      | **Sprite** | **Mirinda** |
| Nationality   | **Turkish** | **Canadian** |
| Transport     | **Train** |           |

Since the person in position 1 is driving the train, the person in position 2 must be using the motorbike (the only other mode of transport).

|               |    1    |     2     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Beverage      | **Sprite** | **Mirinda** |
| Nationality   | **Turkish** | **Canadian** |
| Transport     | **Train** | **Motorbike** |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |     2     |

Lv4-3x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step based on the given conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** The person whose hobby is writing is in an even position.
   - This means the person with the hobby ""writing"" must be in position 2.

2. **Condition 2:** The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
   - This implies that if someone prefers ice-hockey, they must be to the left of the person who prefers fantasy movies.

Given these conditions, let's fill out the table:

|               |      1       |    2     |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Hobby         | collecting  | writing  |
| Movie-Genre   | swimming    | fantasy  |
| Sport         | ice-hockey  | swimming |

### Explanation:
- Since the person with the hobby ""writing"" is in position 2 (from Condition 1), the first position must have ""collecting"".
- For Condition 2, we need to place ""ice-hockey"" and ""fantasy"" such that ""ice-hockey"" is to the left of ""fantasy"". This can be achieved by placing ""ice-hockey"" in position 1 and ""swimming"" in position 2 for both ""Movie-Genre"" and ""Sport"".

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|               |      1       |    2     |
|---------------|-------------|----------|

Lv4-3x2-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

1. **There are 2 different types of food: pomegranate, raspberry**
2. **There are 2 different movie-genres: fantasy, superhero**
3. **There are 2 different means of transport: ship, train**

We need to satisfy these conditions:
1. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
2. The person eating pomegranate is in an odd position (i.e., position 1).

Let's start with the second condition:
- The person eating pomegranate must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          | pomegranate | raspberry |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |
```

Now, let's consider the first condition:
- The person driving the ship must be on the right of the person watching superhero movies.

This means that the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1, and the person driving the ship must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          | pomegranate | raspberry |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero   | fantasy   |
| Transport     | ship        | train     |
```

Let's verify if all conditions are satisfied:
1. The person driving the ship (in position 2) is on the right of the person watching superhero movies (in position 1).
2. The person eating pomegranate (in position 1) is in an odd position.

Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the final solution is:

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          | pomegranate | raspberry |

Lv4-3x2-5	"Certainly! Let's break down the puzzle and solve it step by step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two types of food: **lime** and **raspberry**.
2. There are two types of sports: **cricket** and **rugby**.
3. There are two types of transport: **quad-bike** and **skateboard**.

### Clues:
1. The person eating **raspberry** is on the right of the person whose sport is **rugby**.
2. The person driving the **quad-bike** is in an odd position (i.e., position 1).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person driving the quad-bike is in position 1.
    - So, we can fill in the first row with ""quad-bike"" in position 1.
    - This means the second row must be ""skateboard"".

2. **Clue 1**: The person eating **raspberry** is on the right of the person whose sport is **rugby**.
    - Since the person in position 1 is using the quad-bike, the person in position 2 must be using the skateboard.
    - Therefore, the person in position 2 cannot be eating **raspberry** because they would not be on the right of the person whose sport is **rugby** (since there is no one to their left).
    - Hence, the person in position 1 must be eating **raspberry**.
    - The person in position 2 must be eating **lime**.

3. Now, we need to assign the sports:
    - The person in position 1 is eating **raspberry**, so the person in position 2 must have the sport that is **rugby** (since the person with **raspberry** is on the right of the person with **rugby**).
    - Therefore, the person in position 1 has the sport that is **cricket** (the only other option).

So, the final arrangement is:

|             |     1     |     2      |
| Food        | raspberry | lime       |
| Sport       | cricket   | rugby      |
| Transport   | quad-bike | skateboard |

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-3x2-6	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

We are given:
1. The people have 2 different hobbies: fishing, singing.
2. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: metal, trance.
3. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: basketball, water-polo.
4. The fan of metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing.
5. The person who's sport is basketball is in an odd position (which means position 1).

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         |    ?       |    ?       |
| Music-Genre   |    ?       |    ?       |
| Sport         |  Basketball|    ?       |

From clue 5, we know that the person with basketball as their sport is in position 1. So, the table now looks like this:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         |    ?       |    ?       |
| Music-Genre   |    ?       |    ?       |
| Sport         |  Basketball|    ?       |

From clue 4, the fan of metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. This means if someone has fishing as their hobby, the person to their right must be the one who likes metal. Since the person with basketball is in position 1, the person in position 2 cannot have fishing as their hobby because there would be no one to their left for the fan of metal. Therefore, the person in position 2 must have singing as their hobby and metal as their music genre. So, the table now looks like this:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         |  Fishing   |  Singing   |
| Music-Genre   |  Trance    |  Metal     |
| Sport         |  Basketball|  Water-polo|

Now, let's verify all the clues:
1. The fan of metal (position 2) is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing (position 1).
2. The person who's sport is basketball (position 1) is in an odd position.

Both clues are satisfied. Therefore, the final solution table is:

```

Lv4-3x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the table step by step.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the accountant.
2. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing.
3. The person eating pepper is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the accountant.
   - This means if someone's sport is skiing, the accountant must be on their right.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing.
   - This means the person with sailing can either be directly next to the person with skiing or on one side of the person with skiing.

3. **Clue 3**: The person eating pepper is in an even position.
   - This means the person eating pepper can only be in position 2 (since there are only two positions).

Given that the person eating pepper is in position 2, we need to determine what they are eating and their job and sport.

### Positioning Based on Clues:
- Since the person eating pepper is in position 2, the person in position 1 must be eating the other type of food, which is radish.
- Let's denote the person in position 1 as \( P_1 \) and the person in position 2 as \( P_2 \).

### Applying Clue 1:
- If \( P_1 \) is eating radish, then \( P_2 \) must be eating pepper.
- According to Clue 1, the person with skiing cannot be in position 2 because the accountant would need to be on their right, but position 2 is already taken by the person with pepper. Therefore, the person with skiing must be in position 1.

### Applying Clue 2:
- Since the person with skiing is in position 1, the person with sailing must be either directly next to them or on one side of them.
- Given that the person with sailing is not in position 2 (because it's occupied by the person with pepper), the person with sailing must be in position 3.

### Determining Jobs and Sports:
- We know the person with skiing is in position 1, so the person with sailing must be in position 3.
- The person in position 2 (with pepper) could be either an accountant or a dancer. However, since the person with skiing is on the left of the accountant (Clue 1), the person with skiing cannot be the accountant. Therefore, the person with skiing must be the dancer, and the person with sailing must be the accountant.

### Final Table:
```plaintext
|         |   1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food    | Radish | Pepper     |        |
| Job     | Dancer | Accountant |        |
| Sport   | Skiing |            | Sailing|
```

### Conclusion:
The final solution table is as follows:

```plaintext
|         |   1    |     2      |   3    |

Lv4-3x2-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
1. There are two different types of food: blueberry, pumpkin.
2. There are two different types of sports: surfing, volleyball.
3. There are two different means of transport: bike, helicopter.
4. The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing.
5. The person eating pumpkin is in an odd position (position 1).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of Pumpkin Eater**:
   - According to clue 5, the person eating pumpkin is in position 1.
   - Therefore, position 1 must be filled with ""pumpkin"".

2. **Position of Helicopter Driver**:
   - According to clue 4, the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing.
   - Since position 1 is occupied by ""pumpkin"", the person in position 2 cannot be the one driving the helicopter (because there would be no room for someone else to be on the right).
   - Thus, the person in position 2 must be the one driving the helicopter.

3. **Sport and Food Assignment**:
   - Position 1 (pumpkin) must have a sport other than surfing because the person with the sport of surfing is to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
   - Therefore, the person in position 1 must have the sport of volleyball.
   - This leaves the sport of surfing for position 2.
   - Position 2 must have the food of blueberry because it is the only remaining option.

4. **Transport Assignment**:
   - Position 2 (helicopter) must have the transport mode of helicopter.
   - Position 1 must have the transport mode of bike (since it's the only remaining option).

We have:
- Two hobbies: baking, woodworking
- Two jobs: bartender, scientist
- Two music genres: classical, r&b

And we know:
1. The scientist is to the right of the fan of r&b.
2. The person who's hobby is baking is in an even position (position 2).

| Hobby         | woodworking | baking    |
| Job           | scientist   | bartender |
| Music-Genre   | classical   | r&b       |

### Explanation:

1. **Position 2 for Baking**: This means the person with the hobby of baking is in position 2.
2. **Scientist to the Right of R&B**: Since the person with the hobby of baking (who is in position 2) prefers r&b, the scientist must be in position 1 because they need to be to the right of the r&b preference.
3. **Jobs and Hobbies Match**:
   - Position 1: Scientist, so the job is scientist.
   - Position 2: Baking, so the job is bartender.
4. **Music Genres Match**:
   - Position 1: Scientist, so the music genre is classical (since they are to the right of the r&b preference).
   - Position 2: Baking, so the music genre is r&b.

### Given Information:
1. There are two different beverages: 7up and almond-milk.
2. There are two different types of food: kale and kiwi.
3. There are two different hobbies: filmmaking and singing.
4. The person with the hobby of singing is on the right of the person eating kiwi.
5. The person drinking 7up is in an even position (i.e., position 2).

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Position of the Person Drinking 7up**:
   - Since the person drinking 7up is in an even position, they must be in position 2.
   
2. **Hobby of the Person in Position 2**:
   - We need to determine if the person in position 2 has the hobby of singing or filmmaking. Let's assume the person in position 2 has the hobby of singing for now and check for consistency.

3. **Person Eating Kiwi**:
   - According to clue 4, the person with the hobby of singing is on the right of the person eating kiwi. If the person in position 2 has the hobby of singing, then the person eating kiwi must be in position 1.

4. **Beverage of the Person Eating Kiwi**:
   - Since the person in position 2 is drinking 7up (from clue 5), the person in position 1 cannot be drinking 7up. Therefore, the person in position 1 must be drinking almond-milk.

5. **Hobby of the Person Eating Kale**:
   - The remaining hobby (filmmaking) must belong to the person in position 1 because the person in position 2 already has the hobby of singing.

6. **Beverage and Food Assignments**:
   - We now have:
     - Position 1: Drinking almond-milk, eating kale, and has the hobby of filmmaking.
     - Position 2: Drinking 7up, and has the hobby of singing.
   
7. **Remaining Beverage and Food**:
   - The only remaining beverage is almond-milk, which is already assigned to position 1.
   - The only remaining food is kiwi, which is already assigned to position 1.
   - Therefore, the remaining person (position 2) must be drinking 7up and eating kiwi.
