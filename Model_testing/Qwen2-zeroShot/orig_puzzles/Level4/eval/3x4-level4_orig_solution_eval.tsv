Lv4-3x4-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step to find the correct arrangement:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The person driving the airplane is the person who's hobby is writing.**
   - Writing → Airplane

2. **The person driving the bus is on the left of the person watching drama movies.**
   - If the person watching drama movies is in position 2, then the person driving the bus must be in position 1.
   - If the person watching drama movies is in position 3, then the person driving the bus must be in position 2.
   - If the person watching drama movies is in position 4, then the person driving the bus must be in position 3.

3. **The person who's hobby is writing is in an odd position (1 or 3).**
   - From step 1, we know that the person with the hobby of writing is in an odd position.
   - Therefore, the person driving the airplane (and thus the person with the hobby of writing) must be in position 1 or 3.

4. **The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person driving the ship.**
   - This means the person driving the boat and the person driving the ship cannot be in adjacent positions.

5. **The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of hiking and the person watching martial-arts movies cannot be in adjacent positions.

6. **The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.**
   - The person driving the ship must be in a position before the person with the hobby of skydiving.

7. **The person driving the boat is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the person driving the boat must be in position 1 or 4.

8. **The person driving the ship is between the person watching satire movies and the person who's hobby is hiking.**
   - This means the person driving the ship must be in position 2, with the person watching satire movies and the person with the hobby of hiking on either side.

### Combining Information:

From steps 2 and 7, the person driving the boat must be in position 1 or 4. Since the person driving the boat cannot be in the same position as the person watching drama movies (step 2), and considering the person with the hobby of writing is in an odd position (step 3), let's assume:
- Position 1: Boat
- Position 4: Ship

This satisfies the conditions for both steps 2 and 7.

Now, from step 8, the person driving the ship (position 4) is between the person watching satire movies and the person with the hobby of hiking. So, the person with the hobby of hiking must be in position 2 or 3.

Since the person driving the bus is on the left of the person watching drama movies (step 2), and the person with the hobby of writing is in an odd position (step 3), the person with the hobby of writing must be in position 1 (airplane).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Writing (Airplane)
- Position 2: Hiking
- Position 3: Satire
- Position 4: Skydiving (Ship)

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:

- The person watching drama movies must be in position 3 (since the person driving the bus is on the left of the person watching drama movies, and the person with the hobby of writing is in position 1).
- The person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 2 (since the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 2 and they cannot be adjacent).

Finally, we can assign the movie genres and means of transport:

- Position 1: Writing (Airplane) → Crime (since it's not drama, martial-arts, or satire)
- Position 2: Hiking (Drama)
- Position 3: Satire (Martial-Arts)
- Position 4: Skydiving (Ship) → Satire (since it's not crime, drama, or martial-arts)

Lv4-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is Sudoku.
2. The person whose hobby is video-games is Mexican.
3. The person whose hobby is Sudoku is in an even position (2 or 4).
4. The person driving the airplane is on the far right.
5. The person driving the taxi is on the far left.
6. The person whose hobby is singing is on the left of the Japanese.
7. The American is between the person whose hobby is video-games and the person whose hobby is singing.
8. The Polish is between the Japanese and the person whose hobby is Sudoku.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person driving the airplane is on the far right.
   - This means the person in position 4 drives the airplane.

2. **Clue 5**: The person driving the taxi is on the far left.
   - This means the person in position 1 drives the taxi.

3. **Clue 2**: The person whose hobby is video-games is Mexican.
   - Since the Mexican is in position 2 (as per Clue 6), the person in position 2 has the hobby of video-games.

4. **Clue 3**: The person whose hobby is Sudoku is in an even position (2 or 4).
   - We already know the person in position 2 has video-games, so the person in position 4 must have Sudoku.

5. **Clue 8**: The Polish is between the Japanese and the person whose hobby is Sudoku.
   - Since the person with Sudoku is in position 4, the Polish person must be in position 3.

6. **Clue 7**: The American is between the person whose hobby is video-games and the person whose hobby is singing.
   - The person in position 2 has video-games (Mexican) and the person in position 4 has Sudoku (Polish). Therefore, the American must be in position 3 (which is already occupied by Polish).

   Let's correct this: The American must be in position 2 since the Polish is in position 3 and the Mexican is in position 2, leaving the American to be in position 1 (since the person in position 1 drives the taxi).

7. **Clue 6**: The person whose hobby is singing is on the left of the Japanese.
   - With the American in position 1 and the Mexican in position 2, the only positions left for the Japanese and the person with singing are 3 and 4. Since the Polish is in position 3, the Japanese must be in position 4, and the person with singing must be in position 3.

8. **Clue 1**: The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is Sudoku.
   - Since the person with Sudoku is in position 4, the person driving the boat could be in position 3 or 1. But we already know the taxi driver is in position 1, so the boat driver must be in position 3 (which is the Polish).

9. **Assigning Hobbies**:
   - Position 1 (Taxi): Not Polish (boat), not American (between video-games and singing), must be Japanese.
   - Position 2 (Video-Games): Mexican.
   - Position 3 (Singing): American.
   - Position 4 (Sudoku): Polish.

10. **Final Table**:
```
|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |    4     |

Lv4-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The German is between the person eating grapefruit and the person eating tomato.**
   - This means the positions for the German, grapefruit, and tomato must be consecutive.
   
2. **The Argentine is the person driving the train.**
   - So, position 4 (Transport) is ""train"" and Nationality is ""Argentine"".
   
3. **The person driving the motorbike is the person eating lemon.**
   - So, the position for ""motorbike"" (Transport) is the same as the position for ""lemon"" (Food).
   
4. **The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person eating tomato.**
   - Since the person eating lemon is to the right of the person eating tomato, and the person eating lemon is driving the motorbike, the person eating tomato cannot be in position 4.
   
5. **The person eating tomato is in an odd position.**
   - Therefore, the person eating tomato can only be in position 1 or 3.
   
6. **The Canadian is between the person eating kiwi and the American.**
   - This means the positions for the Canadian, kiwi, and American must be consecutive.
   
7. **The German is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.**
   - The German cannot be in position 4 (since the person driving the snowmobile must be to the right of the German).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 4 (Transport): Train (Argentine)**
   - Nationality: Argentine
   - Food: Not relevant yet
   - Transport: Train

2. **Position 3 (Food): Lemon (Motorbike)**
   - Nationality: Not relevant yet
   - Food: Lemon
   - Transport: Motorbike

3. **Position 1 (Food): Tomato (Odd Position)**
   - Nationality: Not relevant yet
   - Food: Tomato
   - Transport: Not relevant yet

4. **Position 2 (Food): Grapefruit or Kiwi**
   - Nationality: Not relevant yet
   - Food: Grapefruit or Kiwi
   - Transport: Not relevant yet

5. **German between Grapefruit and Tomato:**
   - Since Tomato is in position 1, German must be in position 2 or 3.
   - But since position 3 is already taken by Lemon, German must be in position 2.
   - So, position 2 (Food): Grapefruit
   - Position 3 (Food): Tomato

6. **Canadian between Kiwi and American:**
   - Since Tomato is in position 1 and Grapefruit is in position 2, the only remaining positions for Canadian, Kiwi, and American are 1, 2, and 3.
   - But we already have Tomato and Grapefruit in those positions.
   - Therefore, the Canadian must be in position 3 (already taken), so the Canadian must be in position 4 (right of the German).
   - So, position 4 (Nationality): Canadian
   - Position 4 (Food): Kiwi

7. **German on the left of the person driving the snowmobile:**
   - Since German is in position 2, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 3 (but it's already taken by Canadian and Kiwi).
   - Therefore, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 4, which is the Canadian.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4     |

| Nationality   | American   | German    | Canadian  | Argentine |
| Transport     | Roller     | Motorbike | Snowmobile| Train     |
```

### Explanation:
- **Position 1:** Tomato (odd position)
- **Position 2:** Grapefruit (between German and Tomato)
- **Position 3:** Kiwi (between Canadian and American)
- **Position 4:** Argentine (driving the train)

- **German is in position 2, so he is not driving the snowmobile but is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (Canadian in position 4).**

This satisfies all the given conditions."	{'food': ['tomato', 'grapefruit', 'kiwi', 'kiwi'], 'nationality': ['american', 'german', 'canadian', 'argentine'], 'transport': ['roller', 'motorbike', 'snowmobile', 'train']}	True	3	False

5. The fan of soul is the person who's sport is badminton.
6. The person watching horror movies is the fan of pop.
7. The fan of salsa is the person watching crime movies.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The fan of soul is the person who's sport is badminton.
   - This means the person in position 1 or 3 is the fan of soul and their sport is badminton.

2. **Clue 1**: The fan of soul is in an even position (position 2 or 4).
   - From Clue 5, we know that the fan of soul plays badminton, so the fan of soul must be in position 2.

3. **Clue 5** and **Clue 1**: Since the fan of soul is in position 2 and their sport is badminton, the person in position 2 is the fan of soul and plays badminton.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
   - Since the person in position 2 is playing badminton, the person in position 3 must be playing water-polo.

5. **Clue 6**: The person watching horror movies is the fan of pop.
   - The person watching horror movies must be in position 3 or 4. Given that the person in position 3 is playing water-polo, the person in position 4 must be watching horror movies and is the fan of pop.

6. **Clue 4**: The fan of punk is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies.
   - Since the person in position 4 is the fan of pop and watching horror movies, the fan of punk must be in position 3.

7. **Clue 7**: The fan of salsa is the person watching crime movies.
   - The person watching crime movies must be in position 1 or 2. Given that the person in position 2 is the fan of soul, the person in position 1 must be the fan of salsa and watching crime movies.

8. **Clue 2**: The person watching disaster movies is the person who's sport is rowing.
   - The person watching disaster movies must be in position 1 or 4. Given that the person in position 1 is the fan of salsa and watching crime movies, and the person in position 4 is the fan of pop and watching horror movies, the person in position 1 cannot be watching disaster movies. Therefore, the person in position 4 (the fan of pop) must be watching disaster movies and playing rowing.

9. **Clue 6**: The person watching horror movies is the fan of pop.
   - This confirms the fan of pop is in position 4.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The Japanese is the person who's sport is volleyball.**
   - Japanese -> Volleyball

2. **The Colombian is in an odd position (1 or 3).**
   - Colombian -> Position 1 or 3

3. **The person driving the bus is the person who's sport is volleyball.**
   - Volleyball -> Bus

4. **The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.**
   - Helicopter -> Position 1 or 2 (since Volleyball is either 1 or 3)

5. **The person driving the bus is in an even position (2 or 4).**
   - Bus -> Position 2 or 4 (but we know Volleyball is either 1 or 3, so it can't be 2 or 4)

6. **The person who's sport is rugby is on the far left.**
   - Rugby -> Position 1

7. **The Canadian is on the far right.**
   - Canadian -> Position 4

8. **The Colombian is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski.**
   - If Colombian is in position 1, then jet-ski must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If Colombian is in position 3, then jet-ski must be in position 2 or 4.

9. **The person who's sport is golf is in an odd position (1 or 3).**
   - Golf -> Position 1 or 3 (but Rugby is already in Position 1)

Given these constraints, let's assign the positions:

- Position 1: Rugby (given)
- Position 2: Bus (given, and it fits with the constraint that it's an even position)
- Position 3: Golf (must be odd, and not 1)
- Position 4: Canadian (given)

Now, let's place the sports and nationalities:

- Position 1: Rugby (Canadian)
- Position 2: Bus (Japanese, since Japanese plays volleyball)
- Position 3: Golf (Colombian, since it's odd and not 1)
- Position 4: Volleyball (Colombian, but since Colombian is in 3, it must be Japanese)

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rugby (Canadian)
- Position 2: Bus (Japanese)
- Position 3: Golf (Colombian)
- Position 4: Volleyball (Japanese)

### Final Table:

```

Lv4-3x4-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The owner of the guinea-pig is the person watching comedy movies.
2. **Clue 2**: The owner of the goat is between the person watching time-travel movies and the owner of the chinchilla.
3. **Clue 3**: The person watching time-travel movies is the person drinking hot-chocolate.
4. **Clue 4**: The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking 7up is in an even position.
6. **Clue 6**: The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person drinking tea.
7. **Clue 7**: The person watching comedy movies is the person drinking 7up.
8. **Clue 8**: The owner of the guinea-pig is on the far left or far right.

From Clues 1 and 7, we can deduce:
- The owner of the guinea-pig drinks 7up and watches comedy movies.
- Since 7up is in an even position (Clue 5), the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 2 or 4.

Since the owner of the guinea-pig is on the far left or far right (Clue 8), and they are in position 2 or 4, we have two possibilities:
- Position 2: Guinea-pig, 7up, Comedy
- Position 4: Guinea-pig, 7up, Comedy

Let's assume Position 2 for now and see if it fits all clues.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

**Position 2:**
- **Beverage**: 7up
- **Movie-Genre**: Comedy
- **Pet**: Guinea-pig

**Position 1:**
- **Beverage**: ?
- **Movie-Genre**: ?
- **Pet**: ?

**Position 3:**
- **Beverage**: ?
- **Movie-Genre**: ?
- **Pet**: ?

**Position 4:**
- **Beverage**: ?
- **Movie-Genre**: ?
- **Pet**: ?

From Clue 3:
- The person drinking hot-chocolate watches time-travel movies.
- Therefore, Position 4 must be the person drinking hot-chocolate and watching time-travel movies.

So, Position 4:
- **Beverage**: Hot-chocolate
- **Movie-Genre**: Time-travel
- **Pet**: ?

From Clue 6:
- The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person drinking tea.
- Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in Position 3.

So, Position 3:
- **Beverage**: Tea
- **Movie-Genre**: ?
- **Pet**: ?

From Clue 4:
- The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
- Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in Position 4, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in Position 1 or 3.

Since Position 3 is already taken by the person drinking tea, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in Position 1.

So, Position 1:
- **Beverage**: Lemonade
- **Movie-Genre**: Martial-arts
- **Pet**: ?

From Clue 2:
- The owner of the goat is between the person watching time-travel movies and the owner of the chinchilla.
- Since the person watching time-travel movies is in Position 4, the owner of the goat must be in Position 3, and the owner of the chinchilla must be in Position 1.

So, Position 1:
- **Beverage**: Lemonade
- **Movie-Genre**: Martial-arts
- **Pet**: Chinchilla

Position 3:
- **Beverage**: Tea
- **Movie-Genre**: Satire
- **Pet**: Goat

Now we have:
- Position 1: Lemonade, Martial-arts, Chinchilla
- Position 2: 7up, Comedy, Guinea-pig
- Position 3: Tea, Satire, Goat
- Position 4: Hot-chocolate, Time-travel, Horse

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-3x4-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **House fan is on the left or right of the electronic fan.**
2. **Scientist has chess as a hobby.**
3. **Social-worker has drawing as a hobby.**
4. **Drawing hobbyist is to the right of the electronic fan.**
5. **Disco fan is between the journalist and the chess hobbyist.**
6. **House fan is on the left or right of the scientist.**
7. **Chess hobbyist is in an even position.**
8. **Chess hobbyist is between the collecting hobbyist and the drawing hobbyist.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Positions for Scientist and Social-Worker
- From clue 2: Scientist has chess as a hobby.
- From clue 7: Chess hobbyist is in an even position (2 or 4).
- From clue 8: Chess hobbyist is between the collecting hobbyist and the drawing hobbyist.

Since the chess hobbyist must be in an even position and there are only two even positions (2 and 4), let's consider both possibilities:

**Case 1: Chess hobbyist is at position 2**
- Drawing hobbyist must be at position 4 (since it's to the right of the electronic fan and the chess hobbyist is in position 2).
- Collecting hobbyist must be at position 1 (since the chess hobbyist is between the collecting hobbyist and the drawing hobbyist).

This would mean the scientist is at position 4 (since the chess hobbyist is at position 2).

**Case 2: Chess hobbyist is at position 4**
- Drawing hobbyist must be at position 3 (since it's to the right of the electronic fan and the chess hobbyist is in position 4).
- Collecting hobbyist must be at position 2 (since the chess hobbyist is between the collecting hobbyist and the drawing hobbyist).

This would mean the scientist is at position 2 (since the chess hobbyist is at position 4).

Given that the scientist must also fit with the other constraints, let's test Case 1 first.

#### Step 2: Fill in Known Information for Case 1
- Position 1: Collecting hobbyist
- Position 2: Scientist (chess hobbyist)
- Position 3: Drawing hobbyist
- Position 4: Social-worker (drawing hobbyist)

#### Step 3: Determine Jobs and Music Genres
- The scientist is at position 2, so they can't be the journalist or the social-worker.
- The drawing hobbyist is at position 3, so they can't be the chess hobbyist.
- The social-worker is at position 4, so they can't be the chess hobbyist or the collecting hobbyist.

From clue 5: Disco fan is between the journalist and the chess hobbyist.
- The chess hobbyist is at position 2, so the journalist must be at position 1 (collecting hobbyist) or 3 (drawing hobbyist).

Since the drawing hobbyist is at position 3, the journalist must be at position 1 (collecting hobbyist).

From clue 6: House fan is on the left or right of the scientist.
- The scientist is at position 2, so the house fan must be at position 1 or 3.

From clue 1: House fan is on the left or right of the electronic fan.
- If the house fan is at position 1, the electronic fan must be at position 2 or 3.
- If the house fan is at position 3, the electronic fan must be at position 1 or 2.

Since the scientist is at position 2, the house fan cannot be at position 2. So, the house fan must be at position 1 or 3.

If the house fan is at position 1, then the electronic fan must be at position 2 or 3.
- But since the scientist is at position 2, the electronic fan must be at position 3.
- This means the house fan is at position 1.

So, the house fan is at position 1, the electronic fan is at position 3, and the scientist is at position 2.

#### Step 4: Determine Music Genres
- The journalist (position 1) must like electronic music (since the journalist is between the house fan and the chess hobbyist, and the chess hobbyist likes electronic music).
- The scientist (position 2) must like country music (since the scientist is the chess hobbyist).
- The drawing hobbyist (position 3) must like house music (since the drawing hobbyist is next to the house fan).
- The social-worker (position 4) must like disco music (since the social-worker is the drawing hobbyist).

Lv4-3x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and deduce the correct positions step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The entrepreneur is in an odd position (1 or 3).**
2. **The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the entrepreneur (2 or 4).**
3. **The person drinking water is on the left or right of the entrepreneur (2 or 4).**
4. **The person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person drinking coffee.**
5. **The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing.**
6. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the entrepreneur.**
7. **The entrepreneur is on the right of the person drinking coffee.**
8. **The manager is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.**
9. **The social-worker is in an odd position (1 or 3).**

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **From Clue 1 and Clue 7:**
   - The entrepreneur must be in position 3 because if they were in position 1, they would need to be on the right of the person drinking coffee, which is not possible since the person drinking coffee must be in position 2 or 4.
   - So, the entrepreneur is in position 3.

2. **From Clue 2 and Clue 7:**
   - Since the entrepreneur is in position 3, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2 (as the entrepreneur is on the right of the person drinking coffee).

3. **From Clue 3:**
   - The person drinking water can only be in position 2 or 4. Since position 2 is already taken by the person drinking coffee, the person drinking water must be in position 4.

4. **From Clue 4:**
   - The person who's sport is rugby must be on the left of the person drinking coffee. Since the person drinking coffee is in position 2, the person with rugby as their sport must be in position 1.

5. **From Clue 6:**
   - The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is in position 3, the person with weightlifting as their sport must be in position 4. But we already know that position 4 is occupied by the person drinking water. Therefore, this means there's a contradiction unless we reassess. Given our current placements, the only logical fit for weightlifting is still position 4, but we need to check other constraints.

6. **From Clue 5:**
   - The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing. We don't know the exact positions yet, but this will help us place the remaining elements.

7. **From Clue 8:**
   - The manager is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position 1 (because the entrepreneur is in position 3 and the person drinking coffee is in position 2), it must be in position 4. But position 4 is occupied by the person drinking water. Thus, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3, and the manager must be in position 1.

8. **From Clue 9:**
   - The social-worker is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since position 3 is already taken by the entrepreneur, the social-worker must be in position 1.

9. **Reassessing Clue 5:**
   - With the social-worker in position 1, the person with skiing as their sport must be in position 2 (since the person drinking coffee is in position 2 and the person drinking water is in position 4).

10. **Final Adjustments:**
    - Position 1: Social-worker
    - Position 2: Person with skiing and drinking coffee
    - Position 3: Entrepreneur
    - Position 4: Person with weightlifting and drinking water

Lv4-3x4-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis

1. **The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the fan of indie**.
2. **The Canadian is on the far left or far right**.
3. **The owner of the horse is on the right of the fan of electronic**.
4. **The Nigerian is between the fan of electronic and the fan of country**.
5. **The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the fan of electronic**.
6. **The owner of the mouse is the fan of indie**.
7. **The Turkish is on the far right**.
8. **The fan of country is in an odd position**.
9. **The Malaysian is between the fan of punk and the fan of indie**.
10. **The owner of the lizard is on the far left**.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Clue 10**: The owner of the lizard is on the far left. Therefore, the lizard is in position 1.
   - Lizard: 1

2. **Clue 7**: The Turkish is on the far right. Therefore, the Turkish is in position 4.
   - Turkish: 4

3. **Clue 2**: The Canadian is on the far left or far right. Since the far left is taken by the lizard, the Canadian must be on the far right (position 4). However, since the Turkish is already in position 4, this means the Canadian must be on the far left (position 1).
   - Canadian: 1

4. **Clue 10**: Reaffirming that the owner of the lizard is on the far left, so the lizard is in position 1.

5. **Clue 8**: The fan of country is in an odd position. Given that positions 1 and 3 are occupied, the only possible position for the fan of country is 3.
   - Country: 3

6. **Clue 4**: The Nigerian is between the fan of electronic and the fan of country. Since the fan of country is in position 3, the Nigerian must be in position 2.
   - Nigerian: 2

7. **Clue 3**: The owner of the horse is on the right of the fan of electronic. The fan of country is in position 3, so the fan of electronic must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is taken by the lizard, and position 2 is taken by the Nigerian. So, the fan of electronic must be in position 4, and the owner of the horse must be in position 3.
   - Electronic: 4
   - Horse: 3

8. **Clue 6**: The owner of the mouse is the fan of indie. The only remaining position for the fan of indie is 2, but it is already taken by the Nigerian. This means the owner of the mouse must be in position 4, and the fan of indie must be in position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is taken by the lizard and position 3 is taken by the fan of country, the fan of indie must be in position 2.
   - Indie: 2
   - Mouse: 2

9. **Clue 5**: The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the fan of electronic. We have already determined the fan of electronic is in position 4, and the owner of the mouse is in position 2.
   - Mouse: 2

10. **Clue 9**: The Malaysian is between the fan of punk and the fan of indie. Since the fan of indie is in position 2, the Malaysian must be in position 3, and the fan of punk must be in position 4. But position 4 is already taken by the Turkish, so the Malaysian must be in position 3, and the fan of punk must be in position 1.
    - Punk: 1
    - Malaysian: 3
