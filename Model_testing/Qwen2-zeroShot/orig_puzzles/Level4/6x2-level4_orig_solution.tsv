Lv4-6x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

1. **The person whose hobby is singing is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.**
   - This means the person with the hobby ""singing"" is in position 1, and the person with the pet ""goldfish"" is in position 2.

2. **The fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of disco.**
   - This means the person who likes hip-hop is in position 2, and the person who likes disco is in position 1.

3. **The person drinking Fanta is the person eating plum.**
   - This means the beverage ""Fanta"" and the food ""plum"" are for the same person.

4. **The person drinking Sprite is in an even position.**
   - This means the person who drinks Sprite is either in position 2 or 4.

5. **The social-worker is the person who's hobby is photography.**
   - This means the job ""social-worker"" and the hobby ""photography"" are for the same person.

From these clues, we can start filling in the table:

|               |    1    |       2       |

| Music-Genre   | Disco   | Hip-hop       |
| Pet           | Goldfish | Horse        |

Now, let's use the remaining information to fill in the rest:

- From clue 3, the person drinking Fanta is eating plum. Since the person eating plum is in position 1, the person drinking Fanta must be in position 2.
- From clue 4, the person drinking Sprite is in an even position, which is already taken by the person drinking Sprite in position 2. Therefore, the person drinking Sprite must be in position 4.

So, the final table looks like this:

|               |    1    |       2       |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Beverage      |   Sprite|   Fanta       |

Lv4-6x2-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The Polish person is on the right of the person eating asparagus.
2. The person eating broccoli is on the left or right of the fan of rock.
3. The person drinking juice is in an odd position.
4. The person eating broccoli has the hobby of writing.
5. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the fish.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions for the Polish person and the person eating asparagus.
From clue 1, we know that the Polish person is on the right of the person eating asparagus. This means if the Polish person is in position 2, the person eating asparagus must be in position 1. If the Polish person is in position 1, the person eating asparagus must be in position 2.

Let's assume:
- Position 1: Asparagus (we will test both scenarios later)
- Position 2: Polish

#### Step 2: Determine the positions for the person eating broccoli and the fan of rock.
From clue 2, the person eating broccoli is on the left or right of the fan of rock. Since we already placed the Polish person in position 2, let's consider the possibilities for the person eating broccoli and the fan of rock.

Let's assume:
- Position 1: Asparagus
- Position 2: Polish

This means the person eating broccoli can be in position 3 or 4, and the fan of rock can be in position 2, 3, or 4.

#### Step 3: Determine the positions for the person drinking juice.
From clue 3, the person drinking juice is in an odd position. Therefore, the person drinking juice can only be in position 1 or 3.

Since position 1 is already taken by asparagus, the person drinking juice must be in position 3.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Asparagus
- Position 2: Polish
- Position 3: Juice

#### Step 4: Determine the positions for the person eating broccoli and the fan of rock.
From clue 4, the person eating broccoli has the hobby of writing. The remaining positions for the person eating broccoli and the fan of rock are 4 and 5.

If the person eating broccoli is in position 4, then the fan of rock must be in position 5.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Asparagus
- Position 2: Polish
- Position 3: Juice
- Position 4: Broccoli
- Position 5: Rock

#### Step 5: Determine the positions for the pet owners.
From clue 5, the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the fish. We know the pet in position 2 is goldfish, so the fish must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Fish
- Position 2: Goldfish
- Position 3: Juice
- Position 4: Broccoli
- Position 5: Rock

#### Step 6: Determine the remaining hobbies and nationalities.
We need to assign the remaining hobbies and nationalities. The remaining hobbies are video-games and writing, and the remaining nationalities are Dutch and Polish.

Since the Polish person is in position 2 and the person eating broccoli is in position 4, the person with the hobby of writing must be in position 4 (broccoli), and the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 5 (rock).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Fish
- Position 2: Polish
- Position 3: Juice
- Position 4: Broccoli (writing)
- Position 5: Rock (video-games)

Finally, the Dutch person must be in position 1 (Fish) because the Polish person is in position 2.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      |       Fish  |          |
| Food          |       Aspar |          |
| Hobby         |       Write | Video-Gam|
| Music-Genre   |             |          |
| Nationality   |       Dutch | Polish   |
| Pet           |       Fish  |  Gold    |
```

This configuration satisfies all the given clues."

3. **Job and Movie-Genre:**
   - From Clue 3, the person watching zombie movies is on the right of the accountant. This means the accountant cannot be in position 2 (since the person with ""video-games"" is in position 2). Therefore, the accountant must be in position 1.

   - So, the person with the music genre ""jazz"" is in position 1.
   - Since the person with the music genre ""jazz"" is in position 1, the person driving the scooter must be in position 2.

| Transport     |                |            |

Now, let's consider the project-manager and the boat:
- The project-manager must be in position 1 because they are on the left of the person watching romance movies, and the person driving the boat is also in position 1.

So, the project-manager is in position 1 and the person watching romance movies is in position 2.

| Transport     | boat           |            |

Now, considering the Australian and the person eating broccoli:
- The Australian is either to the left or right of the person eating broccoli.
- Since the person eating broccoli is in position 2, the Australian can only be in position 1 (left) or 2 (right).

Given the project-manager is in position 1, the Australian cannot be there. Therefore, the Australian must be in position 2.

2. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person driving the car.
3. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left.
4. The fan of dubstep is on the left of the dutch.
5. The owner of the lizard is in an odd position (i.e., position 1 or 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1 (Leftmost) - Water-polo** (Clue 3)
2. **Position 2 - ?**
3. **Position 3 - ?**
4. **Position 4 - Ship (Clue 2)** (The person driving the ship is to the right of the person driving the car)
5. **Position 5 - Car (Clue 1)** (The person driving the car has the hobby of video-games)

From Clue 5, the owner of the lizard must be in an odd position, which means either Position 1 or Position 3. Since Position 1 is already taken by Water-polo, the owner of the lizard must be in Position 3.

So far, we have:
```
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Hobby         | Water-polo  |             |
| Music-Genre   |             |               |
| Nationality   |             |               |
| Pet           |             | Lizard        |
| Sport         |             |               |
| Transport     |             | Ship          |
```

From Clue 4, the fan of dubstep is on the left of the dutch. This means the fan of dubstep must be in Position 2, and the dutch must be in Position 4.

So far, we have:
```
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Hobby         | Water-polo  |             |
| Music-Genre   |             | Dubstep       |
| Nationality   |             | Dutch         |
| Pet           |             | Lizard        |
| Sport         |             |               |
| Transport     |             | Ship          |
```

Since the person with the hobby of video-games drives the car, and the person driving the car is in Position 5, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in Position 2.

So far, we have:
```
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Hobby         | Water-polo  | Magic-tricks  |
| Music-Genre   |             | Dubstep       |
| Nationality   |             | Dutch         |
| Pet           |             | Lizard        |
| Sport         |             |               |
| Transport     |             | Ship          |
```

Now, the only pet left for Position 1 is the turtle, and the only nationality left for Position 1 is Brazilian.

So, we have:
```
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Hobby         | Water-polo  | Magic-tricks  |
| Music-Genre   |             | Dubstep       |
| Nationality   | Brazilian   | Dutch         |
| Pet           | Turtle      | Lizard        |
| Sport         |             |               |
| Transport     |             | Ship          |
```

Finally, the only sport left for Position 2 is skateboarding.

So, the final solution is:
```
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Hobby         | Water-polo  | Magic-tricks  |

Lv4-6x2-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Lizard Owner**: The owner of the lizard is in an even position (2).
2. **Hobby Location**: The person who's hobby is hiking is in an odd position (1).
3. **Skateboard vs Martial-Arts**: The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
4. **Avocado vs Metal**: The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the fan of metal.
5. **Soul vs Martial-Arts**: The fan of soul is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies.

### Filling the Table:

Given the constraints:
- Lizard owner is at position 2.
- Hiking is at position 1.
- Skateboard is on the left of Martial-Arts.
- Avocado is next to Metal.
- Soul is next to Martial-Arts.

We can start by placing the known positions:

|               |     1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Food          |            |              |
| Hobby         | hiking     | lizard       |
| Movie-Genre   |            |              |
| Music-Genre   |            |              |
| Pet           |            | goat         |
| Transport     | skateboard | tram         |

From this, we know:
- Position 1: Hiking, Skateboard
- Position 2: Lizard, Tram

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

### Movie-Genre:
Since the skateboard person is on the left of the martial-arts movie person, and the skateboard is in position 1, the martial-arts movie must be in position 2.

|               |     1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Food          |            |              |
| Hobby         | hiking     | lizard       |
| Movie-Genre   |            | martial-arts |
| Music-Genre   |            |              |
| Pet           |            | goat         |
| Transport     | skateboard | tram         |

### Music-Genre:
The person who prefers soul is next to the person who watches martial-arts. Since martial-arts is in position 2, soul must be in position 1.

|               |     1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Food          |            |              |
| Hobby         | hiking     | lizard       |
| Movie-Genre   | soul       | martial-arts |
| Music-Genre   |            |              |
| Pet           |            | goat         |
| Transport     | skateboard | tram         |

### Food:
The person eating avocado is next to the person who listens to metal. Since the only positions left for food are 1 and 2, and one of them must be next to the metal listener, we need to determine which is which.

If we assume the person in position 1 eats avocado, then the person in position 2 listens to metal. This fits the constraint that the avocado eater is next to the metal listener.

|               |     1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Food          | avocado    | strawberry   |
| Hobby         | hiking     | lizard       |
| Movie-Genre   | soul       | martial-arts |
| Music-Genre   | metal      | soul         |
| Pet           |            | goat         |
| Transport     | skateboard | tram         |

### Pet:
The pet owner in position 2 is the goat, so the pet owner in position 1 must be the lizard.

|               |     1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Food          | avocado    | strawberry   |
| Hobby         | hiking     | lizard       |
| Movie-Genre   | soul       | martial-arts |
| Music-Genre   | metal      | soul         |
| Pet           | goat       | lizard       |
| Transport     | skateboard | tram         |

This satisfies all the given constraints.

### Final Solution:

```
|               |     1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Food          | avocado    | strawberry   |
| Hobby         | hiking     | lizard       |
| Movie-Genre   | soul       | martial-arts |
| Music-Genre   | metal      | soul         |
| Pet           | goat       | lizard       |
| Transport     | skateboard | tram         |

Lv4-6x2-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
**Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is skydiving is in an even position (i.e., position 2).

So, we can place ""skydiving"" in position 2:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |   chess    | skydiving |
| Music-Genre   |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |           |
| Pet           |            |           |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |
```

### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
**Clue 2:** The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the mouse.

Since ""skydiving"" is in position 2, ""ice-hockey"" must be in position 1. This also means that the owner of the mouse is in position 2.

```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |   chess    | skydiving |
| Music-Genre   |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |           |
| Pet           | ice-hockey | mouse     |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |
```

### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
**Clue 3:** The person driving the airplane is on the left of the thai.

This means the person driving the airplane is in position 1 and the thai is in position 2 for nationality or transport. Since ""skydiving"" is already in position 2, the thai cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the thai must be in position 1 for nationality or transport.

### Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
**Clue 4:** The fan of techno is the owner of the mouse.

Since the owner of the mouse is in position 2 (as determined from Clue 2), the fan of techno must also be in position 2.

```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |   chess    | skydiving |
| Music-Genre   |            | techno    |
| Nationality   |            |           |
| Pet           | ice-hockey | mouse     |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |
```

### Step 5: Determine the remaining positions
Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

- The fan of pop must be in position 1 because there are only two music genres.
- The person with chess as a hobby must be the thai (since they are not the owner of the mouse).
- The person with ice-hockey as a sport must be the thai (since the thai is in position 1).

```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |   thai     | skydiving |
| Music-Genre   |   pop      | techno    |
| Nationality   |            |           |
| Pet           | ice-hockey | mouse     |
| Sport         | surfing    |           |
| Transport     | airplane  |           |
```

### Step 6: Finalize the remaining details
- The person with surf as a sport must be the thai (since the thai is in position 1).
- The person with airplane as transport must be the thai (since the thai is in position 1).

Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |   thai     | skydiving |

| Sport         | surfing    |           |
| Transport     | airplane  |           |
```

Now, let's finalize the table with the missing details:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |   thai     | skydiving |

| Sport         | surfing    | chess     |
| Transport     | airplane  | bus       |
```

Here is the final solution:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |   thai     | skydiving |
