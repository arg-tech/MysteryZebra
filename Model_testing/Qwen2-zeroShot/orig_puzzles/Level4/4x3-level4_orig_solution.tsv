Lv4-4x3-1	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to solve the puzzle.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person eating pepper is between the person who's hobby is drawing and the person who's sport is baseball.**
   - This means that if we denote the positions as 1, 2, and 3, the order could be:
     - Drawing, Pepper, Baseball
     - Baseball, Pepper, Drawing

2. **The person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the person eating corn.**
   - This means the person eating corn can be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the person watching musical movies is either directly to the left or right of them.

3. **The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball.**
   - This means the order could be:
     - Baseball, Climbing
     - Climbing, Baseball (not possible since it must be strictly right)

4. **The person eating potato is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.**
   - This means the order could be:
     - Rock-climbing, Potato
     - Potato, Rock-climbing (not possible since it must be strictly right)

5. **The person eating pepper is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.**
   - This means the order could be:
     - Pepper, Scientific
     - Scientific, Pepper (not possible since it must be strictly left)

6. **The person who's hobby is drawing is in an odd position.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of drawing can only be in position 1 or 3.

### Solving the Puzzle:

Let's start by placing the person with the hobby of drawing in an odd position (position 1 or 3).

#### Case 1: Drawing is in position 1.
- Since drawing is in position 1, the person in position 2 cannot be drawing.
- From clue 1, if drawing is in position 1, then the order could be:
  - Drawing, Pepper, Baseball
  - Drawing, Baseball, Pepper

Let's test both possibilities:

1. **Drawing, Pepper, Baseball:**
   - From clue 5, the person eating pepper is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. So, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 3.
   - From clue 6, the person watching scientific movies must be in an even position, but here it is in position 3. This is not possible.

2. **Drawing, Baseball, Pepper:**
   - The person eating pepper is on the left of the person watching scientific movies, so the person watching scientific movies must be in position 3.
   - From clue 6, the person watching scientific movies must be in an even position, but here it is in position 3. This is not possible.

Since neither case works for drawing being in position 1, let's try drawing in position 3.

#### Case 2: Drawing is in position 3.
- From clue 6, the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 3.
- From clue 1, the person eating pepper must be between the person who's hobby is drawing and the person who's sport is baseball. Since drawing is in position 3, the order could be:
  - Baseball, Drawing, Pepper
  - Pepper, Drawing, Baseball

Let's test both possibilities:

1. **Baseball, Drawing, Pepper:**
   - From clue 5, the person eating pepper is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. So, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2.
   - From clue 3, the person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. So, the order must be:
     - Baseball, Climbing, Drawing, Pepper (not possible since there is no position 4)
   - The correct order should be:
     - Baseball, Climbing, Drawing, Pepper (not possible since there is no position 4)

2. **Pepper, Drawing, Baseball:**
   - From clue 5, the person eating pepper is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. So, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2.
   - From clue 3, the person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. So, the order must be:
     - Baseball, Climbing, Drawing, Pepper (not possible since there is no position 4)
   - The correct order should be:
     - Baseball, Climbing, Drawing, Pepper (not possible since there is no position 4)

Since neither case works for drawing being in position 3, let's re-evaluate the constraints.

Given the constraints and the need to fit all clues, we find that the correct placement is:

- **Corn** (position 1)
- **Drawing** (position 2)
- **Pepper** (position 3)
- **Baseball** (position 1)
- **Climbing** (position 2)
- **Surfing** (position 3)

This fits all the clues perfectly.

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-4x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person watching action movies is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.**
   - This means that the action movie watcher and the baseball player are next to each other, with the action movie watcher on the left.

2. **The person watching disaster movies is the coach.**
   - The coach watches disaster movies.

3. **The person watching action movies is on the left of the owner of the ferret.**
   - The action movie watcher is next to the ferret owner, with the action movie watcher on the left.

4. **The coach is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.**
   - The coach is next to the guinea-pig owner, with the coach on the left.

5. **The person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the photographer.**
   - The thriller movie watcher is either next to the photographer or the same as the photographer.

6. **The photographer is in an even position.**
   - The photographer must be in position 2.

7. **The person who's sport is tennis is between the person watching disaster movies and the accountant.**
   - The tennis player is between the coach (disaster movie watcher) and the accountant.

### Placing Information in the Table:
Let's start placing the information based on the clues:

1. Since the photographer is in position 2, we can fill in the photographer's row.
   ```
   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
   | Job           |          | Photographer |            |
   | Movie-Genre   |          |              |            |
   | Pet           |          |              |            |
   | Sport         |          |              |            |
   ```

2. From clue 2, the coach watches disaster movies and is in an odd position (either 1 or 3).
   - Since the photographer is in position 2, the coach cannot be in position 2, so the coach must be in position 1 or 3.
   - From clue 4, the coach is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the coach must be in position 1 and the guinea-pig owner must be in position 2 (photographer). This is consistent with clue 2.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
   | Job           | Coach    | Photographer |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster |              |            |
   | Pet           | Guinea-pig |              |            |
   | Sport         |          |              |            |
   ```

3. From clue 1, the action movie watcher is on the left of the baseball player. Since the coach is in position 1, the action movie watcher must be in position 2 and the baseball player in position 3.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
   | Job           | Coach    | Photographer |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster | Action       |            |
   | Pet           | Guinea-pig |              |            |
   | Sport         |          | Baseball    |            |
   ```

4. From clue 3, the action movie watcher (position 2) is on the left of the ferret owner. So the ferret owner must be in position 3.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
   | Job           | Coach    | Photographer |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster | Action       |            |
   | Pet           | Guinea-pig | Ferret      |            |
   | Sport         |          | Baseball    |            |
   ```

5. From clue 5, the thriller movie watcher is on the left or right of the photographer (position 2), but since the photographer is already in position 2, the thriller movie watcher must be in position 1 or 3. Since the coach is in position 1 and the baseball player is in position 3, the thriller movie watcher must be the photographer, which is already placed.
   
   - This confirms the photographer is in position 2, and the thriller movie watcher must be in position 1.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
   | Job           | Accountant | Photographer |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Thriller  | Action       |            |
   | Pet           | Guinea-pig | Ferret      |            |
   | Sport         |          | Baseball    |            |
   ```

6. From clue 7, the tennis player is between the coach (disaster movie watcher) and the accountant. The coach is in position 1 and the accountant is in position 2, so the tennis player must be in position 3.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
   | Job           | Accountant | Photographer | Coach    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Thriller  | Action       | Disaster |
   | Pet           | Guinea-pig | Ferret      | Hamster  |
   | Sport         | Tennis    | Baseball    | Lacrosse |
   ```

### Final Solution:
```
|               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Accountant | Photographer | Coach    |

Lv4-4x3-3	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to find the correct arrangement:

1. **The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person driving the bike**.
2. **The person eating watermelon is the person driving the train**.
3. **The person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the owner of the bird**.
4. **The person eating carrot is between the person watching adventure movies and the person driving the train**.
5. **The person watching action movies is in an even position**.
6. **The owner of the turtle is the person eating cranberry**.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 2:
- The person eating watermelon is the person driving the train (clue 2).

#### Clue 6:
- The owner of the turtle is the person eating cranberry (clue 6).
- Since the person eating cranberry is also the owner of the turtle, we can place ""Turtle"" under ""Pet"" for the person who eats cranberry.

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the turtle (who eats cranberry) is on the right of the person driving the bike.
- This means the person driving the bike must be in position 1, and the person with the turtle must be in position 3.

#### Clue 4:
- The person eating carrot is between the person watching adventure movies and the person driving the train (who eats watermelon).
- The person driving the train is in position 2 (from clue 2), so the person eating carrot must be in position 1 or 3.

Since the person driving the train is in position 2, and the person with the turtle (who eats cranberry) is in position 3, the person eating carrot must be in position 1.

#### Clue 5:
- The person watching action movies is in an even position.
- The only even positions available are 2 and 4. Since position 2 is already occupied by the person driving the train, the person watching action movies must be in position 4.

#### Clue 3:
- The person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the owner of the bird.
- We know the person eating cranberry is in position 3 (from clue 6). Therefore, the owner of the bird must be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:

- Position 1: Person eating carrot, watching adventure movies.
- Position 2: Owner of the bird, watching action movies.
- Position 3: Person eating cranberry, owning the turtle.
- Position 4: Person driving the train, eating watermelon.

Lv4-4x3-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
2. The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
3. The engineer is the person watching martial-arts movies.
4. The Italian is on the far right.
5. The bartender is on the right of the Pakistani.
6. The Italian is on the right of the Pakistani (redundant with clue 5).
7. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions based on nationality and job.
- From clue 4, the Italian is on the far right (position 3).
- From clue 5 and clue 6, the bartender is on the right of the Pakistani, so the bartender cannot be in position 3 (Italian). Therefore, the bartender must be in position 2 and the Pakistani in position 1.

So, we have:
```
| Hobby | Job    | Movie-Genre | Nationality |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
|      1|        |             | Pakistan    |
|      2| Bartender|            |             |
|      3|        |             | Italian     |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the job for the Italian.
- Since the engineer watches martial-arts movies (clue 3), and the Italian is not the engineer (since the Italian is on the right), the engineer must be in position 1.
- This leaves the bartender and the person with woodworking as the other two jobs.

So, we have:
```
| Hobby | Job    | Movie-Genre | Nationality |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
|      1| Engineer|            | Pakistan    |
|      2| Bartender|            |             |
|      3|        |             | Italian     |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the movie genre for the engineer.
- The engineer watches martial-arts movies (clue 3).

So, we have:
```
| Hobby | Job    | Movie-Genre | Nationality |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
|      1| Engineer| Martial-Arts| Pakistan    |
|      2| Bartender|             |             |
|      3|        |             | Italian     |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the movie genre for the bartender.
- The person who's hobby is woodworking prefers documentaries (clue 2).
- The person who's hobby is woodworking is in an odd position (clue 7).

Since the bartender is in position 2, the woodworking person cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the woodworking person must be in position 1, and the bartender must watch mystery movies.

So, we have:
```
| Hobby | Job    | Movie-Genre | Nationality |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
|      1| Woodworking| Documentary | Pakistan    |
|      2| Bartender| Mystery     |             |
|      3|        |             | Italian     |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the remaining information.
- The person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies (clue 1).
- Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 1, the person with the hobby of chess must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
| Hobby | Job    | Movie-Genre | Nationality |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Chess | Woodworking| Documentary | Pakistan    |
|      2| Bartender| Mystery     |             |
|      3|        |             | Italian     |
```

- The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person watching documentary movies (clue 2).

Since the woodworking person is in position 1 and the documentary person is in position 3, this is consistent.

- The only job left is photography for the person in position 3.

So, the final solution is:
```
| Hobby | Job    | Movie-Genre | Nationality |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Chess | Woodworking| Documentary | Pakistan    |
|      2| Bartender| Mystery     | British     |
|      3| Photography|             | Italian     |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Hobby | Job    | Movie-Genre | Nationality |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Chess | Woodworking| Documentary | Pakistan    |
|      2| Bartender| Mystery     | British     |
|      3| Photography|             | Italian     |

Lv4-4x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the information given into the table step by step. Let's break down the clues and see how they fit together.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The manager is on the left of the German.**
   - This means if the manager is in position 1, the German must be in position 2.
   - If the manager is in position 2, the German must be in position 3.

2. **The person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking juice.**
   - This means if someone is drinking water in position 1, the person drinking juice must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **The bartender is in an odd position.**
   - The bartender can only be in position 1 or 3.

4. **The manager is on the left of the fan of pop.**
   - If the manager is in position 1, the fan of pop must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the manager is in position 2, the fan of pop must be in position 3.

5. **The police-officer is on the left or right of the fan of salsa.**
   - This means the police-officer and the fan of salsa can be next to each other (e.g., police-officer in position 1, fan of salsa in position 2) or separated by one position (e.g., police-officer in position 1, fan of salsa in position 3).

6. **The police-officer is on the right of the person drinking juice.**
   - This means if someone is drinking juice in position 1, the police-officer must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If someone is drinking juice in position 2, the police-officer must be in position 3.

7. **The Polish is in the middle.**
   - The Polish person must be in position 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 2 must be occupied by the Polish person.**

   |               |     1     |    2    |       3        |
   | Beverage      |           | Polish  |                |
   | Job           |           | Polish  |                |
   | Music-Genre   |           | Polish  |                |
   | Nationality   |           | Polish  |                |

2. **The bartender is in an odd position (1 or 3).**

   - If the bartender is in position 1, then:
     - The manager cannot be in position 1 because the manager is on the left of the German.
     - The manager must be in position 2, making the German in position 3.
     - The fan of pop must be in position 3 (since the manager is on the left of the fan of pop).
     - The police-officer must be in position 3 (since the police-officer is on the right of the person drinking juice and the person drinking juice cannot be in position 3).

   - This scenario is not possible because the bartender and the police-officer would both be in position 3, which is not allowed.

3. **Therefore, the bartender must be in position 3.**

   - The manager must be in position 2, making the German in position 1.
   - The fan of pop must be in position 2 (since the manager is on the left of the fan of pop).
   - The police-officer must be in position 1 (since the police-officer is on the right of the person drinking juice and the person drinking juice cannot be in position 1).

4. **The person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking juice.**

   - Since the police-officer is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 2, and the person drinking juice must be in position 3.

5. **The Polish person is in position 2.**

   - This fits with all the previous placements.

6. **The fan of salsa is in position 3 (since the police-officer is on the right of the fan of salsa and the police-officer is in position 1).**

   - Therefore, the fan of salsa must be in position 3.

7. **The person drinking water is in position 2 (since the police-officer is in position 1 and the person drinking juice is in position 3).**

8. **The person drinking juice is in position 3 (since the person drinking water is in position 2 and the police-officer is in position 1).**

9. **The person drinking coffee must be in position 1 (since the person drinking water is in position 2 and the person drinking juice is in position 3).**

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |    2    |       3        |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Water   | Juice          |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person watching mystery movies is between the photographer and the person eating cauliflower.**
   - This means that the person who watches mystery movies is not the photographer or the one eating cauliflower. The photographer and the person eating cauliflower must be on either side of the mystery movie watcher.

2. **The dutch is the person eating asparagus.**
   - So, the Dutch person eats asparagus.

3. **The person watching western movies is the italian.**
   - So, the Italian person watches western movies.

4. **The Italian is on the left of the social-worker.**
   - This means the Italian is in position 1, and the social-worker is in position 2 or 3.

5. **The Dutch is in an even position.**
   - Since there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), the Dutch can only be in position 2.

6. **The Dutch is on the right of the person eating raspberry.**
   - Since the Dutch is in position 2, the person eating raspberry must be in position 1.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- Position 1: Dutch, eating raspberry.
- Position 2: Dutch, (not specified yet).
- Position 3: (to be determined).

Now let's fill in the details:

- **Position 1:** Dutch, eating raspberry.
- **Position 2:** Dutch, (not specified yet).
- **Position 3:** (to be determined).

### Determining the remaining details:

From clue 3:
- The Italian is in position 1, so this cannot be true for the Dutch.

From clue 4:
- The Italian is in position 1, and the social-worker is in position 2 or 3.

Since the Dutch is in position 2:
- The social-worker must be in position 3.

From clue 5:
- The Dutch is in position 2, which is an even position, so this is consistent.

From clue 6:
- The Dutch is on the right of the person eating raspberry, so the person eating raspberry must be in position 1.

From clue 2:
- The Dutch is eating asparagus.

From clue 1:
- The person watching mystery movies is between the photographer and the person eating cauliflower.
- Since the Italian is in position 1, the person watching mystery movies cannot be the Italian.
- The Dutch is in position 2, so the photographer and the person eating cauliflower must be on either side of the mystery movie watcher.

### Final Deductions:
- **Position 1:** Dutch, eating raspberry.
- **Position 2:** Dutch, (not specified yet, but job and movie genre will be determined).
- **Position 3:** Social-worker, (job and movie genre will be determined).

Given the constraints:
- The person watching mystery movies must be in position 3 (since the Dutch is in position 2 and the Italian is in position 1).
- The photographer must be in position 1 (left of the mystery movie watcher) and the person eating cauliflower must be in position 3 (right of the mystery movie watcher).

### Final Table:

```

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The Russian is on the far left or far right.**
2. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the far right.**
3. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position.**
4. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person whose hobby is dancing.**
5. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the Pakistani.**
6. **The person driving the car is in an odd position.**
7. **The person whose hobby is camping is between the Pakistani and the person driving the tram.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2:** The person drinking soy-milk is on the far right.
   - So, Beverage 3 = Soy-milk.

2. **Clue 1:** The Russian is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the person drinking soy-milk (Beverage 3) is on the far right, the Russian cannot be on the far right.
   - Therefore, the Russian must be on the far left.
   - So, Nationality 1 = Russian.

3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position.
   - This means the person drinking hot-chocolate is either in position 1 or 3.
   - Since the Russian is in position 1, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 3.
   - So, Beverage 3 = Hot-chocolate.

4. **Clue 2 (revisited):** The person drinking soy-milk is on the far right.
   - So, Beverage 3 = Soy-milk (confirmed).

5. **Clue 4:** The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person whose hobby is dancing.
   - This means the person driving the quad-bike is not in position 3 (since the person with the hobby of dancing would be to their right).
   - Also, since the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person whose hobby is dancing, the person driving the quad-bike cannot be in position 1 (since the person with the hobby of dancing would be to their right, and the Russian is already in position 1).
   - Therefore, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 2.
   - So, Transport 2 = Quad-bike.

6. **Clue 5:** The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the Pakistani.
   - Since the person driving the quad-bike is in position 2, the Pakistani must be in position 3.
   - So, Nationality 3 = Pakistani.

7. **Clue 6:** The person driving the car is in an odd position.
   - This means the person driving the car is either in position 1 or 3.
   - Since the Russian is in position 1 and the Pakistani is in position 3, the person driving the car must be in position 1.
   - So, Transport 1 = Car.

8. **Clue 7:** The person whose hobby is camping is between the Pakistani and the person driving the tram.
   - Since the Pakistani is in position 3, the person driving the tram must be in position 1 (already occupied by the Russian) or 2 (occupied by the person driving the quad-bike).
   - Therefore, the person driving the tram must be in position 2.
   - So, Transport 2 = Tram.
   - This leaves position 3 for the person whose hobby is camping.
   - So, Hobby 3 = Camping.

9. **Determine remaining positions:**
   - Since the person in position 3 is the Pakistani and has the hobby of camping, the person in position 2 must have the hobby of dancing.
   - So, Hobby 2 = Dancing.
   - The person in position 1 must have the hobby of sudoku.
   - So, Hobby 1 = Sudoku.

10. **Determine remaining beverages:**
    - The person in position 1 (sudoku) cannot drink hot-chocolate (position 3) or soy-milk (position 3).
    - Therefore, the person in position 1 must drink coffee.
    - So, Beverage 1 = Coffee.
    - The person in position 2 (dancing) cannot drink coffee (position 1) or soy-milk (position 3).
    - Therefore, the person in position 2 must drink hot-chocolate.
    - So, Beverage 2 = Hot-chocolate.
    - The person in position 3 (camping) must drink soy-milk.
    - So, Beverage 3 = Soy-milk (confirmed).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |       1       |     2     |     3     |

Lv4-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Summary:
1. The Colombian is on the right of the person eating apricot.
2. The fan of punk is in an even position (position 2).
3. The Turkish is the owner of the chinchilla.
4. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person eating cabbage.
5. The Colombian is on the left or right of the Turkish.
6. The owner of the horse is on the left of the fan of blues.
7. The Turkish is in an odd position (position 1).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7**: The Turkish is in an odd position (position 1). So, we place ""Turkish"" in position 1.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |     2     |     3      |
   | Food          |          |           |            |
   | Music-Genre   |          |           |            |
   | Nationality   | Turkish  |           |            |
   | Pet           |          |           |            |
   ```

2. **Clue 3**: The Turkish is the owner of the chinchilla. So, we place ""chinchilla"" in position 1 under the pet column.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |     2     |     3      |
   | Food          |          |           |            |
   | Music-Genre   |          |           |            |
   | Nationality   | Turkish  |           |            |
   | Pet           | chinchilla |           |            |
   ```

3. **Clue 1**: The Colombian is on the right of the person eating apricot. Since the Turkish is in position 1, the Colombian must be in position 3. Also, the person eating apricot cannot be the Colombian (since the Colombian is to the right), so the person eating apricot must be in position 2.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |     2     |     3      |
   | Food          |          | apricot   |            |
   | Music-Genre   |          |           |            |
   | Nationality   | Turkish  |           | Colombian |
   | Pet           | chinchilla |           |            |
   ```

4. **Clue 2**: The fan of punk is in an even position (position 2). Since position 2 already has ""apricot"", the fan of punk must be in position 4 (not applicable here as there are only three positions). This clue needs re-evaluation based on the current setup. Let's assume it means the fan of punk is in position 2, which conflicts with apricot. We need to resolve this conflict.
   
   Revisiting Clue 2 and 4, since position 2 is already occupied by apricot, the fan of punk must be in position 4. But there are only three positions, so let's correct the initial assumption and recheck:
   
   - Position 2 must have the fan of punk.
   - The person eating cabbage must be in position 3 (since the owner of the lizard is on the left of the person eating cabbage and the Colombian is in position 3).

   Therefore, the person eating cabbage is in position 3, and the owner of the lizard must be in position 2.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |     2     |     3      |
   | Food          |          | cabbage   | lemon      |
   | Music-Genre   |          | punk      |            |
   | Nationality   | Turkish  |           | Colombian |
   | Pet           | chinchilla | lizard   |            |
   ```

5. **Clue 6**: The owner of the horse is on the left of the fan of blues. Since the fan of punk is in position 2, the owner of the horse must be in position 1, and the fan of blues must be in position 3.
   
   ```
   |               |    1     |     2     |     3      |
   | Food          |          | cabbage   | lemon      |
   | Music-Genre   |          | punk      |            |
   | Nationality   | Turkish  |           | Colombian |
   | Pet           | horse    | lizard    |            |
   ```

6. **Clue 5**: The Colombian is on the left or right of the Turkish. Since the Turkish is in position 1 and the Colombian is in position 3, they are correctly placed.

7. **Final Verification**:
   - The Colombian is on the right of the person eating apricot (correct).
   - The fan of punk is in an even position (correct).
   - The Turkish is the owner of the chinchilla (correct).
   - The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person eating cabbage (correct).
   - The Colombian is on the left or right of the Turkish (correct).
   - The owner of the horse is on the left of the fan of blues (correct).
   - The Turkish is in an odd position (correct).

Lv4-4x3-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The Japanese is on the left of the person driving the roller.
2. The fan of classical is the dancer.
3. The teacher is on the left of the fan of indie.
4. The fan of classical is the Thai.
5. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the van.
6. The dancer is in an odd position.
7. The dancer is on the left or right of the teacher.

### Initial Setup:
|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |
| Job           |            |            |            |
| Music-Genre   |            |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |            |
| Transport     |            |            |            |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2 and Clue 4:
- The fan of classical is the dancer and also the Thai.
- So, the dancer (job) and Thai (nationality) must be in the same row.

#### Clue 6:
- The dancer is in an odd position, so the dancer must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Combining Clues 2 and 6:
- Since the dancer is in an odd position, and the dancer is the Thai, the Thai must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Position Analysis:
- If the Thai is in position 1, then the dancer is in position 1.
- If the Thai is in position 3, then the dancer is in position 3.

#### Clue 7:
- The dancer is on the left or right of the teacher.
- This means if the dancer is in position 1, the teacher cannot be in position 1 (since there is no left position for it). Therefore, the dancer must be in position 3 and the teacher can be in position 1 or 2.

#### Position 1:
- If the Thai (dancer) is in position 1, then the teacher must be in position 2 or 3.
- However, since the teacher must be to the left of the fan of indie, and the fan of indie must be in position 3 (since the dancer is in position 1), the teacher must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Thai (dancer)
- Position 2: Teacher
- Position 3: Fan of indie

#### Clue 3:
- The teacher is on the left of the fan of indie.
- This fits our current positions perfectly.

#### Clue 1:
- The Japanese is on the left of the person driving the roller.
- Since the Thai is in position 1, the Japanese must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the teacher is in position 2, the Japanese must be in position 3.
- Therefore, the person driving the roller must be in position 1.

#### Clue 5:
- The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the van.
- Since the Japanese is in position 3 and the Thai is in position 1, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 1 and the person driving the van must be in position 3.

#### Final Assignment:
- Position 1: Japanese (driving snowmobile)
- Position 2: Teacher
- Position 3: Thai (dancer, driving van)

### Music-Genres and Jobs:
- We know the fan of classical is the dancer (Thai).
- Therefore, the fan of indie must be in position 2 (Teacher).

Since the remaining genres are electronic and classical, and the fan of classical is the Thai, the fan of electronic must be in position 2 (Teacher).

### Final Table:
```
|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |
| Job           | Dancer     | Teacher    | Freelancer |
| Music-Genre   | Indie      | Classical  | Electronic |
| Nationality   | Japanese  | Thai       | Chinese    |
