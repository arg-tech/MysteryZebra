### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1:**
   - Bd (Bird), Cd (Canadian)
   - Since Bd is at position 1, we can place it there.

2. **Position 5:**
   - Hb (Handball) or Sc (Scooter)
   - Since Hb must be at position 1 or 5, and Bd is at position 1, Hb must be at position 5.

3. **Position 3:**
   - Since Hb is at position 5, Sc must be at position 3.
   - T (Turkish) is to the right of Sc, so T must be at position 4.
   - Jp (Japanese) is to the right of T, so Jp must be at position 5 (but Sc is already there), so Jp must be at position 2.

4. **Position 2:**
   - Jp (Japanese) is at position 2.
   - T (Turkish) is at position 4.
   - S (Soy Milk) is to the right of G (Goat).
   - So, S must be at position 5 (but Sc is there), so S must be at position 4 (but T is there), so S must be at position 3 (but Sc is there), so S must be at position 2.
   - Therefore, G must be at position 1 (but Bd is there), so G must be at position 3.

5. **Position 4:**
   - T (Turkish) is at position 4.
   - S (Soy Milk) is at position 2.
   - G (Goat) is at position 3.
   - M (Martial Arts) is to the right of T, so M must be at position 5.
   - Jp (Japanese) is to the right of M, but Jp is at position 2, so this is consistent.

6. **Position 1:**
   - Bd (Bird) is at position 1.
   - Hc (Hot Chocolate) is at position 1.
   - Ds (Disaster) is at position 1.
   - Cd (Canadian) is at position 1.

7. **Position 3:**
