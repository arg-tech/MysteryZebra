Lv4-5x6-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **House Fan Position**:
   - The fan of house is in an odd position (5).
   - The fan of house is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
   
   So, let's place the fan of house at position 5 and denote the skydiving person as \(S\).

2. **Australian Position**:
   - The australian is between the writer and the person who's hobby is skydiving.
   - Since the fan of house is in position 5 and is to the right of the skydiving person, the skydiving person must be in position 3 (because it needs to fit within the range for the australian to be in between).

   So, we have:
   - Skydiving (S) in position 3.
   - Australian in position 4.
   - House fan in position 5.

3. **Designer Position**:
   - The designer is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
   - The person with woodworking can't be in position 5 (house fan), so they must be in position 2.

   So, we have:
   - Woodworking in position 2.
   - Designer in position 6.

4. **French Position**:
   - The french is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
   - Hiking person must be in position 1 because it needs to fit within the range for the french to be on the right.

   So, we have:
   - Hiking in position 1.
   - French in position 2 (but we already have woodworking there, so this conflicts). Recheck, the french must be in position 3 but then the hiking can't fit. Correctly, the french must be in position 4 and hiking in position 1.

5. **Russian and Thai Positions**:
   - The russian is on the left or right of the thai.
   - The thai is between the canadian and the person drinking water.
   - The person drinking water is on the far left or far right.

   Let's assume the thai is in position 3 (middle), then the canadian and water must be in positions 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

6. **Blues Fan**:
   - The person who's hobby is hiking is the fan of blues.
   - Hiking is in position 1, so blues fan is in position 1.

7. **Russian and Thai Final**:
   - The russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
   - The person who's hobby is gardening is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

   Since blues fan is in position 1, gardening must be in position 3 or 5. But since the australian is in position 4, gardening must be in position 5 and the russian in position 6.

8. **Other Constraints**:
   - The fan of reggae is on the far left or far right.
   - The fan of funk is in an even position.
   - The person drinking tea is between the fan of blues and the police-officer.
   - The person drinking water is on the far left or far right.
   - The person drinking sprite is on the left of the russian.
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the writer.
   - The canadian is on the left of the fan of soul.
   - The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - The fan of house is the person drinking cola.
   - The person drinking tea is between the fan of blues and the police-officer.
   - The person drinking water is on the far left or far right.
   - The accountant is on the left or right of the designer.
   - The writer is on the left or right of the australian.
   - The fan of blues is the architect.
   - The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the police-officer.
