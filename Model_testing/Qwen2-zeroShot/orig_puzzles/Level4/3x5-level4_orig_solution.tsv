Lv4-3x5-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step to find the correct arrangement.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person drinking fanta is the person who's sport is swimming.**
   - (Swimming) -> (Fanta)

2. **The person driving the helicopter is the person who's sport is golf.**
   - (Golf) -> (Helicopter)

3. **The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.**
   - Lemonade is in position 3.

4. **The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking water.**
   - This means cola and water are adjacent.

5. **The person drinking cola is between the person driving the helicopter and the person drinking water.**
   - Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 2 (golf), cola and water must be in positions 1 and 4, respectively, or 4 and 5, respectively.

6. **The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the person driving the subway is in position 1 or 5.

7. **The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.**
   - Since (Swimming) -> (Fanta), (Lemonade) -> (Position 3) and (Swimming) -> (Position 2), lemonade must be in position 4 or 5.

8. **The person who's sport is basketball is on the far right.**
   - (Basketball) -> (Position 5).

9. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is in an even position.**
   - Skateboarding can only be in positions 2 or 4.

10. **The person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the tram.**
    - (Tram) -> (Iced-tea).

11. **The person who's sport is basketball is the person driving the subway.**
    - (Basketball) -> (Subway).

12. **The person driving the taxi is between the person who's sport is golf and the person driving the tram.**
    - (Golf) -> (Helicopter) and (Tram) -> (Iced-tea), so the taxi driver must be in position 3.

### Final Arrangement:

Given the constraints, let's place each item:

- Position 1: Subway (Basketball)
- Position 2: Helicopter (Golf)
- Position 3: Taxi (Basketball is on the far right, and taxi is between golf and tram)
- Position 4: Tram (Iced-tea)
- Position 5: Basketball (Far right)

Now we need to assign sports and beverages:

- (Swimming) -> (Fanta) -> Position 2
- (Lemonade) -> Position 3 (middle)
- (Cola) -> (Water) -> Positions 1 and 4 (adjacent, with cola between helicopter and water)
- (Skateboarding) -> Position 4 (even position)

So, the final arrangement is:

| Beverage     | Cola | Fanta | Iced-tea | Water | Lemonade |
|--------------|------|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| Sport        | Basketball | Swimming | Iced-tea | Water | Skateboarding |
| Transport    | Subway | Helicopter | Taxi | Tram | Basketball |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |    1     |    2     |     3      |       4       |     5      |
| Beverage    | Cola    | Fanta   | Iced-tea   | Water         | Lemonade  |
| Sport       | Basketball | Swimming | Iced-tea   | Water         | Skateboarding |
| Transport   | Subway  | Helicopter | Taxi      | Tram          | Basketball |

Lv4-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 5**: The person watching fantasy movies is on the far right.
   - Fantasy movies are watched by someone in position 5.

2. **Clue 11**: The person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right.
   - Epic movies are watched by someone in position 1 or 5. Since position 5 is already taken by fantasy, the person watching epic movies must be in position 1.

3. **Clue 6**: The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.
   - Since the person watching epic movies is in position 1, the owner of the cat can be in position 2 or 3 (left) or 4 or 5 (right).

4. **Clue 10**: The owner of the mouse is in an even position.
   - The even positions available are 2, 4, and 6 (but 6 is not in the table). So, the owner of the mouse can be in position 2 or 4.

5. **Clue 9**: The owner of the cat is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
   - If the owner of the cat is in position 2, the person driving the taxi must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - If the owner of the cat is in position 4, the person driving the taxi must be in position 5.

6. **Clue 2**: The person driving the car is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
   - This implies the owner of the hamster cannot be in position 1 or 5 if the car driver is in position 1 or 5.

7. **Clue 3**: The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies.
   - This implies the person watching horror movies cannot be in position 1 or 5 if the car driver is in position 1 or 5.

8. **Clue 4**: The owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
   - If the owner of the cat is in position 2, the owner of the hamster can be in position 1 or 3.
   - If the owner of the cat is in position 4, the owner of the hamster can be in position 3 or 5.

9. **Clue 7**: The person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the car.
   - This means the car driver cannot be in position 5, and the boat driver must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

10. **Clue 8**: The owner of the cat is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
    - This further restricts the possible positions for the owner of the cat.

11. **Clue 12**: The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person watching spy movies.
    - This implies the person watching spy movies cannot be in position 1 if the owner of the hedgehog is in position 1.

### Final Solution:
Let's assign the values based on these constraints:

1. **Position 1**: Epic movies
2. **Position 2**: Cat owner
3. **Position 3**: Car driver (and not the boat driver)
4. **Position 4**: Mouse owner
5. **Position 5**: Fantasy movies

From the above, we have:
- Position 1: Epic movies
- Position 2: Cat owner
- Position 3: Car driver
- Position 4: Mouse owner
- Position 5: Fantasy movies

Now, we need to determine the remaining genres, pets, and transport modes:

- **Position 3** (Car driver): Not the boat driver, so must be one of the other transports.
- **Position 4** (Mouse owner): Even position, so must be either 4.
- **Position 2** (Cat owner): On the left of the person driving the taxi, so could be 2 or 4.
- **Position 1** (Epic movies): Far left, so confirmed.
- **Position 5** (Fantasy movies): Far right, so confirmed.

Given the constraints:
- **Transport**: Car (position 3), not the boat, so it could be subway, taxi, or van.
- **Pet**: Cat (position 2), mouse (position 4).
- **Genre**: Epic (position 1), fantasy (position 5).

The only remaining transport is the boat, which must be in position 7 (not in the table).

Thus, the final table is:

```
|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |
| Movie-Genre   |  Epic   | Fantasy|  Subway |  Mouse |  Fantasy|
| Pet           |  Cat    | Mouse  |  -      |  -     |  -      |
| Transport     |  -      |  -     |  Car    |  -     |  -      |
```

Since the transport options are not fully assigned, let's finalize with the known constraints:

```
|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |
| Movie-Genre   |  Epic   | Fantasy|  Subway |  Mouse |  Fantasy|
| Pet           |  Cat    | Mouse  |  -      |  -     |  -      |
| Transport     |  -      |  -     |  Car    |  -     |  -      |
```

This is the best assignment based on the provided clues."
Lv4-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person driving the scooter is the fan of trance.
2. The person driving the train is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.
3. The person driving the ship is in an even position.
4. The fan of trance is the malaysian.
5. The person driving the snowmobile is between the person driving the airplane and the fan of trance.
6. The fan of indie is in the middle (position 3).
7. The American is on the left of the Brazilian.
8. The person driving the airplane is on the right of the Italian.
9. The Russian is on the far right.
10. The Italian is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
11. The fan of techno is the Russian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4 & 11:
- The fan of trance is the Malaysian.
- The fan of techno is the Russian.
  
#### Clue 9:
- The Russian is on the far right (position 5).

#### Clue 11:
- Since the Russian is the fan of techno and is in position 5, the person in position 5 is Russian and techno.

#### Clue 7:
- The American is on the left of the Brazilian.

#### Clue 8:
- The person driving the airplane is on the right of the Italian.
- The Italian must be to the left of the person driving the airplane.

#### Clue 10:
- The Italian is on the left of the person driving the airplane.

#### Clue 6:
- The fan of indie is in the middle (position 3).

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the train is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.

#### Clue 5:
- The person driving the snowmobile is between the person driving the airplane and the fan of trance.

#### Clue 2:
- The person driving the train is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.

#### Clue 1:
- The person driving the scooter is the fan of trance.
- The Malaysian is the fan of trance and drives the scooter (position 1).

#### Positions for the remaining clues:
- Since the Malaysian is in position 1 and drives the scooter, the fan of trance is Malaysian.
- The person driving the snowmobile is between the person driving the airplane and the fan of trance (Malaysian).
- The person driving the airplane is on the right of the Italian.
- The Italian is on the left of the person driving the airplane.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements:

1. Malaysian (Trance) - Scooter
2. ?
3. Indie
4. ?
5. Russian (Techno) - Train

Since the person driving the train is either left or right of the fan of jazz, and the Russian is in position 5, the person in position 4 must be driving the train. Thus, the person in position 4 is the Russian, and the person in position 3 is the fan of jazz.

Now, we need to determine who is in positions 2 and 4:

- The person driving the airplane is on the right of the Italian.
- The Italian is on the left of the person driving the airplane.

Given that the person driving the snowmobile is between the person driving the airplane and the fan of trance, the person driving the airplane cannot be in position 2 because there would not be enough space for the snowmobile.

Thus, the person driving the airplane is in position 4 (Russian), and the person in position 2 must be the Italian.

Finally, since the person driving the snowmobile is between the person driving the airplane and the fan of trance, and the person driving the airplane is in position 4, the person in position 2 must be the Italian, and the person in position 3 must be the fan of jazz.

So, we have:

1. Malaysian (Trance) - Scooter
2. Italian
3. Jazz
4. Russian (Techno) - Train
5. American (Airplane)

Now, the only nationality left for the first position is the Brazilian.

So, we have:

1. Brazilian
2. Italian
3. Jazz
4. Russian (Techno) - Train
5. American (Airplane)

Final solution:

Lv4-3x5-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct arrangement:

### Given Information:
1. Hobbies: filmmaking, fishing, hiking, puzzles, reading
2. Movie-Genres: action, disaster, martial-arts, romance, thriller
3. Sports: biathlon, parkour, rowing, snowboarding, swimming

### Clues:
1. The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person whose sport is biathlon.
2. The person watching action movies is the person whose hobby is fishing.
3. The person whose hobby is puzzles is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
4. The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person whose sport is parkour.
5. The person watching martial-arts movies is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
6. The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is reading.
7. The person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person whose sport is parkour.
8. The person whose hobby is hiking is on the far right (position 5).
9. The person watching action movies is between the person whose hobby is filmmaking and the person whose sport is snowboarding.
10. The person whose hobby is reading is on the left of the person whose sport is swimming.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position 5 - Hiking
From clue 8, we know the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 5.
\[ \text{Position 5: Hiking} \]

#### Step 2: Position 3 - Puzzles
From clue 3, the person with the hobby of puzzles is in an odd position (1 or 3). From clue 4, this person is on the left or right of the person whose sport is parkour. Since the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 5, the person with the hobby of puzzles must be in position 3.
\[ \text{Position 3: Puzzles} \]

#### Step 3: Position 1 - Biathlon
From clue 1, the person whose hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person whose sport is biathlon. Therefore, the person whose sport is biathlon must be in position 1.
\[ \text{Position 1: Biathlon} \]

#### Step 4: Position 3 - Martial-Arts Movies
From clue 5, the person watching martial-arts movies is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since position 1 is already occupied by biathlon, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 3. However, position 3 is already occupied by puzzles. This means that the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 1, but this conflicts with the biathlon being there. Revisiting the clues, it seems the only way to resolve this is if the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 5, which is not possible as hiking is there. Thus, the only feasible position for the person watching martial-arts movies is position 3.
\[ \text{Position 3: Martial-Arts Movies} \]

#### Step 5: Position 1 - Fishing
From clue 2, the person watching action movies is the person whose hobby is fishing. Since position 3 is now taken by puzzles, the person whose hobby is fishing must be in position 1.
\[ \text{Position 1: Fishing} \]

#### Step 6: Position 4 - Action Movies
From clue 9, the person watching action movies is between the person whose hobby is filmmaking and the person whose sport is snowboarding. Since position 1 is fishing and position 3 is puzzles, the only positions left for filmmaking and snowboarding are 2 and 4. The person watching action movies must be in position 4.
\[ \text{Position 4: Action Movies} \]

#### Step 7: Position 2 - Filmmaking
Since position 4 is action movies, the person whose hobby is filmmaking must be in position 2.
\[ \text{Position 2: Filmmaking} \]

#### Step 8: Position 4 - Snowboarding
From clue 9, the person watching action movies (position 4) is between the person whose hobby is filmmaking (position 2) and the person whose sport is snowboarding. Therefore, the person whose sport is snowboarding must be in position 5.
\[ \text{Position 5: Snowboarding} \]

#### Step 9: Position 3 - Reading
From clue 6, the person watching romance movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is reading. The only positions left for reading and romance are 3 and 4. Since position 4 is action movies, the person whose hobby is reading must be in position 3.
\[ \text{Position 3: Reading} \]

#### Step 10: Position 4 - Thriller Movies
From clue 7, the person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person whose sport is parkour. Since position 3 is reading and position 5 is snowboarding, the person whose sport is parkour must be in position 2.
\[ \text{Position 2: Parkour} \]
Therefore, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 4.
\[ \text{Position 4: Thriller Movies} \]

11. **Clue 12**: The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the fan of pop.

### Initial Setup:
Let's start with the positions based on Clues 7 and 10:
- Water is at either 1 or 5.
- Tram is at either 1 or 5.

Since the person drinking water must be on the far left or right (Clue 7) and the person driving the tram must be on the far left or right (Clue 10), we can infer that:
- Water is at 1 or 5.
- Tram is at 1 or 5.

### Placing Water and Tram:
Since the person drinking water cannot be in the same position as the person driving the tram, and considering Clue 4 (hip-hop is at 5) and Clue 7 (water is at 1 or 5):

- Water is at 1.
- Tram is at 5.

### Placing the Fan of Hip-Hop:
- Hip-hop is at 5 (Clue 4).

### Placing the Fan of Blues:
- Blues is at 3 (Clue 11).

### Placing the Bike:
- Bike is driven by the fan of salsa (Clue 5).
- Salsa is at 3 (since blues is at 3 and bike cannot be at 3).
- Therefore, the bike is at 2 (since bike cannot be at 1 or 5 and blues is at 3).

### Placing the Roller:
- Roller is driven by the fan of blues (Clue 11).
- Blues is at 3, so roller is at 1 or 3.
- Since water is at 1, roller must be at 3.

### Placing the Skateboard:
- Skateboard is on the left of the person drinking coffee (Clue 9).
- Coffee is not at 1 (water), 3 (salsa), or 5 (tram), so coffee is at 4.
- Therefore, skateboard is at 2 (since bike is at 2 and coffee is at 4).

### Placing the Lemonade and Soy-Milk:
- Lemonade is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk (Clue 6).
- The only positions left are 2 and 4, but since skateboard is at 2 and coffee is at 4, lemonade and soy-milk must be at 2 and 4 respectively.
- Since lemonade is on the left of soy-milk, lemonade is at 2 and soy-milk is at 4.

### Final Solution:
Now let's fill in the table:

|               |   1    |    2    |    3     |     4      |    5    |

Lv4-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The freelancer is on the far left.**
   - Freelancer is in position 1.
   
2. **The fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of techno.**
   - R&B fan is to the left of Techno fan.
   
3. **The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is between the entrepreneur and the person who's hobby is sudoku.**
   - Rock-climbing is in the middle (position 3), with Sudoku on one side and Entrepreneur on the other.
   
4. **The freelancer is on the left of the electrician.**
   - Electrician is in position 2.
   
5. **The fan of r&b is the person who's hobby is collecting.**
   - Collecting is associated with R&B fan.
   
6. **The fan of blues is on the left or right of the journalist.**
   - Blues fan is next to Journalist.
   
7. **The fan of blues is the person who's hobby is sudoku.**
   - Sudoku is associated with Blues fan.
   
8. **The fan of blues is on the right of the electrician.**
   - Since the electrician is in position 2, the Blues fan must be in position 4.
   
9. **The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far left or far right.**
   - Puzzles can be in position 1 or 5.
   
10. **The fan of punk is in an even position.**
    - Punk fan can be in position 2, 4, or 5.

### Positioning Based on Clues:

- **Freelancer** is in position 1.
- **Electrician** is in position 2.
- **Blues fan** is in position 4 (from clue 8).
- **Sudoku fan** is in position 4 (from clue 7).

Since the Blues fan is in position 4 and the Sudoku fan is in position 4, there is a contradiction unless we consider the order of the genres and hobbies. Let's recheck:

- **Collecting** is associated with R&B fan, so R&B fan is in position 1 (since Collecting is in position 1).
- **Rock-climbing** is between Entrepreneur and Sudoku, and since Sudoku is in position 4, Rock-climbing must be in position 3.
- **Entrepreneur** must be in position 2 (since Rock-climbing is in position 3 and Sudoku is in position 4).
- **Puzzles** can only be in position 5 because it cannot be in position 1 (freelancer) or 2 (electrician) or 3 (rock-climbing) or 4 (sudoku).

Now let's place the remaining items:

- **Journalist** must be in position 5 (since Blues fan is in position 4 and must be next to Journalist).
- **Punk fan** can be in position 2 or 4, but since position 2 is already taken by the electrician, Punk fan is in position 4.

So, we have:
- Position 1: R&B (Collecting)
- Position 2: Electrician
- Position 3: Rock-climbing
- Position 4: Punk (Sudoku)
- Position 5: Blues (Journalist)

### Final Solution Table:

Lv4-3x5-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking almond-milk is the fan of metal.
2. The fan of jazz is the owner of the rabbit.
3. The owner of the goat is the person drinking fanta.
4. The owner of the frog is on the left of the fan of disco.
5. The owner of the goat is on the far left or far right.
6. The fan of disco is the person drinking cola.
7. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.
8. The owner of the cat is the person drinking cola.
9. The fan of reggae is in an odd position.
10. The owner of the rabbit is in an odd position.
11. The owner of the rabbit is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 8 and Clue 7:
- The owner of the rabbit is in an odd position (Clue 10).
- The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking mirinda (Clue 7).

This means the owner of the rabbit must be in positions 1 or 3 (since they are in an odd position and on the right of someone). Let's explore both possibilities:

**Case 1: Owner of the rabbit is in position 1.**
- This means the person in position 2 drinks mirinda.
- The person in position 4 would be the fan of reggae (Clue 9, since it's an odd position).

**Case 2: Owner of the rabbit is in position 3.**
- This means the person in position 2 drinks mirinda.
- The person in position 5 would be the fan of reggae (Clue 9, since it's an odd position).

Since the owner of the rabbit can only be in an odd position, let's try **Case 1 first:**

**Assume the owner of the rabbit is in position 1.**
- Position 2 drinks mirinda.
- Position 4 is the fan of reggae.

Now, we need to fit other clues into this setup.

#### Clue 6:
- The fan of disco drinks cola (Clue 6).
- The owner of the cat drinks cola (Clue 8).
- Therefore, the owner of the cat is in position 4 (since position 4 is the fan of reggae).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rabbit
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 4: Cat (fan of reggae)
- Position 5: Fan of disco (cola)

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the goat drinks fanta.
- The owner of the goat is either in position 1 or 5 (Clue 5).

Since position 1 is already occupied by the rabbit, the owner of the goat must be in position 5.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rabbit
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 3: Unknown
- Position 4: Cat (fan of reggae)
- Position 5: Goat (fanta)

#### Clue 1:
- The person drinking almond-milk is the fan of metal.
- The fan of metal is not in position 4 (cat), so it must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rabbit
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 3: Almond-milk (fan of metal)
- Position 4: Cat (fan of reggae)
- Position 5: Goat (fanta)

#### Clue 2:
- The fan of jazz is the owner of the rabbit.
- The owner of the rabbit is in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rabbit (owner of the rabbit)
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 3: Almond-milk (fan of metal)
- Position 4: Cat (fan of reggae)
- Position 5: Goat (fanta)

#### Clue 4:
- The owner of the frog is on the left of the fan of disco.
- The fan of disco is in position 5 (cola).

Therefore, the owner of the frog must be in position 4 (since position 4 is the fan of reggae, and position 5 is the fan of disco).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rabbit (owner of the rabbit)
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 3: Almond-milk (fan of metal)
- Position 4: Frog (owner of the frog)
- Position 5: Goat (fanta, fan of disco)
