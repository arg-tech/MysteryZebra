3. The person driving the train is on the left of the person driving the skateboard.
4. The person watching superhero movies is in an odd position (1st or 3rd).
5. The person watching western movies is the person watching western movies (redundant).
6. The person driving the snowmobile is on the far right.

13. The fisherman is the person driving the train.
14. The person driving the snowmobile is the analyst.
15. The owner of the rat is on the left or right of the analyst.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 14**: The person driving the snowmobile is the analyst. This means Analyst = Snowmobile.
2. **Clue 6**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the far right. Therefore, Analyst is in position 4.
3. **Clue 13**: The fisherman is the person driving the train. Therefore, Fisherman = Train.
4. **Clue 13 and 15**: Since the fisherman is the person driving the train and the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the analyst, the analyst (position 4) must be on the far right, so the owner of the rat could be in positions 2 or 3.

5. **Clue 11**: The accountant is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the analyst is in position 4, the accountant can only be in position 1 or 2.
6. **Clue 3**: The person driving the train (fisherman) is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since the fisherman is in position 4, the skateboard must be in position 3.
7. **Clue 2**: The person driving the snowmobile (analyst) is on the right of the person whose sport is biathlon. So, the biathlon must be in position 2.
8. **Clue 8**: The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person whose sport is golf. Since biathlon is in position 2 and skateboard is in position 3, quad-bike must be in position 1, and golf in position 4 (but analyst is already in position 4, so this is consistent).
9. **Clue 4**: The person watching superhero movies is in an odd position (1st or 3rd). Since the skateboard is in position 3, superhero movies must be in position 1.
10. **Clue 10**: The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies. Since superhero is in position 1, adventure must be in position 2 or 3, but biathlon is in position 2, so adventure must be in position 3.
11. **Clue 7**: The person whose sport is parkour is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since the rat is in position 2 or 3, and parkour cannot be in position 3 (superhero), it must be in position 2.
12. **Clue 9**: The fisherman is on the left or right of the person watching family movies. Since the fisherman is in position 4 and the person watching family movies cannot be in position 4, they must be in position 1 or 3, but superhero is in position 1, so family movies must be in position 3.
13. **Clue 12**: The owner of the rabbit is between the person watching superhero movies and the owner of the dog. Since superhero is in position 1 and family movies are in position 3, the rabbit owner must be in position 2, and the dog owner must be in position 3 (family movies).

   - This means the person watching thriller movies and the person whose sport is cycling are in the same position.

6. **Person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the far left.**
   - This means the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 1.

7. **Person drinking sprite is in an even position (2, 4).**
   - This means the person drinking sprite is in position 2 or 4.

8. **Person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is camping.**
   - Since the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 1, the person whose hobby is camping must be in position 2.

9. **Person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.**
   - Since the person watching thriller movies is the person whose sport is cycling, and the person drinking sprite is in position 2 or 4, the person watching thriller movies can be in position 2 or 3.

10. **Person whose hobby is board-games is the person whose sport is soccer.**
    - This means the person whose hobby is board-games and the person whose sport is soccer are in the same position.

11. **Person drinking juice is on the far left.**

12. **Fan of blues is on the left of the person watching animation movies.**
    - This means if someone is a fan of blues, they are in position 1 or 2, and the person watching animation movies is in position 2 or 3.

13. **Fan of electronic is on the far left.**
    - This means the person who is a fan of electronic is in position 1.

Now let's start placing the information based on these clues:

- **Position 1:** Person drinking juice and fan of electronic.
- **Position 2:** Person whose hobby is camping.
- **Position 3:** Person watching comedy movies.
- **Position 4:** Person drinking sprite.

From clue 6, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 1, so:
- Position 1: Magic-tricks, drinking juice, fan of electronic.

From clue 8, since the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 1, the person whose hobby is camping must be in position 2:
- Position 2: Camping.

From clue 1, the person whose sport is climbing is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is in position 3, the person whose sport is climbing must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is already taken by magic-tricks, so it must be in position 2:
- Position 2: Camping, sport is climbing.

From clue 5, the person watching thriller movies is the person whose sport is cycling. Since the person whose sport is climbing is in position 2, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3 or 4. But the person watching comedy movies is in position 3, so the person watching thriller movies must be in position 4:
- Position 4: Thriller, sport is cycling.

From clue 7, the person drinking sprite is in an even position, and since position 2 is already taken by camping, the person drinking sprite must be in position 4:
- Position 4: Thriller, sport is cycling, drinking sprite.

From clue 3, the person drinking cola is in an odd position, and since positions 1 and 3 are taken, the person drinking cola must be in position 3:
- Position 3: Comedy, drinking cola.

From clue 13, the fan of blues is on the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is in position 3, the person watching animation movies must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is already taken by thriller, so the person watching animation movies must be in position 5, and the fan of blues must be in position 4:
- Position 4: Thriller, sport is cycling, drinking sprite, fan of blues.

From clue 12, the fan of blues is on the left of the person watching animation movies, which is consistent with our placement.

From clue 10, the person whose hobby is board-games is the person whose sport is soccer. Since the person whose sport is cycling is in position 4, the person whose sport is soccer must be in position 3:
- Position 3: Comedy, drinking cola, hobby is board-games.

From clue 11, the person drinking juice is on the far left, which is consistent with our placement.

From clue 12, the fan of blues is on the left of the person watching animation movies, which is consistent with our placement.

Finally, the remaining positions and preferences should be filled out as follows:
- Position 1: Magic-tricks, drinking juice, fan of electronic.
- Position 2: Camping, sport is climbing.
- Position 3: Comedy, drinking cola, hobby is board-games.
- Position 4: Thriller, sport is cycling, drinking sprite, fan of blues.
- Position 5: Animation, no specific preference given.

From Clue 8 and Clue 2:
- Motorbike must be in position 2 (right of Train).

From Clue 1 and Clue 2:
- Cricket must be in position 1 or 3.
- House must be in position 2 (left of Motorbike).

Since Train is in position 1, and Cricket cannot be in position 1 (it would conflict with House being in position 2), Cricket must be in position 3.
- House must be in position 2 (left of Motorbike).

From Clue 13:
- Rowing -> Pineapple.
- Since Cricket is in position 3, Rowing must be in position 4.

From Clue 11 and Clue 12:
- Jazz -> Cricket (left) and Jazz -> Pilot (right).
- So, Pilot must be in position 4 (right of Jazz).

From Clue 10 and Clue 14:
- Orange -> Indie.
- Indie -> Nectarine (left of Nectarine).

From Clue 4 and Clue 5:
- Climbing -> Architect (left or right).
- Since Cricket is in position 3, Climbing must be in position 2 (right of Architect).

From Clue 6:
- Cricket -> Rowing (left or right).
- Since Cricket is in position 3 and Rowing is in position 4, no new information here.

From Clue 5:
- Subway -> Nectarine (left or right).
- Since Nectarine is in position 4, Subway must be in position 2 (right of Architect).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The owner of the cat is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Cat

2. **Clue 11**: The scientist is in an odd position (1, 3).

3. **Clue 12**: The person who's hobby is board-games is the scientist.
   - Position 3: Scientist, Hobby = Board-Games

4. **Clue 6**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
   - Since the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 3, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 4**: The fan of trance is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the snowmobile.
   - The person driving the snowmobile is in position 2, so the fan of trance must be in position 3 (but we already know position 3 is the scientist). Thus, the fan of trance must be in position 1 or 4. However, since the scientist is in position 3, the fan of trance must be in position 4.

6. **Clue 14**: The librarian is on the left or right of the bartender.
   - This doesn't give us exact positions yet, but it helps to narrow down the possibilities later.

7. **Clue 10**: The librarian is on the left of the bartender.
   - This means the librarian is in position 1 or 2, and the bartender is in position 2 or 3. But since the cat is in position 1 and the scientist is in position 3, the librarian must be in position 2 and the bartender in position 3.

8. **Clue 13**: The scientist is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.

9. **Clue 1**: The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the snake.
   - This means the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 1 or 2, and the owner of the snake must be in position 2 or 3. But since the cat is in position 1 and the scientist is in position 3, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 2 and the owner of the snake in position 3 (but scientist is there, so this is not possible). Thus, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 1 and the owner of the snake in position 2.

10. **Clue 2**: The fan of rock is the person who's hobby is gardening.
    - This means the person with the hobby of gardening has the music genre of rock.

    - The person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 2 (bar librarian) or 4 (trance fan).

    - The owner of the horse must be in position 2 (bar librarian) or 4 (trance fan).

- **Nurse**: Position 2

Now, let's place the documentary movie watcher:

- **Documentary movie watcher**: Position 3 (since the nurse is in position 2 and the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the nurse)

- **Owner of the goldfish**: Position 3 (since they watch documentaries)

Next, place the blueberry eater:

- **Blueberry eater**: Security-guard (Position 4, as given)

Now, place the person with volleyball:

- **Volleyball**: Between skateboarding and blueberry (Position 3 or 4). Since blueberry is in position 4, volleyball must be in position 2.

- **Skateboarding**: Before volleyball (Position 1)

Now, place the handball and chinchilla:

- **Chinchilla owner**: Even position (2 or 4), but since the blueberry eater is in position 4, the chinchilla owner must be in position 2.

7. **Clue 13**: The person whose hobby is skydiving is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.
   - Since the Spanish (dancing) is in position 1, the person whose hobby is skydiving must be in position 2 or 3. But since position 2 is occupied by the person eating cauliflower, the skydiver must be in position 3.

8. **Clue 14**: The person whose hobby is hiking is on the right of the Spanish.

Lv4-5x4-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and the provided table format.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The owner of the hamster is on the far left or far right.
2. The person watching disaster movies is the person whose sport is badminton.
3. The person driving the bike is in an even position (position 2 or 4).
4. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
5. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the Indonesian.
6. The person driving the skateboard is the person watching superhero movies.
7. The person watching zombie movies is in an even position (position 2 or 4).
8. The owner of the snake is on the left or right of the person driving the bike.
9. The person whose sport is cycling is the person driving the snowmobile.
10. The owner of the snake is on the far left.
11. The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the owner of the hamster.
12. The person whose sport is badminton is on the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
13. The Thai is on the left of the owner of the frog.
14. The Indian is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Positioning the Hamster Owner:
From clue 1, the hamster owner is at position 1 or 4.

#### Positioning the Disaster Movie Watcher:
From clue 2, the disaster movie watcher is the badminton player. From clue 4, the disaster movie watcher is on the right of the superhero movie watcher. Therefore, if the badminton player is at position 2 or 4, the superhero movie watcher must be at position 1 or 3 respectively. But since the badminton player cannot be at position 1 (as it would conflict with the Indian being in an odd position), the badminton player must be at position 4. Thus, the superhero movie watcher must be at position 3.

#### Positioning the Skateboard Driver:
From clue 6, the skateboard driver is the superhero movie watcher, which is at position 3. From clue 5, the skateboard driver is to the left of the Indonesian. Therefore, the Indonesian must be at position 4 (but position 4 is already occupied by the badminton player). This means the Indonesian cannot be at position 4, so they must be at position 2 or 1.

#### Positioning the Zombie Movie Watcher:
From clue 7, the zombie movie watcher is in an even position (position 2 or 4). Since position 4 is already occupied by the badminton player, the zombie movie watcher must be at position 2.

#### Positioning the Bike Driver:
From clue 3, the bike driver is in an even position (position 2 or 4). Since position 2 is already occupied by the zombie movie watcher, the bike driver must be at position 4. But position 4 is already occupied by the badminton player, so this must be incorrect. Therefore, the bike driver must be at position 2.

#### Positioning the Motorbike Driver:
From clue 11, the motorbike driver is on the left of the hamster owner. The hamster owner is at position 1 or 4. If the hamster owner is at position 4, the motorbike driver would have to be at position 1, but the Indian must be in an odd position (1 or 3) and the Thai must be on the left of the frog owner, which complicates this. So the hamster owner must be at position 1, and the motorbike driver must be at position 2.

#### Positioning the Indian:
From clue 14, the Indian is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since the hamster owner is at position 1, the Indian must be at position 3.

#### Positioning the Thai:
From clue 13, the Thai is on the left of the frog owner. Since the Indian is at position 3, the Thai must be at position 1 (which conflicts with the hamster owner). Therefore, the Thai must be at position 2, and the frog owner must be at position 4.

#### Final Positions:
- Position 1: Thai, Frog Owner
- Position 2: Indian, Skateboard Driver (Superhero Movie Watcher)
- Position 3: Indonesian, Bike Driver
- Position 4: Badminton Player, Disaster Movie Watcher
