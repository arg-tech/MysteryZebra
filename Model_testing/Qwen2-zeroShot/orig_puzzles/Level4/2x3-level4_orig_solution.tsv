Lv4-2x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and place the information step-by-step.

### Clue Analysis:
1. The person eating cauliflower is in an even position.
2. The architect is on the left or right of the firefighter.
3. The architect is the person eating pineapple.
4. The person eating pomegranate is on the far left.
5. The engineer is the engineer (this clue doesn't provide new information but confirms that there is an engineer).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person eating pomegranate is on the far left. So, we can start with:
   ```
   | Food   | Pomegranate |             |           |
   | Job    |             |             |           |
   ```

2. **Clue 3**: The architect is the person eating pineapple. Therefore, the person eating pineapple cannot be the one eating pomegranate, which means the architect must be in either position 2 or 3. Since the architect cannot be in position 1 (because it's pomegranate), the architect must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person eating cauliflower is in an even position. Therefore, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2 or 4. However, since position 4 is not available, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 2**: The architect is on the left or right of the firefighter. Given the positions, the only possible arrangement for the architect and firefighter is:
   - If the architect is in position 2 (eating pineapple), then the firefighter must be in position 3.
   - This satisfies the condition that the architect is on the left or right of the firefighter.

5. **Final Arrangement**:
   - Position 1: Pomegranate (person eating pomegranate)
   - Position 2: Pineapple (architect)
   - Position 3: Cauliflower (firefighter)

Since the engineer is just mentioned as an occupation without additional constraints, we can assume the remaining job goes to the remaining person. The only job left is the engineer, so the engineer must be in position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is already taken by the person eating pomegranate, the engineer must be in position 3.

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|        |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Food   | Pomegranate |  Pineapple  | Cauliflower |
| Job    | Engineer    | Architect   | Firefighter |

Lv4-2x3-2	"Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step by step.

1. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far right.
2. The person driving the roller is in an even position (which means they must be in position 2).
3. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
4. The person driving the roller is the person driving the roller (redundant information).

Given these clues, we can start filling in the table:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 3 (Far Right) for Board-Games:**
   - Position 3 must be board-games.

2. **Roller in Position 2:**
   - Position 2 must be roller.

3. **Taxi Left of Filmmaking:**
   - Since the person in position 2 is roller, the person in position 1 must be taxi or drawing.
   - The person with the hobby of filmmaking must be in position 3, which is already taken by board-games.
   - Therefore, the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 1, and the person with the hobby of filmmaking must be in position 3 (board-games), leaving position 2 as roller.

Now let's assign the remaining hobbies and transports based on the positions:

- Position 1: Drawing (since it must be to the left of filmmaking)
- Position 2: Roller (given)
- Position 3: Board-Games (given)

For transport:
- Position 1: Taxi (left of filmmaking)
- Position 2: Roller (given)
- Position 3: Taxi (not possible since the person in position 3 has board-games, so it must be boat)

So the final table looks like this:

```
|             |    1    |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby       | Drawing | Filmmaking | Board-games |
| Transport   | Taxi    | Roller     | Boat        |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |    1    |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby       | Drawing | Filmmaking | Board-games |
| Transport   | Taxi    | Roller     | Boat        |

Lv4-2x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and use the given clues to fill in the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the fan of dubstep.
2. The fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
3. The person who's hobby is photography is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of Photography**: According to clue 3, the person with the hobby of photography must be in an even position (i.e., position 2). So, we can place ""photography"" in position 2.

2. **Positions for Baking and Electronic**: Since photography is in position 2, positions 1 and 3 are left for baking and electronic. Clue 2 states that the fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of dubstep. This means the fan of electronic cannot be in position 3 because then there would be no space for the fan of dubstep. Therefore, electronic must be in position 1, and dubstep must be in position 3.

3. **Baking Position**: According to clue 1, the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the fan of dubstep. Since dubstep is in position 3, baking must be in position 2. But we already placed photography in position 2, so this confirms that electronic must be in position 1 and dubstep must be in position 3, and photography must be in position 2.

### Final Table Configuration:

|               |     1      |      2      |   3    |
| Hobby         | electronic | photography | baking |

Lv4-2x3-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is gardening is between the person who's hobby is camping and the Canadian.**
   - This means the order must be: Camping -> Gardening -> Canadian or Canadian -> Gardening -> Camping.
   
2. **The person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position.**
   - This means the person with the chess hobby is either in position 1 or 3.

3. **The Dutch is on the left of the Canadian.**
   - This means the Dutch nationality must be to the left of the Canadian nationality.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Position of Chess Hobby
Since the chess hobbyist is in an odd position, they can only be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2: Determine the Possible Orderings Based on Gardening
We need to place the gardening hobbyist such that it is between the camping and the Canadian.

- If the chess hobbyist is in position 1:
  - The possible orders for camping and gardening are:
    - Position 2: Gardening, Position 3: Canadian (Camping -> Gardening -> Canadian)
    - Position 2: Canadian, Position 3: Gardening (Canadian -> Gardening -> Camping)

- If the chess hobbyist is in position 3:
  - The possible orders for camping and gardening are:
    - Position 1: Canadian, Position 2: Gardening (Canadian -> Gardening -> Camping)
    - Position 1: Gardening, Position 2: Canadian (Gardening -> Canadian -> Camping)

#### Step 3: Incorporate the Dutch and Canadian Constraint
- The Dutch must be to the left of the Canadian.

#### Step 4: Combine All Constraints
Let's test each scenario:

**Scenario 1: Chess in Position 1**
- Position 1: Chess
- Possible orders for camping and gardening:
  - Position 2: Gardening, Position 3: Canadian (Camping -> Gardening -> Canadian)
  - Position 2: Canadian, Position 3: Gardening (Canadian -> Gardening -> Camping)

- Check Dutch and Canadian:
  - For (Camping -> Gardening -> Canadian): Dutch cannot be to the left of Canadian.
  - For (Canadian -> Gardening -> Camping): Dutch can be in Position 1 (Dutch -> Canadian -> Gardening -> Camping).

This works. So we have:
- Position 1: Dutch
- Position 2: Canadian
- Position 3: Gardening
- Position 4: Camping

**Scenario 2: Chess in Position 3**
- Position 3: Chess
- Possible orders for camping and gardening:
  - Position 1: Canadian, Position 2: Gardening (Canadian -> Gardening -> Chess)
  - Position 1: Gardening, Position 2: Canadian (Gardening -> Canadian -> Chess)

- Check Dutch and Canadian:
  - For (Canadian -> Gardening -> Chess): Dutch can be in Position 1 (Dutch -> Canadian -> Gardening -> Chess).
  - For (Gardening -> Canadian -> Chess): Dutch cannot be to the left of Canadian.

This also works. So we have:
- Position 1: Dutch
- Position 2: Canadian
- Position 3: Chess
- Position 4: Gardening

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Hobby         | Camping   | Gardening | Chess    |
| Nationality   | Dutch     | Canadian  |         |
```

Or another valid solution:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Hobby         | Camping   | Gardening | Chess    |
| Nationality   | Dutch     | Canadian  |         |

Both solutions fit the constraints."
Lv4-2x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is baking is the person who's sport is lacrosse.**
   - This means the person with the hobby ""baking"" and the sport ""lacrosse"" is in the same row.

2. **The person who's sport is tennis is the person who's hobby is collecting.**
   - This means the person with the hobby ""collecting"" and the sport ""tennis"" is in the same row.

3. **The person who's hobby is collecting is in an odd position.**
   - Since there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), the odd positions are 1 and 3. Therefore, the person with the hobby ""collecting"" must be in either position 1 or 3.

4. **The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.**
   - The person with the sport ""tennis"" must be in a position to the left of the person with the hobby ""filmmaking.""

### Deduction:

- From Clue 2, the person with the hobby ""collecting"" and the sport ""tennis"" must be in one of the odd positions (1 or 3).
- From Clue 3, since the person with the hobby ""collecting"" is in an odd position, they must be in position 1 or 3.
- From Clue 4, the person with the hobby ""filmmaking"" must be to the right of the person with the sport ""tennis."" So, if the person with the sport ""tennis"" is in position 1, the person with the hobby ""filmmaking"" must be in position 2 or 3. But since the person with the hobby ""collecting"" is already in position 1, the person with the sport ""tennis"" cannot be in position 1. Thus, the person with the sport ""tennis"" must be in position 3, and the person with the hobby ""filmmaking"" must be in position 2.

Given these deductions:
- Position 1: The person with the hobby ""collecting"" and the sport ""tennis.""
- Position 2: The person with the hobby ""filmmaking.""
- Position 3: The person with the hobby ""baking"" and the sport ""lacrosse.""

### Final Solution Table:

```
|         |     1      |     2      |    3     |
| Hobby   | collecting | filmmaking | baking   |
| Sport   | tennis     |            | lacrosse |
```

This satisfies all the given clues."
Lv4-2x3-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.**
   - This means if the documentary watcher is in position 1, the horror watcher must be in position 2 or 3.
   
2. **The person watching documentary movies is between the owner of the turtle and the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - This implies that the documentary watcher is in position 2 (since it must be between two other positions).
   
3. **The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies.**
   - This reinforces point 1, so the documentary watcher must be in position 1, the horror watcher in position 2, and the martial-arts watcher in position 3.
   
4. **The owner of the dog is in an even position.**
   - This means the dog owner must be in position 2 or 4. But since we only have three positions, the dog owner must be in position 2.

### Assigning the Positions:

- **Position 1:** Documentary movies
- **Position 2:** Horror movies
- **Position 3:** Martial-arts movies

### Assigning the Pets:

- The owner of the turtle must be in position 1 because the documentary watcher is in position 1.
- The owner of the dog is in position 2.
- The owner of the turtle is in position 1, and the owner of the dog is in position 2. Therefore, the owner of the turtle is in position 1, and the owner of the dog is in position 2. The only remaining pet for position 3 is the turtle.

So, the final arrangement is:

- Position 1: Turtle
- Position 2: Dog
- Position 3: Turtle

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1       |      2      |   3    |

Lv4-2x3-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clue Breakdown:

1. **The owner of the frog is between the owner of the rat and the person eating artichoke.**
   - This means the order must be: Rat, Frog, Artichoke or Artichoke, Frog, Rat.
   
2. **The owner of the snake is in an odd position.**
   - This means the owner of the snake can only be in position 1 or 3.
   
3. **The owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating kale.**
   - This means the person eating kale cannot be in position 1 (since the rat would not be to its left).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the position of the snake:**
   - The snake must be in an odd position (1 or 3).
   
2. **Consider the placement of the rat and frog based on Clue 1:**
   - If the snake is in position 1, the rat and frog must fit into positions 2 and 3.
   - If the snake is in position 3, the rat and frog must fit into positions 1 and 2.
   
3. **Use Clue 3 to determine the position of kale:**
   - Since the owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating kale, kale cannot be in position 1.

Let's try the first scenario where the snake is in position 1:

- Position 1: Snake
- Position 2: Rat (since the owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating kale)
- Position 3: Frog (since the owner of the frog is between the owner of the rat and the person eating artichoke)

Now, we need to assign the food items:
- The person eating artichoke must be in position 3 (since the frog is between the rat and the artichoke).
- The person eating kale cannot be in position 1 (the owner of the rat is on its left), so it must be in position 2.

This gives us:

- Position 1: Snake
- Position 2: Kale (rat's owner)
- Position 3: Artichoke (frog's owner)

Since all the clues are satisfied with this arrangement, the final table is:

```
|        |   1    |  2   |     3     |
| Food   | Kale   | Artichoke | Carrot    |
| Pet    | Snake  | Rat     | Frog      |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|        |   1    |  2   |     3     |
| Food   | Kale   | Artichoke | Carrot    |
| Pet    | Snake  | Rat     | Frog      |

Lv4-2x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and place the information into the given table.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person who's sport is tennis is in an odd position.**
   - This means the person who likes tennis can be in position 1 or 3.

2. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the fan of ambient.**
   - This means the person who likes lacrosse must be to the left of the person who likes ambient.

3. **The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the fan of dubstep.**
   - This means the person who likes tennis must be to the left of the person who likes dubstep.

4. **The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.**
   - This means the person who likes tennis is either directly next to or directly opposite the person who likes lacrosse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of Tennis
From clue 1, we know that the person who likes tennis can only be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2: Position of Lacrosse
From clue 2, the person who likes lacrosse must be on the left of the fan of ambient. Since the person who likes tennis can only be in position 1 or 3, and the person who likes lacrosse must be on the left of the fan of ambient, the person who likes lacrosse cannot be in position 3 (since there would be no one to the left of them).

Therefore, the person who likes lacrosse must be in position 1.

#### Step 3: Position of Tennis and Dubstep
From clue 3, the person who likes tennis is on the left of the fan of dubstep. Since the person who likes lacrosse is in position 1, the person who likes tennis must be in position 2 (to be on the left of the fan of dubstep) and the fan of dubstep must be in position 3.

#### Step 4: Confirming Positions
- The person who likes lacrosse is in position 1.
- The person who likes tennis is in position 2.
- The person who likes dubstep is in position 3.

From clue 4, the person who likes tennis (position 2) is either directly next to or directly opposite the person who likes lacrosse (position 1). This is satisfied as the person who likes tennis is indeed directly next to the person who likes lacrosse.

### Explanation:
- **Position 1:** Lacrosse (from clue 2 and 4)
- **Position 2:** Tennis (from clue 3 and 4)
- **Position 3:** Lacrosse (from clue 1)

Since the person who likes tennis is in position 2, the person who likes dubstep must be in position 3 (clue 3), leaving the person who likes funk in position 1.

Lv4-2x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the positions step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person eating corn is on the right of the person drinking cola.
2. The person eating pineapple is in an even position (i.e., position 2).
3. The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person drinking 7up.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The person eating pineapple is in position 2.
   - So, we can place ""pineapple"" in position 2 for food.

2. **Clue 3**: The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
   - This means the person drinking 7up must be in position 1 because the pineapple is in position 2.
   - Therefore, position 1 is ""7up"" and position 2 is ""pineapple"".

3. **Clue 1**: The person eating corn is on the right of the person drinking cola.
   - Since position 1 is ""7up"", the person drinking cola must be in position 3 to satisfy clue 1.
   - Therefore, position 3 is ""cola"".
   - Position 2 is already ""pineapple"".
   - This leaves position 2 as the only position for corn.

So, we have:
- Position 1: 7up (drinking)
- Position 2: Pineapple (eating)
- Position 3: Cola (drinking)

Now, let's fill in the table with these deductions:

```
|            |   1    |     2     |   3    |
