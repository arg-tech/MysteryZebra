Lv4-7x3-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4:** The accountant is the owner of the turtle.
2. **Clue 14:** The Chinese is in an odd position (either 1 or 3).
3. **Clue 10:** The Chinese is the accountant.
4. **Clue 4 and Clue 14:** Since the Chinese is the accountant and in an odd position, the Chinese must be in position 1 or 3.
5. **Clue 13:** The person who's sport is swimming is on the far right (position 3).
6. **Clue 5:** The Australian is on the left of the person eating onion.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is baseball is the person eating apple.
8. **Clue 6:** The person eating onion is on the right of the Australian.
9. **Clue 8:** The fan of folk is in the middle (position 2).

Now let's fill in what we know so far:

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
|---------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Food          |  onion   |  unknown   |  apple     |
| Hobby         |  unknown |  folk      |  unknown   |
| Job           |  accountant |  unknown  |  unknown   |
| Music-Genre   |  unknown |  unknown   |  unknown   |
| Nationality   |  australian |  unknown  |  chinese   |
| Pet           |  unknown |  unknown   |  frog      |
| Sport         |  unknown |  unknown   |  swimming  |

Next, let's use more clues to fill in the gaps:

10. **Clue 11:** The person who's hobby is chess is the Spanish.
11. **Clue 12:** The accountant is on the left or right of the musician.
12. **Clue 1:** The designer is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is traveling.
13. **Clue 2:** The owner of the frog is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle.
14. **Clue 3:** The owner of the turtle is in an odd position.
15. **Clue 9:** The person eating apple is on the right of the fan of folk.

From these clues, we can deduce:

- The person with the turtle is in position 1 (since the Chinese is in position 1 and the Chinese owns the turtle).
- The designer must be in position 2 because the designer is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is traveling, and the person with the turtle (Chinese) is in position 1.
- The person with the frog is in position 3 because the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle, and the owner of the turtle is in position 1.
- The person with the onion is in position 1 (since the Australian is on the left of the person eating onion, and the Chinese is in position 1, the Australian cannot be in position 1).

So, the updated table is:

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
|---------------|----------|------------|------------|

| Pet           |  unknown |  unknown   |  frog      |
| Sport         |  unknown |  unknown   |  swimming  |

Now, let's assign the remaining details:

- The Spanish has the hobby of chess (Clue 11).
- The designer is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is traveling. Since the designer is in position 2, the person with the traveling hobby must be in position 3.
- The accountant is the owner of the turtle (Clue 4), so the accountant is in position 1.
- The person who eats onion is on the left of the Australian (Clue 6), so the person who eats onion is in position 1, which is already filled.
- The person who eats apple is on the right of the fan of folk (Clue 9), so the fan of folk is in position 2, and the person who eats apple is in position 3.
- The person who eats onion is the Australian (Clue 6).
- The person who eats apple is the Chinese (Clue 7).
- The person who eats onion is the fan of disco (Clue 8).
- The person who eats apple is the fan of folk (Clue 9).

So, the final table is:

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
|---------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Food          |  onion   |  disco     |  apple     |

| Pet           |  unknown |  unknown   |  frog      |
| Sport         |  unknown |  unknown   |  swimming  |

Since all other details can be inferred from the given constraints, the final solution is:

```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Positions for Beverages and Hip-Hop/Salsa Fans:

Lv4-7x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, we will use the given clues to determine the positions of each attribute for the three individuals. Let's start by organizing the clues and solving step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour.
2. The fan of pop is on the left or right of the scientist.

8. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the Egyptian.
9. The security-guard is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
10. The person who's hobby is dancing is in an even position.
11. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the fan of blues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5: The Chinese is on the far left.
This means the first column is occupied by the Chinese.

#### Clue 6: The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the scientist.
Let's denote the scientist as S and the filmmaker as F. We know that S is on the left of F.

#### Clue 10: The person who's hobby is dancing is in an even position.
Dancing can only be in position 2 (since there are only three positions).

#### Clue 7: The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour.
Let's denote the person with parkour as P. The hedgehog owner must be to the right of P.

#### Clue 4: The person drinking sprite is the owner of the frog.
Let's denote the person drinking sprite as S.

#### Clue 9: The security-guard is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
Let's denote the security-guard as G and the person drinking iced-tea as I. G is on the left of I.

#### Clue 11: The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the fan of blues.
I is on the left of the person who likes blues.

#### Clue 3: The fan of country is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
Let's denote the person with golf as G and the filmmaker as F. The fan of country must be between G and F.

#### Clue 2: The fan of pop is on the left or right of the scientist.
The fan of pop is either next to S or at one end.

#### Clue 8: The fan of blues is on the left or right of the Egyptian.
The fan of blues is either next to E or at one end.

Now let's place the elements based on these clues:

1. **Chinese** (Clue 5) - Position 1
2. **Dancing** (Clue 10) - Position 2
3. **Filmmaking** (Clue 6) - Position 3 (since it is to the right of the scientist)

Given the above, the scientist (S) must be in position 1, and the filmmaker (F) must be in position 3.

Next, we need to determine the other attributes:

- **Sprite** (Clue 4) - Since the sprite drinker is the owner of the frog, and the sprite drinker must be in position 2 (dancing), the frog owner is also in position 2.
- **Hedgehog** (Clue 7) - The hedgehog owner must be to the right of the parkour person. Since the parkour person cannot be in position 3 (filmmaker), they must be in position 1 (Chinese). Therefore, the hedgehog owner is in position 3.
- **Parkour** (Clue 7) - The parkour person is in position 1 (Chinese).
- **Security-guard** (Clue 9) - The security-guard must be in position 1 (Chinese) or 2 (dancing). Since the Chinese is in position 1, the security-guard must be in position 2 (dancing).
- **Iced-tea** (Clue 9 and Clue 11) - The iced-tea drinker is in position 2 (dancing), and they are to the left of the fan of blues. Therefore, the fan of blues must be in position 3 (filmmaker).
- **Blues** (Clue 8) - The fan of blues is in position 3 (filmmaker).
- **Pop** (Clue 2) - The fan of pop is next to the scientist (position 1). Therefore, the fan of pop is in position 3 (filmmaker).
- **Country** (Clue 3) - The fan of country is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Therefore, the person with golf is in position 1 (Chinese), and the person with filmmaking is in position 3 (filmmaker). The fan of country must be in position 2 (dancing).
- **Egyptian** (Clue 8) - The Egyptian is in position 1 (Chinese) or 3 (filmmaker). Since the Chinese is in position 1, the Egyptian must be in position 3 (filmmaker).
- **Blues** (Clue 11) - The fan of blues is in position 3 (filmmaker).

Finally, we can fill in the table:

- The person who plays baseball (position 1) is also the librarian (position 1).
- Therefore, the librarian is at position 1.

#### Position 2:
- The person drinking lemonade (position 2) is on the right of the social-worker (position 2).
- Since the librarian is at position 1, the social-worker must be at position 2.
