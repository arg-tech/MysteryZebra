Lv10-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and deducing the correct positions for each category.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person eating banana is the fan metal or the person eating banana is the person watching horror movies, but not both.**
   - This means the person who eats banana cannot be both a fan of metal and watching horror movies.

2. **The fan soul is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies.**
   - The person who prefers soul music must be positioned to the left of the person who watches musical movies.

3. **The person watching horror movies is in an even position.**
   - The person who watches horror movies must be in position 2 (since positions are 1, 2, 3).

4. **The fan electronic is somewhere to the left of the fan soul.**
   - The person who prefers electronic music must be positioned to the left of the person who prefers soul music.

5. **The fan electronic is not to the right of the person eating peach.**
   - The person who prefers electronic music cannot be in a position to the right of the person who eats peach.

6. **The Brazilian is not to the left of the person eating cranberry.**
   - The Brazilian cannot be in position 1 if the person eating cranberry is in position 2 or 3.

7. **The person eating cranberry is the Australian.**
   - The Australian is the person who eats cranberry.

8. **The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the Brazilian.**
   - The person who watches adventure movies must be in a position to the left of the Brazilian.

9. **The person eating peach is the fan metal.**
   - The person who eats peach must be a fan of metal music.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. From clue 3, the person watching horror movies is in position 2.
   - Position 2: Horror Movies

2. From clue 7, the person eating cranberry is the Australian.
   - Position 3: Cranberry, Australian

3. From clue 8, the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the Brazilian.
   - Since the Brazilian cannot be in position 1 (clue 6), the only possible position for the Brazilian is position 3.
   - Therefore, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 1.

4. From clue 1, the person eating banana cannot be both a fan of metal and watching horror movies.
   - Since the person watching horror movies is in position 2, the person eating banana cannot be in position 2.
   - Also, the person eating banana is the fan of metal (clue 9).
   - Therefore, the person eating banana must be in position 1 or 3. But since position 1 is occupied by the person watching adventure movies, the person eating banana must be in position 3.
   - Position 3: Peach, Metal Fan, Australian

5. From clue 9, the person eating peach is the fan metal.
   - This confirms that the person eating peach (position 3) is the fan of metal.

6. From clue 2, the fan soul is to the left of the person watching musical movies.
   - Since the person watching horror movies (position 2) is not the fan of soul, the person in position 1 (watching adventure movies) cannot be the fan of soul.
   - Therefore, the person in position 3 (eating peach) is not the fan of soul.
   - The only remaining positions for the fan of soul are positions 1 or 2.
   - Since the person in position 2 is watching horror movies, the fan of soul must be in position 1.
   - Position 1: Soul Fan, Adventure Movies

7. From clue 4, the fan electronic is to the left of the fan soul.
   - The fan electronic must be in position 1 (Soul Fan) or position 2 (Horror Movies).
   - Since the person in position 1 is the fan of soul, the person in position 2 cannot be the fan of electronic.
   - Therefore, the person in position 2 (Horror Movies) must be the fan of electronic.
   - Position 2: Electronic Fan, Horror Movies

8. From clue 5, the fan electronic is not to the right of the person eating peach.
   - This is already satisfied as the fan electronic is in position 2 and the person eating peach is in position 3.

9. From clue 6, the Brazilian is not to the left of the person eating cranberry.
   - Since the Brazilian is in position 3 and the person eating cranberry is also in position 3, this is satisfied.

Lv10-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The fan of pop and the person who's hobby is card-games have the same parity positions.
2. The owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
3. The owner of the goat is the fan of metal or the fan of metal is the Malaysian, but not both.
4. The fan of pop is on the left or right of the owner of the pony.
5. The owner of the goat is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
6. The person who's hobby is card-games and the owner of the ferret have the same parity positions.
7. The owner of the goat is not the person who's hobby is drawing.
8. The owner of the ferret is the fan of pop.
9. The Italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the Malaysian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the fan of pop.
From clue 1 and clue 8, we know that the person who is the fan of pop is also the owner of the ferret (clue 8). Since the fan of pop and the person with the hobby of card-games have the same parity positions (clue 1), they must be in the same column (either all odd or all even).

Since the owner of the ferret is the fan of pop, let's assume the fan of pop is in position 1 (the only way to satisfy the parity condition for card-games being in an odd position).

So, we can place:
- Fan of Pop: 1
- Owner of Ferret: 1

#### Step 2: Determine the hobby of the person in position 1.
From clue 6, the person who's hobby is card-games and the owner of the ferret have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the ferret is in position 1, the person with the hobby of card-games must also be in position 1.

So, we can place:
- Hobby: Card-games (1)

#### Step 3: Determine the nationality of the person in position 1.
From clue 9, the Italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the Malaysian. Therefore, the person in position 1 cannot be the Italian because there would be no room for the other two nationalities in the remaining positions.

So, the person in position 1 could be either Malaysian or Nigerian. Let's assume it is Malaysian for now.

#### Step 4: Determine the pet of the person in position 1.
From clue 8, the owner of the ferret is the fan of pop. Therefore, the pet of the person in position 1 is a ferret.

So, we can place:
- Pet: Ferret (1)

#### Step 5: Determine the hobby of the person in position 3.
From clue 2, the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. From clue 3, the owner of the goat is the fan of metal or the fan of metal is the Malaysian, but not both. Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the fan of metal cannot be the Malaysian.

So, the owner of the goat must be the fan of metal. Since the owner of the goat is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing (clue 5) and the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (clue 2), the person in position 3 cannot be the owner of the pony or the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

Therefore, the person in position 3 must be the person who's hobby is drawing.

So, we can place:
- Hobby: Drawing (3)

#### Step 6: Determine the nationality of the person in position 3.
Since the Italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the Malaysian, and the Malaysian is in position 1, the person in position 3 must be the Italian.

So, we can place:
- Nationality: Italian (3)

#### Step 7: Determine the pet of the person in position 3.
From clue 3, the owner of the goat is the fan of metal. Since the fan of pop is the owner of the ferret and the owner of the goat is the fan of metal, the person in position 3 must be the owner of the goat.

So, we can place:
- Pet: Goat (3)

#### Step 8: Determine the hobby of the person in position 2.
From clue 2, the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the person in position 3 has the hobby of drawing, the person in position 2 must have the hobby of rock-climbing.

So, we can place:
- Hobby: Rock-climbing (2)

#### Step 9: Determine the nationality of the person in position 2.
Since the Italian is in position 3, the person in position 2 must be the Nigerian.

So, we can place:
- Nationality: Nigerian (2)

#### Step 10: Determine the pet of the person in position 2.
From clue 2, the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the person in position 2 has the hobby of rock-climbing, the person in position 2 must be the owner of the pony.

So, we can place:
- Pet: Pony (2)

#### Final Table:
```
|               |       1       |    2    |     3      |
| Hobby         | Card-games   | Rock-climbing | Drawing   |

Lv10-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching action movies is on the far right.
2. The musician is the person watching action movies or the person watching action movies is the person driving the ship, but not both.
3. The person driving the ship is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
4. The person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the person driving the ship.
5. The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the photographer.
6. The person driving the ship is not the photographer.
7. The person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the person watching zombie movies.
8. The person who's hobby is chess and the person driving the jet-ski have different parity positions (i.e., if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position).
9. The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Action Movies Position
From clue 1, the person watching action movies is in position 3.

|               |     1     |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         |           |              | Chess    |
| Job           |           |              | Musician |
| Movie-Genre   |           |              | Action   |
| Transport     |           |              | Ship     |

#### Step 2: Musician Position
From clue 2, either the musician is in position 3 (watching action movies) or the person driving the ship is in position 3. Since we already placed the musician in position 3, the person driving the ship cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the musician cannot be in position 3.

#### Step 3: Ship and Jet-Ski Drivers
From clue 3, the person driving the ship is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski. From clue 6, the person driving the ship is not the photographer. So, the photographer must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 5, the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the photographer. Since the photographer is not in position 3, and the person driving the ship cannot be in position 3, the photographer can only be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the photographer is in position 1 for now.

|               | Photographer |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         |             |              | Chess    |
| Job           |             |              | Musician |
| Movie-Genre   |             |              | Action   |
| Transport     | Ship        |              | Jet-ski |

#### Step 4: Zombie Movies Position
From clue 4, the person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is in position 1, the person watching zombie movies cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 1, which is the photographer. However, this contradicts our assumption that the photographer is in position 1. Hence, the photographer must be in position 2.

|               | Photographer |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         |             |              | Chess    |

| Movie-Genre   |             |              | Action   |
| Transport     | Ship        |              | Jet-ski |

#### Step 5: Photographer and Job
From clue 5, the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the photographer. Since the photographer is in position 2, the person driving the ship must be in position 1.

|               | Photographer |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         |             |              | Chess    |

| Transport     | Ship        |              | Jet-ski |

#### Step 6: Parity Check
From clue 8, the person who's hobby is chess and the person driving the jet-ski have different parity positions. The person driving the jet-ski is in position 3, which is an odd position. Therefore, the person with the hobby of chess must be in an even position, which is position 2.

|               | Photographer |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         |             | Gardening   | Chess    |

| Transport     | Ship        | Scooter     | Jet-ski |

#### Step 7: Cooking Position
From clue 9, the person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person driving the scooter is in position 2, the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 3.

|               | Photographer |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         |             | Gardening   | Cooking  |
| Job           | Scientist   |              | Musician |
| Movie-Genre   |             |              | Action   |
| Transport     | Ship        | Scooter     | Jet-ski |

#### Step 8: Job Position
The only job left is the photographer, which is the scientist.

|               | Photographer |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         | Scientist   | Gardening   | Cooking  |

| Transport     | Ship        | Scooter     | Jet-ski |

#### Final Table:

   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      |             |          |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |      sy  |     ambient     |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
   | Nationality   |             |          |           |
   ```

2. The British is in the classical column, so:
   ```
   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      |             |          |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |      sy  |     ambient     |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
   | Nationality   | British     |          |           |
   ```

3. The Fanta column cannot be the first column because the classical fan (British) is already there. So, it must be in the second or third column. But from Clue 6, the classical fan is on the left of the Fanta drinker, so Fanta must be in the third column:
   ```
   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      |             |          |     Fanta     |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |      sy  |     ambient     |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
   | Nationality   | British     |          |           |
   ```

4. The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the fantasy movie watcher cannot be in the last column, it must be in the first column:
   ```
   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      |             |          |     Fanta     |
   | Movie-Genre   | fantasy     |      sy  |     ambient     |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
   | Nationality   | British     |          |           |
   ```

5. The person drinking lemonade and the person watching fantasy movies have different parity positions. Since the fantasy movie watcher is in the first column (odd), the lemonade drinker must be in the second column (even):
   ```
   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      |             | lemonade |     Fanta     |
   | Movie-Genre   | fantasy     |      sy  |     ambient     |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
   | Nationality   | British     |          |           |
   ```

6. The Egyptian is the person drinking lemonade or the person drinking lemonade is the person watching documentary movies, but not both. Since the lemonade drinker is in the second column, the Egyptian cannot be in the documentary movie column (last column). Therefore, the Egyptian must be in the third column (Malaysian):
   ```
   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      |             | lemonade |     Fanta     |
   | Movie-Genre   | fantasy     |      sy  |     ambient     |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian | Malaysian |
   ```

7. The Malaysian and the person drinking Fanta have different parity positions. Since the Fanta drinker is in the third column (odd), the Malaysian must be in the second column (even):
   ```
   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      | milk        | lemonade |     Fanta     |
   | Movie-Genre   | fantasy     |      sy  |     ambient     |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian | Malaysian |
   ```

8. Finally, the person drinking milk must be in the first column, and the person watching documentary movies cannot be to the right of the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is in the second column, the documentary movie watcher must be in the first column, which conflicts with the milk drinker being in the first column. Therefore, the documentary movie watcher must be in the first column, and the milk drinker must be in the second column, making the documentary movie watcher in the first column (British):
   ```
   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      | milk        | lemonade |     Fanta     |
   | Movie-Genre   | documentary |      sy  |     ambient     |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian | Malaysian |
   ```

9. The person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the Egyptian, so the documentary movie watcher must be in the first column (British), and the Egyptian must be in the second column:
   ```
   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      | milk        | lemonade |     Fanta     |
   | Movie-Genre   | documentary |      sy  |     ambient     |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian | Malaysian |
   ```

10. The person watching fantasy movies is in the first column, and the person drinking milk is in the first column, so the person watching fantasy movies is in the first column (British), and the person drinking milk is in the first column (British), which is consistent with all clues.

Finally, we have:

```
|               |      1      |    2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | milk        | lemonade |     Fanta     |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary |      sy  |     ambient     |
| Music-Genre   |             |          |           |
| Nationality   | British     | Egyptian | Malaysian |

Lv10-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The police-officer is in the middle**:
   - This means the police-officer is in position 2.

2. **The German is not to the left of the person eating asparagus**:
   - This means the German cannot be in the first position if the person eating asparagus is in the second or third position.

3. **The person drinking 7up is not the musician**:
   - The person drinking 7up cannot be the musician.

4. **The person drinking water is not the musician**:
   - The person drinking water cannot be the musician.

5. **The German is not to the left of the person eating asparagus**:
   - Similar to clue 2.

6. **The German is the person eating mango or the person drinking water is the German, but not both**:
   - Either the German eats mango or drinks water, but not both.

7. **The electrician is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up**:
   - The electrician must be in a position to the left of the person drinking 7up.

8. **The person eating mango is somewhere between the Thai and the Indian**:
   - The person eating mango must be in a position that is between the Thai and the Indian.

9. **The German is somewhere to the right of the Indian**:
   - The German cannot be in the first position; he must be in the second or third position if the Indian is in the first.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Positioning the Police-Officer:
- The police-officer is in the middle (position 2).

#### Positioning the Electrician:
- The electrician must be to the left of the person drinking 7up.
- Since the police-officer is in position 2, the electrician can only be in position 1 or 3.

#### Positioning the Person Eating Mango:
- The person eating mango must be between the Thai and the Indian.
- This limits the positions for the Thai, Indian, and mango-eater.

#### Positioning the German:
- The German must be to the right of the Indian.
- Also, the German cannot be to the left of the person eating asparagus.

#### Elimination Process:
- Let's assume the German is in position 3 (since the Indian cannot be in position 3 due to the German being to the right).
- If the German is in position 3, the Indian must be in position 1 (the only remaining position to the left of the German).

- Now, the Thai must be in position 2 (the only remaining position).

#### Confirming the Positions:
- The Thai is in position 2 (police-officer).
- The Indian is in position 1.
- The German is in position 3.

#### Determining the Remaining Positions:
- The electrician must be in position 1 (leftmost) since the person drinking 7up must be to the right of the electrician.
- The person drinking 7up cannot be the musician, so it must be either the police-officer or the German.
- Since the police-officer is already in position 2, the person drinking 7up must be the German.

#### Final Clues Verification:
- The person drinking water cannot be the musician, so it must be the Indian (since the German drinks 7up).
- The person eating asparagus cannot be the German (since the German is the one drinking 7up), so it must be the Thai.

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1      |       2        |    3     |
| Beverage      |   Water    |    7up         |  Sprite  |
| Food          | Asparagus  |    Mango       |  Avocado |
| Job           | Electrician| Police-officer | Musician |
| Nationality   |   Indian   |    German      |   Thai   |
```

This satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv10-4x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements in their respective categories (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Sport) while satisfying all the given conditions. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Basketball is somewhere to the right of Video-Games**:
   - This means Video-Games cannot be in position 3 if Basketball is in position 1 or 2.

2. **Basketball is somewhere to the left of Rowing**:
   - This means Rowing cannot be in position 1 or 2 if Basketball is in position 3.

3. **Radish is between Cola and Juice**:
   - This means Radish must be in position 2 if Cola and Juice are in positions 1 and 3, or 3 and 1 respectively.

4. **Drawing is to the right of Basketball**:
   - This means Drawing cannot be in position 1 if Basketball is in position 2 or 3.

5. **Peas is next to Radish**:
   - This means Peas can only be in position 1 or 3 if Radish is in position 2, or vice versa.

6. **Rowing and Peas have the same parity positions**:
   - This means if Rowing is in an odd position, Peas must also be in an odd position, and if Rowing is in an even position, Peas must also be in an even position.

7. **Cola is either Radish or Video-Games, but not both**:
   - This means Cola must be in the same position as either Radish or Video-Games, but not both.

8. **Camping is to the right of Nectarine**:
   - This means Nectarine cannot be in position 3 if Camping is in position 1 or 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions for Sports and Hobbies
From Clues 1 and 2:
- Video-Games cannot be in position 3 if Basketball is in position 1 or 2.
- Rowing cannot be in position 1 or 2 if Basketball is in position 3.

Let's assume:
- Basketball is in position 2 (this satisfies both Clues 1 and 2).
- Then, Rowing must be in position 3.

So, the positions for Sports are:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: Basketball
- Position 3: Rowing

From Clue 4:
- Drawing must be in position 3 because it is to the right of Basketball.

So, the positions for Sports and Hobbies are:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: Basketball
- Position 3: Rowing and Drawing

#### Step 2: Determine the positions for Beverages and Foods
From Clue 3:
- Radish is between Cola and Juice. Since Radish is in position 2, Cola and Juice must be in positions 1 and 3.

So, the positions for Beverages are:
- Position 1: Cola
- Position 2: Radish
- Position 3: Juice

From Clue 7:
- Cola is either Radish or Video-Games, but not both. Since Cola is in position 1, it cannot be Radish (which is in position 2). Therefore, Cola must be Video-Games.

So, the positions for Beverages and Foods are:
- Position 1: Video-Games
- Position 2: Radish
- Position 3: Juice

From Clue 5:
- Peas is next to Radish. Since Radish is in position 2, Peas must be in position 1 or 3.

From Clue 6:
- Rowing and Peas have the same parity positions. Since Rowing is in position 3 (odd), Peas must also be in position 3.

So, the positions for Foods are:
- Position 1: Peas
- Position 2: Radish
- Position 3: Juice

#### Step 3: Determine the remaining positions
From Clue 8:
- Camping is to the right of Nectarine. Since Camping is in position 3, Nectarine must be in position 1.

So, the final table is:

```
|            |      1      |     2      |    3    |
| Beverage   | Video-Games |     Radish |    Juice|
| Food       |      Peas   |    Nectarine|   Radish|
| Hobby      |     Drawing |     Camping|   Video-Games|
| Sport      |    Basketball|   Rowing  |   Tennis|
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |      1      |     2      |    3    |
| Beverage   | Video-Games |     Radish |    Juice|
| Food       |      Peas   |    Nectarine|   Radish|
| Hobby      |     Drawing |     Camping|   Video-Games|

Lv10-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The fan of ambient is not to the right of the Spanish.
2. The Argentine is somewhere between the fan of jazz and the Spanish.
3. The person whose hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person whose hobby is baking.
4. The fan of house is in the middle.
5. The person whose hobby is woodworking is the security guard.
6. The Argentine is the dressmaker or the dressmaker is the fan of ambient, but not both.
7. The Spanish is on the far left or far right.
8. The person whose hobby is writing is the Spanish or the person whose hobby is writing is the fan of jazz, but not both.
9. The electrician is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Spanish
From clue 7, the Spanish is either in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Fan of House
From clue 4, the fan of house is in the middle (position 2).

#### Step 3: Positioning the Spanish
Since the Spanish can only be in position 1 or 3 and the fan of house is in position 2, the Spanish must be in position 1 or 3. But since the fan of house is in the middle, the Spanish cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the Spanish must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 4: Positioning the Argentine
From clue 2, the Argentine is between the fan of jazz and the Spanish. Since the Spanish is in position 1 or 3, and the fan of house is in position 2, the fan of jazz must be in position 3 if the Spanish is in position 1, or in position 1 if the Spanish is in position 3. Therefore, the Argentine must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Spanish: Position 1
- Argentine: Position 2
- Fan of Jazz: Position 3

#### Step 5: Determining Hobbies and Jobs
- From clue 3, the person with woodworking as a hobby is on the right of the person with baking as a hobby. Since the Argentine is in position 2, the person with baking as a hobby must be in position 1 (Spanish) or 3 (fan of jazz). Since the Spanish is in position 1, the person with baking as a hobby must be in position 1.
- From clue 5, the person with woodworking as a hobby is the security guard. So, the security guard must be in position 3 (since the fan of jazz is in position 3).
- Therefore, the person with baking as a hobby must be the dressmaker, and the person with writing as a hobby must be the electrician.

#### Step 6: Determining Music Genres
- From clue 8, the person with writing as a hobby is the Spanish or the fan of jazz, but not both. Since the Spanish is in position 1 and the fan of jazz is in position 3, the person with writing as a hobby must be the fan of jazz.
- From clue 1, the fan of ambient is not to the right of the Spanish. Since the Spanish is in position 1, the fan of ambient cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, the fan of ambient must be the Argentine.
- From clue 6, the Argentine is the dressmaker or the dressmaker is the fan of ambient, but not both. Since the Argentine is the fan of ambient, the dressmaker must be the person with baking as a hobby (the Spanish).
- Therefore, the fan of house must be the person with writing as a hobby (the fan of jazz).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |      2      |       3        |
| Hobby         | Baking     | Writing     | Woodworking    |
| Job           | Dressmaker | Electrician | Security Guard |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient    | House       | Jazz           |
| Nationality   | Spanish    | Argentine   | German         |
```

This satisfies all the given clues."
Lv10-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The freelancer is not the person driving the car.
2. The owner of the frog is on the left of the person driving the car.
3. The owner of the frog is not to the right of the person driving the airplane.
4. The person driving the car and the lawyer have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
5. The owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is tennis or the person who's sport is tennis is the designer, but not both.
6. The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person driving the airplane.
7. The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
8. The person driving the snowmobile is not the owner of the bird.
9. The freelancer is the person who's sport is soccer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Freelancer and Sport
From clue 9, we know:
- The freelancer is the person who's sport is soccer.

So, we can fill:
- **Sport (Freelancer) = Soccer**

#### Step 2: Car Driver and Parity
From clue 4, we know:
- The person driving the car and the lawyer have the same parity positions.

Since the freelancer is soccer, they are in position 2. So, the car driver and the lawyer must be in positions 1 or 3 (same parity).

#### Step 3: Frog Owner and Car Driver
From clue 2, we know:
- The owner of the frog is on the left of the person driving the car.

From clue 3, we know:
- The owner of the frog is not to the right of the person driving the airplane.

This means the owner of the frog cannot be in position 3, so they must be in position 1.

So, we can fill:
- **Pet (Position 1) = Frog**
- **Car Driver ≠ Position 1**

#### Step 4: Airplane Driver and Parity
From clue 4, since the car driver and the lawyer have the same parity, if the car driver is in an odd position, the lawyer must also be in an odd position. If the car driver is in an even position, the lawyer must also be in an even position.

Since the car driver cannot be in position 1 (owner of the frog), the only remaining odd position is 3. Therefore, the car driver must be in position 3.

So, we can fill:
- **Car Driver = Position 3**

This means the lawyer must be in position 1 (since they have the same parity).

So, we can fill:
- **Lawyer = Position 1**

#### Step 5: Sailing and Airplane
From clue 6, we know:
- The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person driving the airplane.

Since the lawyer is in position 1 and the car driver is in position 3, the person driving the airplane must be in position 2.

So, we can fill:
- **Transport (Position 2) = Airplane**

This means the person with sport sailing must be in position 3.

So, we can fill:
- **Sport (Position 3) = Sailing**

#### Step 6: Tennis and Ferret
From clue 5, we know:
- The owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is tennis or the person who's sport is tennis is the designer, but not both.

Since the person with sport sailing (position 3) is already assigned, the person with sport tennis must be in position 2.

So, we can fill:
- **Sport (Position 2) = Tennis**

This means the owner of the ferret must be in position 1.

So, we can fill:
- **Pet (Position 1) = Ferret**

#### Step 7: Bird and Snowmobile
From clue 8, we know:
- The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.

Since the freelancer (soccer) is in position 2, the person with sport tennis (position 2) is in position 1.

From clue 8, we know:
- The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.

So, the person with sport soccer (freelancer) is in position 2.

From clue 8, we know:
- The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.

So, the person with sport tennis (ferret owner) is in position 1.

From clue 8, we know:
- The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.

So, the person with sport tennis (ferret owner) is in position 1.

From clue 8, we know:
- The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.

So, the person with sport tennis (ferret owner) is in position 1.

From clue 8, we know:
- The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.

So, the person with sport tennis (ferret owner) is in position 1.

#### Final Table:
```
|             |     1      |     2      |    3     |
| Job         | Lawyer     | Freelancer | Designer |
