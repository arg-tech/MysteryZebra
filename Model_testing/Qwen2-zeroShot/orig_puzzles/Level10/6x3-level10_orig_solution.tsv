Let's start by placing some known facts:

- From Clue 11, the person watching action movies is the person drinking soy-milk.
- From Clue 4, the fan of punk is the person whose sport is tennis.
- From Clue 7, the fan of folk is on the left of the doctor.

### Initial Setup:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
|---------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Beverage      |          |             |            |
| Job           |          |             |            |
| Movie-Genre   | Action   |             |            |
| Music-Genre   | Folk     |             |            |
| Pet           |          |             |            |
| Sport         | Tennis   |             |            |

Now let's use the remaining clues:

- From Clue 6, the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is water-polo.
- From Clue 8, the person drinking almond-milk is the person whose sport is water-polo or the owner of the guinea-pig is the person drinking almond-milk, but not both.
- From Clue 9, the person whose sport is golf is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is tennis.
- From Clue 2, the person whose sport is golf is on the left of the fan of metal.
- From Clue 1, the person whose sport is golf is not to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
- From Clue 5, the mechanic is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies.
- From Clue 3, the coach is the person watching zombie movies or the coach is the owner of the hedgehog, but not both.

### Deductions:

- Since the person whose sport is golf is on the left of the fan of metal (Clue 2) and to the right of the person whose sport is tennis (Clue 9), the only position for golf is 1.
- Therefore, the person whose sport is tennis is in position 2, and the person whose sport is water-polo is in position 3.
- The person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1 or 2 (Clue 6). Since the person whose sport is golf (position 1) is not the one drinking almond-milk (Clue 1), the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2.
- The person drinking almond-milk is the person whose sport is water-polo (Clue 8).

### Updated Table:

| Sport         | Tennis   | Water-polo  | Golf       |

### Remaining Clues:

- The person whose sport is golf (position 3) is the mechanic (Clue 5).
- The mechanic is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies (Clue 5), so the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 1.
- The coach is the person watching zombie movies or the owner of the hedgehog, but not both (Clue 3). Since the person watching action movies is the person drinking soy-milk (Clue 11), the person watching zombie movies cannot be in position 2 (since it would contradict the coach being the owner of the hedgehog).

### Final Placement:

- Position 1: The person watching fantasy movies (not the coach).
- Position 2: The person drinking almond-milk (coach).
- Position 3: The person whose sport is golf (mechanic).

Lv10-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 13:** The pilot is in an odd position.
   - Possible positions for the pilot: 1, 3.

2. **Clue 6:** The person drinking tea is the person drinking tea (redundant).

3. **Clue 14:** The person who's hobby is fishing is the person drinking tea.
   - Fishing -> Tea

4. **Clue 10:** The pilot is not to the left of the lawyer.
   - If the pilot is in position 1, the lawyer must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the pilot is in position 3, the lawyer must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 13 & 10:** The pilot is in an odd position, so the pilot cannot be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the pilot is in position 1.
   - The lawyer must be in position 3.

6. **Clue 1:** The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the pilot.
   - Since the pilot is in position 1, the owner of the dog can be in position 2 or 3.
   - Given that the lawyer is in position 3, the owner of the dog must be in position 2.

7. **Clue 3:** The photographer is the owner of the lizard or the photographer is the person who's hobby is video-games, but not both.
   - Let's denote the photographer as P, the owner of the lizard as L, and the person with video-games as V.
   - We need to check which of these statements holds true:
     - If P = L, then P ≠ V.
     - If P = V, then P ≠ L.

8. **Clue 5:** The photographer and the owner of the dog have the same parity positions.
   - The owner of the dog is in position 2 (even).
   - So, the photographer must be in an even position (2 or 4).

9. **Clue 7:** The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the photographer.
   - This means L < P.

10. **Clue 4:** The owner of the lizard is not to the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
    - This means L > B.

11. **Clue 11:** The owner of the mouse and the person who's sport is rowing have different parity positions.
    - If M is in an odd position, R must be in an even position.
    - If M is in an even position, R must be in an odd position.

12. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is badminton is not to the right of the person drinking fanta.
    - This means B < F.

13. **Clue 12:** The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person driving the skateboard.
    - This means F < S.

14. **Clue 8:** The person driving the taxi is the person who's sport is basketball.
    - This means T = B.

15. **Clue 9:** The person who's hobby is drawing is not to the left of the lawyer.
    - This means D > L.

16. **Clue 15:** The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
    - This means S < T.

### Final Placement:

- Position 1: Pilot (from Clue 13)
- Position 2: Owner of the dog (from Clue 1)
- Position 3: Lawyer (from Clue 10)

Given the constraints, let's place the remaining elements:

- Position 4: Photographer (must be even, from Clue 5)
- Position 5: Owner of the lizard (from Clue 7 and 4)
- Position 6: Owner of the mouse (from Clue 11 and 12)

Since the owner of the dog is in position 2 and the pilot is in position 1, the owner of the dog is not the photographer or the person with video-games. The owner of the lizard must be in an even position (position 4 or 6) and must be to the left of the photographer.

- Position 4: Owner of the lizard
- Position 5: Photographer
- Position 6: Owner of the mouse

Now, let's assign the sports, hobbies, and other details:

- Position 1: Pilot
- Position 2: Owner of the dog
- Position 3: Lawyer
- Position 4: Owner of the lizard
- Position 5: Photographer
- Position 6: Owner of the mouse

Assign the sports and hobbies based on the constraints:

- Basketball (T): Position 5 (Photographer)
- Rowing (R): Position 6 (Owner of the mouse)

- Fishing (F): Position 3 (Lawyer)
- Drawing (D): Position 1 (Pilot)

- Fanta (Fanta): Position 4 (Owner of the lizard)
- Sprite (Sprite): Position 5 (Photographer)
- Tea (Tea): Position 2 (Owner of the dog)

- Dog (Dog): Position 2 (Owner of the dog)
- Lizard (Lizard): Position 4 (Owner of the lizard)
- Mouse (Mouse): Position 6 (Owner of the mouse)

Lv10-6x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to fill out the table step-by-step. Let's start by organizing the clues and filling in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The French is the person whose sport is cricket, or the person whose sport is cricket is the one eating radish, but not both.
   - This means that if the French has cricket as their sport, then no other person can have cricket as their sport and be eating radish. If someone else has cricket as their sport, then the French must be eating radish.
   
2. **Clue 2**: The Thai is not to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - This means the Thai must be either in position 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient.
   - This means the fan of ambient cannot be in position 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking water and the French have different parity positions.
   - This means if the French is in an odd position (1 or 3), the person drinking water must be in an even position (2). Conversely, if the French is in an even position (2), the person drinking water must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

5. **Clue 5**: The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the horse.
   - This means the horse owner cannot be in position 1.

6. **Clue 6**: The Egyptian is on the far left or far right.
   - This means the Egyptian must be in position 1 or 3.

7. **Clue 7**: The person eating onion is on the left of the person drinking juice.
   - This means the person eating onion cannot be in position 3.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left or far right.
   - This means the person with ice-hockey must be in position 1 or 3.

9. **Clue 9**: The person eating papaya is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
   - This means the person with ice-hockey cannot be in position 2 or 3 if the person eating papaya is in position 3.

10. **Clue 10**: The fan of ambient is on the left of the person drinking juice.
    - This means the person drinking juice cannot be in position 1.

11. **Clue 11**: The Egyptian is the person who's sport is baseball or the person drinking cola is the Egyptian, but not both.
    - This means if the Egyptian has baseball as their sport, they cannot drink cola, and vice versa.

12. **Clue 12**: The fan of pop and the person drinking cola have the same parity positions.
    - This means if the person drinking cola is in an odd position (1 or 3), the fan of pop must also be in an odd position. If the person drinking cola is in an even position (2), the fan of pop must also be in an even position.

13. **Clue 13**: The person drinking water is not the Thai.
    - This means the Thai cannot drink water.

### Filling the Table:

Let's start by placing some fixed elements based on the clues:

- **Position 1**: Since the Egyptian is on the far left or far right, let's place the Egyptian here. We'll check if this fits with other clues.
  - Position 1: Egyptian

- **Position 3**: The owner of the horse must be to the right of the owner of the dog, so the horse cannot be in position 1. Also, the person with ice-hockey must be in position 1 or 3, so the horse cannot be in position 3.
  - Position 3: Dog (since it must be to the right of the dog owner)

- **Position 2**: The Thai cannot be to the right of the person drinking cola, so the Thai cannot be in position 3. The Thai also cannot be in position 1 since the Egyptian is there.
  - Position 2: Thai

Now let's assign sports and drinks:

- **Position 1 (Egyptian)**: Since the Egyptian is on the far left, and clue 11 says the Egyptian is either baseball or drinks cola, and clue 13 says the Egyptian does not drink water, the Egyptian must drink cola.
  - Position 1: Egyptian, Cola

- **Position 2 (Thai)**: The Thai cannot be to the right of the person drinking cola, so the Thai must be drinking something other than cola. The Thai also cannot be drinking water (clue 13).
  - Position 2: Thai, Juice (since onion is to the left of juice, and Thai cannot be in position 3)

- **Position 3 (Dog)**: The dog owner is to the right of the ambient fan, and the person with ice-hockey must be in position 1 or 3. Since the dog is in position 3, the ice-hockey fan must be in position 1.
  - Position 3: Dog, Water (since Thai is drinking juice, and the person eating papaya cannot be in position 3)

- **Position 1 (Ice-Hockey)**: The person with ice-hockey is in position 1, and the fan of ambient must be to the left of the person drinking juice.
  - Position 1: Egyptian, Cola, Ice-Hockey, Ambient

- **Position 2 (Thai)**: The Thai is in position 2, and the Thai cannot be drinking cola or water. So, the Thai must be eating papaya.
  - Position 2: Thai, Papaya, Juice

- **Position 3 (Dog)**: The dog owner is in position 3, and the dog owner must be eating onion (since onion is to the left of juice).
  - Position 3: Dog, Water, Onion

#### Clue 4: Cat owner is not the one with the hobby of camping.
Since the cat owner is the Chinese (rightmost), they do not have the hobby of camping.

#### Clue 11: Pony owner is to the right of the camping hobbyist.
This means the camping hobbyist must be in position 2, and the pony owner (Chinese) is in position 3.

| Nationality   | Chinese    | Camping    |           |

Since the camping hobbyist is in position 2, they cannot be the Egyptian (who must be in an even position).

#### Clue 10: Hobbyist for filmmaking is the one watching musical movies.
The person watching musical movies has the hobby of filmmaking.

| Nationality   | Chinese    | Camping    | Filmmaking |

13. The Dutch is the owner of the frog or the Dutch is the person who's hobby is puzzles, but not both.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning Dutch**:
   - Dutch is on the far left (position 1).
   - Dutch is either the owner of the frog or the person with the hobby of puzzles, but not both.
   - Since the person with the hobby of puzzles is in an even position, it can't be the Dutch (position 1).

2. **Positioning American**:
   - The American is between the Polish and the Dutch.
   - Since Dutch is in position 1, the American must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the Polish must be in position 3.

3. **Hobby of Puzzles**:
   - The person with the hobby of puzzles is in an even position.
   - Given the American is in position 2, the only remaining even position is 4.
   - Therefore, the person with the hobby of puzzles is in position 4.

4. **Manager and Bird**:
   - The manager is the owner of the bird.
   - The manager cannot be in position 1 (Dutch) or 2 (American).
   - Therefore, the manager must be in position 3.
   - So, the person with the hobby of puzzles (position 4) is the owner of the bird.

5. **Cauliflower Position**:
   - The person eating cauliflower is on the far right (position 3).
   - Since the manager is in position 3, the person eating cauliflower is the manager.
   - Therefore, the manager is the owner of the bird and eats cauliflower.

6. **Frog and Orange**:
   - The owner of the frog is not to the left of the person eating orange.
   - The person eating orange is in position 3 (manager), so the owner of the frog cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - Therefore, the owner of the frog must be in position 4, which is the person with the hobby of puzzles.

7. **Salsa and Video-Games**:
   - The fan of salsa is between the person eating orange (position 3) and the person with the hobby of video-games.
   - Since the person eating orange is in position 3, the fan of salsa must be in position 2.
   - The person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 4.

8. **Classical Music and Nationality**:
   - The fan of classical music is not Dutch.
   - Since the Dutch is in position 1, the fan of classical music cannot be Dutch.
   - Therefore, the fan of classical music must be either American or Polish.
   - The American is in position 2, so the fan of classical music must be Polish.

9. **Guinea-Pig and Parity**:
   - The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird.
   - The owner of the bird is in position 3 (manager).
   - Therefore, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 2 (American).

10. **Remaining Foods and Hobbies**:
    - The person with the hobby of puzzles (position 4) is the owner of the bird.
    - The person with the hobby of traveling (position 2) is the owner of the guinea-pig.
    - The person with the hobby of video-games (position 3) is the manager (owner of the bird).
    - The person with the hobby of traveling (position 2) is the owner of the frog.
    - The person with the hobby of video-games (position 3) is the manager (owner of the bird).
    - The person with the hobby of puzzles (position 4) is the owner of the bird.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the subway is the Chinese or the person driving the subway is the person eating cherry, but not both.
   - This implies that if one is true, the other must be false.

2. **Clue 2:** The fan of dubstep is not to the left of the owner of the hamster.
   - This means the owner of the hamster cannot be in position 1 if the fan of dubstep is in position 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the chinchilla and the fan of techno have the same parity positions.
   - This means if the owner of the chinchilla is in an odd position, the fan of techno must also be in an odd position; if in an even position, the fan of techno must also be in an even position.

4. **Clue 4:** The fan of electronic is on the right of the owner of the hamster.
   - This means the owner of the hamster cannot be in position 3 if the fan of electronic is in position 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the helicopter is in an even position.
   - This means the person driving the helicopter must be in either position 2 or 4 (but since there are only three positions, it must be in position 2).

6. **Clue 6:** The fan of electronic and the analyst have the same parity positions.
   - This means if the analyst is in an odd position, the fan of electronic must also be in an odd position; if in an even position, the fan of electronic must also be in an even position.

    - This means the owner of the hamster cannot be in position 3 if the owner of the frog is in position 3.

12. **Clue 12:** The person driving the subway and the fan of electronic have the same parity positions.
    - This means if the person driving the subway is in an odd position, the fan of electronic must also be in an odd position; if in an even position, the fan of electronic must also be in an even position.

13. **Clue 13:** The owner of the chinchilla and the journalist have different parity positions.
    - This is the same as Clue 9, so no new information.

14. **Clue 14:** The person eating watermelon is the Brazilian or the Brazilian is the journalist, but not both.
    - This means if the Chinese person eats watermelon, the Brazilian cannot be the journalist, and vice versa.

15. **Clue 15:** The Australian is not the owner of the hamster.

    - This means if the Brazilian is in an odd position, the owner of the frog must be in an even position; if in an even position, the owner of the frog must be in an odd position.

### Filling the Table:

Let's start with some deductions:
- From Clue 5, the person driving the helicopter is in position 2.
- From Clue 8, the Chinese person eats watermelon.
- From Clue 16, the Australian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway (position 2), so the Australian must be in position 1.
- From Clue 15, the Australian is not the owner of the hamster, so the owner of the hamster must be in position 3.
- From Clue 17, the Australian is somewhere to the left of the person eating spinach, so the person eating spinach must be in position 3 (which is already the owner of the hamster).
- From Clue 14, the person eating watermelon (Chinese) is not the Brazilian, so the Brazilian cannot be the journalist (since the Chinese person eats watermelon and the Brazilian cannot be the journalist).
- From Clue 7, the journalist is on the left of the paramedic, so the journalist must be in position 1 and the paramedic in position 3.
- From Clue 9, the owner of the chinchilla and the journalist have different parity positions, so the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 2.
- From Clue 12, the person driving the subway and the fan of electronic have the same parity positions, so the fan of electronic must be in position 2.
- From Clue 10, the fan of dubstep is not the person eating watermelon, so the fan of dubstep cannot be the Chinese.
- From Clue 11, the owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hamster, so the owner of the frog must be in position 3.

   - From Clue 2: The person drinking fanta cannot be the owner of the cat, so the accountant must be the one drinking fanta.

9. **Accountant is somewhere to the right of the owner of the cat:**
   - From Clue 1: The accountant must be in column 2 or 3, and the owner of the cat must be in column 1.

10. **Entrepreneur is the person eating pumpkin or the entrepreneur is the owner of the horse, but not both:**
    - From Clue 14: The entrepreneur must be in column 2, and the person eating pumpkin must be in column 1.
