From **Clue 11** and **Clue 12**:
- The person driving the Subway is to the right of the person eating Nectarine.
- The person drinking Water is to the left of the person drinking Milk.

From **Clue 4**:
- Garlic is to the right of Apple.

From **Clue 15**:
- The person driving the Car is between the person drinking Water and the person driving the Skateboard.

From **Clue 14**:
- The person driving the Skateboard and the person eating Nectarine have different parity positions.

From **Clue 13**:
- Lemonade is to the right of 7Up.

From **Clue 1** and **Clue 5**:
- Mirinda and the car driver have different parity positions, and Mirinda is not the car driver.

From **Clue 6**:
- Spinach and Water have different parity positions.

From **Clue 9**:
- The person driving the Skateboard is between Cherry and Tram.

From **Clue 16**:
- Milk is between Nectarine and Cherry.

### Step 3: Final Solution

Let's place the items based on the deductions:

1. **Jet-ski**: From Clue 10, it must be at position 1 (far left) because if it were at position 5, there would be no room for other items.
2. **Subway**: From Clue 11, it must be to the right of Nectarine. Since Jet-ski is at position 1, Subway can only be at position 5.
3. **Nectarine**: From Clue 16, it must be between Milk and Cherry. Since Subway is at position 5, Nectarine can be at position 2 or 4.
4. **Cherry**: Since Nectarine is between Milk and Cherry, and Nectarine cannot be at position 5 (Subway), Cherry must be at position 3.
5. **Milk**: Since Cherry is at position 3, Milk must be at position 4.
6. **Spinach**: From Clue 6, it must be at an odd position (1, 3, 5). Since positions 1 and 5 are taken, Spinach must be at position 3.
7. **Garlic**: From Clue 4, it must be to the right of Apple. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are taken, Garlic can be at position 2 or 4.
8. **Apple**: Since Garlic is to the right of Apple and Garlic cannot be at position 4 (Milk), Apple must be at position 1.
9. **Lemonade**: From Clue 13, it must be to the right of 7Up. Since positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are taken, Lemonade must be at position 4.
10. **Mirinda**: From Clue 3, it must be between Subway (position 5) and Garlic. Since Garlic cannot be at position 5, Garlic must be at position 2, and Mirinda must be at position 4.
11. **Water**: From Clue 12, it must be to the left of Milk. Since Milk is at position 4, Water must be at position 1 (Jet-ski).
12. **Car**: From Clue 15, it must be between Water (position 1) and Skateboard. Since Water is at position 1, Car must be at position 3.

### Final Table

15. The person whose hobby is writing is in an odd position.
16. The person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the person whose hobby is traveling.
17. The police-officer is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position the Coach
- The coach is in the middle (position 3).

#### Step 2: Position the Person Drinking Soy-Milk
- The person drinking soy-milk is in an even position (positions 2 or 4).
- The person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the person whose hobby is traveling.
- If the person drinking soy-milk were in position 2, then the person with traveling as a hobby would be in position 3 (coach), which is not allowed because the coach is already in position 3.
- Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 4.

#### Step 3: Position the Freelancer
- The freelancer is between the coach and the person whose hobby is chess.
- Since the coach is in position 3, the freelancer must be in position 2 or 4.
- But since position 4 is taken by the person drinking soy-milk, the freelancer must be in position 2.

#### Step 4: Position the Person Whose Hobby is Chess
- The freelancer (in position 2) is between the coach and the person whose hobby is chess.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is chess must be in position 1.

#### Step 5: Position the Person Whose Hobby is Traveling
- The person whose hobby is traveling is not to the left of the person drinking fanta.
- The person drinking soy-milk is in position 4, so the person whose hobby is traveling cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is traveling must be in position 5.

#### Step 6: Position the Person Drinking Fanta
- The person drinking fanta is either the police-officer or the person whose hobby is traveling, but not both.
- The person whose hobby is traveling is in position 5, so the person drinking fanta must be the police-officer.
- Therefore, the police-officer is in position 5.

#### Step 7: Position the Person Drinking Hot-Chocolate
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is chess.
- The person whose hobby is chess is in position 1, so the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- But positions 2 and 4 are taken by the freelancer and the person drinking soy-milk respectively, and position 5 is taken by the police-officer.
- Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 3.

#### Step 8: Position the Person Drunk on Lemonade and Coffee
- The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3, so the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1 or 2.
- The person whose hobby is chess is in position 1, so the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 3 (hot-chocolate).

#### Step 9: Position the Person Drunk on Coffee and Lemonade
- The person drinking lemonade is in position 2, and the person drinking coffee is in position 3.
- The person whose hobby is chess is in position 1, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3.
- The person whose hobby is drawing is on the right of the person whose hobby is chess.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is drawing must be in position 4.
- The person whose hobby is writing must be in position 1 (since it's an odd position).

#### Step 10: Assign the Beverages and Hobbies
- The person whose hobby is chess is in position 1, so they must drink fanta (since the police-officer drinks fanta).
- The person whose hobby is drawing is in position 4, so they must drink coffee.
- The person whose hobby is traveling is in position 5, so they must drink fanta (but this contradicts the earlier assignment; thus, the person drinking fanta must be the police-officer).
- The person whose hobby is baking is not to the left of the person whose hobby is drawing.
- The person whose hobby is writing is in position 1, so they must drink fanta (but this is already assigned to the police-officer).
- The person whose hobby is chess is in position 1, so they must drink fanta (but this is already assigned to the police-officer).

    - This means the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the airplane must be in position 2 or 3.

11. **Clue 10**: The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person driving the scooter.
    - This means the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the scooter must be in position 2 or 3.

### Final Placement:

From the above clues, let's place the items step-by-step:

- Position 3: Hiking (from Clue 11)
- Position 4: Helicopter (from Clue 4 and Clue 5)
- Position 2: Juice (from Clue 12 and Clue 7)

Since the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 3, the person drinking juice is in position 2. The person driving the airplane must be in position 4 or 5 (since the person drinking juice is in position 2 and the person driving the airplane must be to the right of the person drinking juice). Since the person with the hobby of drawing is on the left of the person driving the scooter, and the person driving the helicopter is in position 4, the person driving the airplane must be in position 5 (since the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 1 or 2).

- Position 1: Drawing (from Clue 9 and Clue 10)
- Position 2: Juice
- Position 3: Hiking
- Position 4: Helicopter
- Position 5: Airplane

Now, let's place the beverages and hobbies:

- The person drinking juice is in position 2, so the person drinking coffee must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not position 3 because the person with the hobby of hiking is there). So, the person drinking coffee is in position 4 or 5. Since the person drinking fanta must be to the right of the person drinking coffee and the person drinking coffee is not to the left of the person drinking fanta, the person drinking coffee is in position 4 and the person drinking fanta is in position 5.

- The person drinking 7up must be in position 3, 4, or 5, but since positions 4 and 5 are taken, the person drinking 7up is in position 3.

15. **Clue 15:** The person eating lettuce is somewhere between the person driving the subway and the person driving the bus.
16. **Clue 16:** The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking water.

### Step-by-Step Solution

Let's start by placing the person eating plum (Clue 14) in the middle (position 3):

|             |   1   |    2     |    3     |      4      |    5     |
| Beverage    |       |          | Plum     |             |          |
| Food        |       |          | Lime     |             |          |
| Transport   |       |          | Bus      |             |          |

Next, let's use Clue 3 to place the person drinking tea:

- The person drinking tea is on the far left or far right.
- The person drinking tea cannot be in position 3 since Plum is there.
- Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 1 or 5.

Let's assume the person drinking tea is in position 1 for now:

|             | Tea  |    2     | Plum     |      4      |    5     |
| Beverage    |      |          |         |             |          |
| Food        |      |          | Lime     |             |          |
| Transport   |      |          | Bus      |             |          |

Now, using Clue 2, the person drinking tea is either the person eating plum or the person driving the subway, but not both. Since the person drinking tea is in position 1, they cannot be the person eating plum. Thus, the person drinking tea must be the person driving the subway:

|             | Tea  |    2     | Plum     |      4      |    5     |
| Beverage    |      |          |         |             |          |
| Food        |      |          | Lime     |             |          |
| Transport   | Sub  |          | Bus      |             |          |

Using Clue 6, the person driving the car is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up:

|             | Tea  |    2     | Plum     |      4      |    5     |
| Beverage    |      |          |         |             |          |
| Food        |      |          | Lime     |             |          |
| Transport   | Sub  |          | Bus      | 7up         |          |

Using Clue 10, the person driving the car is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea:

Since the person drinking tea is in position 1, the person driving the car must be in position 2:

|             | Tea  | Car    | Plum     |      4      |    5     |
| Beverage    |      |        |         |             |          |
| Food        |      |        | Lime     |             |          |
| Transport   | Sub  |        | Bus      | 7up         |          |

Using Clue 11, the person driving the car is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea:

- The person drinking iced-tea must be in position 4.

Using Clue 8, the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea:

- The person drinking iced-tea must be in position 4, and the person drinking 7up must be in position 5.

|             | Tea  | Car    | Plum     | Iced-tea    | 7up      |
| Beverage    |      |        |         |             |          |
| Food        |      |        | Lime    |             |          |
| Transport   | Sub  |        | Bus     |            |          |

Using Clue 1, the person driving the airplane is somewhere between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the car:

- The person driving the airplane must be in position 2, and the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.

|             | Almond-milk | Car    | Plum     | Iced-tea    | 7up      |
| Beverage    |             |        |         |             |          |
| Food        |              |        | Lime    |             |          |
| Transport   | Airplane    |        | Bus     |            |          |

Using Clue 5, the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person eating broccoli:

- The person eating broccoli must be in position 4.

Using Clue 7, the person eating peach is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car:

- The person eating peach must be in position 1.

Using Clue 9, the person driving the boat is not to the right of the person eating lettuce:

- The person eating lettuce must be in position 3.

Using Clue 15, the person eating lettuce is somewhere between the person driving the subway and the person driving the bus:

- The person eating lettuce must be in position 3.

Using Clue 16, the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking water:

- The person drinking water must be in position 5.

|             | Almond-milk | Car    | Plum     | Iced-tea    | Water    |
| Beverage    |             |        |         |             |          |
| Food        | Peach       |        | Lime    |             |          |
| Transport   | Airplane    | Bus    | Boat    |            |          |

Finally, the person drinking water must be in position 5, and the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 4. The remaining positions are filled as follows:

|             | Almond-milk | Car    | Plum     | Iced-tea    | Water    |
