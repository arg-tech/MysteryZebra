   - So, S = A and the architect is the fan of R&B.

4. **Clue 1**: The Canadian and the fan of R&B have the same parity positions.
   - Since the architect (S) is the fan of R&B, the Canadian must be in the same position as the architect.

5. **Clue 16**: The person drinking iced-tea is the Canadian or the Canadian is the person driving the helicopter, but not both.
   - Since the Canadian is in the same position as the architect (S), and the architect is the person driving the scooter, the Canadian cannot be the person driving the helicopter.
   - Therefore, the Canadian is the person drinking iced-tea.

6. **Clue 17**: The Canadian is not to the right of the person eating avocado.
   - Since the Canadian is in position 1 (drinking iced-tea), the person eating avocado must be in position 2 or 3.

    - Let’s denote the Colombian as C and the person whose hobby is rock-climbing as R.

11. **Clue 7**: The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person whose hobby is hiking.
    - The person driving the scooter (S) is in position 1, so the person whose hobby is hiking must be in position 2 or 3.

12. **Clue 8**: The person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person eating avocado.
    - The person eating avocado must be in position 2 or 3, and since the person driving the scooter is in position 1, the person eating avocado must be in position 2 or 3.

13. **Clue 13**: The person driving the quad-bike is on the left or right of the person eating avocado.
    - The person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1 or 3.

Lv10-7x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the fan house.
2. **Clue 2**: The Thai is somewhere to the right of the nurse.
3. **Clue 3**: The nurse is the owner of the horse or the owner of the horse is the Argentine, but not both.

9. **Clue 9**: The Mexican is not to the left of the fan house.
10. **Clue 10**: The fan disco is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret.
11. **Clue 11**: The person drinking juice is between the Argentine and the person eating apricot.
12. **Clue 12**: The person driving the scooter is not to the right of the photographer.
13. **Clue 13**: The Thai is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
14. **Clue 14**: The person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
15. **Clue 15**: The owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai.
16. **Clue 16**: The owner of the horse and the fan house have the same parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. From Clue 5:
- The person drinking 7up is the fan house.
- Therefore, the fan house must be one of the positions for the person drinking 7up.

#### 2. From Clue 16:
- The owner of the horse and the fan house have the same parity positions.
- Since the fan house is 7up, the owner of the horse must also be in an odd position (1 or 3).

#### 3. From Clue 3:
- The nurse is the owner of the horse or the owner of the horse is the Argentine, but not both.
- Since the owner of the horse is in an odd position, it can't be the nurse (who would be in an even position).
- Therefore, the owner of the horse is the Argentine.

#### 4. From Clue 13:
- The Thai is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
- Since the owner of the horse is in position 1 or 3, the Thai must be in position 2 or 3 if the owner of the horse is in position 1, or in position 3 if the owner of the horse is in position 3.

#### 5. From Clue 2:
- The Thai is somewhere to the right of the nurse.
- Since the Thai is to the right of the owner of the horse, and the owner of the horse is the Argentine, the Thai cannot be in position 1.
- If the owner of the horse is in position 1, the Thai must be in position 2 or 3. If the owner of the horse is in position 3, the Thai must be in position 3.

#### 6. From Clue 15:
- The owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai.
- This means if the Thai is in position 2, the owner of the snake must be in position 1. If the Thai is in position 3, the owner of the snake must be in position 1 or 2.

#### 7. From Clue 7:
- The owner of the snake is somewhere between the person driving the motorbike and the person driving the bus.
- This means the owner of the snake cannot be in position 1 (since there is no position before it), so the owner of the snake must be in position 2 or 3.

#### 8. From Clue 8:
- The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike.
- Therefore, the owner of the snake must be in position 2, and the person driving the motorbike must be in position 3.

#### 9. From Clue 4:
- The firefighter and the person driving the scooter have different parity positions.
- Since the person driving the motorbike is in position 3 (odd), the person driving the scooter must be in position 1 (even).

#### 10. From Clue 12:
- The person driving the scooter is not to the right of the photographer.
- Therefore, the photographer must be in position 3 (since the person driving the scooter is in position 1).

#### 11. From Clue 14:
- The person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
- Since the person drinking 7up is the fan house, the person drinking juice must be in position 1 or 3.

#### 12. From Clue 10:
- The fan disco is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret.
- Since the fan house is 7up, the fan disco must be in position 1 or 2.

#### 13. From Clue 11:
- The person drinking juice is between the Argentine and the person eating apricot.
- Since the Argentine is the owner of the horse, the person drinking juice must be in position 2 (between 1 and 3).

#### 14. From Clue 1:
- The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the fan house.
- Since the fan house is 7up, the person eating cucumber must be in position 2 or 3.

#### 15. From Clue 6:
- The fan disco and the person driving the bus have different parity positions.
- Since the fan house is 7up, the fan disco must be in position 2 (since the person driving the bus must be in position 1 or 3).

#### 16. From Clue 9:
- The Mexican is not to the left of the fan house.
- Therefore, the Mexican must be in position 2 or 3.

#### 17. From Clue 13:
- The Thai is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
- Since the owner of the horse is in position 1, the Thai must be in position 2 or 3.
