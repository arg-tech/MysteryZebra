3. **Clue 1**: The person drinking milk is the fan of r&b or the person drinking milk is the designer, but not both.
4. **Clue 12** and **Clue 1** together imply that:
   - If the person drinking milk is the designer, then the fan of r&b must be someone else.
   - If the person drinking milk is the fan of r&b, then the designer must be someone else.

5. **Clue 9**: The designer is not to the right of the person drinking milk.
   - This means if the designer is in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 1.

### Step 3: Place Designer and Milk

Since the designer cannot be to the right of the person drinking milk, and considering the constraints:

- If the designer is in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 1.
- If the designer is in position 3, the person drinking milk must be in position 1 or 2.

- The fan of r&b must be someone else.
- From **Clue 2**, the fan of r&b is not to the left of the analyst.
- From **Clue 12**, the fan of r&b is not the person drinking milk.

If the person drinking milk is the fan of r&b:
- The designer must be someone else.
- From **Clue 2**, the fan of r&b is not to the left of the analyst.
- From **Clue 12**, the designer is not the fan of r&b.

### Step 5: Detailed Placement

Considering all constraints, let's place the designer and milk:

- **Designer in Position 2**: 
  - Person drinking milk in Position 1.
  - Fan of r&b can be in Position 3 or 4.
  - Fan of r&b cannot be in Position 2 because the designer is there.
  - Fan of r&b cannot be in Position 1 because the person drinking milk is there.

Lv10-5x4-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to fill in the table step-by-step. Let's break down each clue and deduce the information:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is puzzles and the person watching family movies have the same parity positions.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking lemonade is not to the left of the Indonesian.
4. **Clue 4:** The Indonesian is on the left or right of the American.

6. **Clue 6:** The Indonesian is on the far left.
7. **Clue 7:** The person watching family movies is between the Spanish and the person drinking lemonade.
8. **Clue 8:** The fan of folk is the Indonesian or the fan of folk is the person drinking almond-milk, but not both.
9. **Clue 9:** The person whose hobby is writing is the fan of funk.
10. **Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is chess is not the fan of funk.
11. **Clue 11:** The person drinking juice is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies.
12. **Clue 12:** The fan of folk and the person whose hobby is writing have the same parity positions.
13. **Clue 13:** The person drinking juice and the person watching thriller movies have different parity positions.
14. **Clue 14:** The person watching martial-arts movies is the person whose hobby is puzzles.
15. **Clue 15:** The fan of funk and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions.
16. **Clue 16:** The person watching thriller movies is not the person whose hobby is writing.
17. **Clue 17:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is not to the right of the fan of ambient.
18. **Clue 18:** The fan of pop is not the person drinking juice.
19. **Clue 19:** The person whose hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the Spanish.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 6:** The Indonesian is on the far left (position 1).
2. **From Clue 14:** The person watching martial-arts movies is the person whose hobby is puzzles. Since the Indonesian is at position 1, the person with puzzles must be at position 2, 3, or 4.
3. **From Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is puzzles and the person watching family movies have the same parity positions. Therefore, if puzzles is in an odd position, family movies must also be in an odd position; if puzzles is in an even position, family movies must also be in an even position.
4. **From Clue 16:** The person watching thriller movies is not the person whose hobby is writing. This means writing cannot be in the position where thriller movies are watched.
5. **From Clue 7:** The person watching family movies is between the Spanish and the person drinking lemonade. This means the person watching family movies cannot be in position 1 or 4.
6. **From Clue 3:** The person drinking lemonade is not to the left of the Indonesian (position 1). So, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
7. **From Clue 2:** The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking sprite. This means if the person drinking lemonade is in position 2, the person drinking sprite must be in position 1 (but that's impossible since the Indonesian is in position 1), so the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3 or 4, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 2.
8. **From Clue 11:** The person drinking juice is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies. This means if the person drinking juice is in position 3 or 4, the person watching thriller movies cannot be in position 2.
9. **From Clue 13:** The person drinking juice and the person watching thriller movies have different parity positions. If the person drinking juice is in position 3 (odd), the person watching thriller movies must be in position 2 (even); if the person drinking juice is in position 4 (even), the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3 (odd).
10. **From Clue 12:** The fan of folk and the person whose hobby is writing have the same parity positions. Since writing is the fan of funk, and the fan of funk is either the Indonesian (position 1) or the person drinking almond-milk, it must be in an odd position. So, the person whose hobby is writing (fan of funk) must be in position 1 or 3.
11. **From Clue 9:** The person whose hobby is writing is the fan of funk. So, the person drinking juice must be in position 4 (even), and the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3 (odd).
12. **From Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is chess is not the fan of funk. So, the person whose hobby is chess must be in position 2 or 4.
13. **From Clue 15:** The fan of funk and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions. Since the person watching epic movies cannot be in position 1 (Indonesian), they must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Given the parity, the person watching epic movies must be in position 2 or 4.
14. **From Clue 17:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is not to the right of the fan of ambient. Since the person watching martial-arts movies (puzzles) is in position 2, the fan of ambient must be in position 1 (Indonesian) or 3.
15. **From Clue 18:** The fan of pop is not the person drinking juice. So, the fan of pop must be in position 2 or 3.
16. **From Clue 19:** The person whose hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the Spanish. So, the Spanish must be in position 3 or 4.

### Final Table:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |      4      |
| Beverage      | lemonade     | sprite   | juice   | almond-milk |

Lv10-5x4-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 3:** The person eating cabbage is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 14:** The person eating cabbage and the engineer have different parity positions.
3. **Clue 17:** The person who's sport is parkour is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
4. **Clue 19:** The paramedic is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).

Since the person eating cabbage is either in position 1 or 4, and the engineer has a different parity position, we can deduce:
- If the person eating cabbage is in position 1, the engineer must be in position 2 or 4.
- If the person eating cabbage is in position 4, the engineer must be in position 1 or 3.

Since the paramedic is also in an odd position (1 or 3), and the person who's sport is parkour is in an odd position, let's place these first.

### Initial Setup:
- Position 1: Cabbage (due to Clue 3)
- Position 3: Parkour (due to Clue 17)
- Position 1 or 3: Paramedic (due to Clue 19)

Since the person eating cabbage is at position 1, the engineer cannot be there due to Clue 14. Therefore, the engineer must be in position 2 or 4.

### Placing the Engineer and Paramedic:
- Position 1: Cabbage
- Position 3: Parkour
- Position 1 or 3: Paramedic

Let's assume the paramedic is in position 1 for now and see if it works out:
- Position 1: Cabbage (paramedic)
- Position 3: Parkour

This means the engineer must be in position 4 (since he cannot be in position 1 or 3).

### Remaining Positions:
- Position 2: (to be determined)
- Position 4: Engineer

Now, let's use other clues to fill in the remaining details.

### Using Clue 10:
- The person who's sport is lacrosse is the paramedic.
- Position 1: Cabbage (paramedic)

So, the person with lacrosse is in position 1.

### Using Clue 16:
- The person drinking almond-milk is the person who's hobby is gardening or the person who's hobby is gardening is the person eating pomegranate, but not both.

Let's denote:
- G = Gardening
- P = Pomegranate
- A = Almond-milk

If the person with Gardening is in position 2, then the person with Almond-milk must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but not 1 because the paramedic is there).

### Using Clue 7:
- The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket.

If Cricket is in position 1 or 3, Singing must be in position 2 or 4 respectively.

### Using Clue 12:
- The journalist is somewhere to the left of the lawyer.

If the lawyer is in position 2 or 4, the journalist must be in position 1 or 3 respectively.

### Using Clue 13:
- The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the engineer.

If the engineer is in position 4, the magician must be in position 3.

### Using Clue 11:
- The person eating pineapple is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade.

If Pineapple is in position 3, Lemonade must be in position 4.

### Using Clue 8:
- The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading.

If Reading is in position 2, Gardening must be in position 1 or 3.

### Final Solution:
- Position 1: Cabbage (paramedic)
- Position 2: Gardening
- Position 3: Parkour (paramedic)
- Position 4: Lacrosse (paramedic)

Based on the above deductions and the remaining constraints:

|            |      1      |       2       |     3     |      4       |
| Beverage   | Almond-milk | Hot-chocolate | Lemonade  | Soy-milk    |
| Food       | Cabbage     | Pineapple     | Lettuce   | Pomegranate |
| Hobby      | Gardening   | Reading       | Magic-tricks | Singing    |

| Sport      | Lacrosse    | Cricket       | Parkour   | Tennis      |

#### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |      1      |       2       |     3     |      4       |

Let's start placing the elements based on these clues:

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **Clue 14:** The accountant watches disaster movies.
2. **Clue 16:** The analyst is in an odd position (1 or 3).

Given that the analyst must be in an odd position, let's try placing the analyst in position 1:
- Analyst: 1

Now, since the security-guard is on the left of the accountant, the security-guard must be in position 2:
- Security-guard: 2
- Accountant: 1

Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is not the analyst, the person with skateboarding cannot be in position 1.

### Analyzing Clue 10:
- The person who's sport is skateboarding and the person who's hobby is fishing have different parity positions.

### Analyzing Clue 3:
- The person who's sport is cycling is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.

### Analyzing Clue 9:
- The Polish is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.

### Analyzing Clue 11:
- The Australian is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies (accountant), so the Australian cannot be in position 4.

### Analyzing Clue 12:
- The Australian is the person who's sport is soccer or the person who's sport is soccer is the person who's hobby is fishing, but not both.

### Analyzing Clue 5:
- The Polish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is soccer.

### Analyzing Clue 7:
- The accountant is not to the left of the Indian, so the Indian cannot be in position 3.

### Analyzing Clue 13:
- The accountant and the person who's hobby is skydiving have the same parity positions, which means the skydiver is also in position 1.

### Analyzing Clue 15:
- The American is not to the right of the American, meaning the American is in position 1 or 2.

### Analyzing Clue 17:
- The person watching comedy movies and the Polish have different parity positions.

### Final Solution:

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can fill in the remaining slots:

|               |       1        |     2      |    3    |      4       |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Airplane Driver:**
   - From Clue 3, the person driving the airplane is in position 4.

2. **Positioning the Van Driver:**
   - From Clue 5, the person driving the van is the person drinking coffee.
   - From Clue 13, the person eating mango and the person driving the airplane have the same parity positions.
   - Since the airplane driver is in position 4 (even), the mango eater must be in an even position.
   - Therefore, the mango eater cannot be in position 1 (odd) or 3 (odd), so the mango eater must be in position 2 or 4.
   - Since the airplane driver is in position 4, the mango eater must be in position 2.
   - From Clue 10, the person eating mango is the person drinking soy-milk.
   - Therefore, position 2 is for soy-milk and mango.

3. **Positioning the Disaster Movie Watcher:**
   - From Clue 1, the disaster movie watcher is not to the left of the cabbage eater.
   - From Clue 16, the disaster movie watcher is between the cabbage eater and the argentine.
   - Therefore, the disaster movie watcher must be in position 3.
   - From Clue 9, the disaster movie watcher and the milk drinker have the same parity positions.
   - Since the disaster movie watcher is in position 3 (odd), the milk drinker must also be in an odd position.
   - Therefore, the milk drinker must be in position 1 or 3.
   - But since position 3 is already taken by the disaster movie watcher, the milk drinker must be in position 1.
   - From Clue 14, the milk drinker is to the left of the soy-milk drinker.
   - Therefore, the soy-milk drinker must be in position 4 (the only remaining even position).

4. **Positioning the Hot-Chocolate Drinker:**
   - From Clue 11, the person drinking hot-chocolate is the australian.
   - Therefore, the australian must be in position 1, which is the milk drinker.
   - This confirms that the milk drinker is the australian.

5. **Positioning the Cabbage Eater:**
   - From Clue 1, the disaster movie watcher (position 3) is not to the left of the cabbage eater.
   - From Clue 16, the disaster movie watcher is between the cabbage eater and the argentine.
   - Therefore, the cabbage eater must be in position 2 or 4.
   - Since position 2 is already taken by the mango eater, the cabbage eater must be in position 4.
   - From Clue 6, the person eating pear is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
   - Therefore, the pear eater must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Since position 3 is already taken by the disaster movie watcher, the pear eater must be in position 4.
   - From Clue 15, the person eating pear is the person watching mystery movies.
   - Therefore, the mystery movie watcher is in position 4.

6. **Positioning the Remaining Attributes:**
   - From Clue 8, the person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the person eating mango.
   - Therefore, the documentary movie watcher must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since position 1 is taken by the australian (milk drinker), the documentary movie watcher must be in position 2.
   - From Clue 7, the person driving the van and the person watching documentary movies have the same parity positions.
   - Since the van driver is in position 4, the documentary movie watcher must be in an even position.
   - Therefore, the documentary movie watcher must be in position 2.
   - From Clue 12, the person eating cabbage and the person watching adventure movies have different parity positions.
   - Since the cabbage eater is in position 4 (even), the adventure movie watcher must be in an odd position.
   - Therefore, the adventure movie watcher must be in position 1.
   - From Clue 17, the person eating apricot is not the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - Therefore, the person eating apricot must be in position 3.
   - From Clue 18, the indonesian is the person drinking milk or the indonesian is the person eating cabbage, but not both.
   - Since the milk drinker is in position 1 and the cabbage eater is in position 4, the indonesian must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person eating apricot is the indonesian.
