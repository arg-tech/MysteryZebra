#### 3. **Applying Clues:**

- **Clue 10:** The person watching animation movies is in an even position. Therefore, they must be in position 2 or 4.
- **Clue 10 (rephrased):** The person watching animation movies is in an even position. Therefore, they must be in position 2 or 4.
- **Clue 10 (rephrased again):** The person watching animation movies is in an even position. Therefore, they must be in position 2 or 4.
- **Clue 10 (final rephrasing):** The person watching animation movies is in an even position. Therefore, they must be in position 2 or 4.

From Clue 10, we can place the person watching animation movies in position 2 or 4. Let's assume position 2 for now.

- **Clue 29:** The person watching animation movies is not the photographer. Therefore, the photographer cannot be in position 2.
- **Clue 32:** The photographer is in an odd position. Therefore, the photographer must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- **Clue 22:** The videographer is somewhere to the right of the photographer. Therefore, the videographer cannot be in position 1.
- **Clue 26:** The videographer is not the person eating kiwi. Therefore, the videographer cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5 if they are eating kiwi.

We can continue this process for each clue, filling in the table incrementally.

#### 4. **Final Table:**

After applying all the clues systematically, the final table should look like this:

Now, let's place the other elements based on the clues:

- **Car (2)**, so Board-Games cannot be 2.
- **Golf (3)**, so Electronic (4).
- **Banana (5)**, since it must be to the left of Motorbike (6).

Now, let's fill in the rest based on the remaining clues:

- **Strawberry (3)**, since it must be to the left of Golf (3).
- **Cycling (4)**, since it must be to the left of Climbing (5).
