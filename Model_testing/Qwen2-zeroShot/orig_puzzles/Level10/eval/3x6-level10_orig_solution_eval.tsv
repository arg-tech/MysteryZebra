20. The owner of the rat is not the person drinking fanta.
21. The owner of the bird is somewhere between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the owner of the dog.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 6 (Water) is the owner of the goldfish** (Constraint 16).
2. **Owner of the snake is in an odd position** (Constraint 17). Therefore, the owner of the snake can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
3. **Owner of the dog is the person who's sport is lacrosse** (Constraint 9).
4. **Person drinking water (position 6) is not the person who's sport is badminton** (Constraint 20).
5. **Person drinking tea is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting** (Constraint 1).
6. **Person who's sport is basketball is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting** (Constraint 2).
7. **Person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person drinking tea** (Constraint 6).
8. **Person drinking tea is not the person who's sport is badminton** (Constraint 7).
9. **Person who's sport is weightlifting has a different parity from the owner of the snake** (Constraint 5).
10. **Person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the owner of the snake** (Constraint 14).

Let's try to place the items based on these constraints:

- Position 6 (Water) = Goldfish.
- Owner of the snake must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Dog is in position 4 (lacrosse).
- Person drinking water (position 6) is not the person who's sport is badminton.
- Person drinking tea cannot be to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
- Person who's sport is basketball cannot be to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
- Person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person drinking tea.
- Person drinking tea is not the person who's sport is badminton.
- Person who's sport is weightlifting has a different parity from the owner of the snake.
- Person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the owner of the snake.

Let's place the items step-by-step:

1. **Position 6 (Water)** = Goldfish.
2. **Position 4 (Dog)** = Lacrosse.
3. **Position 1 (Snake)** = Odd position.
4. **Position 2 (Tea)** = Not to the left of Weightlifting.
5. **Position 5 (Badminton)** = On the right of Tea.
6. **Position 3 (Basketball)** = Not to the left of Weightlifting.

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining items:

- **Position 1 (Snake)** = Odd position (let's assume 1 for now).
- **Position 2 (Tea)** = Not to the left of Weightlifting (must be after Weightlifting).
- **Position 5 (Badminton)** = On the right of Tea (must be after Tea).
- **Position 3 (Basketball)** = Not to the left of Weightlifting (must be after Weightlifting).

So, we can place:

- **Position 1 (Snake)** = Weightlifting (since it needs to be in an odd position and not to the left of Basketball).
- **Position 2 (Tea)** = Coffee (since it needs to be after Weightlifting and not to the left of Weightlifting).
- **Position 5 (Badminton)** = Tea (since it needs to be on the right of Tea and not to the left of Weightlifting).
- **Position 3 (Basketball)** = Fanta (since it needs to be after Weightlifting and not to the left of Weightlifting).

Now, we have:

|            |       1       |     2     |   3    |     4      |    5     |    6     |

| Pet        |   Snake      |   Bird    | Cat    |   Dog      |   Rat    |   Goldfish|
| Sport      | Weightlifting| Basketball| Lacrosse| Rowing     | Rugby    |   Rugby  |

12. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the owner of the snake or the owner of the snake is the person drinking fanta, but not both (true).
13. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the owner of the cat (true).
14. The person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the owner of the snake (true).
15. The person drinking coffee is between the owner of the rat and the person drinking tea (true).
16. The person drinking water is the owner of the goldfish (true).
17. The owner of the snake is in an odd position (true).
18. The owner of the rat and the person drinking juice have different parity positions (true).

Lv10-3x6-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

### Step 1: Identify key constraints and fill in the table.

#### Constraint 7:
- The person who's hobby is writing is on the far left or far right.
- Let's assume Writing is at position 1 (we can test other positions later if needed).

#### Constraint 18:
- The person eating kale is on the far left.
- So, Position 1 = Kale.

#### Constraint 1:
- The person who's hobby is drawing is the dancer or the person eating carrot is the person who's hobby is drawing, but not both.
- Since Writing is at position 1, the person with hobby Writing cannot be the person with hobby Drawing.
- Therefore, the person with hobby Drawing must be the dancer.

#### Constraint 2:
- The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the designer.
- So, let's place Puzzles before Designer.

#### Constraint 4:
- The chef is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.
- So, Chef must be on the left of Dancer.

#### Constraint 5:
- The person eating zucchini is not to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
- So, Zucchini cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

#### Constraint 6:
- The person eating lime and the dressmaker have different parity positions.
- So, if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position.

- So, if Writing is at position 1, Woodworking must be between Chef and Writing.

#### Constraint 12:
- The person eating raspberry is somewhere between the person who's hobby is writing and the person eating carrot.
- So, Writing < Raspberry < Carrot.

#### Constraint 13:
- The security-guard is somewhere between the dressmaker and the person who's hobby is woodworking.
- So, Security-guard must be between Dressmaker and Woodworking.

#### Constraint 14:
- The person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
- So, Rock-climbing > Woodworking.

#### Constraint 15:
- The person eating kale and the dancer have different parity positions.
- So, if Dancer is in an odd position, Kale must be in an even position.

#### Constraint 16:
- The chef is not the person who's hobby is puzzles.
- So, Chef ≠ Puzzles.

#### Constraint 17:
- The coach is not to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.

#### Constraint 25:
- The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the chef.
- So, Zucchini = Chef or Zucchini is next to Chef.

#### Constraint 26:
- The designer is not to the left of the dressmaker.

| Job     | Chef       |             | Dancer         | Designer    | Security-guard| Dressmaker|

Now we need to fill in the remaining food and jobs.

1. **Zucchini** must be on the left or right of the Chef. Since Chef is in position 1, Zucchini must be in position 6.
2. **Raspberry** must be between Writing and Carrot, and it must be less than Dancer. So, Raspberry could be in position 4.
3. **Lime** and **Pineapple** must fit in the remaining positions. Since Dancer is in position 4, Lime and Pineapple must be in positions 2 and 5.

Let's finalize:

|         |     1      |      2      |       3        |      4      |       5       |    6    |
| Food    | Kale       | Pineapple   |                | Raspberry   | Lime          | Zucchini|
| Hobby   | Writing    | Puzzles     | Coach          | Drawing     | Rock-climbing | Woodwork |
| Job     | Chef       |             | Dancer         | Designer    | Security-guard| Dressmaker|
