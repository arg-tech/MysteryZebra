Lv10-3x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues step by step. Let's break down each clue and deduce the information:

### Clues:
1. The manager is in the middle.
2. The owner of the guinea-pig is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere between the dressmaker and the person who's sport is lacrosse.
4. The owner of the fish is not to the left of the manager.
5. The dressmaker is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
6. The manager is the person who's sport is golf or the person who's sport is golf is the owner of the fish, but not both.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 1:
- Manager is in the middle (position 2).

|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     |                | Manager    |            |
| Pet     |                |            |            |
| Sport   |                |            |            |

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the guinea-pig is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey.

#### Clue 3:
- The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere between the dressmaker and the person who's sport is lacrosse.

This means the person with ice-hockey cannot be in position 1 or 3. It must be in position 2, which is the manager's position. Therefore, the manager's sport is ice-hockey.

|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     |                | Manager    |            |
| Pet     |                |            |            |
| Sport   |                | Ice-hockey |            |

#### Clue 4:
- The owner of the fish is not to the left of the manager.

Since the manager is in position 2, the owner of the fish cannot be in position 1. This leaves position 3 for the owner of the fish.

|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     |                | Manager    | Fish       |
| Pet     |                |            |            |
| Sport   |                | Ice-hockey |            |

#### Clue 5:
- The dressmaker is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey.

We already know that the manager has ice-hockey, so the dressmaker cannot be the manager. This leaves either position 1 or 3 for the dressmaker. But since position 3 is occupied by the fish owner, the dressmaker must be in position 1.

|         | Dressmaker     | Manager    | Fish       |
| Job     |                |           |            |
| Pet     |                |            |            |
| Sport   |                | Ice-hockey |            |

#### Clue 6:
- The manager is the person who's sport is golf or the person who's sport is golf is the owner of the fish, but not both.

Since the manager has ice-hockey, the person who's sport is golf cannot be the manager. Therefore, the owner of the fish (position 3) must have golf.

|         | Dressmaker     | Manager    | Fish       |
| Job     |                |           |            |
| Pet     |                |            |            |
| Sport   |                | Ice-hockey | Golf       |

#### Final Clue:
- The only sport left for the dressmaker is lacrosse.

|         | Dressmaker     | Manager    | Fish       |
| Job     |                |           |            |
| Pet     |                |            |            |
| Sport   | Lacrosse       | Ice-hockey | Golf       |

Now, we need to assign the pets. Since the owner of the fish (position 3) has golf, the dressmaker (position 1) cannot have the fish. The manager (position 2) also cannot have the fish. Therefore, the dressmaker must have the chinchilla (since the guinea-pig is not the owner of ice-hockey, it must be the guinea-pig).

|         | Dressmaker     | Manager    | Fish       |
| Job     |                |           |            |
| Pet     | Chinchilla     |           | Guinea-pig |
| Sport   | Lacrosse       | Ice-hockey | Golf       |

Finally, the only pet left for the manager is the fish.

|         | Dressmaker     | Manager    | Fish       |
| Job     |                |           |            |
| Pet     | Chinchilla     | Fish      | Guinea-pig |
| Sport   | Lacrosse       | Ice-hockey | Golf       |

Lv10-3x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Person driving the airplane is somewhere between the malaysian and the russian**:
   - This means the order could be: Malaysian (M), Airplane (A), Russian (R) or Russian (R), Airplane (A), Malaysian (M).

2. **Malaysian is the person eating garlic or the person driving the motorbike, but not both**:
   - This means the Malaysian can either eat garlic or drive a motorbike, but not both.

3. **Russian is somewhere to the left of the Malaysian**:
   - This means if the Malaysian is in position 1, the Russian must be in position 2 or 3; if the Malaysian is in position 2, the Russian must be in position 1 or 3; if the Malaysian is in position 3, the Russian must be in position 1 or 2.

4. **Person driving the airplane is somewhere between the person eating garlic and the person eating strawberry**:
   - This means if we denote the person eating garlic as G, the person eating strawberry as S, and the person driving the airplane as A, then the order could be G, A, S or S, A, G.

5. **Nigerian is on the left of the person eating garlic**:
   - This means the Nigerian (N) must be in position 1 if the person eating garlic is in position 2 or 3.

6. **Russian and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions**:
   - This means if the Russian is in an odd position, the person driving the motorbike must also be in an odd position; if the Russian is in an even position, the person driving the motorbike must also be in an even position.

### Filling in the Table:

Let's start with the constraints and see how they fit together.

#### Step 1: Determine the positions for the Russian and Malaysian.
- From constraint 3, if the Malaysian is in position 1, the Russian must be in position 2 or 3.
- From constraint 1, if the Malaysian is in position 1, the Russian must be in position 2 (since the airplane driver must be between them).
- If the Malaysian is in position 2, the Russian must be in position 1.
- If the Malaysian is in position 3, the Russian must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions for the Nigerian.
- From constraint 5, the Nigerian must be on the left of the person eating garlic.
- This means if the person eating garlic is in position 2 or 3, the Nigerian must be in position 1.

#### Step 3: Determine the positions for the airplane driver.
- From constraint 1, the airplane driver must be between the Malaysian and the Russian.
- From constraint 4, the airplane driver must be between the person eating garlic and the person eating strawberry.

#### Step 4: Determine the positions for the food and transport.
- From constraint 2, the Malaysian can either eat garlic or drive the motorbike, but not both.
- From constraint 6, the Russian and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions.

### Solution Table:

Given the constraints, let's place the elements:

1. **Position 1**: Nigerian (N)
2. **Position 2**: Malaysian (M) (eating garlic)
3. **Position 3**: Russian (R) (driving the airplane)

- The Nigerian is on the left of the person eating garlic.
- The Malaysian is eating garlic.
- The Russian is driving the airplane.
- The airplane driver is between the person eating garlic and the person eating strawberry.
- The Malaysian cannot drive the motorbike since he is eating garlic.

Since the Russian and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions, and the Russian is in an even position (position 2), the person driving the motorbike must also be in an even position (position 2, which is the Malaysian). However, the Malaysian is already eating garlic, so this is not possible. Therefore, the motorbike must be driven by the person in position 3, who is the Russian.

Thus, the person eating strawberry must be in position 1, which is the Nigerian.

Final table:

Lv10-3x3-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The librarian is the person drinking juice or the librarian is the person watching animation movies, but not both.**
   - This means the librarian either drinks juice or watches animation, but not both.

2. **The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies.**
   - If someone is watching animation, the person watching comedy must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **The person watching spy movies is on the right of the nurse.**
   - The nurse cannot be in position 3, and the spy must be in position 2 or 3.

4. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the bartender.**
   - The bartender cannot be in position 1.

5. **The person watching animation movies is not the bartender.**
   - The bartender does not watch animation.

6. **The person watching spy movies is not the librarian.**
   - The librarian does not watch spy.

7. **The person watching animation movies and the bartender have different parity positions.**
   - If one is in an odd position (1 or 3), the other must be in an even position (2).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Librarian's Position
From Clue 1, the librarian can only be:
- Drinking juice (Clue 1a)
- Watching animation (Clue 1b)

Since the librarian cannot be both, we need to determine which one fits better with other clues.

#### Step 2: Determine the Bartender's Position
From Clue 4, the bartender cannot be in position 1. So, the bartender can be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Determine the Spy and Nurse Positions
From Clue 3, the spy is on the right of the nurse. Therefore, if the nurse is in position 1, the spy must be in position 2 or 3.
- If the nurse is in position 2, the spy must be in position 3.
- If the nurse is in position 3, there is no valid position for the spy.

So, the nurse must be in position 1, and the spy must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 4: Determine the Animation Movie Watcher
From Clue 2, the person watching comedy is to the right of the person watching animation. So, the animation watcher must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 5: Determine the Parity of Animation and Bartender
From Clue 7, the animation watcher and the bartender have different parity positions. If the animation watcher is in position 1 (odd), the bartender must be in position 2 (even). If the animation watcher is in position 2 (even), the bartender must be in position 3 (odd).

#### Step 6: Determine the Librarian's Role
From Clue 1, the librarian can only be:
- Drinking juice (Clue 1a)
- Watching animation (Clue 1b)

If the librarian is watching animation, then the animation watcher must be in position 1, and the bartender must be in position 3 (odd parity).

If the librarian is drinking juice, the animation watcher must be in position 2, and the bartender must be in position 1 (even parity).

#### Step 7: Final Placement Based on All Clues

Let's try the scenario where the librarian drinks juice:
- Librarian in position 1, drinking juice.
- Animation watcher in position 2.
- Bartender in position 3.

This satisfies all the conditions:
- Librarian drinks juice.
- Animation watcher is in position 2.
- Bartender is in position 3.
- Spy (not the librarian) is in position 2.
- Nurse is in position 1.
- Soy-milk drinker is in position 1 (left of bartender).

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | Juice     | Fanta     | Soy-milk  |
| Job           | Nurse     | Spy       | Bartender |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation | Comedy    | Spy       |
```

### Final Solution:

Lv10-3x3-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The Argentine is not the fan of R&B.**
   - This means the Argentine either prefers Ambient or Salsa.

2. **The Freelancer is on the left of the Nurse.**
   - This implies the Freelancer is in position 1 and the Nurse is in position 2 or 3.

3. **The Freelancer is the Argentine or the Fan of Salsa, but not both.**
   - If the Freelancer is the Argentine, then the Freelancer cannot be the Fan of Salsa.
   - If the Freelancer is the Fan of Salsa, then the Freelancer cannot be the Argentine.

4. **The Argentine and the Fan of R&B have different parity positions.**
   - If the Argentine is in an odd position (1), the Fan of R&B must be in an even position (2 or 3).
   - If the Argentine is in an even position (2), the Fan of R&B must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

5. **The Colombian and the Nurse have different parity positions.**
   - If the Colombian is in an odd position (1), the Nurse must be in an even position (2 or 3).
   - If the Colombian is in an even position (2), the Nurse must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

6. **The Fan of R&B is somewhere to the left of the Teacher.**
   - The Fan of R&B cannot be in position 3 if the Teacher is in position 2 or 3.

7. **The Fan of Salsa is the Argentine or the Freelancer is the Fan of Salsa, but not both.**
   - If the Fan of Salsa is the Argentine, then the Freelancer cannot be the Fan of Salsa.
   - If the Freelancer is the Fan of Salsa, then the Argentine cannot be the Fan of Salsa.

8. **The Freelancer and the Fan of Salsa have the same parity positions.**
   - If the Freelancer is in an odd position (1), the Fan of Salsa must also be in an odd position (1).
   - If the Freelancer is in an even position (2), the Fan of Salsa must also be in an even position (2).

### Step-by-Step Solution:
Let's start with the Freelancer being in position 1 (leftmost) based on clue 2 and see where it leads us:

- **Freelancer is in position 1.**
- **Nurse is in position 2 or 3.**

From clue 3, since the Freelancer is in position 1, he cannot be the Fan of Salsa, so he must be the Argentine. Therefore, the Argentine is in position 1.

- **Argentine is in position 1.**
- **Fan of Salsa is in position 2 or 3.**

From clue 7, the Fan of Salsa cannot be the Freelancer, so the Freelancer is not the Fan of Salsa. From clue 8, the Freelancer and the Fan of Salsa have the same parity positions. Since the Freelancer is in position 1 (odd), the Fan of Salsa must also be in position 1, which is impossible. So, the Freelancer must be the Fan of Salsa, and the Fan of Salsa must be in position 2 or 3.

Since the Freelancer is the Fan of Salsa, the Argentine is in position 1, and the Fan of Salsa is in position 2 or 3, let's assume the Fan of Salsa is in position 2 for now.

- **Fan of Salsa is in position 2.**
- **Nurse is in position 3.**

Now, let's use clue 4:
- **The Argentine and the Fan of R&B have different parity positions.**
- Since the Argentine is in position 1 (odd), the Fan of R&B must be in position 3 (odd).

So, the Fan of R&B is in position 3.

- **The Colombian and the Nurse have different parity positions.**
- Since the Nurse is in position 3 (odd), the Colombian must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the Argentine is in position 1, the Colombian must be in position 2.

- **The Colombian is in position 2.**
- **Nurse is in position 3.**

Finally, we need to assign the jobs:
- **Freelancer (position 1) is the Fan of Salsa.**
- **Nurse (position 3) is the Teacher.**
- **Colombian (position 2) is the Freelancer.**

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
| Job           | Freelancer | Colombian | Nurse    |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa      | R&B      | Ambient  |
| Nationality   | Argentine  | Colombian | Mexican  |
```

Lv10-3x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct information into the table. Let's go through the clues step by step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The Canadian is in an odd position.**
   - This means the Canadian can only be in position 1 or 3.

2. **The person whose hobby is writing is the Canadian or the Canadian is the person driving the tram, but not both.**
   - If the Canadian has the hobby of writing, then the Canadian cannot be the one driving the tram.
   - If the Canadian is driving the tram, then the Canadian cannot have the hobby of writing.

3. **The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the Nigerian.**
   - This means if the Nigerian is in position 1, the Filmmaker must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the Nigerian is in position 2, the Filmmaker must be in position 3.
   - If the Nigerian is in position 3, there is no room for the Filmmaker (which would violate the rule).

4. **The person whose hobby is writing is in an even position.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of writing can only be in position 2.

5. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the person whose hobby is writing.**
   - Since the person with the hobby of writing is in position 2, the person driving the trike must be in position 3.

### Deductions:
- From clue 4, the person with the hobby of writing must be in position 2.
- From clue 5, the person driving the trike must be in position 3.
- From clue 2, since the person with the hobby of writing is in position 2, the Canadian cannot be the one driving the tram. Therefore, the Canadian must be in position 1.
- From clue 1, the Canadian is in an odd position, which fits with position 1.
- From clue 3, since the Canadian is in position 1 and the person with the hobby of writing is in position 2, the Nigerian must be in position 3 (since the Filmmaker must be to the right of the Nigerian, and the only remaining position is 3).

### Placing the Hobbies:
- The person in position 2 (writing) is the Canadian.
- The person in position 3 (trike) is the Nigerian.
- The person in position 1 must be the Thai, as there are only three nationalities and the other two are already placed.

### Placing the Hobbies:
- The person in position 1 (Thai) must be the Filmmaker (since the Filmmaker must be to the right of the Nigerian, and the only remaining position is 1).
- The person in position 2 (Canadian) must have the hobby of writing.
- The person in position 3 (Nigerian) must be the Filmmaker.

Lv10-3x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step-by-step. Let's break down the clues and determine the correct arrangement.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking fanta.**
   - This means if someone is eating zucchini (Z), then the person drinking fanta (F) must be to their right.
   
2. **The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the person eating pomegranate (P).**
   - This implies that the person eating zucchini can be adjacent to or next to the person eating pomegranate.

3. **The person who's sport is ice-hockey (I) is somewhere to the right of the person eating pomegranate.**
   - If someone is playing ice-hockey, they are to the right of the person eating pomegranate.

4. **The person drinking juice (J) is not to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.**
   - The person drinking juice cannot be to the left of the person playing ice-hockey.

5. **The person eating grapes (G) is not to the left of the person drinking fanta.**
   - The person eating grapes cannot be to the left of the person drinking fanta.

6. **The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person eating pomegranate or the person eating pomegranate is the person drinking fanta, but not both.**
   - This means either the person eating pomegranate plays ice-hockey, or the person drinking fanta eats pomegranate, but not both.

7. **The person eating pomegranate is not to the right of the person drinking juice.**
   - The person eating pomegranate cannot be to the right of the person drinking juice.

8. **The person eating grapes is on the right of the person who's sport is golf (Gf).**
   - The person eating grapes is to the right of the person playing golf.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is ice-hockey (I) is the person eating pomegranate (P) or the person eating pomegranate is the person drinking fanta (F), but not both.
   - Let's assume P = I for now and see if it fits other clues.

2. **Clue 7:** The person eating pomegranate is not to the right of the person drinking juice (J).
   - Since P = I, and I cannot be to the right of J, J must be to the left of I.

3. **Clue 1:** The person eating zucchini (Z) is on the left of the person drinking fanta (F).
   - Z must be to the left of F.

4. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
   - Since P = I, I (Pomegranate) must be to the left of F.

5. **Clue 5:** The person eating grapes (G) is not to the left of the person drinking fanta.
   - G cannot be to the left of F.

6. **Clue 8:** The person eating grapes is on the right of the person who's sport is golf (Gf).
   - G must be to the right of Gf.

7. **Combining Clues:**
   - From Clue 6, P = I.
   - From Clue 7, J must be to the left of P (I).
   - From Clue 1, Z must be to the left of F.
   - From Clue 3, P (I) must be to the left of F.
   - From Clue 5, G cannot be to the left of F.
   - From Clue 8, G must be to the right of Gf.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit them into the positions:

- Z must be first (leftmost) because it must be to the left of F.
- P (I) must be second because it must be to the left of F and to the left of J.
- F must be third because it is to the right of P and Z.
- G must be to the right of Gf.

Since P (I) is the person eating pomegranate and playing ice-hockey, and J is to the left of P, J must be first. Z is to the left of F, so Z must be second. F is third.

This leaves G and Gf. Since G is to the right of Gf, G must be in the last position.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- J (Juice)
- Z (Zucchini)
- F (Fanta)
- G (Grapes)
- Gf (Golf)

Lv10-3x3-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching family movies is the owner of the chinchilla.
2. The owner of the pony is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
3. The fan of funk is the person watching sports movies.
4. The person watching family movies is the fan of trance or the person watching family movies is the owner of the chinchilla, but not both (this seems redundant since it repeats the first clue).
5. The fan of funk is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.
6. The fan of d&b is not to the right of the owner of the pony.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the owner of the chinchilla and their preference.
- From Clue 1: The person watching family movies is the owner of the chinchilla.
- Let's denote this person as Person A.

#### Step 2: Determine the position of the owner of the pony.
- From Clue 2: The owner of the pony is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
- Therefore, Person A (owner of chinchilla) must be in Position 1, and the owner of the pony must be in Position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Identify the person who is the fan of funk.
- From Clue 3: The fan of funk is the person watching sports movies.
- Let's denote this person as Person B.

#### Step 4: Determine the positions of the fans of funk and family movies.
- From Clue 5: The fan of funk is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.
- Since Person A is watching family movies, Person B (fan of funk) must be in Position 1 or 2.
- But from Clue 2, the owner of the pony (who is also in Position 2 or 3) cannot be the fan of funk. So, Person B (fan of funk) must be in Position 1.

#### Step 5: Determine the position of the owner of the pony.
- Since Person B is in Position 1, the owner of the pony must be in Position 2 or 3.
- From Clue 2, the owner of the pony is to the right of Person A (who is in Position 1). Therefore, the owner of the pony must be in Position 3.

#### Step 6: Determine the remaining preferences.
- From Clue 6: The fan of d&b is not to the right of the owner of the pony.
- The owner of the pony is in Position 3, so the fan of d&b cannot be in Position 3. Therefore, the fan of d&b must be in Position 2.

#### Step 7: Assign the remaining genres and pets.
- Person A (in Position 1) is watching family movies and owns the chinchilla.
- Person B (in Position 1) is the fan of funk and watching sports movies.
- The owner of the pony (in Position 3) must be the fan of d&b.

Thus, we have:
- Position 1: Person A (Family Movies, Chinchilla)
- Position 2: Fan of d&b, Pony
- Position 3: Fan of funk, Sports Movies

Now let's fill in the table:

```
|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Family | Sports     | D&B    |
| Music-Genre   | Funk   |            |        |
| Pet           | Chinchilla | Pony  |        |
```

Since the fan of trance is not specified, we can assume the remaining genre for Position 2 is the last remaining genre, which is d&b.

Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Family | Sports     | D&B    |
| Music-Genre   | Funk   | D&B        |        |
| Pet           | Chinchilla | Pony  |        |

Lv10-3x3-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct information into the table. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.**
   - This means the person with puzzles cannot be in position 1 if the person with climbing is in position 1.

2. **The person who's hobby is puzzles is the person who's sport is basketball or the person who's sport is basketball is the fan d&b, but not both.**
   - This implies that if the person with puzzles has basketball as their sport, then that person must be the fan of d&b. Otherwise, the fan of d&b must have basketball as their sport.

3. **The person who's hobby is skydiving and the fan funk have the same parity positions.**
   - This means that if the person with skydiving is in an odd position, the fan of funk must also be in an odd position. If the person with skydiving is in an even position, the fan of funk must also be in an even position.

4. **The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.**
   - This means the person with climbing cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the person with skydiving is in position 1 or 2, respectively.

5. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the fan d&b.**
   - This means the fan of d&b cannot be in position 3 if the person with lacrosse is in position 2 or 3.

6. **The person who's hobby is writing is between the fan funk and the fan d&b.**
   - This means the person with writing must be in the middle position (position 2) if the fan funk and fan d&b are in positions 1 and 3 or 3 and 1, respectively.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Position 1:**
   - From clue 4, the person with climbing cannot be in position 1.
   - From clue 1, the person with puzzles cannot be in position 1 if the person with climbing is in any position.
   - Therefore, position 1 must be occupied by either skydiving or writing.

2. **Position 3:**
   - From clue 5, the person with lacrosse cannot be in position 3 if the fan of d&b is in position 2.
   - From clue 3, the person with skydiving and the fan of funk must have the same parity positions.
   - Since position 3 is an odd position, the person with skydiving must be in position 3 if the fan of funk is in position 1 or 3.

3. **Position 2:**
   - The person with writing must be in position 2 (clue 6).
   - Therefore, the person with writing is between the fan funk and the fan d&b.

4. **Clue 2:**
   - If the person with puzzles has basketball as their sport, they must be the fan of d&b.
   - If the person with basketball is the fan of d&b, then the person with puzzles cannot have basketball as their sport.
   - Therefore, the person with puzzles must have lacrosse as their sport (since lacrosse cannot be in position 2).

5. **Clue 3:**
   - The person with skydiving and the fan funk must have the same parity positions.
   - Since the person with writing is in position 2, the person with skydiving and the fan funk must be in positions 1 and 3.

6. **Clue 4:**
   - The person with climbing must be to the right of the person with skydiving.
   - Therefore, the person with climbing must be in position 3.

7. **Clue 5:**
   - The fan of d&b cannot be in position 3 if the person with lacrosse is in position 2.
   - Therefore, the fan of d&b must be in position 1, and the person with lacrosse must be in position 3.

8. **Clue 6:**
   - The person with writing is between the fan funk and the fan d&b.
   - Therefore, the fan funk must be in position 1 and the fan d&b must be in position 3.

Lv10-3x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and use process of elimination and logical deduction.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **The fan of house music is on the right of the person watching drama movies.**
2. **The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.**
3. **The fan of punk is not to the right of the Italian.**
4. **The Italian is somewhere to the right of the person watching drama movies.**
5. **The Italian is somewhere between the Nigerian and the fan of blues.**
6. **The Italian is the person watching drama movies or the Italian is the fan of house, but not both.**

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 6:
- The Italian is either the person watching drama movies or the fan of house.
- This means if the Italian is the person watching drama movies, they cannot be the fan of house.
- If the Italian is the fan of house, they cannot be the person watching drama movies.

#### Clue 4:
- The Italian is to the right of the person watching drama movies.

#### Clue 5:
- The Italian is between the Nigerian and the fan of blues.
- This means the order must be: Nigerian, Italian, Fan of blues (or vice versa).

#### Clue 3:
- The fan of punk is not to the right of the Italian.
- Since the Italian is to the right of the person watching drama movies, the fan of punk cannot be in position 3.

#### Clue 2:
- The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
- This means the person watching disaster movies can be adjacent to the person watching drama movies.

#### Clue 1:
- The fan of house music is on the right of the person watching drama movies.

### Possible Positions:
Given the constraints, we can start placing elements:

1. **Person Watching Drama Movies:**
   - Let's assume this is in position 2 (since it needs to have the fan of house on the right).

2. **Fan of House Music:**
   - Must be in position 3 (right of the person watching drama movies).

3. **Italian:**
   - Must be to the right of the person watching drama movies.
   - Also, must be between the Nigerian and the fan of blues.

4. **Fan of Punk:**
   - Cannot be in position 3 (right of the Italian).
   - Therefore, the fan of punk must be in position 1.

5. **Disaster Movies:**
   - Must be on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
   - Since the fan of house is in position 3, the person watching disaster movies could be in position 1 or 2.

Given these placements, let's finalize:

- Position 1: Fan of Punk (must be since it cannot be in position 3)
- Position 2: Person Watching Drama Movies (to allow the fan of house in position 3)
- Position 3: Fan of House Music (right of the person watching drama movies)

Now, considering the Italian and other constraints:
- The Italian must be in position 3 (between Nigerian and fan of blues) and to the right of the person watching drama movies.
- The Nigerian must be in position 1 (leftmost), and the fan of blues must be in position 2 (right of the Nigerian).

Thus, the final arrangement is:

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Punk     | Drama    | House    |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |          |
| Nationality   | Nigerian | Italian  | Fan of Blues |
