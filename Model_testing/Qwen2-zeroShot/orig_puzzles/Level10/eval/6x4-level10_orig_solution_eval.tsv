Lv10-6x4-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person Watching Spy Movies is on the Far Left:**
   - Position 1: Spy Movies

2. **Person Watching Thriller Movies is Not to the Left of the Fan Classical:**
   - Since Spy is at position 1, Thriller cannot be at position 2 (as it would be to the left of the Fan Classical).
   - Therefore, Thriller must be at position 3 or 4.

3. **Fan Classical is Somewhere Between Fan Soul and Person Eating Radish:**
   - This means the positions for these three are sequential.
   - Let's denote Fan Soul as S, Fan Classical as C, and Person Eating Radish as R.
   - Possible sequences: S-C-R or R-C-S

4. **Fan Classical is the Person Watching Documentary Movies or Fan Classical is the Person Eating Apple, but Not Both:**
   - This means one of these two statements must be true, and the other false.
   - Let's consider the implications of each:
     - If C = Documentary, then C ≠ Apple.
     - If C = Apple, then C ≠ Documentary.

5. **Fan Gospel is Not to the Right of Fan Soul:**
   - This means if S is in position i, C is in position j, then i < j.

6. **Person Who's Hobby is Hiking is Somewhere Between Person Who's Hobby is Sudoku and the Person Drinking Sprite:**
   - This means the positions for these three are sequential.
   - Let's denote Person Hiking as H, Person Sudoku as D, and Person Drinking Sprite as S.
   - Possible sequences: H-D-S or S-D-H

7. **Person Who's Hobby is Chess is Somewhere to the Left of the Person Who's Hobby is Filmmaking:**
   - Chess < Filmmaking

8. **Person Drinking Coffee is on the Right of the Person Watching Thriller Movies:**
   - If Thriller is at position 3, Coffee must be at position 4.
   - If Thriller is at position 4, Coffee must be at position 4 (no change).

9. **Person Who's Hobby is Filmmaking is the Brazilian or the Person Who's Hobby is Filmmaking is the Fan Gospel, but Not Both:**
   - This means one of these two statements must be true, and the other false.
   - Let's consider the implications of each:
     - If Filmmaking = Brazilian, then Filmmaking ≠ Fan Gospel.
     - If Filmmaking = Fan Gospel, then Filmmaking ≠ Brazilian.

10. **Person Eating Apple is Not to the Left of the Person Watching Documentary Movies:**
    - This means if Apple is in position i, Documentary is in position j, then i > j.

11. **Person Eating Papaya is the Person Who's Hobby is Filmmaking or the Person Eating Papaya is the Person Watching Spy Movies, but Not Both:**
    - This means one of these two statements must be true, and the other false.
    - Let's consider the implications of each:
      - If Papaya = Filmmaking, then Papaya ≠ Spy.
      - If Papaya = Spy, then Papaya ≠ Filmmaking.

12. **Fan Gospel is Not the Argentine:**
    - The Fan Gospel cannot be Argentine.

13. **Person Eating Apple is Not to the Left of the Person Watching Documentary Movies:**
    - This means if Apple is in position i, Documentary is in position j, then i > j.

14. **Person Drinking Sprite is Between the Indian and the Person Eating Papaya:**
    - This means if Indian is in position i, Papaya is in position j, then Sprite is in position (i+1) or (j-1).

15. **Fan Classical is Not to the Right of the Person Drinking Sprite:**
    - This means if Sprite is in position i, C must be in position j where j < i.

16. **Person Drinking Sprite is Not to the Left of the Fan Soul:**
    - This means if Sprite is in position i, S must be in position j where j > i.

17. **Fan Gospel is Not the Argentine:**
    - The Fan Gospel cannot be Argentine.

18. **Person Drinking Sprite is Not to the Left of the Fan Soul:**
    - This means if Sprite is in position i, S must be in position j where j > i.

19. **Person Who's Hobby is Hiking is on the Left of the Person Who's Hobby is Chess:**
    - Hiking < Chess

### Analysis and Filling the Table:

1. **Clue 16:** The person eating pineapple (position 2) is the analyst.
2. **Clue 13:** The fan of indie is the person eating nectarine (position 4). Therefore, the person eating nectarine (position 4) is the fan of indie.
3. **Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is dancing (position 1) is on the left of the person eating nectarine (position 4).
4. **Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is dancing (position 1) is the analyst or the person drinking fanta (position 1) is the person whose hobby is dancing. Since the analyst is already in position 2, the person drinking fanta must be the person whose hobby is dancing.
5. **Clue 7:** The architect is on the right of the person driving the airplane. Let’s assume the person driving the airplane is in position 3, so the architect is in position 4.
6. **Clue 17:** The person eating peas (position 3) is not to the right of the fan of techno. So, the fan of techno cannot be in position 3 or 4.
7. **Clue 21:** The person driving the helicopter is the person whose hobby is dancing. From clue 10, the person whose hobby is dancing is the analyst (position 2), so the person driving the helicopter must be in position 2. But since the analyst is already in position 2, the person driving the helicopter must be someone else.
8. **Clue 20:** The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the fan of techno. If the fan of techno is in position 1, then the person driving the helicopter could be in position 3 or 4.
9. **Clue 22:** The person driving the airplane is the fan of jazz or the person driving the airplane is the person whose hobby is filmmaking. If the person driving the airplane is in position 3, and the person whose hobby is filmmaking is in position 1, then the person driving the airplane must be the fan of jazz.
10. **Clue 15:** The person driving the helicopter and the person eating pineapple (position 2) have the same parity positions (both even or both odd). Since the person eating pineapple is in position 2 (even), the person driving the helicopter must also be in an even position, which is position 4.
11. **Clue 14:** The person drinking sprite and the person driving the jet-ski have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 4 (even), the person drinking sprite must also be in an even position, which is position 2.
12. **Clue 8:** The person drinking soy-milk is the person driving the jet-ski or the person drinking soy-milk is the fan of indie, but not both. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 4 (even), the person drinking soy-milk must be the fan of indie in position 4.
13. **Clue 9:** The person driving the helicopter and the person eating pineapple have the same parity positions. Since the person eating pineapple is in position 2 (even), the person driving the helicopter must also be in position 4.
14. **Clue 12:** The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the subway is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 4.
15. **Clue 5:** The person drinking milk is the fan of indie or the fan of indie is the person whose hobby is cooking, but not both. Since the fan of indie is the person eating nectarine (position 4), the person drinking milk must be the person whose hobby is cooking.
16. **Clue 6:** The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person whose hobby is cooking. Since the person whose hobby is cooking is in position 4, the person whose hobby is filmmaking must be in position 3.
17. **Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is woodworking is the person driving the jet-ski or the person whose hobby is woodworking is the writer, but not both. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 4, the person whose hobby is woodworking must be the writer.
18. **Clue 2:** The person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple. Since the person eating pineapple is in position 2, the person driving the subway must be in position 1.
19. **Clue 19:** The fan of jazz is the person eating raspberry. Since the fan of jazz is the person driving the airplane, the person eating raspberry must be in position 3.
20. **Clue 11:** The fan of indie is not to the left of the fan of indie. This is consistent with our placement.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person eating spinach is on the far left (Position 1).**
2. **Person driving the car is the person whose hobby is drawing (from Clue 19).**
3. **Fan of dubstep is on the far left or far right (Clue 18).** Since spinach is at Position 1, dubstep must be at Position 4.
4. **Person whose hobby is drawing is the fan of classical or the person watching drama movies, but not both (Clue 6).** Since the person whose hobby is drawing is at Position 2, they cannot be the fan of classical (as it would contradict Clue 10), so they must be the person watching drama movies (even position).
5. **Person watching drama movies is in an even position (2 or 4).** Since drawing is at Position 2, the person watching drama movies is at Position 2.
6. **Person whose hobby is drawing and the fan of hip-hop have the same parity positions (Clue 4).** Since drawing is at Position 2, the fan of hip-hop must also be at Position 2, which is impossible as drawing already occupies that position. Therefore, the fan of hip-hop must be at Position 4, and drawing must be at Position 2.
7. **Person driving the trike is not the person whose hobby is drawing (Clue 21).** So, the person driving the trike is not at Position 2.
8. **Person driving the trike is on the left of the person whose hobby is video-games (Clue 7).** So, the person driving the trike must be at Position 1 or 3, and the person whose hobby is video-games must be at Position 2 or 4.
9. **Person whose hobby is video-games and the person eating mango have different parity positions (Clue 9).** So, if video-games is at Position 2, mango must be at Position 4, and vice versa.
10. **Person watching western movies is between the person driving the trike and the person eating potato (Clue 12).** So, the person watching western movies must be at Position 3, the person driving the trike at Position 1, and the person eating potato at Position 4.
11. **Person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies (Clue 11).** So, the person watching epic movies must be at Position 1 or 2, and the person driving the boat must be at Position 3 or 4.
12. **Person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is drawing (Clue 23).** Since drawing is at Position 2, grapefruit can be at Position 1 or 3.
13. **Person whose hobby is board-games is not the person eating mango (Clue 13).** So, the person whose hobby is board-games must be at Position 1, 3, or 4, and not at Position 2.
14. **Person drinking lemonade is not the person driving the car (Clue 14).** So, the person drinking lemonade must be at Position 1, 3, or 4, and not at Position 2.
15. **Person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea (Clue 15).** So, lemonade must be at Position 1 or 3, and tea must be at Position 2 or 4.
16. **Person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike (Clue 16).** So, tea must be at Position 1 or 3, and the person driving the trike must be at Position 2 or 4.
17. **Person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda (Clue 17).** So, mirinda can be at Position 1, 2, 3, or 4, and satire movies can be at Position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
