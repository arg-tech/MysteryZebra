Lv10-3x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct information into the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Firefighter**:
   - The firefighter is in the middle (position 4).
   - The firefighter owns the lizard or eats nectarine, but not both.
   
2. **Person Eating Corn**:
   - Is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
   - Is between the person eating nectarine and the person eating onion.
   - Is in position 3 (since it must be an odd position and it must be between nectarine and onion).

3. **Dancer**:
   - Is in an even position (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).
   - Is either to the left or right of the person eating corn (position 3).
   - Since the firefighter is in position 4, the dancer cannot be in position 4. Thus, the dancer can be in positions 2, 6, or 8.

4. **Person Eating Watermelon**:
   - Is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
   - Must be in position 5 (since it is the only remaining odd position after placing corn at position 3).

5. **Person Eating Mango**:
   - Is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion.
   - Must be in an odd position (positions 1 or 3) or in position 5.
   - Cannot be in position 3 because corn is there. Thus, the person eating mango must be in position 1.

6. **Person Eating Onion**:
   - Must be to the right of the person eating mango.
   - Since mango is in position 1, onion must be in position 2, 4, or 6.
   - Since the firefighter is in position 4, onion cannot be in position 4. Thus, onion must be in position 6.

7. **Person Eating Nectarine**:
   - Must be in an even position (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).
   - Cannot be in position 4 (firefighter), 6 (onion), or 8 (must be between mango and corn). Thus, nectarine must be in position 2.

8. **Person Eating Carrot**:
   - Is the owner of the frog or the coach, but not both.
   - Must be in an even position (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).
   - Since nectarine is in position 2, the person eating carrot must be in position 6 or 8.

9. **Person Eating Cranberry**:
   - Is somewhere to the right of the person eating mango (position 1).
   - Must be in an even position (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).
   - Since nectarine is in position 2, cranberry must be in position 4, 6, or 8.
   - Since the firefighter is in position 4, cranberry cannot be in position 4. Thus, cranberry must be in position 6 or 8.

10. **Person Eating Watermelon**:
    - Is in position 5 (already placed).

11. **Owner of the Hedgehog**:
    - Must be in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
    - Must be to the right of the person eating mango (position 1).
    - Since mango is in position 1, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 3 or 5.
    - Since corn is in position 3, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 5.

12. **Owner of the Goat**:
    - Must be on the far left (position 1).

13. **Electrician**:
    - Is not to the right of the person eating mango (position 1).
    - Is between the owner of the turtle and the lawyer.
    - Must be in an even position (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).
    - Since nectarine is in position 2, the electrician cannot be in position 2.
    - Since the person eating cranberry is to the right of the person eating mango, the electrician must be in position 6 or 8.
    - Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 5, the electrician cannot be in position 5.
    - Thus, the electrician must be in position 8.

14. **Architect**:
    - Is not to the left of the person eating carrot.
    - Is to the right of the owner of the dog.
    - Must be in an even position (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).
    - Since nectarine is in position 2, the architect cannot be in position 2.
    - Since the electrician is in position 8, the architect must be in position 6.

15. **Owner of the Dog**:
    - Must be to the right of the architect (position 6).
    - Must be in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
    - Since the owner of the goat is in position 1 and the owner of the hedgehog is in position 5, the owner of the dog must be in position 3.

16. **Owner of the Chinchilla**:
    - Is between the person eating corn (position 3) and the architect (position 6).
    - Must be in an even position (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).
    - Since nectarine is in position 2 and the architect is in position 6, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 4.

17. **Project-Manager**:
    - Must be to the right of the person eating mango (position 1).
    - Must be in an even position (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).

Lv10-3x7-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct information into the table. Let's start by organizing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 27**: The teacher is the person eating cherry.
2. **Clue 15**: The person who's sport is volleyball is in an odd position (4).
3. **Clue 22**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon. Since volleyball is at position 4, the person eating watermelon must be either at position 3 or 5.
4. **Clue 1**: The person eating watermelon is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Therefore, if the person eating watermelon is at position 3, then the person with sport rugby cannot be at position 1 or 2.
5. **Clue 5**: The person eating cherry (the teacher) is in an odd position (4), which contradicts Clue 27. This means the teacher cannot be the person eating cherry. We will revisit this after more information is filled in.
6. **Clue 14**: The accountant is somewhere to the right of the teacher. Since the teacher is at position 4, the accountant must be at position 5, 6, or 7.
7. **Clue 25**: The accountant is on the right of the teacher. So the accountant must be at position 6 or 7.
8. **Clue 17**: The dancer is on the left of the electrician. This means the electrician must be at a position to the right of the dancer.
9. **Clue 26**: The teacher is somewhere between the electrician and the person who's sport is basketball. Since the teacher is at position 4, the electrician must be to the right of position 4, and the person with sport basketball must be to the left of position 4.
10. **Clue 13**: The person who's sport is basketball is in an even position (6). This means the person with sport basketball is at position 6.
11. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is basketball is not the electrician. Therefore, the electrician cannot be at position 6.
12. **Clue 30**: The accountant is the person eating peas or the accountant is the person who's sport is skateboarding, but not both. Since the accountant is at position 6, the accountant cannot be the person eating peas (because the person eating peas is at position 3 or 5, and the accountant is at position 6). Therefore, the accountant must be the person who's sport is skateboarding.
13. **Clue 19**: The doctor is not the person who's sport is lacrosse. So the doctor must be one of the remaining sports: accountant, architect, dancer, firefighter, or teacher.
14. **Clue 24**: The teacher is not the person eating peas. Since the teacher is at position 4, the person eating peas must be at position 3 or 5.
15. **Clue 21**: The teacher and the person eating watermelon have different parity positions. Since the teacher is at position 4 (even), the person eating watermelon must be at position 3 (odd).
16. **Clue 11**: The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person with sport basketball is at position 6, the person eating asparagus must be at position 7.
17. **Clue 23**: The person eating asparagus is on the right of the architect. Therefore, the architect must be at position 6, which contradicts the fact that the person with sport basketball is at position 6. We need to re-evaluate.
18. **Clue 28**: The architect and the person who's sport is basketball have different parity positions. Since the person with sport basketball is at position 6 (even), the architect must be at an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7).
19. **Clue 18**: The person eating cauliflower and the teacher have the same parity positions. Since the teacher is at position 4 (even), the person eating cauliflower must be at position 6 (even).
20. **Clue 29**: The person eating asparagus is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the person with sport golf cannot be at position 6 (basketball), it could be at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
21. **Clue 7**: The person eating peas is on the left of the doctor. Since the person eating peas is at position 3, the doctor must be at position 4, 5, 6, or 7.
22. **Clue 20**: The person who's sport is basketball is not the dancer. Therefore, the dancer must be one of the remaining sports: accountant, architect, dancer, firefighter, or teacher.
23. **Clue 16**: The person who's sport is biathlon and the person eating nectarine have the same parity positions. Since the person eating nectarine is at position 5 (odd), the person with sport biathlon must also be at position 5 (odd).
24. **Clue 9**: The firefighter is the person who's sport is biathlon or the firefighter is the person eating cauliflower, but not both. Since the firefighter cannot be at position 5 (biathlon), the firefighter must be the person eating cauliflower.
25. **Clue 12**: The person eating nectarine is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the person eating nectarine is at position 5, the person with sport rugby must be at position 3.
26. **Clue 8**: The dancer is on the right of the architect. Since the architect must be at an odd position and the dancer is on the right, the architect must be at position 1 and the dancer at position 2.
27. **Clue 10**: The firefighter and the person who's sport is biathlon have the same parity positions. Since the firefighter is at position 1 (odd) and the person with sport biathlon is at position 5 (odd), the person with sport biathlon is the firefighter.
28. **Clue 22**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon. Since the person eating watermelon is at position 3, the person with sport volleyball can be at position 2 or 4.
29. **Clue 1**: The person eating watermelon is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Therefore, the person with sport volleyball cannot be at position 2.
30. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is golf is not to the right of the person eating nectarine. Since the person eating nectarine is at position 5, the person with sport golf cannot be at position 6 or 7.
31. **Clue 26**: The teacher is somewhere between the electrician and the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person with sport basketball is at position 6, the teacher must be at position 4, and the electrician must be at position 5.
32. **Clue 24**: The teacher is not the person eating peas. Since the teacher is at position 4, the person eating peas must be at position 3.
33. **Clue 14**: The accountant is somewhere to the right of the teacher. Since the teacher is at position 4, the accountant must be at position 5 or 6 or 7. But since the accountant is at position 6, the person eating peas must be at position 3.
34. **Clue 30**: The accountant is the person eating peas or the accountant is the person who's sport is skateboarding, but not both. Since the accountant is at position 6, the accountant is the person who's sport is skateboarding.
35. **Clue 16**: The person who's sport is biathlon and the person eating nectarine have the same parity positions. Since the person eating nectarine is at position 5 (odd), the person with sport biathlon must also be at position 5 (odd). Therefore, the person with sport biathlon is the firefighter.
36. **Clue 29**: The person eating asparagus is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the person with sport golf cannot be at position 6, it must be at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
37. **Clue 11**: The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person with sport basketball is at position 6, the person eating asparagus must be at position 7.
38. **Clue 23**: The person eating asparagus is on the right of the architect. Therefore, the architect must be at position 6, which contradicts the fact that the person with sport basketball is at position 6. We need to re-evaluate.
