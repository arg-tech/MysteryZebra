The chinchilla owner must be in position 4 or 5, so the ship driver must also be in position 4 or 5.

12. **Lacrosse and Car**: From clue 1, the lacrosse player cannot be in position 4 or 5, so the lacrosse player must be in position 2 and the car driver in position 1.

13. **Beverages and Sports**: From clue 21, the bird owner is the car driver or the social-worker is the bird owner. Since the car driver is in position 1, the bird owner must be the social-worker. The social-worker is in position 2, so the bird owner is in position 2.

14. **Golf and Fanta**: From clue 4, the person whose sport is golf cannot be the fanta drinker. The fanta drinker must be in position 4 or 5, so the person whose sport is golf must be in position 1 or 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left (Position 1).
2. **Clue 14**: The person eating kale is the person drinking sprite (since it can't be the Thai).
3. **Clue 6**: The person drinking fanta is somewhere between the person driving the van and the person eating kale (since the person eating kale is in Position 3, fanta must be in Position 2 or 4).

Let's assume fanta is in Position 2 (we will verify later):

- **Position 1**: Almond-milk
- **Position 2**: Fanta
- **Position 3**: Sprite (kale)
- **Position 4**: ?
- **Position 5**: ?

4. **Clue 13**: The person drinking fanta is in an even position, so fanta is in Position 2 (confirmed).

5. **Clue 16**: The person watching action movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta (so action must be in Position 1 or 3).

Since the person drinking almond-milk is in Position 1, action cannot be there. So, action must be in Position 3 (sprite/kale).

6. **Clue 24**: The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies.

7. **Clue 29**: The person watching romance movies is somewhere between the person eating kale and the person eating lime. Since kale is in Position 3, the person watching romance movies must be in Position 2 (fanta).

8. **Clue 22**: The person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since scientific is in an odd position (Position 3), 7up cannot be in Position 4 or 5.

9. **Clue 25**: The person watching scientific movies is not to the right of the person eating kale. So, scientific must be in Position 3 (confirms our previous placement).

10. **Clue 28**: The person watching superhero movies is not the person drinking sprite (so superhero is in Position 4 or 5).

11. **Clue 21**: The person watching action movies is not to the right of the person watching superhero movies. So, action must be in Position 3 (sprite/kale), and superhero must be in Position 4 or 5.

12. **Clue 18**: The Thai is in an even position. So, Thai must be in Position 2 or 4.
