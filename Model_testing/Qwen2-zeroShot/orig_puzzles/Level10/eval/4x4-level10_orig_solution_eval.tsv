### Initial Setup

Let's start by setting up the grid and filling in what we know:

|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           |                 | soy-milk |            |
| Food          |           |                 |          |            |
| Job           |           |                 |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |                 |          |            |

#### Clue 16: The person drinking milk is in an even position
- Milk must be in position 2 or 4.

#### Clue 17: The person drinking milk and the person eating spinach have different parity positions
- If milk is in position 2, spinach must be in position 3 (odd).
- If milk is in position 4, spinach must be in position 1 (odd).

Let's assume milk is in position 2 for now:

- Animation must be in position 3 or 4 since milk is in position 2.

#### Clue 9: The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person drinking 7up
- Satire cannot be in position 1 or 2; it must be in position 3 or 4.
- 7up must be in position 1 or 2.

Since milk is in position 2, 7up must be in position 1:
|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | 7up       | milk            | soy-milk |            |
| Food          |           |                 |          |            |
| Job           |           |                 |          |            |

- Animation must be in position 3.

#### Clue 9: The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person drinking 7up
- Satire must be in position 4.

#### Clue 1: The person watching animation movies is not to the left of the person watching satire movies
- This is satisfied as animation is in position 3 and satire is in position 4.

- (Dubstep, Tennis) → (1, 2) or (2, 3)

From Constraint 3:
- (Frog, Thriller) → (3, 4) and (1, 3) or (2, 4)

From Constraint 4:
- (Thriller, Dog) → (4, 3) or (3, 2)

From Constraint 7:
- (Tennis, Drama) → (3, 2) or (4, 3)

Combining these, we get:
- (Tennis, Frog) → (3, 4)
- (Thriller, Dog) → (4, 3) or (3, 2)
- (Tennis, Drama) → (3, 2) or (4, 3)

Let's assume (Tennis, Frog) = (3, 4) and (Thriller, Dog) = (4, 3).

Then (Tennis, Drama) must be (3, 2).

From Constraint 8:
- (Mystery, Dog) and (Chinchilla) → (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

Since (Dog, 3) is taken, (Mystery, Chinchilla) → (1, 2), (2, 3).

From Constraint 9:
- (Thriller, Gospel) → (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

Since (Thriller, 4) is taken, (Gospel, 1) or (2).

From Constraint 6:
- (Chinchilla, Punk) or (Chinchilla, Water-Polo) → Not both

If (Chinchilla, 2), then (Punk, 1) or (Water-Polo, 1).

From Constraint 10:
- (Lacrosse, Pony) → (1, 3) or (2, 4)

Since (1, 3) is taken by (Punk, 1), (Lacrosse, 1) and (Pony, 3).

From Constraint 11:
- (R&B, Water-Polo) → Not (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)

So, (R&B, 1) and (Water-Polo, 4).

Now let's fill in the table:

Lv10-4x4-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 6**: The fan pop is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Fan Pop

2. **Clue 10**: The owner of the pony is on the far right.
   - Position 4: Pony

3. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is traveling is the person eating lemon.
   - Position 2: Lemon (Hobby: Traveling)

4. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the fan country.
   - Since Position 2 (Traveling) is to the left of the fan country, the fan country must be in Position 3.

5. **Clue 7**: The fan country is somewhere between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
   - We already placed Traveling in Position 2 and Fan Country in Position 3. Therefore, the person with the hobby of rock-climbing must be in Position 4.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is video-games is the fan pop or the person who's hobby is video-games is the owner of the goat, but not both.
   - Since the fan pop is in Position 1, the person with the hobby of video-games cannot be the fan pop. Therefore, the person with the hobby of video-games must be the owner of the goat.

7. **Clue 5**: The owner of the goat is in an even position.
   - The only even position left is Position 2. However, Position 2 is already taken by the person who's hobby is traveling. So, the owner of the goat must be in Position 4.

8. **Clue 8**: The owner of the goat is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing or the owner of the goat is the fan country, but not both.
   - Since the fan country is in Position 3, the owner of the goat cannot be the fan country. Thus, the owner of the goat must be the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

9. **Clue 9**: The person eating lemon and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions.
   - The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in Position 4, which is an even position. Therefore, the person eating lemon (Position 2) must also be in an even position, which is already satisfied.

10. **Clue 11**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person eating cucumber have the same parity positions.
    - The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in Position 4, which is an even position. Therefore, the person eating cucumber must also be in an even position. The only even position left is Position 2, but it is already occupied by the person who's hobby is traveling. So, the person eating cucumber must be in Position 4, which is the owner of the goat.

11. **Clue 12**: The person eating asparagus is on the far right.
    - Position 4: Asparagus (Owner of the goat)

13. **Clue 13**: The owner of the rat is not to the left of the person eating cucumber.
    - The person eating cucumber is in Position 4. Therefore, the owner of the rat cannot be in Position 1, 2, or 3. The only position left for the owner of the rat is Position 1.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Rat (Fan Pop)
- Position 2: Lemon (Traveling)
- Position 3: Fan Country
- Position 4: Goat (Rock Climbing, Asparagus)

To fill in the remaining details:
- The remaining food items are asparagus, cucumber, and plum.
- The remaining hobbies are puzzles and video-games.
- The remaining music genres are country, dubstep, and gospel.

From Clue 4, the person with the hobby of video-games is the owner of the goat, so:
- Position 4: Goat (Video-Games, Asparagus)

From Clue 1, the owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the fan gospel:
- The fan gospel must be in Position 3.
- The remaining music genre for Position 1 (Rat) is dubstep.

From Clue 8, the owner of the goat is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing or the owner of the goat is the fan country, but not both:
- The owner of the goat (Position 4) is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

Finally, the person eating cucumber must be in Position 2 (Traveling), and the person eating plum must be in Position 3 (Fan Country).

So, the final table is:

- The person driving the subway is the person watching thriller movies.

#### Step 2: Determine the person eating potato (clue 9 and 10)
- Since the person driving the subway is the person watching thriller movies (clue 12), the person eating potato must be the person driving the subway (clue 9).
- Therefore, the person eating potato = driving the subway = watching thriller movies.

#### Step 3: Determine the person watching superhero movies (clue 13)
- The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person watching superhero movies.
- Since the person watching thriller movies is in position 4, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

#### Step 4: Determine the person driving the skateboard (clue 3)
- The person driving the van is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.
- The person driving the subway is in position 4, so the person driving the skateboard cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3.

- The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person whose hobby is photography.
- The person driving the skateboard (position 4) is the person watching superhero movies, so the person whose hobby is rock-climbing and photography must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Since the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person whose hobby is photography, and the person whose hobby is photography is not in position 1 (because the person whose hobby is rock-climbing must be on the left), the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is in position 1 and the person whose hobby is photography is in position 2.

#### Step 6: Determine the person eating cauliflower and puzzles (clue 1, 6, and 7)
- The person eating cauliflower and the person whose hobby is puzzles have different parity positions.
- The person whose hobby is photography is somewhere to the left of the person eating cauliflower (clue 6).

#### Step 7: Determine the person eating grapes and avocado (clue 5)
- The person eating avocado is not to the right of the person eating grapes.
- The person eating cauliflower is in position 4, so the person eating grapes must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the person eating cauliflower is in position 4, the person eating grapes must be in position 2, and the person eating avocado must be in position 3.

#### Step 8: Determine the person whose hobby is skydiving (clue 10)
- The person whose hobby is skydiving is somewhere between the person eating potato and the person watching thriller movies.
- The person eating potato is in position 1, and the person watching thriller movies is in position 4.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is skydiving must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is in position 1 and the person whose hobby is photography is in position 2, the person whose hobby is skydiving must be in position 3.

#### Step 9: Determine the remaining food and movie genres
- The person eating grapes is in position 2, so the remaining food is avocado and cauliflower.
- The person watching spy movies must be in position 1 because the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is in position 1 and the person watching superhero movies is in position 4.
- The person watching thriller movies is in position 4, so the remaining movie genre is spy.

15. **Clue 15:** The person eating garlic is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Based on Clues:
- **Clue 10 & 11:** Golf is in an even position (2 or 4) and on the left of lemon. Therefore, golf must be in position 2 and lemon in position 4.
- **Clue 6:** Papaya is to the right of soccer. Since lemon is in position 4, papaya cannot be in position 4. Also, since golf is in position 2, papaya can only be in position 3.
- **Clue 2:** Tea is to the left of Mirinda. This means if we assume Tea is in position 1, Mirinda must be in position 2, but golf is in position 2, so Tea must be in position 1 and Mirinda in position 3.
- **Clue 4:** Tea is not to the right of Papaya. Since Papaya is in position 3, Tea cannot be in position 4. Therefore, Tea must be in position 1.
- **Clue 7:** 7up is between Sudoku and Garlic. Since Tea is in position 1, 7up cannot be in position 1. If Garlic is in position 3, then 7up must be in position 2, and Sudoku in position 4.
- **Clue 14:** Lemon is to the left of Sudoku. Since Lemon is in position 4, Sudoku must be in position 5, but there is no position 5. So, we need to adjust our positions.
- **Clue 15:** Garlic is to the left of Reading. Since Garlic is in position 3, Reading must be in position 4.
- **Clue 12:** Reading is not to the left of Soy-Milk. Since Reading is in position 4, Soy-Milk must be in position 3.
- **Clue 3:** Parkour is either Cherry or Camping. Since Cherry is in position 3 and Camping is in position 4, Parkour must be in position 2.
- **Clue 13:** Cherry is to the left or right of Parkour. Since Parkour is in position 2, Cherry must be in position 1.
- **Clue 1:** Soy-Milk and Sudoku have different parity positions. Since Soy-Milk is in position 3 (odd), Sudoku must be in position 4 (even).
- **Clue 5:** Parkour and Lemon have the same parity positions. Since Parkour is in position 2 (even), Lemon must be in position 4 (even).
