### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking almond-milk has the hobby of drawing.
2. The person drinking coffee is not to the left of the person drinking fanta.
3. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the fan indie.
4. The person who's hobby is singing is not a fan of blues.
5. The person who's hobby is singing is either drinking fanta or is a fan of indie, but not both.
6. The person drinking fanta and the fan ambient have the same parity (both odd or both even) positions.
7. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the fan indie.
8. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the fan pop.
9. The person drinking fanta is in an even position.
10. The person who's hobby is photography is between the person drinking coffee and the fan ambient.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of Fanta
From clue 9, we know that the person drinking fanta is in an even position. Therefore, fanta must be in position 2 or 4.

#### Step 2: Parity of Fanta and Ambient
From clue 6, the person drinking fanta and the fan ambient have the same parity positions. Since fanta is in an even position (2 or 4), the fan ambient must also be in an even position. Thus, fanta is in position 4 and ambient is in position 2 or 4.

Since fanta is in position 4, ambient cannot be in position 4. So, ambient must be in position 2.

#### Step 3: Hobbies and Beverages
From clue 1, the person drinking almond-milk has the hobby of drawing. This means drawing is in position 1 or 2 (since fanta is in position 4).

From clue 8, the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the fan pop. Since fanta is in position 4, the fan pop must be in position 3.

So, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1, and the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 1.

#### Step 4: Position of Indie
From clue 3, the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the fan indie. Since fanta is in position 4, the fan indie must be in position 3.

From clue 7, the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the fan indie. Since fanta is in position 4 and indie is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

#### Step 5: Position of Coffee and Blues
From clue 2, the person drinking coffee is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta is in position 4, coffee must be in position 3 or 4. But since indie is in position 3, coffee must be in position 3.

From clue 4, the person who's hobby is singing is not a fan of blues. From clue 5, the person who's hobby is singing is either drinking fanta or is a fan of indie, but not both. Since fanta is in position 4 and indie is in position 3, the person with the hobby of singing must be in position 3 and must be a fan of indie.

#### Step 6: Photography
From clue 10, the person who's hobby is photography is between the person drinking coffee and the fan ambient. Since coffee is in position 3 and ambient is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 1.

#### Step 7: Remaining Beverages and Hobbies
- The person drinking almond-milk (position 1) has the hobby of drawing.
- The person drinking coffee (position 3) has the hobby of singing and is a fan of indie.
- The person drinking fanta (position 4) has the hobby of skydiving (since itâ€™s not drawing, singing, or photography).
- The person drinking pop (position 2) has the hobby of photography.

13. **The person eating lettuce is not to the right of the person eating peas.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11:** The Spanish is in an even position.
   - Spanish can only be in position 2 or 4.

2. **Clue 12 & 1:** The Egyptian is the person eating lettuce or the Egyptian is the owner of the snake, but not both.
   - This means the Egyptian cannot be both eating lettuce and owning the snake simultaneously.

3. **Clue 2:** The Italian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish.
   - This means the Italian must be in position 1 or 2 if the owner of the fish is in position 2 or 3, respectively.

4. **Clue 9:** The person eating lettuce is on the right of the person eating peach.
   - This means peach cannot be eaten in position 4, and lettuce must be in position 3 or 4.

5. **Clue 3 & 12:** The Egyptian is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
   - This means the Egyptian could be in any position, but we need to consider the parity and other constraints.

6. **Clue 5:** The owner of the snake is on the right of the owner of the horse.
   - This means the owner of the horse cannot be in position 4.

7. **Clue 6:** The owner of the snake is on the left or right of the owner of the fish.
   - This means the owner of the fish cannot be in position 1.

8. **Clue 7:** The owner of the snake is on the left or right of the Italian.
   - This means the Italian cannot be in position 4.

9. **Clue 8:** The person eating peas is on the left or right of the person eating lettuce.

Lv10-3x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues step-by-step to fill out the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating onion is the Italian.
   - This means the Italian eats onion.

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating lime is on the far right.
   - This means the person eating lime is in position 4.

3. **Clue 3**: The person eating onion is the Thai or the person eating onion is the person drinking hot-chocolate, but not both.
   - Since the Italian (from Clue 1) eats onion, the Italian cannot be the Thai (as it would make both statements true). Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be the one eating onion, which is the Italian.

4. **Clue 4**: The person eating lime is not to the right of the person drinking coffee.
   - This means the person drinking coffee is to the left of the person eating lime, who is in position 4.

5. **Clue 5**: The Spanish is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
   - This means the Spanish is in position 1, 2, or 3, and the person drinking sprite is to the right of the Spanish.

6. **Clue 6**: The Japanese is between the person eating cauliflower and the Italian.
   - This means the Japanese is in position 2, and the person eating cauliflower is either in position 1 or 3.

### Arranging the Information:

- From Clue 1, the Italian (I) eats onion.
- From Clue 2, the person eating lime (L) is in position 4.
- From Clue 3, the Italian drinks hot-chocolate (H).
- From Clue 4, the person drinking coffee (C) is to the left of the person eating lime (L), so C is in position 1 or 2.
- From Clue 5, the Spanish (S) is to the left of the person drinking sprite (Sp).
- From Clue 6, the Japanese (J) is between the person eating cauliflower (Ca) and the Italian (I).

### Possible Positions:
- Position 1: Spanish (S)
- Position 2: Japanese (J)
- Position 3: Person eating cauliflower (Ca)
- Position 4: Person eating lime (L)

Since the Japanese is between the person eating cauliflower and the Italian, and the Spanish is to the left of the person drinking sprite, we can deduce:

- Position 1: Spanish (S)
- Position 2: Japanese (J)
- Position 3: Person eating cauliflower (Ca)
- Position 4: Person eating lime (L)

The person drinking coffee (C) must be in position 1 because the person eating lime (L) is in position 4, and the person drinking coffee (C) is to the left of the person eating lime (L).

Now, let's assign the beverages and foods:

- Position 1 (Spanish): Coffee (C)
- Position 2 (Japanese): Sprite (Sp)
- Position 3 (Person eating cauliflower): Hot-chocolate (H)
- Position 4 (Person eating lime): Tea (T)

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |   4    |
| Beverage      | Coffee      | Sprite     | Hot-chocolate | Tea    |
| Food          | Grapefruit  | Lime       | Cauliflower   | Onion  |
| Nationality   | Spanish     | Japanese   | Thai          | Italian |
```

### Explanation:
- The Spanish drinks coffee and eats grapefruit.
- The Japanese drinks sprite and eats lime.
- The Thai drinks hot-chocolate and eats cauliflower.
- The Italian drinks tea and eats onion.

Lv10-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the Canadian.
2. The Australian is not to the right of the person eating grapes.
3. The person who's hobby is baking is on the far left.
4. The person eating grapes is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
5. The person who's hobby is cooking is not the Australian.
6. The Canadian is somewhere to the left of the person eating cabbage.
7. The person who's hobby is writing is the Chinese or the person who's hobby is writing is the person eating cabbage, but not both.
8. The Chinese is the person eating grapes or the Chinese is the person who's hobby is cooking, but not both.
9. The Polish is somewhere between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person eating grapes.
10. The Polish is on the right of the person eating banana.
11. The person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the Polish.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Placement of Baking
From clue 3:
- Baking is on the far left (Position 1).

#### Step 2: Placement of Cooking and Grapes
From clue 1 and clue 4:
- The person with the hobby of cooking must be in Position 4 because they are to the right of the Canadian.
- The person eating grapes must be in Position 3 because they are to the right of the person with the hobby of cooking.

#### Step 3: Placement of Canadian and Cabbage
From clue 1:
- The Canadian cannot be in Position 4 (where cooking is).
- Therefore, the Canadian must be in Position 2.
- From clue 6:
- The Canadian (in Position 2) is to the left of the person eating cabbage, so the person eating cabbage must be in Position 3, which conflicts with the person eating grapes being there. This means we need to re-evaluate.

Re-evaluating:
- If the Canadian is in Position 2, then the person eating grapes must be in Position 3.
- Thus, the person with the hobby of cooking must be in Position 4.
- The person eating cabbage must be in Position 1 or 2, but not 1 because baking is already in Position 1.

So, let's try:
- Canadian in Position 2.
- Person eating grapes in Position 3.
- Person with the hobby of cooking in Position 4.

#### Step 4: Revisiting Clues for Consistency
- Clue 2: The Australian is not to the right of the person eating grapes.
- Clue 5: The person with the hobby of cooking is not the Australian.
- Clue 6: The Canadian is to the left of the person eating cabbage.
- Clue 7 and 8: The Chinese is either eating grapes or has the hobby of cooking, but not both.
- Clue 9: The Polish is between the person with the hobby of fishing and the person eating grapes.
- Clue 10: The Polish is to the right of the person eating bananas.
- Clue 11: The person with the hobby of writing is to the right of the Polish.

#### Step 5: Placing Remaining Elements
- The person with the hobby of writing must be in Position 4 (since it's to the right of the Polish).
- The person with the hobby of cooking is in Position 4 (not the Australian).
- The person with the hobby of baking is in Position 1.
- The person eating grapes is in Position 3.
- The person with the hobby of fishing must be in Position 2 (the only remaining position).

#### Final Table:

```

Lv10-3x4-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will systematically analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's start with the clues and see how they fit together.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is singing.
2. **Clue 2:** The American is either the person whose hobby is camping or the one driving the trike, but not both.
3. **Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is singing is not to the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the ship and the Nigerian have different parity positions (i.e., if one is in an odd position, the other is in an even position).
5. **Clue 5:** The person whose hobby is card-games is on the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
6. **Clue 6:** The Nigerian is not to the left of the person driving the ship.
7. **Clue 7:** The Dutch is somewhere between the person whose hobby is puzzles and the American.
8. **Clue 8:** The person whose hobby is singing is on the right of the person driving the trike.
9. **Clue 9:** The Nigerian is between the person driving the train and the Dutch.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Based on Clue 7 and Clue 8:
- From Clue 7, the Dutch must be between the person whose hobby is puzzles and the American.
- From Clue 8, the person whose hobby is singing is on the right of the person driving the trike.
- Since the Chinese is on the far right (Clue 7), the person driving the trike cannot be the Chinese.

#### Step 2: Analyzing Parity and Positioning Based on Clue 4 and Clue 6:
- From Clue 4, the person driving the ship and the Nigerian have different parity positions.
- From Clue 6, the Nigerian is not to the left of the person driving the ship.

#### Step 3: Placing the Nigerian:
- If the Nigerian is in position 2, then the person driving the ship must be in position 4 (even position).
- If the Nigerian is in position 4, then the person driving the ship must be in position 2 (odd position).

Since the Nigerian cannot be to the left of the person driving the ship, the only valid placement is:
- Nigerian in position 4
- Person driving the ship in position 2

#### Step 4: Placing the Dutch:
- The Dutch must be between the person whose hobby is puzzles and the American.
- Given the positions, the Dutch can only be in position 3.

#### Step 5: Placing the American:
- The American can only be in position 1 because the Dutch is in position 3 and the American must be between the person whose hobby is puzzles and the Dutch.

#### Step 6: Placing the Hobbies:
- The person whose hobby is puzzles must be in position 2 (since the American is in position 1 and the Dutch is in position 3).
- The person whose hobby is singing must be in position 4 (since the person driving the trike cannot be in position 4 and the Nigerian is in position 4).

#### Step 7: Placing the Remaining Hobbies:
- The person whose hobby is card-games must be in position 1 (since it is to the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles and the American cannot have the hobby of puzzles).
- The remaining hobby (camping) must be in position 3.

#### Step 8: Confirming Positions:
- The person whose hobby is puzzles is to the left of the person whose hobby is singing.
- The person whose hobby is card-games is on the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
- The person driving the ship and the Nigerian have different parity positions.
- The Nigerian is not to the left of the person driving the ship.
- The Dutch is between the person whose hobby is puzzles and the American.
- The person whose hobby is singing is on the right of the person driving the trike.
- The Nigerian is between the person driving the train and the Dutch.

Lv10-3x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating potato is not to the left of the person eating orange.
   - This means if someone eats potato, they must be at position 2, 3, or 4, and the person who eats orange must be to their right.

2. **Clue 2:** The analyst is between the owner of the bird and the person eating potato.
   - This implies that the analyst cannot be in position 1 or 4. If the analyst is in position 2, then the owner of the bird must be in position 1 and the person eating potato must be in position 3. If the analyst is in position 3, then the owner of the bird must be in position 2 and the person eating potato must be in position 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the teacher.
   - This means the owner of the dog can be in any position except where the teacher is located.

4. **Clue 4:** The person eating potato is somewhere between the person eating grapefruit and the owner of the chinchilla.
   - This means the person eating potato must be in position 2 or 3, and the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating grapefruit must be positioned accordingly.

5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the chinchilla and the person eating garlic have the same parity positions.
   - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position.

6. **Clue 6:** The librarian is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
   - This means the librarian cannot be in the last position and must be to the left of the owner of the chinchilla.

7. **Clue 7:** The security-guard is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
   - This means the security-guard can be in any position except where the owner of the goldfish is located.

8. **Clue 8:** The owner of the dog is on the left of the person eating grapefruit.
   - This means the owner of the dog cannot be in the last position and must be to the left of the person eating grapefruit.

9. **Clue 9:** The owner of the bird is the analyst or the owner of the bird is the person eating orange, but not both.
   - This means the owner of the bird and the analyst cannot both be in the same position, and the owner of the bird and the person eating orange cannot both be in the same position.

10. **Clue 10:** The owner of the bird and the librarian have the same parity positions.
    - This means if the owner of the bird is in an odd position, the librarian must be in an odd position, and if the owner of the bird is in an even position, the librarian must be in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1:**
   - From Clue 3, the owner of the dog cannot be in position 1.
   - From Clue 6, the librarian cannot be in position 1.
   - Therefore, position 1 can only be occupied by either the analyst, the person eating garlic, or the person eating grapefruit.

2. **Position 2:**
   - From Clue 4, the person eating potato must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - From Clue 6, the librarian cannot be in position 2.
   - From Clue 7, the security-guard cannot be in position 2.
   - Therefore, position 2 can only be occupied by the owner of the bird, the owner of the chinchilla, or the person eating grapefruit.

3. **Position 3:**
   - From Clue 1, the person eating potato must be in position 3 or 4.
   - From Clue 4, the person eating potato must be between the person eating grapefruit and the owner of the chinchilla.
   - Therefore, position 3 can only be occupied by the person eating grapefruit, the owner of the chinchilla, or the person eating potato.

4. **Position 4:**
   - From Clue 1, the person eating potato must be in position 4.
   - From Clue 8, the owner of the dog must be to the left of the person eating grapefruit.
   - Therefore, position 4 can only be occupied by the person eating potato.

### Final Placement:

- **Position 1:**
  - From Clue 2, the analyst must be between the owner of the bird and the person eating potato.
  - Therefore, position 1 must be the analyst (since the analyst cannot be in position 4).

- **Position 2:**
  - From Clue 2, the analyst is in position 1, so the person eating potato must be in position 3 or 4.
  - From Clue 4, the person eating potato must be between the person eating grapefruit and the owner of the chinchilla.
  - Therefore, position 2 must be the owner of the bird (since the owner of the bird cannot be in position 4).

- **Position 3:**
  - From Clue 4, the person eating potato must be in position 3.
  - Therefore, position 3 must be the person eating potato.

- **Position 4:**
  - From Clue 4, the person eating potato must be in position 4.
  - Therefore, position 4 must be the person eating grapefruit.

- **Remaining Positions:**
  - From Clue 3, the owner of the dog must be to the left or right of the teacher.
  - From Clue 8, the owner of the dog must be to the left of the person eating grapefruit.
  - Therefore, position 3 must be the owner of the dog and position 4 must be the teacher.

- **Remaining Clues:**
  - From Clue 5, the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating garlic have the same parity positions.
  - Since the owner of the dog is in position 3 (odd), the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 4 (even).
  - Therefore, position 3 must be the owner of the chinchilla and position 4 must be the person eating garlic.

- **Final Table:**

Lv10-3x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will analyze each clue step-by-step and place the information into the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the train and the person watching crime movies have different parity positions.
   - Train: Odd or Even
   - Crime: Opposite parity (Odd if Train is Even, Even if Train is Odd)

2. **Clue 2:** The social-worker is on the right of the person driving the tram.
   - Social-worker: Right of Tram

3. **Clue 3:** The person watching satire movies is not to the left of the person driving the bus.
   - Satire: Not Left of Bus

4. **Clue 4:** The person watching satire movies is on the left of the teacher.
   - Satire: Left of Teacher

5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the train is not the nurse.
   - Nurse â‰  Train

6. **Clue 6:** The teacher is between the social-worker and the nurse.
   - Social-worker, Teacher, Nurse (in that order)

7. **Clue 7:** The person driving the bus and the pilot have different parity positions.
   - Bus: Odd or Even
   - Pilot: Opposite parity (Odd if Bus is Even, Even if Bus is Odd)

8. **Clue 8:** The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person watching thriller movies.
   - Tram: Right of Thriller

9. **Clue 9:** The person watching scientific movies is the person driving the bus or the person watching scientific movies is the teacher, but not both.
   - Scientific: Bus or Teacher (but not both)

10. **Clue 10:** The person driving the train and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions.
    - Train: Same parity as Scientific

### Initial Setup:

|               |    1     |   2    |     3      |       4       |
| Job           |          |        |            |               |
| Movie-Genre   |          |        |            |               |
| Transport     |          |        |            |               |

### Applying Clues:

1. **Clue 1 & 10:**
   - Train and Scientific must be in the same parity positions (both odd or both even).

2. **Clue 2:**
   - Social-worker is to the right of Tram.

3. **Clue 3 & 4:**
   - Satire is to the left of Teacher and not to the left of Bus.

4. **Clue 5:**
   - Nurse â‰  Train.

5. **Clue 6:**
   - Social-worker, Teacher, Nurse (in that order).

6. **Clue 7 & 8:**
   - Bus and Pilot must be in different parities, and Tram is to the right of Thriller.

7. **Clue 9:**
   - Scientific is either Bus or Teacher.

### Possible Assignments:

Let's assume:
- Train is in position 1 (Odd)
- Bus is in position 2 (Even)

From Clue 1 and 10, since Train is in an odd position, Scientific must also be in an odd position. So, Scientific could be in position 1 or 3.

Since Bus is in an even position, Pilot must be in an odd position. So, Pilot could be in position 1, 3, or 4.

### Assigning Values:

1. **Train: 1**
   - Train is an odd position.
   - Scientific must be in an odd position (1 or 3).
   
2. **Bus: 2**
   - Bus is an even position.
   - Pilot must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 4).

3. **Tram:**
   - Must be to the right of Thriller.
   - Could be in position 3 or 4.

4. **Social-worker, Teacher, Nurse:**
   - Social-worker is to the right of Tram.
   - Teacher is between Social-worker and Nurse.
   - Satire is to the left of Teacher and not to the left of Bus.

Given these constraints, let's assign values:

- **Train: 1** (Nurse, as it cannot be the driver)
- **Scientific: 3** (since Train and Scientific must be in the same parity and Train is in an odd position)
- **Bus: 2** (Pilot must be in an odd position, so it can be 1 or 3, but 1 is already taken by Train)
- **Pilot: 3** (since Bus is in an even position, Pilot must be in an odd position)
- **Tram: 4** (since Tram must be to the right of Thriller and there are no other options for an even position)
- **Thriller: 3** (since Tram is in position 4)

Now, we need to place the remaining positions for Social-worker, Teacher, and Nurse:

- **Satire: 2** (it must be to the left of Teacher and not to the left of Bus)
- **Teacher: 3** (between Social-worker and Nurse)
- **Social-worker: 4** (to the right of Tram)

### Final Solution:

|               |    1     |   2    |     3      |       4       |

Lv10-3x4-10	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the ferret.
2. The person whose hobby is photography is in an odd position (1 or 3).
3. The person whose hobby is camping is not to the left of the person whose hobby is chess (so, if camping is in position 2, chess must be in position 3 or 4; if camping is in position 4, chess must be in position 3).
4. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the owner of the horse.
5. The person whose hobby is camping is in an even position (2 or 4).
6. The person driving the trike is the person whose hobby is cooking or the owner of the guinea-pig is the person driving the trike, but not both.
7. The person whose hobby is camping and the person driving the taxi have the same parity positions (both odd or both even).
8. The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
9. The owner of the horse is on the left of the person whose hobby is chess.
10. The owner of the ferret and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Position Analysis:
From Clue 5 and Clue 2:
- Photography is in position 1 or 3.
- Camping is in position 2 or 4.

#### Pet Analysis:
From Clue 1:
- If the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 2, the owner of the ferret must be in position 1.
- If the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 4, the owner of the ferret must be in position 3.

#### Hobbies and Transport Analysis:
From Clue 3 and Clue 5:
- Since camping is in an even position (2 or 4), and it cannot be to the left of chess, we can deduce:
  - If camping is in position 2, chess must be in position 3 or 4.
  - If camping is in position 4, chess must be in position 3.

From Clue 7:
- The person with the hobby of camping and the person driving the taxi must have the same parity positions. This means if camping is in position 2, the taxi driver must be in position 2 (odd), and if camping is in position 4, the taxi driver must be in position 4 (even).

From Clue 8:
- The person driving the tram is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski.

From Clue 9:
- The owner of the horse is on the left of the person whose hobby is chess.

From Clue 4:
- The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the owner of the horse.

From Clue 6:
- The person driving the trike is the person whose hobby is cooking or the owner of the guinea-pig is the person driving the trike, but not both.

Let's try to place these elements systematically:

1. **Position 1**:
   - Owner of the ferret (Clue 1)
   - Person with photography (Clue 2)

2. **Position 2**:
   - Owner of the guinea-pig (Clue 1)
   - Person with camping (Clue 5)

3. **Position 3**:
   - Person with chess (Clue 9, Clue 3)
   - Person with jet-ski (Clue 4, Clue 8)

4. **Position 4**:
   - Person with horse (Clue 9)
   - Person with taxi (Clue 7)

Now, let's fill in the details:

- **Owner of the guinea-pig in position 2**: So, the owner of the ferret must be in position 1.
- **Person with photography in position 1**: So, the person with camping must be in position 2.
- **Person with chess in position 3**: So, the person with jet-ski must be in position 3.
- **Person with horse in position 4**: So, the person with taxi must be in position 4.

Finally, from Clue 6 and Clue 10:
- The owner of the ferret (position 1) and the person driving the tram (position 3) must have the same parity positions, which they do.
- The person driving the trike must be the person with cooking or the owner of the guinea-pig, but not both. Given the positions, the only logical fit is that the person with cooking is in position 3 (jet-ski driver), and the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 2.

So, the final table is:

```
