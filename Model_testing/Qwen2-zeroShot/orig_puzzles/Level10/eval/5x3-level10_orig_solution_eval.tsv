Lv10-5x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step by step. Let's break down the clues and see how they fit together.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7:** The person driving the airplane is the Chinese.
   - Position: 1 (Chinese)
   - Transport: Airplane

2. **Clue 4:** The French is either to the left or right of the Chinese.
   - Since the Chinese is in position 1, the French can be in position 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 8:** The fisherman is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - This means the person with the hobby of card-games cannot be in position 3.

4. **Clue 11:** The person drinking soy-milk is the person who's hobby is filmmaking or the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person driving the airplane, but not both.
   - From Clue 7, the person driving the airplane is Chinese.
   - Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk is the one with the hobby of filmmaking.
   - Soy-milk drinker must be in an even position (Clue 12), so it must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 12:** The person drinking soy-milk is in an even position.
   - Soy-milk drinker is in position 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The police-officer is not to the right of the police-officer.
   - This is redundant as it's always true for a single person.

7. **Clue 6:** The police-officer is on the left or right of the person driving the tram.
   - Since the Chinese is in position 1 and drives the airplane, the police-officer can only be in position 3 (right of the Chinese).

8. **Clue 10:** The person drinking tea is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - The person drinking soy-milk is in position 2, so the person drinking tea must be in position 3.

9. **Clue 13:** The person drinking tea is not to the left of the person driving the motorbike.
   - The person drinking tea is in position 3, and since the police-officer is also in position 3, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1 (Chinese).

10. **Clue 2:** The architect is on the left of the person driving the tram.
    - The person driving the tram is in position 3 (police-officer), so the architect must be in position 1 (Chinese).

11. **Clue 5:** The architect and the person driving the airplane have the same parity positions.
    - The architect is in position 1 (odd) and the person driving the airplane is in position 1 (odd).

12. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is video-games and the architect have different parity positions.
    - The architect is in position 1 (odd), so the person with the hobby of video-games must be in an even position (position 2).

13. **Clue 9:** The person who's hobby is video-games is the Chinese or the person who's hobby is video-games is the fisherman, but not both.
    - Since the Chinese is already in position 1, the person with the hobby of video-games must be the fisherman in position 2.

14. **Clue 8:** The fisherman is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
    - The fisherman is in position 2, so the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 1 (Chinese).

### Final Table:

10. **Clue 10:** The person whose sport is ice-hockey is on the far right.
11. **Clue 11:** The person driving the airplane is the fan of blues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5:
- The person watching crime movies is on the far left (Position 1).

#### Clue 10:
- The person whose sport is ice-hockey is on the far right (Position 3).

#### Clue 4:
- The person whose sport is ice-hockey is the fan of sports movies.
- Therefore, Position 3 (far right) is the fan of sports movies.

#### Clue 11:
- The person driving the airplane is the fan of blues.
- Therefore, the person in Position 3 (far right) is also driving the airplane and is the fan of blues.

#### Clue 9:
- The person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
- Since the person driving the airplane is in Position 3, the person driving the trike must be in Position 1 (the far left).

#### Clue 5 again:
- The person watching crime movies is in Position 1.

#### Clue 1:
- The person whose sport is golf and the fan of d&b have different parity positions.
- Since the person in Position 1 is watching crime movies, the fan of d&b cannot be in Position 1. The person whose sport is golf must be in an odd position (1 or 3), and the fan of d&b must be in an even position (2).

#### Clue 10:
- The person whose sport is ice-hockey is on the far right (Position 3).
- The person in Position 3 is the fan of blues and driving the airplane.

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the person driving the trike.
- The person driving the trike is in Position 1, so the owner of the hedgehog can be in Position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the turtle is on the right of the fan of blues.
- Since the fan of blues is in Position 3, the owner of the turtle must be in Position 2.

#### Clue 6:
- The fan of d&b is not to the right of the person driving the van.
- Since the person driving the trike is in Position 1 and the person driving the airplane is in Position 3, the fan of d&b must be in Position 2.

#### Clue 7:
- The person whose sport is golf is on the left or right of the person whose sport is rugby.
- The person whose sport is golf must be in Position 1 or 2, and the person whose sport is rugby must be in Position 2 or 3. Given that the fan of d&b is in Position 2, the person whose sport is golf must be in Position 1, and the person whose sport is rugby must be in Position 3.

#### Clue 8:
- The person whose sport is ice-hockey is the fan of d&b or the person watching crime movies, but not both.
- Since the person watching crime movies is in Position 1, the person whose sport is ice-hockey cannot be the fan of d&b. Therefore, the person whose sport is ice-hockey must be the person watching crime movies.

Lv10-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step 1: Initial Setup
We need to place the food, movie genre, nationality, sport, and transport for three people. Let's denote them as Person 1, Person 2, and Person 3.

### Step 2: Analyze Constraints
1. **Person eating papaya is not the one driving the jet-ski.**
2. **The person whose sport is snowboarding and the person driving the jet-ski have the same parity positions.**
3. **The French is somewhere between the Thai and the Polish.**
4. **The Thai is not the person eating plum.**

11. **The person eating papaya is between the Polish and the person whose sport is snowboarding.**
12. **The Thai is the person eating papaya or the person eating papaya is the person watching crime movies, but not both.**

### Step 3: Applying Constraints

#### Constraint 6:
- The person eating pepper is on the far left or far right.
- Let's assume Person 1 eats pepper (we can test Person 3 later).

#### Constraint 10:
- The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person eating pepper.
- Since Person 1 eats pepper, Person 3 must eat papaya.

#### Constraint 11:
- The person eating papaya (Person 3) is between the Polish and the person whose sport is snowboarding.
- This means the Polish is either Person 1 or Person 2.

#### Constraint 3:
- The French is somewhere between the Thai and the Polish.
- If the Polish is Person 1, then the French must be Person 2 (since Person 3 is the Thai).
- If the Polish is Person 2, then the French must be Person 1 (since Person 3 is the Thai).

#### Constraint 2:
- The person whose sport is snowboarding and the person driving the jet-ski have the same parity positions.
- If the Polish is Person 1, then the French is Person 2, and the Thai is Person 3.
- If the Polish is Person 2, then the French is Person 1, and the Thai is Person 3.

#### Constraint 4:
- The Thai is not the person eating plum.
- Since Person 3 is the Thai, they do not eat plum.

#### Constraint 5:
- The person driving the van is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is climbing.
- If the Polish is Person 1, then the French is Person 2, and the Thai is Person 3.
- If the Polish is Person 2, then the French is Person 1, and the Thai is Person 3.

#### Constraint 8:
- The person driving the bike is not to the right of the person whose sport is snowboarding.
- This implies the person driving the bike is either Person 1 or Person 2 if the Polish is Person 1, or Person 2 if the Polish is Person 2.

#### Constraint 9:
- The Polish is on the left or right of the person whose sport is golf.
- If the Polish is Person 1, then the person with golf is Person 2.
- If the Polish is Person 2, then the person with golf is Person 1.

#### Constraint 7:
- The person watching scientific movies is not the person eating pepper.
- Since Person 1 eats pepper, the person watching scientific movies cannot be Person 1.

#### Constraint 12:
- The Thai is the person eating papaya or the person eating papaya is the person watching crime movies, but not both.
- Since Person 3 eats papaya, they cannot be watching crime movies.

### Step 4: Final Solution
After applying all the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- Person 1: Polish, driving the van, sport: golf, watching crime movies
- Person 2: French, driving the bike, sport: snowboarding, watching scientific movies
- Person 3: Thai, eating papaya, eating pepper

| Transport     |            |               |            |

#### Step 2: Determine the German's Position (Clue 2)
- The German is on the left of the person drinking juice.

|               |     1      |       2       |     3      |
| Beverage      |            |               |            |

| Transport     |            |               |            |

#### Step 3: Determine the Movie Genre for the German (Clue 1)
- Since the German is the videographer, he cannot be watching romance movies. Therefore, the person watching romance movies must be either in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 4: Determine the Drink for the German (Clue 7)
- The German is the videographer, so he cannot be drinking hot chocolate. Therefore, the person drinking hot chocolate must be either in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 5: Determine the Movie Genre and Drink for the Person in Position 1 (Clue 8 and Clue 9)
- The person watching adventure movies is to the left of the videographer, so the person in position 1 must be watching adventure movies.
- The librarian is to the right of the person driving the bike, so the person in position 1 cannot be the librarian or the driver of the bike.

- The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person drinking hot chocolate.
- The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person drinking juice.

Since the German is drinking juice (from Clue 2), the person in position 3 cannot be drinking juice. Also, the person in position 1 is drinking hot chocolate (from Clue 7).

| Transport     |            |               | Snowmobile |

#### Step 7: Determine the Remaining Positions
- The person in position 2 must be drinking juice.
- The person in position 2 must be the Dutch (since the German is the videographer and the Dutch is to the right of the German).

| Transport     |            | Ship          | Snowmobile |

#### Step 8: Determine the Last Nationality and Transport
- The writer is the person watching Western movies (from Clue 3).
- The person watching Western movies is not to the right of the Dutch (Clue 5).

Lv10-5x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each category (Beverage, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport, Transport) into the correct columns based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of techno is on the far right.
   - This means the third column is occupied by the fan of techno.

2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person whose sport is swimming.
   - This means the person driving the helicopter is in column 1, and the person whose sport is swimming is in column 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person whose sport is swimming is the fan of techno or the owner of the goldfish is the person whose sport is swimming, but not both.
   - Since the fan of techno is in column 3, the person whose sport is swimming cannot be the fan of techno. Therefore, the owner of the goldfish must be the person whose sport is swimming.

4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike.
   - This means the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 2 or 3 if the person driving the bike is in column 1.

5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person whose sport is swimming.
   - Since the person whose sport is swimming is in column 2 or 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate can only be in column 2 or 3 as well.

6. **Clue 6**: The person whose sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person whose sport is tennis.
   - This means the person whose sport is tennis is in column 2 or 3 if the person whose sport is swimming is in column 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 7**: The fan of punk is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - This means the fan of punk can be in column 1 or 2 if the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 2 or 3.

8. **Clue 8**: The fan of techno is on the left or right of the fan of funk.
   - Since the fan of techno is in column 3, the fan of funk can be in column 1 or 2.

9. **Clue 9**: The owner of the frog is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda.
   - This means the owner of the frog is in column 1 or 2 if the person drinking mirinda is in column 2 or 3.

10. **Clue 10**: The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
    - This means the person drinking mirinda is in column 1 if the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 2 or 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1** places the fan of techno in column 3.
2. **Clue 2** and **Clue 3** together imply that the person whose sport is swimming is the owner of the goldfish, and they are in column 2 or 3.
3. **Clue 4** and **Clue 5** together imply that the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 2 or 3.
4. **Clue 6** implies that the person whose sport is tennis is in column 2 or 3.
5. **Clue 7** and **Clue 8** together imply that the fan of punk can be in column 1 or 2.
6. **Clue 9** and **Clue 10** together imply that the owner of the frog is in column 1 or 2, and the person drinking mirinda is in column 1.

Based on these deductions, we can start placing the items:

- **Column 3**: Fan of techno (Clue 1)
- **Column 2**: Owner of the goldfish (Clue 3)
- **Column 2 or 3**: Person drinking hot-chocolate (Clue 4, 5)
- **Column 2 or 3**: Person whose sport is tennis (Clue 6)
- **Column 1**: Owner of the frog (Clue 9)

Given these constraints, let's assign the values:

- **Column 1**: Owner of the frog, Person drinking mirinda
- **Column 2**: Owner of the goldfish, Person drinking hot-chocolate
- **Column 3**: Fan of techno

Now we need to assign the remaining items (fanta, punk, badminton, helicopter, jet-ski) to the columns:

- **Column 1**: Owner of the frog, Person drinking mirinda
- **Column 2**: Owner of the goldfish, Person drinking hot-chocolate
- **Column 3**: Fan of techno

We know:
- The fan of punk must be in column 1 or 2 (Clue 7 and 8).
- The fan of funk must be in column 1 or 2 (Clue 8).
- The person driving the helicopter must be in column 1 (Clue 2).
- The person whose sport is swimming must be in column 2 or 3 (Clue 3).

Let's assign the remaining items:

- **Column 1**: Owner of the frog, Person drinking mirinda, Fan of punk

Lv10-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step 1: Identify the positions of the Polish person
From constraint 2, we know that the Polish person is between the person watching musical movies and the person driving the scooter.
From constraint 4, the Polish person is also between the person watching musical movies and the person driving the scooter.

This means:
- The Polish person cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to their left).
- The Polish person cannot be in position 3 (since there would be no one to their right).

Thus, the Polish person must be in position 2.

### Step 2: Determine the person driving the motorbike
From constraint 1, the Polish person is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
Since the Polish person is in position 2, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1.

### Step 3: Determine the person driving the skateboard
From constraint 3, the Egyptian person is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
Since the Egyptian person cannot be in position 3 (as the Polish person is already there), the person driving the skateboard must be in position 1 or 2.

However, from constraint 1, the person driving the motorbike (position 1) cannot be the same as the person driving the skateboard. Therefore, the person driving the skateboard must be in position 3, and the Egyptian person must be in position 2.

### Step 4: Determine the person driving the scooter
From constraint 4, the Polish person (position 2) is between the person watching musical movies and the person driving the scooter.
Since the person driving the skateboard is in position 3, the person driving the scooter must be in position 1.

### Step 5: Determine the sports preferences
From constraint 6, the person who's sport is surfing is not to the left of the writer.
From constraint 8, the person who's sport is surfing is not in position 1 (since the writer is to the right of the person watching crime movies).

Thus, the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 3 (the writer).

- Position 1: Person with sport = surfing
- Position 2: Polish person (security guard)
- Position 3: Writer (surfing)

From constraint 5, the writer is to the right of the person watching crime movies. Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be in position 1.

- Position 1: Person watching crime movies (surfing)
- Position 2: Polish person (security guard)
- Position 3: Writer (surfing)

From constraint 7, the security guard is not the person driving the skateboard, which aligns with our previous findings.

### Step 6: Determine the movie genres and nationalities
From constraint 5, the writer is to the right of the person watching crime movies, so the person watching crime movies is in position 1.

- Position 1: Person watching crime movies (surfing)
- Position 2: Polish person (security guard)
- Position 3: Writer (surfing)

From constraint 1, the Polish person is between the person watching musical movies and the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the scooter is in position 1, the person watching musical movies must be in position 3.

- Position 1: Person watching crime movies (surfing)
- Position 2: Polish person (security guard)
- Position 3: Person watching musical movies (surfing, writer)

Thus, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 2.

- Position 1: Person watching crime movies (surfing)
- Position 2: Person watching documentary movies (security guard)
- Position 3: Person watching musical movies (writer)

Lv10-5x3-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The fan blues is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing.**
   - This means if the person who likes climbing is in position 1 or 2, the person who likes blues must be in position 2 or 3 respectively.

2. **The person eating nectarine is on the far right.**
   - The person eating nectarine must be in position 3.

3. **The person eating nectarine is the fan blues or the person eating nectarine is the person who's sport is surfing, but not both.**
   - Since the person eating nectarine is in position 3, this person can either like blues or surf, but not both.
   - Therefore, position 3 cannot be blues (since it would conflict with the previous statement).

4. **The fan blues is not to the right of the fan salsa.**
   - If the fan blues is in position 1 or 2, the fan salsa must be in position 2 or 1 respectively.

5. **The person who's sport is surfing is not the scientist.**
   - The person who surfs cannot be the scientist.

6. **The person eating pear is the person who's hobby is traveling or the scientist is the person eating pear, but not both.**
   - If the person eating pear is the person who's hobby is traveling, then the scientist cannot eat pear. Otherwise, the scientist eats pear.

7. **The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the right of the scientist.**
   - The scientist cannot be in position 3 (since the person eating nectarine is there), and the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 2 or 3.

8. **The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere between the photographer and the person who's sport is surfing.**
   - This means the person who surfs cannot be in position 1 or 3, and the person who plays cricket must be in position 2.

9. **The person eating garlic and the person who's sport is climbing have the same parity positions.**
   - If the person eating garlic is in an odd position (1 or 3), the person who plays climbing must also be in an odd position. If the person eating garlic is in an even position (2), the person who plays climbing must also be in an even position.

10. **The fan salsa and the person who's hobby is dancing have the same parity positions.**
    - Similar to the previous point, if the person who dances is in an odd position, the fan salsa must be in an odd position. If the person who dances is in an even position, the fan salsa must be in an even position.

### Filling the Table:

Let's start placing the items based on these constraints:

1. **Position 3**:
   - Nectarine (from constraint 2)
   - Not blues (from constraint 3)
   - Not surfing (from constraint 5)

2. **Position 2**:
   - Must be either blues or surfing (from constraint 1 and 3)
   - Cannot be blues if it is not to the right of the fan salsa (from constraint 4)
   - Must be surfing (from constraint 8)

3. **Position 1**:
   - Must be either blues or dancing (from constraint 4 and 7)
   - Cannot be blues if the fan salsa is in position 2 (from constraint 4)
   - Must be dancing (from constraint 7)

4. **Position 3 (revisited)**:
   - Nectarine (confirmed from earlier)

5. **Position 2 (revisited)**:
   - Surfing (confirmed from earlier)

6. **Position 1 (revisited)**:
   - Dancing (confirmed from earlier)

Now, we need to place the remaining items:

- **Sport Cricket**: Must be in position 2 (from constraint 8)
- **Job Scientist**: Cannot be in position 3 (from constraint 5) and must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 2 is surfing, the scientist must be in position 1.
- **Hobby Traveling**: Must be in position 2 (from constraint 6)
- **Music Genre Salsa**: Must be in position 2 (from constraint 10)
- **Food Garlic**: Must be in position 1 (from constraint 9 and 10)

### Final Solution:

| Transport     |          |             |          |

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Clue 3:** The Canadian is in an odd position. So, the Canadian can only be in position 1 or 3.
2. **Clue 8:** The Canadian is the person eating banana. So, the Canadian eats banana.
3. **Clue 12:** The person eating banana and the owner of the horse have the same parity positions. Since the Canadian (eating banana) is in position 1 (odd), the owner of the horse must also be in position 1 (odd).
4. **Clue 7:** The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the owner of the horse is in position 1, the person driving the train cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2 or 3.
5. **Clue 6:** The person driving the tram is in an even position. So, the person driving the tram can only be in position 2 or 3.
6. **Clue 4:** The person eating banana is not to the left of the person drinking cola. Since the Canadian (banana) is in position 1, the person drinking cola cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person drinking cola must be in position 2 or 3.
7. **Clue 13:** The person driving the train and the person drinking cola have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the tram is in an even position, the person driving the train must also be in an even position. Thus, the person driving the train is in position 2, and the person drinking cola is also in position 2.
8. **Clue 1:** The owner of the horse is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train. Since the owner of the horse is in position 1 and the person driving the train is in position 2, this condition is satisfied.
9. **Clue 2:** The owner of the mouse is not the person driving the tram. Since the person driving the tram is in position 2, the owner of the mouse cannot be in position 2.
10. **Clue 5:** The Mexican is not the person drinking almond-milk. So, the Mexican can drink cola or lemonade.
11. **Clue 10:** The person drinking lemonade is on the far left or far right. So, the person drinking lemonade can only be in position 1 or 3.
12. **Clue 9:** The person drinking lemonade is the owner of the rat or the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the scooter, but not both. If the person drinking lemonade is in position 1, then the owner of the rat must be in position 3. If the person drinking lemonade is in position 3, then the person driving the scooter must be in position 1.
13. **Clue 11:** The Dutch is on the left or right of the person eating lettuce. Since the person eating banana is in position 1, the Dutch cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the Dutch can be in position 2 or 3.
14. **Clue 14:** The person eating lettuce is not the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is in position 2, the person eating lettuce cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the person eating lettuce must be in position 1 or 3.

### Final Table:

Lv10-5x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement. Let's break down the clues and deduce step-by-step.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **Clue 1:** The Malaysian is not to the left of the owner of the fish.
2. **Clue 2:** The writer watches time-travel movies.
3. **Clue 3:** The American is not to the right of the dressmaker.
4. **Clue 4:** The dressmaker is the dressmaker (redundant, confirms the dressmaker is in job 2).
5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the goat is somewhere between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the fish.
6. **Clue 6:** The American is not to the left of the analyst.
7. **Clue 7:** The person eating cabbage is on the left of the dressmaker.
8. **Clue 8:** The person watching family movies is in an even position (2nd position).
9. **Clue 9:** The analyst and the person watching family movies have the same parity positions (both in even or both in odd positions).
10. **Clue 10:** The dressmaker is the person eating onion or the dressmaker is the owner of the fish, but not both.
11. **Clue 11:** The person eating spinach is not to the left of the analyst.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position the Dressmaker
From Clue 4, the dressmaker is in position 2.

#### Step 2: Position the Writer
From Clue 2, the writer watches time-travel movies and must be in an odd position. Since the only odd position left is 1, the writer is in position 1.

#### Step 3: Position the Analyst
From Clue 9, the analyst and the person watching family movies have the same parity positions. From Clue 8, the person watching family movies is in position 2. Therefore, the analyst must also be in position 2, but this conflicts with the dressmaker being in position 2. This means the person watching family movies cannot be the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in position 2, the analyst must be in an odd position, and the person watching family movies must be in position 1. This conflicts with the writer being in position 1, so the person watching family movies must be in position 3.

Since the analyst and the person watching family movies must have the same parity, and the person watching family movies is in position 3, the analyst must be in position 1 (writer) or 3. But since the writer is already in position 1, the analyst must be in position 3.

#### Step 4: Position the American and Analyst
From Clue 6, the American is not to the left of the analyst. Since the analyst is in position 3, the American cannot be in position 1. From Clue 3, the American is not to the right of the dressmaker (in position 2). Therefore, the American must be in position 1.

#### Step 5: Position the Malaysian
From Clue 1, the Malaysian is not to the left of the owner of the fish. Since the American is in position 1, the Malaysian cannot be in position 1. The Malaysian can only be in position 3, which leaves the fish for the Malaysian.

#### Step 6: Position the Goat, Lizard, and Fish
From Clue 5, the owner of the goat is between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the fish. Since the Malaysian (fish) is in position 3, the goat and lizard must be in positions 1 and 2. The dressmaker (lizard) must be in position 2, and the goat must be in position 1.

#### Step 7: Determine the Remaining Foods and Jobs
From Clue 7, the person eating cabbage is on the left of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in position 2, the person eating cabbage must be in position 1 (American).

From Clue 11, the person eating spinach is not to the left of the analyst. Since the analyst is in position 3, the person eating spinach cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the person eating spinach must be in position 3 (Malaysian).

From Clue 10, the dressmaker is the person eating onion or the dressmaker is the owner of the fish, but not both. Since the dressmaker is the owner of the fish, the dressmaker is not eating onion.

Therefore, the remaining food for the analyst (position 3) is spinach.
