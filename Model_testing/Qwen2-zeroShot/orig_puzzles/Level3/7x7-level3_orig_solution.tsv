Lv3-7x7-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the grid. Let's start by organizing the clues and placing the most direct and clear information first.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 17**: The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 20**: The fan of pop is on the far right.
3. **Clue 22**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the far left or far right.
4. **Clue 36**: The person who's sport is biathlon is on the far right.

From these clues, we can determine that:
- The person drinking almond-milk is either in position 1 or 7.
- The person who's sport is biathlon is in position 7.
- The person driving the snowmobile is either in position 1 or 7.
- The fan of pop is in position 7.

Since the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 7, the fan of pop cannot be in position 7 (since they are the same person). Therefore, the fan of pop must be in position 1, and the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 7.
