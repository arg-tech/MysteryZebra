Lv3-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person driving the helicopter is the person drinking cola.
   - So, **Cola** is driven by **Helicopter**.

2. **Clue 6**: The chef is the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - So, **Hot-Chocolate** is drunk by **Chef**.

3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - From Clue 2, we know that **Cola** is driven by **Helicopter**. Therefore, **Helicopter** must be to the left of **Skateboard**.
   - So, **Helicopter** (driving cola) is in position 1, and **Skateboard** is in position 2.

4. **Clue 1**: The person watching drama movies is between the person driving the helicopter and the dancer.
   - From Clue 2, we know **Helicopter** is in position 1 (driving cola).
   - So, the person watching drama movies must be in position 2, which is **Skateboard**.
   - This also means the person driving the helicopter (position 1) is not the one watching drama, and the dancer is in position 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right.
   - Since **Skateboard** (position 2) is watching drama, the person watching satire must be in either position 1 or position 3.
   - Given that **Helicopter** (position 1) is driving cola, it cannot be watching satire.
   - Therefore, the person watching satire must be in position 3, which is the **Dancer**.

6. **Clue 7**: The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - Since **Dancer** is in position 3, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 1 or 2.
   - **Helicopter** (position 1) is driving cola, so the person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2, which is **Skateboard**.
   - This means the person with biathlon as their sport is in position 1, which is **Helicopter**.

7. **Clue 5**: The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - We already determined that the person watching mystery movies (position 2) is **Skateboard**.
   - And the person with biathlon as their sport is in position 1, which is **Helicopter**.
   - This clue is satisfied since **Skateboard** (position 2) is indeed to the right of **Helicopter** (position 1).

8. **Clue 8**: The person whose sport is basketball is the person drinking cola.
   - From Clue 2, we know **Helicopter** (position 1) is drinking cola.
   - Therefore, the person whose sport is basketball is **Helicopter**.

6. **Clue 6**: The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is the bartender.
7. **Clue 7**: The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person watching satire movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4** tells us that the person driving the subway is on the far right (position 3).
   - So, the person driving the subway is in position 3 for all categories (Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Transport).

2. **Clue 2** tells us that the person watching scientific movies is the person driving the subway.
   - Therefore, the person watching scientific movies is also in position 3 for Movie-Genre.

3. **Clue 6** tells us that the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is the bartender.
   - Since the bartender is on the right of the person eating cucumber (Clue 5), and the bartender is in position 3, the person eating cucumber must be in position 1 or 2.

4. **Clue 3** tells us that the person whose hobby is skydiving is between the person eating pear and the architect.
   - This means the person eating pear cannot be in position 3, and the architect cannot be in position 1 or 3.

5. **Clue 1** tells us that the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber.
   - Since the bartender is in position 3, the person eating cucumber must be in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the scooter must be in position 1 or 2 as well.

6. **Clue 7** tells us that the person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
   - Since the person watching scientific movies is in position 3, the person watching satire movies must be in position 1 or 2.

### Assigning Values:

- **Transport**: Submarine (position 3) -> Clue 4 & 2.
- **Movie-Genre**: Scientific (position 3) -> Clue 2.
- **Hobby**: Rock-climbing (position 3) -> Clue 6.
- **Job**: Bartender (position 3) -> Clue 6.
- **Food**: Cucumber (position 1) -> Based on Clue 5 & 1, the bartender is in position 3 and the cucumber eater is on the left of the bartender.

Given these constraints:
- The person eating cucumber must be in position 1.
- The person driving the scooter must be in position 2 (since the bartender is in position 3 and the cucumber eater is in position 1).

So, we can assign the remaining values:
- **Hobby**: Skydiving (position 2) -> Between pear and architect.
- **Job**: Architect (position 2) -> Between pear and skydiving.
- **Food**: Pear (position 2) -> Between cucumber and architect.
- **Movie-Genre**: Satire (position 1) -> Left of scientific.
- **Transport**: Scooter (position 2) -> Left of submarine.

### Final Solution Table:

Lv3-5x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically apply each clue to fill out the table. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing.
2. The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the turkish.
3. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person driving the train.
4. The person watching family movies is on the right of the person driving the train.
5. The person drinking cola is the Indonesian.
6. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
7. The person driving the bus is the person watching thriller movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the person drinking cola (Clue 5)
- The person drinking cola is the Indonesian.
- This means the Indonesian drinks cola.

#### Step 2: Determine the person driving the bus (Clue 7)
- The person driving the bus is the person watching thriller movies.
- We don't know yet who watches thriller movies, but we know the bus driver is one of them.

#### Step 3: Determine the person's hobbies (Clue 1)
- The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing.
- This implies a relative position for hobbies.

#### Step 4: Determine the movie genres (Clue 2, Clue 3, Clue 4)
- The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the turkish.
- The person watching family movies is on the right of the person driving the train.
- The person drinking tea is on the right of the person driving the train.

From these clues, let's assume:
- The person watching epic movies is either next to or directly the Turkish person.
- The person watching family movies is on the right of the person driving the train.
- The person drinking tea is also on the right of the person driving the train.

Since the person drinking tea is on the right of the person driving the train, and the person watching family movies is also on the right of the person driving the train, it implies that these two people must be in positions 2 and 3 (since position 1 would make the person watching family movies in an impossible spot).

Let's denote:
- Position 1: Person A
- Position 2: Person B
- Position 3: Person C

From Clue 6, the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
- If the person with hobby hiking is in position 2, then the person drinking soy-milk is in position 3.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, the person drinking tea is in position 3, so the person watching family movies must be in position 2.

Now we can piece together the information:
- Position 1: Person A (drinks something, does something, watches something)
- Position 2: Person B (hiking, drinks soy-milk, watches family movies)
- Position 3: Person C (drinks tea, does something, watches something)

From Clue 7, the person driving the bus is watching thriller movies, so:
- Position 1: Person A (drives the bus, watches thriller movies)
- Position 2: Person B (hiking, drinks soy-milk, watches family movies)
- Position 3: Person C (drinks tea, does something, watches something)

Since the person drinking cola is Indonesian (Clue 5), and the Indonesian is in position 1, the Indonesian is the one driving the bus and watching thriller movies.

Now we need to assign the remaining details:
- The person drinking cola (Indonesian) is in position 1.
- The person drinking soy-milk is in position 3 (right of the person with hobby hiking).
- The person drinking tea is in position 2 (right of the person driving the train).

We can now determine the rest:
- The person with hobby singing is in position 1 (since the person with hobby hiking is in position 2).
- The person with hobby skydiving must be in position 3.

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
| Beverage      | Cola      | Soy-milk | Tea       |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Hiking  | Skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller  | Family  | Epic      |
| Nationality   | Indonesian| Nigerian| Turkish   |
| Transport     | Bus       | Train   | Ship      |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
| Beverage      | Cola      | Soy-milk | Tea       |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Hiking  | Skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller  | Family  | Epic      |
| Nationality   | Indonesian| Nigerian| Turkish   |
| Transport     | Bus       | Train   | Ship      |

Lv3-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step 1: Analyze and List Constraints

1. The person eating pear is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour.
2. The person eating peach is on the left of the owner of the cat.
3. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person eating peach.
4. The Brazilian is on the left of the fan of techno.
5. The owner of the cat is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour.
6. The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of ambient.
7. The person eating papaya is on the right of the Brazilian.
8. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the Brazilian.
9. The person eating pear is on the left of the owner of the lizard.
10. The German is the person eating papaya.

### Step 2: Assign Values Based on Given Information

From constraint 10, we know:
- The German eats papaya (3rd column).

From constraint 7, since the German is in the 3rd column:
- The Brazilian must be in the 1st column (left of the German).

From constraint 8, since the Brazilian is in the 1st column:
- The person with biathlon must be in the 2nd column (left of the Brazilian).

From constraint 4, since the Brazilian is in the 1st column:
- The fan of techno must be in the 3rd column (right of the Brazilian).

From constraint 6, since the fan of ambient is in the 3rd column:
- The fan of folk must be in the 1st column (left of the fan of ambient).

Since the Brazilian is in the 1st column, the fan of folk must be in the 1st column, but we already have the Brazilian there. This means the fan of folk must be in the 2nd column, and the fan of ambient in the 3rd column.

### Step 3: Determine Remaining Positions

Now, let's determine the remaining positions for the sports and foods:

- The Brazilian (1st column) has biathlon.
- The person with techno is in the 3rd column.
- The person with folk is in the 2nd column.
- The German (3rd column) eats papaya.
- The person with snowboarding must be in the 3rd column (right of the person eating peach), so it can't be the German (already in 3rd column). It must be the person in the 2nd column.
- The person with parkour must be in the 1st or 2nd column (left or right of the person with pear).

From constraint 5, the owner of the cat is on the right of the person with parkour. So if the person with parkour is in the 1st column, the owner of the cat must be in the 2nd column. If the person with parkour is in the 2nd column, the owner of the cat must be in the 3rd column. But the 3rd column is occupied by the German.

From constraint 2, the person eating peach is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the German (3rd column) eats papaya, the person eating peach cannot be in the 3rd column. So, the person with peach must be in the 1st or 2nd column.

From constraint 9, the person eating pear is on the left of the owner of the lizard. So, the person with pear must be in the 1st or 2nd column, and the owner of the lizard must be in the 2nd or 3rd column.

Given all these constraints, let's place them:

1. **Brazilian** - Biathlon
2. **Fan of Folk** - Snowboarding
3. **German** - Papaya

For the sports and foods:
- The person with peach is in the 1st column (left of the owner of the cat).
- The person with pear is in the 2nd column (left of the owner of the lizard).
- The person with snowboarding is in the 2nd column (right of the person with peach).

So, the final arrangement looks like this:

|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Food          | Peach    | Pear     | Papaya       |
| Music-Genre   | Folk     | Snowboarding | Techno      |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Fan of Folk | German       |
| Pet           | Cat      | Lizard   | None         |
| Sport         | Biathlon| Parkour  | Snowboarding|

Lv3-5x3-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking mirinda is the owner of the ferret.
2. **Clue 2:** The Argentine is on the left or right of the Japanese.
3. **Clue 3:** The dressmaker is the owner of the horse.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking mirinda is in the middle.
5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the horse is on the far right.
6. **Clue 6:** The person watching epic movies is between the owner of the horse and the person watching romance movies.
7. **Clue 7:** The coach is the Argentine.
8. **Clue 8:** The dressmaker is on the far left or far right.
9. **Clue 9:** The manager is on the left of the person drinking juice.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

**From Clue 4 and Clue 5:**
- The person drinking mirinda is in the middle (Position 2).
- The owner of the horse is on the far right (Position 3).

So, we have:
```
|               |     1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |           | Mirinda  |            |
| Job           |           |          | Dressmaker  |
| Movie-Genre   |           | Epic     | Romance     |
| Nationality   |           |          | Japanese    |
| Pet           |           | Ferret   | Horse       |
```

**From Clue 3:**
- The dressmaker owns the horse, so the dressmaker must be in Position 3.
- Since the dressmaker is on the far right (Position 3), the dressmaker is also the owner of the horse.

**From Clue 7:**
- The coach is the Argentine.
- Since the Argentine is on the left or right of the Japanese, and the Japanese is on the far right (Position 3), the Argentine must be in Position 1.

**From Clue 8:**
- The dressmaker is on the far left or far right.
- We already know the dressmaker is in Position 3, so they cannot be on the far left.
- Therefore, the dressmaker must be on the far right, which is already assigned to Position 3.

**From Clue 9:**
- The manager is on the left of the person drinking juice.
- Since the person drinking mirinda (mirinda drinker) is in Position 2, the manager must be in Position 1.
- The person drinking juice must be in Position 3, but since Position 3 is already occupied by the dressmaker (who drinks mirinda), the person drinking juice must be in Position 1.

Since the manager is in Position 1 and the Argentine is also in Position 1, there seems to be a contradiction unless we reassess the positions. Let's correct this:

- The manager is on the left of the person drinking juice.
- The person drinking mirinda is in the middle (Position 2).
- The owner of the horse is on the far right (Position 3).

Revised:
```
|               |     1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | Juice     | Mirinda  | Soy-milk    |
| Job           | Manager   |          | Dressmaker  |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance   | Epic     | Documentary |
| Nationality   | Argentine |          | Japanese    |
| Pet           | Pony      | Ferret   | Horse       |
```

**Final Check:**
- The manager is in Position 1 and is on the left of the person drinking juice.
- The person drinking mirinda is in Position 2.
- The owner of the horse is in Position 3.
- The Argentine is in Position 1, which is on the left of the Japanese in Position 3.
- The dressmaker is in Position 3, owning the horse.
- The person watching epic movies is between the owner of the horse (Position 3) and the person watching romance movies (Position 2).
- The coach (Argentine) is in Position 1.
- The dressmaker is on the far right (Position 3).

The final solution table is:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |      3      |

Lv3-5x3-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis

1. **Clue 1:** The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the van is in the middle.
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the van is the person driving the van (redundant).
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is tennis is between the owner of the mouse and the entrepreneur.
6. **Clue 6:** The chef is on the far right.
7. **Clue 7:** The person eating banana is the person driving the ship.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is climbing is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 6
- The chef is on the far right. Therefore, the positions for the chef are:
  - Position 3: Chef

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- The person driving the van is in the middle (position 2).

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 7
- The person eating banana is the person driving the ship. Therefore, the positions for the ship and banana are:
  - Position 2: Ship
  - Position 2: Banana

Since the person driving the van is also in position 2, we need to adjust our understanding of the person driving the ship. It must be another person in position 2, which contradicts the van being driven there. Let's re-evaluate:

- Position 2: Van (from Clue 3)
- Position 1: Banana (from Clue 7)

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 9
- The person who's sport is climbing is on the far right (position 3). Therefore, the sport of the chef is climbing.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 1
- The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis.
- The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 5
- The person who's sport is tennis is between the owner of the mouse and the entrepreneur.
- The chef is on the far right with sport as climbing.

#### Step 7: Analyze Clue 8
- The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

Given the above, let's place the sports and other elements:

- Position 3: Climbing (chef)
- Position 2: Van (from Clue 3)
- Position 1: Banana (from Clue 7)

Now, let's fill in the remaining elements:

- Position 1: Banana
- Position 2: Van
- Position 3: Climbing (chef)

Using Clue 5:
- The person who's sport is tennis is between the owner of the mouse and the entrepreneur.
- Since the chef is at position 3, the tennis person must be at position 2 or 1. But since position 2 is van, it must be position 1.

- Position 1: Banana
- Position 2: Van
- Position 3: Climbing (chef)

Using Clue 1:
- The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis.
- Since the tennis person is at position 1, the horse owner must be at position 3 (chef).

Using Clue 2:
- The person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing.
- Since the chef is at position 3, the apricot person must be at position 1 or 2. But position 1 is banana, so it must be position 2.

Using Clue 8:
- The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
- Since the tennis person is at position 1, the quad-bike driver must be at position 3 (chef).

Finally, using Clue 5 again:
- The person who's sport is tennis is between the owner of the mouse and the entrepreneur.
- Since the chef is at position 3, the mouse owner must be at position 1 or 2. But position 1 is banana, so it must be position 2.

#### Clue 4:
- The person with the hobby of cooking prefers the sport of rowing.

#### Clue 3:
- The person with the hobby of reading is to the left of the person watching musical movies (cooking hobby).

Since the person with the cooking hobby is in position 2 (from the left), the person with the reading hobby must be in position 1.

#### Clue 5:

### Step 2: Set Up the Table

|               |    1    |     2      |       3       |
| Hobby         |         |            |               |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |               |
| Pet           |         |            |               |
| Sport         |         |            |               |
| Transport     |         |            |               |

### Step 3: Apply Constraints

#### Constraint 5: The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's hobby is skydiving.
This tells us that:
- Skydiving is in the third column (Skydiving -> 3).

#### Constraint 2: The person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
Since Skydiving is in the third column, Basketball must be in the first or second column.

#### Constraint 3: The owner of the hamster is the person who's sport is basketball.
This tells us that:
- Basketball -> Hamster.

#### Constraint 5 Recap: The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's hobby is skydiving.
So, we know:
- Skydiving -> 3 and Basketball -> Hamster.

#### Constraint 1: The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing.
If Sailing is in the first or second column, Fantasy must be in the second or third column.

#### Constraint 4: The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
If Puzzles is in the first or second column, Scientific must be in the second or third column.

#### Constraint 6: The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person driving the bus.
This tells us that:
- Puzzles can be in the first or third column.
- Bus can be in the second or third column if Puzzles is in the first column, or in the first or second column if Puzzles is in the third column.

#### Constraint 7: The person driving the tram is on the right of the owner of the pony.
If Pony is in the first or second column, Tram must be in the second or third column.

#### Constraint 8: The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies.
If Fantasy is in the first or second column, Skateboard must be in the second or third column.

### Step 4: Deduce Positions

Let's start filling in the table based on the above constraints:

1. Since Basketball -> Hamster and Skydiving -> 3, Sailing cannot be in the third column.
2. If Sailing is in the first column, then Fantasy must be in the second column, and Scientific in the third column.
3. If Puzzles is in the first column, then Bus can be in the second or third column.
4. If Pony is in the first column, then Tram must be in the second or third column.
5. If Fantasy is in the second column, then Skateboard must be in the third column.

Based on these deductions, let's place the elements:

- Skydiving -> 3 (from constraint 5)
- Basketball -> Hamster (from constraint 3)
- Sailing -> 1 (since it cannot be in 3 and needs to be left of Fantasy)
- Fantasy -> 2 (since it is right of Sailing and left of Scientific)
- Scientific -> 3 (since it is right of Puzzles and left of Skateboard)

Now, let's fill in the rest:

- Puzzles -> 1 (since it is left or right of Bus)
- Bus -> 2 (since Puzzles is in 1 and Bus is not in 3)
- Tram -> 3 (since it is right of Pony)
- Skateboard -> 2 (since it is right of Fantasy)

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of the person eating plum (Clue 7 & 4)
- The person eating plum is in the middle (Clue 7).
- The person eating spinach is on the right of the person eating plum (Clue 4).

So, the order for food must be:

#### Step 3: Identify the person with the hobby of dancing (Clue 8)
- The person eating plum is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.
- Therefore, the person with the hobby of dancing must be in the rightmost position.

So, the order for hobbies must be:

- Since the owner of the horse is on the right of the person driving the bus, the person driving the bus must be in the leftmost position.
- The photographer (eating pepper) cannot be driving the bus or trike, so they must be in the middle job position.
- The person driving the trike must be on the right of the photographer (eating pepper).

So, the order for jobs and transport must be:

- Engineer (left job)
- Accountant (right job)
- Bus (left transport)
- Trike (right transport)
- Helicopter (middle transport)

### Final Table:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching satire movies is on the far left.**
   - This means the first column is for the person watching satire movies.

   - This means that if one person has a collecting hobby, the other must be either in the same row or adjacent to them.

4. **The fan of salsa is on the far right.**
   - This means the third column is for the person who likes salsa.

5. **The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is gardening.**

7. **The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left of the person driving the skateboard.**

   - This means the software-developer is in the first or second column, and the jazz fan is in the second or third column.

9. **The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is video-games.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person Watching Satire Movies:**
   - First column.
   
2. **Person Driving Boat:**

3. **Person Who Likes Salsa:**
   - Third column.

4. **Person Who Likes Drama Movies:**
   - Right of the person who gardens, so not in the third column. Since the person watching satire is in the first column, the person who likes drama must be in the third column.

   - Fan of salsa, so in the third column.

6. **Person Who Collects:**
   - On the left or right of the gardener.

- **Video-Games**: Third column (right of the person with the collecting hobby).

- **Jazz**: Software-developer in the first column.
