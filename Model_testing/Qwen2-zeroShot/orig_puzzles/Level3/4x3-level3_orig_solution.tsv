We need to determine the positions of nationality, job, sport, and transport for each person.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the person driving the roller
From clue 6, the Japanese drives the roller.
So, we can write:
```
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           |               |              |            |
| Nationality   | Japanese      |              |            |
| Sport         |               |              |            |
| Transport     | Roller        |              |            |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the position of the American
From clue 7, the person driving the roller (Japanese) is on the left of the American.
So, the American must be in position 3.
```
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           |               |              | Manager    |
| Nationality   | Japanese      |              |            |
| Sport         |               |              |            |
| Transport     | Roller        |              | Bus        |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the sport of the Japanese
From clue 1, the Japanese is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
Since the Japanese is in position 1, the person with snowboarding must be in position 3.
So, the sport in position 3 must be snowboarding.
```
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           |               |              | Manager    |
| Nationality   | Japanese      |              |            |
| Sport         |               |              | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Roller        |              | Bus        |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the sport of the person in position 2
From clue 4, the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
So, the person in position 2 must have skateboarding.
```
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           |               |              | Manager    |
| Nationality   | Japanese      |              |            |
| Sport         | Skateboarding |              | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Roller        |              | Bus        |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the person in position 1
From clue 3, the dancer is on the left of the American.
Since the American is in position 3, the dancer must be in position 1.
```
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Dancer        |              | Manager    |
| Nationality   | Japanese      |              |            |
| Sport         | Skateboarding |              | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Roller        |              | Bus        |
```

#### Step 6: Determine the remaining person and their details
From clue 5, the designer is on the left or right of the person driving the bus.
Since the bus is in position 3, the designer must be in position 2.
```
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Dancer        | Designer     | Manager    |
| Nationality   | Japanese      | Indonesian   |            |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Handball     | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Roller        | Jet-ski      | Bus        |
```

From clue 2, the Indonesian is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
Since the Indonesian is in position 2 and the jet-ski is in position 2, this is consistent.

#### Final Table:
```
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Dancer        | Designer     | Manager    |
| Nationality   | Japanese      | Indonesian   | American   |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Handball     | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Roller        | Jet-ski      | Bus        |
```"
Lv3-4x3-2	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to find the solution:

1. **Clue 3:** The owner of the goldfish is the person drinking almond-milk.
   - This means the pet ""gold"" must be in column 3.

2. **Clue 5:** The person drinking almond-milk is the person who's hobby is collecting.
   - So, the hobby ""collecting"" must be in column 3.

3. **Clue 4:** The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person driving the train.
   - Since almond-milk is in column 3, the person driving the train must be in column 1.

4. **Clue 6:** The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the train.
   - Since the person driving the train is in column 1, the person driving the motorbike must be in column 2.

5. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is drawing is between the owner of the frog and the person drinking almond-milk.
   - Since the person drinking almond-milk (and thus having the hobby ""collecting"") is in column 3, the person with the hobby ""drawing"" must be in column 2 (since the person with the hobby ""drawing"" is between the owner of the frog and the person drinking almond-milk).

6. **Clue 1:** The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.
   - Since the person drinking almond-milk is in column 3, the person drinking iced-tea must be in either column 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 7:** There are 3 different favourite beverages: almond-milk, coffee, iced-tea.
   - We know the person drinking almond-milk is in column 3, so the remaining two must be in columns 1 and 2. Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk, it can't be in column 3. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea must be in column 1, leaving coffee for column 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

- **Beverage:**
  - Column 1: iced-tea
  - Column 2: coffee
  - Column 3: almond-milk

- **Hobby:**
  - Column 1: (to be determined)
  - Column 2: drawing
  - Column 3: collecting

- **Pet:**
  - Column 1: (to be determined)
  - Column 2: frog
  - Column 3: gold

- **Transport:**
  - Column 1: train
  - Column 2: motorbike
  - Column 3: (to be determined)

From Clue 2, we know that the person with the hobby ""drawing"" is between the owner of the frog and the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person with the hobby ""drawing"" is in column 2, the owner of the frog must be in column 1 and the person drinking iced-tea (who has no specific hobby mentioned) must be in column 1.

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|             |     1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage    |  iced-tea |  coffee  |  almond-milk |
| Hobby       |  collecting|  drawing |  collecting  |
| Pet         |  frog     |  frog    |  gold       |
| Transport   |  train    |  motorbike |  train      |
```

This is the solution to the puzzle."
Lv3-4x3-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The designer is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
2. The analyst is on the far left or far right.
3. The owner of the lizard is between the owner of the bird and the manager.
4. The Spanish is on the left or right of the analyst.
5. The Italian is the Italian (no new information here).
6. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
7. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left or far right.
8. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the Italian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2 and 7:
- The analyst must be either in position 1 or 3.
- The person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 1 or 3.

Since the analyst and the person with the hobby of drawing can't both be in the same positions (1 or 3), one must be in position 1 and the other in position 3. 

Let's assume:
- Analyst is in position 1.
- Person with the hobby of drawing is in position 3.

This means:
- Position 2 is for the person with the hobby of board-games (since the person with the hobby of board-games is on the left of the Italian, and the Italian cannot be in position 2).

#### Clue 8:
- The person with the hobby of board-games is on the left of the Italian.
- Since the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the Italian must be in position 3.

This conflicts with our earlier assumption that the person with the hobby of drawing is in position 3. Therefore, we need to switch the positions:
- Analyst is in position 3.
- Person with the hobby of drawing is in position 1.
- Person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2.
- Italian is in position 3.

This leaves the person with the hobby of video-games in position 2.

#### Clue 1:
- The designer is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
- So, the designer must be in position 3, which conflicts with our current placement of the Italian in position 3.

We need to adjust again:
- Analyst is in position 1.
- Person with the hobby of drawing is in position 3.
- Person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2.
- Person with the hobby of video-games is in position 1.
- Designer must then be in position 3.

#### Clue 6:
- The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
- The owner of the lizard must be in position 1 or 2, and the owner of the bird must be in position 2 or 3.

Since the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 1, the owner of the lizard must be in position 2, and the owner of the bird must be in position 3.

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the lizard is between the owner of the bird and the manager.
- This confirms the positions:
  - Owner of the lizard (position 2) is between the owner of the bird (position 3) and the manager (position 1).

#### Clue 4:
- The Spanish is on the left or right of the analyst.
- Since the analyst is in position 1, the Spanish must be in position 3.

#### Clue 5:
- The Italian is the Italian (no new information here).

### Final Table:
```plaintext
|               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
| Hobby         | Video-games | Drawing     | Board-games |
| Job           | Spanish     | Analyst     | Italian    |
| Nationality   | Spanish     | Italian     | Italian    |
| Pet           | Lizard      | Bird        | Rat        |
```

This solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv3-4x3-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues step by step to fill in the table. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information.

### Clues:
1. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
2. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
3. The person drinking lemonade is on the far left.
4. The Australian is on the right of the person whose hobby is singing.
5. The person whose hobby is singing is on the far left or far right.
6. The person eating zucchini is between the Nigerian and the person eating carrot.
7. The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the Canadian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3: The person drinking lemonade is on the far left.
This means:
- **Beverage 1**: Lemonade

#### Clue 6: The person eating zucchini is between the Nigerian and the person eating carrot.
This means that the positions for zucchini, Nigerian, and carrot must be consecutive. Since there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), they must occupy these positions.

#### Clue 7: The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the Canadian.
Since the person eating zucchini is between the Nigerian and the person eating carrot, the Canadian cannot be in the middle position (position 2). Therefore, the Canadian must be either in position 1 or position 3.

#### Clue 5: The person whose hobby is singing is on the far left or far right.
This means the person whose hobby is singing is either in position 1 or position 3.

#### Clue 4: The Australian is on the right of the person whose hobby is singing.
If the person whose hobby is singing is in position 1, the Australian must be in position 3. If the person whose hobby is singing is in position 3, the Australian must be in position 2. But since the Canadian is not in position 2 (from Clue 7), the person whose hobby is singing must be in position 1, and the Australian must be in position 3.

#### Clue 2: The person drinking cola is on the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
This means the person drinking cola is in position 1 or 2, and the person whose hobby is writing is in position 2 or 3. Given that the person drinking lemonade is in position 1, the person drinking cola must be in position 2, and the person whose hobby is writing must be in position 3.

#### Clue 1: The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
This means the person eating kiwi is in position 2 or 3, and the person whose hobby is puzzles is in position 1 or 2. Given that the person whose hobby is writing is in position 3, the person eating kiwi must be in position 3, and the person whose hobby is puzzles must be in position 2.

#### Clue 6: Revisited with all other information.
The person eating zucchini is between the Nigerian and the person eating carrot. With the positions filled as follows:
- Position 1: Lemonade
- Position 2: Cola
- Position 3: Writing

The person eating zucchini can only be in position 2 or 3. Since position 2 is already occupied by cola, the person eating zucchini must be in position 3, which means the person eating carrot must be in position 2, and the Nigerian must be in position 1.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |

Lv3-4x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the correct categories. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person eating asparagus is the owner of the bird.**
2. **The analyst is on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies.**
3. **The videographer is on the right of the person eating lemon.**
4. **The person eating asparagus is the person watching thriller movies.**
5. **The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.**
6. **The person eating asparagus is the person watching thriller movies.** (This is redundant with clue 4)
7. **The person watching action movies is between the owner of the horse and the chef.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the person eating asparagus.
From clues 1, 4, and 6, we know:
- The person eating asparagus is the owner of the bird.
- The person eating asparagus is watching thriller movies.

Let's denote the person eating asparagus as \( A \).

#### Step 2: Determine the genre of movie watched by \( A \).
\( A \) is watching thriller movies.

#### Step 3: Identify the job of \( A \).
Since \( A \) is the person eating asparagus, from clue 1, \( A \) owns the bird.
From clue 2, the analyst is on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since \( A \) is watching thriller movies, the analyst cannot be next to \( A \).

From clue 3, the videographer is on the right of the person eating lemon. This means the videographer cannot be \( A \), so the videographer must be either the person eating lemon or the person eating pomegranate.

From clue 5, the person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. This means the person eating pomegranate cannot be \( A \).

So, the person eating lemon must be the videographer, and the person eating pomegranate must be the owner of the goldfish.

Thus, the person eating asparagus is the analyst.

#### Step 4: Determine the pet and movie preferences for the remaining individuals.
- The analyst (eating asparagus) is the owner of the bird and watching thriller movies.
- The person eating lemon is the videographer.
- The person eating pomegranate is the owner of the goldfish and watching time-travel movies.
- The person watching action movies is between the owner of the horse and the chef.

From clue 7, the person watching action movies is between the owner of the horse and the chef. This means the chef must be on one side of the person watching action movies, and the owner of the horse on the other side.

Since the analyst (eating asparagus) is the owner of the bird, the chef must be the owner of the horse, and the person watching action movies is the videographer (eating lemon).

Thus, the final assignments are:
- Analyst (eating asparagus): Bird, Thriller
- Chef (eating pomegranate): Goldfish, Time-travel
- Videographer (eating lemon): Horse, Action

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv3-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is golf is on the right of the chef.
2. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is golf is on the far right.
   - This means the person with golf is in position 3.

3. **Clue 6**: The accountant is the person drinking lemonade.
   - The accountant must be in one of the positions (1, 2, or 3) and is drinking lemonade.

4. **Clue 2**: The accountant is the owner of the pony.
   - The accountant must be in position 1, 2, or 3 and owns the pony.

5. **Clue 4**: The owner of the lizard is in the middle.
   - The owner of the lizard must be in position 2.

6. **Clue 3**: The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
   - Since the owner of the lizard is in position 2, the owner of the cat must be in position 1 or 3.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
   - The person drinking 7up cannot be in position 2 because the owner of the lizard is there.

8. **Clue 8**: The owner of the cat is the person who's sport is rugby.
   - The owner of the cat must be in position 1 or 3, and their sport is rugby.

Now, let's piece it together:

- The person with golf is in position 3.
- The accountant is in position 1, owns the pony, and drinks lemonade.
- The owner of the lizard is in position 2.
- The owner of the cat is in position 1 or 3, and their sport is rugby.
- The person with skateboarding is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
- The person with 7up cannot be in position 2 (lizard), so they must be in position 1 or 3.
- Since the person with golf is in position 3, the person with skateboarding must be in position 1 or 2.

From the above, we can deduce:
- Position 1: Accountant (drinks lemonade, owns pony)
- Position 2: Lizard
- Position 3: Golf

Since the person with 7up cannot be in position 2 (lizard) and must be on the left or right of the person with skateboarding, and since the person with skateboarding is in position 1 or 2, the person with 7up must be in position 1 or 3.

Given that the person with 7up cannot be in position 1 (accountant), the person with 7up must be in position 3, but position 3 is already occupied by golf. Therefore, the person with 7up must be in position 1.

This leaves position 3 for the person with skateboarding.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Accountant (drinks lemonade, owns pony, has 7up)
- Position 2: Lizard
- Position 3: Skateboarding

Now, the remaining person (with rugby) must own the cat, as the owner of the cat is the person who's sport is rugby.

Here is the final solution table:

```
|            |      1      |       2       |     3      |
| Beverage   |    7up      |               |  skateboarding |
| Job        |  accountant |               |  skateboarding |
| Pet        |    pony     |    lizard     |     cat     |
| Sport      |    7up      |               |  skateboarding |

Lv3-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The teacher is the person driving the bus.
2. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
3. The fisherman is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski.
4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the owner of the mouse.
5. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person driving the trike.
6. The teacher is the owner of the frog.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- **Teacher** drives the **bus**.

#### Clue 6:
- The **teacher** owns the **frog**.

#### Clue 5:
- The person with the hobby of **woodworking** drives the **trike**.

Since the teacher owns the frog and drives the bus, the teacher cannot be the one with the hobby of woodworking or driving the trike. So, we have:
- **Hobby**: Woodworking -> Trike
- **Job**: Teacher -> Bus
- **Pet**: Frog -> Teacher

#### Clue 4:
- The person with the hobby of woodworking is on the left of the owner of the mouse.

This means the person with woodworking cannot be in position 3, as they would need to be on the left of someone else.

#### Clue 3:
- The fisherman is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski.

This means the fisherman and the person driving the jet-ski must be next to each other.

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.

Since the person with woodworking is on the left of the owner of the mouse, and the person with woodworking drives the trike, the owner of the mouse must be in position 2 (since they can't be in position 1 because the person with woodworking is on their left).

So, we have:
- Position 2: Mouse

#### Clue 4:
- The person with the hobby of woodworking is on the left of the owner of the mouse.
- Therefore, the person with woodworking must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Woodworking (drives the trike)
- Position 2: Mouse

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the mouse (position 2) is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
- Therefore, the person with photography must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 3: Photography

#### Remaining Hobbies and Jobs:
- The only remaining hobby is **baking**, which must go to position 2.
- The only remaining job is **paramedic**, which must go to position 2.
- The only remaining pet is **guinea-pig**, which must go to position 3.

Since the fisherman cannot be in position 1 (woodworking), and he must be next to the person driving the jet-ski, he must be in position 3 (photography), and the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 2 (mouse).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Woodworking (drives the trike)
- Position 2: Mouse (fisherman, drives the jet-ski)
- Position 3: Photography (teaches, owns the guinea-pig)

Finally, the paramedic must be in position 1, as it's the only job left.

### Final Table:
```
|             |      1      |     2     |      3      |
| Hobby       | Baking      | Photography | Woodworking |
| Job         | Paramedic   | Fisherman  | Teacher     |
| Pet         | Guinea-pig  | Mouse      | Frog        |
| Transport   | Trike       | Jet-ski    | Bus         |

Lv3-4x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of the person, their beverage, food, music genre, and mode of transport.

Let's start by summarizing the clues:

1. The person eating banana is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter.
2. The person drinking milk is on the left of the fan of soul.
3. The fan of folk is on the far right.
4. The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
5. The person drinking milk is the person eating blueberry.
6. The person driving the bike is the fan of folk.

Now, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the fan of folk
From clue 6:
- The person driving the bike is the fan of folk.
- The fan of folk is on the far right (clue 3).

So, the person driving the bike is in position 3 for both transport and music genre.

|               |     1      |   2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |            |        | Milk        |
| Food          |            |        | Pineapple   |
| Music-Genre   |            |        | Folk        |
| Transport     |            |        | Bike        |

### Step 2: Determine the person eating blueberry and drinking milk
From clue 5:
- The person drinking milk is the person eating blueberry.
- The person drinking milk is in position 3 (from above).

So, the person in position 3 is eating blueberry and drinking milk.

|               |     1      |   2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |            |        | Milk        |
| Food          |            |        | Blueberry   |
| Music-Genre   |            |        | Folk        |
| Transport     |            |        | Bike        |

### Step 3: Determine the person eating banana and the person driving the helicopter
From clue 1:
- The person eating banana is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter.
- The person driving the helicopter is in position 3 (bike).

Since the person eating banana cannot be in position 3, they must be in either position 1 or 2.

From clue 4:
- The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
- The person drinking coffee cannot be in position 3, so they must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the person drinking coffee is not in position 3, the person eating pineapple must be in position 3 (already assigned) or position 2.

If the person eating pineapple is in position 2, then the person drinking coffee must be in position 1. This leaves position 1 for the person eating banana.

So, the person in position 1 is eating banana, the person in position 2 is eating pineapple, and the person in position 3 is eating blueberry.

|               |     1      |   2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |            |        | Milk        |
| Food          | Banana     | Pineapple | Blueberry  |
| Music-Genre   |            |        | Folk        |
| Transport     |            |        | Bike        |

### Step 4: Determine the remaining beverages and foods
From clue 2:
- The person drinking milk is on the left of the fan of soul.
- The person drinking milk is in position 3 (blueberry).

This means the person in position 2 must be drinking coffee.

|               |     1      |   2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |            | Coffee | Milk        |
| Food          | Banana     | Pineapple | Blueberry  |
| Music-Genre   |            |        | Folk        |
| Transport     |            |        | Bike        |

From clue 4:
- The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
- The person eating pineapple is in position 2 (pineapple).

So, the person in position 1 is eating banana and drinking almond-milk.

|               |     1      |   2    |      3      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Coffee | Milk        |
| Food          | Banana     | Pineapple | Blueberry  |
| Music-Genre   |            |        | Folk        |
| Transport     |            |        | Bike        |

Finally, from clue 3:
- The fan of folk is on the far right.
- The fan of folk is already in position 3 (bike).

So, the final arrangement is:

```
|               |     1      |   2    |      3      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Coffee | Milk        |
| Food          | Banana     | Pineapple | Blueberry  |
| Music-Genre   | Soul       |        | Folk        |
| Transport     | Helicopter | Bus    | Bike        |
```"
Lv3-4x3-10	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. **The person eating spinach is on the far left**:
   - Spinach is in position 1.

2. **The Russian is on the left or right of the fan of blues**:
   - This means the Russian is not directly next to the blues fan.

3. **The Russian is the Russian** (redundant information).

4. **The fan of d&b is on the left of the person eating kale**:
   - The d&b fan is in position 1 or 2, and the person eating kale is in position 2 or 3.

5. **The fan of classical is the person drinking lemonade**:
   - The classical fan drinks lemonade.

6. **The person drinking soy-milk is between the Argentine and the Russian**:
   - The person drinking soy-milk is in position 2, with the Argentine and the Russian on either side.

7. **The fan of d&b is the Argentine**:
   - The Argentine is the fan of d&b.

Combining these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person eating spinach is in position 1.
- The d&b fan (Argentine) is in position 2.
- The person drinking soy-milk is in position 2, so this conflicts with the d&b fan being in position 2. Therefore, the d&b fan must be in position 1, and the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 3.
- The classical fan (drinking lemonade) cannot be in position 1 or 2 because the Argentine is in position 2. So, the classical fan must be in position 3.
- The Russian is in position 3, as they are not directly next to the blues fan (who must be in position 1 or 2).
- The blues fan must be in position 2, as the Russian is in position 3 and the Argentine is in position 1.

Thus, we have:
- Position 1: Argentine (d&b, eating eggplant)
- Position 2: Blues fan (eating kale)
- Position 3: Russian (classical, drinking lemonade, eating spinach)

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk  | water    | lemonade  |
| Food          | eggplant  | kale     | spinach   |
| Music-Genre   | d&b       | blues    | classical |
| Nationality   | argentine | russian  | thai      |
```

Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk  | water    | lemonade  |
| Food          | eggplant  | kale     | spinach   |
| Music-Genre   | d&b       | blues    | classical |
| Nationality   | argentine | russian  | thai      |
