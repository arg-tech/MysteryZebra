21. **The person eating watermelon is the person driving the jet-ski**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 14**: The person driving the scooter is on the far left. So, position 1 is the scooter.
2. **Clue 16**: The person eating peach is the person driving the boat. So, position 6 is the boat.
3. **Clue 17**: The Mexican is the person eating onion. So, the Mexican is on the right of the person eating peach (position 6), making position 7 the Mexican.
4. **Clue 19 & 20**: The security-guard is on the far left or far right, and the pilot is on the far left or far right. Since position 1 is already taken by the scooter, the security-guard must be in position 7 (Mexican). Thus, the pilot must be in position 1.
5. **Clue 2**: The person driving the trike is on the left of the Italian. Since the pilot is in position 1, the trike driver cannot be in position 1. Also, the trike driver cannot be in position 2 because the Italian would not fit. Therefore, the trike driver is in position 3, and the Italian is in position 4.
6. **Clue 12**: The Russian is the person driving the ship. Since the trike driver is in position 3, the Russian must be in position 4.
7. **Clue 13**: The person driving the train is the Spanish. Since the trike driver is in position 3 and the Russian is in position 4, the train driver must be in position 5.

9. **Clue 10**: The person eating orange is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. The person eating orange cannot be in position 6 (boat) or 7 (Mexican), so it must be in position 2 or 3. Since the trike driver is in position 3, the person eating orange must be in position 2.
10. **Clue 6**: The person eating onion is on the right of the person driving the taxi. The person eating onion is the Mexican, who is in position 7, so the taxi driver must be in position 5.
11. **Clue 3**: The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating mango. The taxi driver is in position 5, so the person eating mango must be in position 4 (Italian).
12. **Clue 4**: The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person driving the train. The scooter driver is in position 1, and the train driver is in position 5.
13. **Clue 5**: The person eating peach is between the person driving the train and the Russian. The person eating peach is in position 6, and the Russian is in position 4, so the train driver (Spanish) must be in position 5.
14. **Clue 8**: The person eating kale is the Dutch. Since the Dutch is not in position 6 (peach) or 7 (Mexican), the Dutch must be in position 3.
15. **Clue 11**: The lawyer is on the left of the pilot. The pilot is in position 1, so the lawyer must be in position 2.
16. **Clue 7**: The Argentine is on the left or right of the videographer. The Argentine cannot be in position 1 (scooter) or 2 (lawyer), so the Argentine must be in position 3 (kale) or 4 (Italian).
17. **Clue 18**: The police-officer is on the left or right of the person eating orange. The person eating orange is in position 2, so the police-officer must be in position 3 (kale) or 5 (train).
