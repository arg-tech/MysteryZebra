   - This implies that the order of the movie genres is either `superhero, crime` or `crime, superhero`.

2. **Person whose sport is snowboarding is on the right of the owner of the lizard**:
   - Let's denote the person with the lizard as `L` and the person with snowboarding as `S`. If `L` is in position 1, then `S` must be in position 4. Otherwise, if `L` is in position 2 or 3, then `S` would need to be in positions 3 or 4 respectively.

13. **Person eating potato is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games**:
    - Let's denote the person eating potato as `P` and the person with video-games as `V`. If `V` is in position 1, then `P` can be in position 2 or 4. If `V` is in position 2, then `P` can be in position 3 or 4. If `V` is in position 3, then `P` can be in position 4. If `V` is in position 4, then `P` cannot be placed since it would violate the previous constraints.
