Lv3-3x5-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 3:** The person driving the airplane is in the middle.
   - This means that the person driving the airplane is in position 3.

2. **Clue 5:** The person driving the bike is the paramedic.
   - Therefore, the paramedic is in position 2 and is driving the bike.

3. **Clue 6:** The analyst is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.
   - This means the analyst is in position 1 and the person driving the motorbike is in position 2 or 3, but since the paramedic (position 2) is driving the bike, the motorbike must be driven by someone in position 4 or 5.

4. **Clue 7:** The paramedic is on the left of the person watching crime movies.
   - Since the paramedic is in position 2, the person watching crime movies must be in position 4 or 5.

5. **Clue 10:** The person watching crime movies is on the far right.
   - Therefore, the person watching crime movies is in position 5.

6. **Clue 1:** The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person watching western movies.
   - This means the person watching fantasy movies is in position 1 or 2, and the person watching western movies is in position 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 4:** The person driving the skateboard is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the skateboard cannot be driven by the paramedic (position 2), it can only be driven by the person in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is already taken by the analyst, so the skateboard must be driven by the person in position 5, who is also watching crime movies.

8. **Clue 8:** The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person driving the skateboard.
   - Since the skateboard is driven by the person in position 5, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is taken by the analyst, so the person watching mystery movies is in position 2, which is the paramedic.

9. **Clue 9:** The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person watching western movies.
   - Since the paramedic is in position 2, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1. This means the person watching western movies is in position 3 or 4. Since the person watching fantasy movies is to the left of the person watching western movies, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 1, and the person watching western movies must be in position 3.

10. **Clue 2:** The doctor is on the right of the pilot.
    - The remaining positions for the doctor and pilot are 4 and 5. Since the person watching crime movies is in position 5, the doctor must be in position 4 and the pilot in position 5.

Now we can summarize the positions:

- Position 1: Analyst, watching fantasy movies, driving skateboard
- Position 2: Paramedic, watching mystery movies, driving bike
- Position 3: Doctor, watching crime movies, driving airplane
- Position 4: Pilot, watching western movies, not specified
- Position 5: Person (doctor), watching crime movies, driving airplane

So the final solution is:

Lv3-3x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct beverage, hobby, and pet in their respective positions. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the owner of the lizard.
2. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the rabbit.
3. The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
4. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the pony.
5. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the owner of the lizard.
6. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
7. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing.
8. The person drinking iced-tea is the owner of the horse.
9. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
10. The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
11. The owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 1 and Clue 5:**
   - Coffee is on the left of Lizard.
   - Sudoku is on the left of Lizard.
   - Therefore, Lizard must be in position 3, and Coffee and Sudoku must be in positions 1 and 2 (Coffee on the left).

2. **From Clue 2:**
   - Lizard is on the right of Rabbit.
   - Since Lizard is in position 3, Rabbit must be in position 2.
   - So, Coffee is in position 1, and Rabbit is in position 2.

3. **From Clue 3:**
   - Goldfish is on the left of Gardening.
   - Since Gardening is in position 4, Goldfish must be in position 3.
   - But we already know Lizard is in position 3, so this must be a contradiction or a misinterpretation. Let's re-evaluate.

4. **From Clue 4:**
   - Goldfish is on the right of Pony.
   - Since Goldfish cannot be in position 3, it must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Pony must be in position 2 or 1.

5. **From Clue 8:**
   - Iced-tea is the owner of the horse.
   - Horse is in position 1 or 2, but since Coffee is in position 1, Horse must be in position 2.
   - So, Rabbit is in position 2, and Iced-tea is in position 2.

6. **From Clue 9:**
   - Lemonade is on the right of Lizard.
   - Since Lizard is in position 3, Lemonade must be in position 4 or 5.
   - But since Goldfish is in position 4 or 5, Lemonade must be in position 5.
   - So, Lizard is in position 3, and Lemonade is in position 5.

7. **From Clue 6:**
   - Gardening is on the right of Writing.
   - Since Writing must be in position 1 or 2, and Gardening must be in position 4 or 5, Gardening must be in position 4 and Writing must be in position 3.

8. **From Clue 7:**
   - Horse is on the left or right of Writing.
   - Since Horse is in position 2 and Writing is in position 3, Horse is on the left of Writing.

9. **From Clue 10:**
   - 7up is on the left or right of Gardening.
   - Since Gardening is in position 4, 7up must be in position 3 or 5.
   - But Lizard and Lemonade are in positions 3 and 5, so 7up must be in position 3.
   - This contradicts our previous placement of Gardening, so let's re-evaluate.

10. **From Clue 11:**
    - Pony is on the right of Photography.
    - Since Photography must be in position 1 or 2, and Pony must be in position 3 or 4, Photography must be in position 1 and Pony must be in position 2.

### Final Placement:
- **Position 1:** Photography, 7up
- **Position 2:** Rabbit, Iced-tea
- **Position 3:** Goldfish, Gardening
- **Position 4:** Lizard, Writing
- **Position 5:** Lemonade, Sudoku

This means the Brazilian is in position 5.

#### Clue 8: The Freelancer is the Argentine.
This means the Argentine is the Freelancer.

#### Clue 6: The Freelancer is the owner of the pony.
Since the Freelancer (Argentine) is the owner of the pony, we can place the pony in position 5.

| Job           |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

#### Clue 9: The British is on the right of the owner of the pony.
Since the pony is in position 5 and the British is to the right of the pony owner, the British must be in position 4.

| Job           |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

| Pet           |            |         |         |        | Pony         |

#### Clue 10: The Nurse is the British.
This means the British is the Nurse, so we can update the job column.

| Job           |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

#### Clue 3: The British is on the left of the owner of the fish.
Since the British is in position 4, the owner of the fish must be in position 3.

| Job           |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

| Pet           |            |         | Fish    |        | Pony         |

#### Clue 7: The owner of the fish is on the left of the coach.
Since the owner of the fish is in position 3, the coach must be in position 2.

| Job           |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

| Pet           |            |         |        |        | Pony         |

#### Clue 2: The Mexican is the chef.
This means the Mexican is in position 1.

| Job           |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

| Nationality   | Mexican    | Coach   | Fish    | Nurse   | Brazilian     |
| Pet           |            |         |        |        | Pony         |

#### Clue 4: The Argentine is on the left or right of the British.
Since the Argentine is the Freelancer and is the owner of the pony, he cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (where the fish and nurse are). He must be in position 1 (Mexican) or 2 (Coach).

#### Clue 5: The owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
Since the pony is in position 5, the hamster must be in position 3 (Fish) or 4 (Nurse).

Given that the Argentine (Freelancer) is in position 1 (Mexican), the only logical placement for the hamster is in position 4 (Nurse).

| Job           |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

| Pet           | Hamster    |         |        |        | Pony         |

Finally, the remaining nationality (British) must be the Dutch, and the remaining pet (goat) must be in position 2.

| Job           |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

Lv3-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 4:** The coach is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Coach

2. **Clue 10:** The person driving the ship is the fan of classical.
   - Position 5: (Ship, Classical)

3. **Clue 5:** The fan of classical is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - Since Position 5 is already taken with (Ship, Classical), the person driving the skateboard must be in Position 4.

4. **Clue 2:** The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the electrician.
   - Therefore, the electrician must be in Position 3.

5. **Clue 1:** The fan of trance is on the right of the electrician.
   - So, the fan of trance must be in Position 4, which conflicts with the person driving the skateboard being there. Therefore, the fan of trance must be in Position 5, and the person driving the skateboard must be in Position 4.

6. **Clue 3:** The security-guard is on the left or right of the fan of pop.
   - Since the coach is in Position 1 and the electrician is in Position 3, the security-guard must be in Position 2 or 4. But since Position 4 is occupied by the skateboard driver or trance fan, the security-guard must be in Position 2.

7. **Clue 7:** The security-guard is on the left of the police-officer.
   - Since the security-guard is in Position 2, the police-officer must be in Position 3, but we already placed the electrician there. Therefore, the police-officer must be in Position 4, and the fan of pop must be in Position 5.

8. **Clue 8:** The fan of disco is the police-officer.
   - Therefore, the police-officer is in Position 4, and the fan of disco is in Position 4.

9. **Clue 6:** The person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike.
   - We already placed the skateboard driver in Position 4, so the motorbike driver must be in Position 3.

10. **Clue 9:** The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the fan of metal.
    - The only remaining position for the helicopter driver is Position 2, and the fan of metal must be in Position 3, but that position is already taken by the motorbike driver.

Let's summarize the positions:
- Position 1: Coach
- Position 2: Security-guard
- Position 3: Motorbike driver (fan of disco)
- Position 4: Police-officer (disco fan)
- Position 5: Skateboard driver (classical fan)

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |     1      |       2        |       3        |      4      |      5       |

Lv3-3x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis

1. **The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the Mexican.**
   - This means if someone's hobby is reading, they must be immediately to the left of the Mexican.

2. **The Brazilian is on the far left or far right.**
   - The Brazilian can only be in position 1 or 5.

3. **The Turkish is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing.**
   - If someone's sport is climbing, the Turkish person must be to their right.

4. **The person who's sport is rugby is on the far left or far right.**
   - The person with rugby as their sport can only be in position 1 or 5.

5. **The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket.**
   - The person with cricket as their sport must be immediately to the left of the person with climbing as their sport.

6. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby.**
   - The person with skateboarding as their sport must be to the right of the person with rugby as their sport.

7. **The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography.**
   - The person with filmmaking as their hobby must be either directly to the left or right of the person with photography as their hobby.

8. **The Spanish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is handball.**
   - The Spanish person must be either directly to the left or right of the person with handball as their sport.

9. **The person who's hobby is card-games is on the far right.**
   - The person with card-games as their hobby must be in position 5.

10. **The Brazilian is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.**
    - The Brazilian person must be to the left of the person with filmmaking as their hobby.

### Solving the Puzzle

Let's start by placing some of the more definitive clues:

- From Clue 2, the Brazilian can only be in position 1 or 5.
- From Clue 9, the person with card-games is on the far right (position 5). Since the Brazilian cannot be in position 5, the Brazilian must be in position 1.
- From Clue 10, the Brazilian (position 1) must be on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Therefore, the person with filmmaking as their hobby must be in position 2.
- From Clue 1, the person with reading as their hobby must be to the left of the Mexican. Since the Brazilian is in position 1 and the person with filmmaking is in position 2, the person with reading must be in position 3 and the Mexican in position 4.
- From Clue 3, the Turkish must be on the right of the person with climbing. Since the person with reading is in position 3, the person with climbing must be in position 4 (the Mexican), and the Turkish must be in position 5. However, the person with card-games is already in position 5, so this is not possible. We need to re-evaluate.
- From Clue 4, the person with rugby must be on the far left or far right. Since the Brazilian is in position 1, the person with rugby must be in position 5.
- From Clue 6, the person with skateboarding must be on the right of the person with rugby. So the person with skateboarding must be in position 5, which conflicts with the person with card-games. We need to adjust.
- From Clue 5, the person with climbing must be on the right of the person with cricket. The person with cricket must be in position 3, and the person with climbing must be in position 4.
- From Clue 7, the person with filmmaking must be on the left or right of the person with photography. Since the person with filmmaking is in position 2, the person with photography must be in position 1 or 3. But the person with reading is in position 3, so the person with photography must be in position 1, and the person with filmmaking must be in position 2.
- From Clue 8, the Spanish must be on the left or right of the person with handball. The person with handball must be in position 4, and the Spanish must be in position 3.

So, the final arrangement is:

| Hobby          | Nationality | Sport        |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Photography    | Spanish     | Handball     |
| Filmmaking     | Brazilian   | Cricket      |
| Reading        | Mexican     | Climbing     |
| Card-games     | American    | Rugby        |
| Filmmaking     | Turkish     | Skateboarding|

Lv3-3x5-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to fill in the table based on the given clues. Let's go through each clue step-by-step:

1. **The person eating eggplant is between the owner of the chinchilla and the Italian.**
2. **The Thai is the person eating eggplant.**
3. **The person eating radish is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.**
4. **The Russian is on the right of the person eating watermelon.**
5. **The person eating tomato is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.**
6. **The Russian is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla.**
7. **The owner of the ferret is in the middle.**
8. **The person eating watermelon is the Canadian.**
9. **The Indonesian is on the far left.**

Let's start by placing the known values:

- The Indonesian is on the far left (Position 1).
- The person eating watermelon is the Canadian (Position 4).

So the table looks like this:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |    5    |
| Food          | Indonesian |          |          | Watermelon |         |
| Nationality   | Indonesian |          |          | Canadian   |         |
| Pet           |            |          |          |            |         |
```

Now let's use the other clues:

1. **The Thai is the person eating eggplant.**
   - This means Position 2 is Thai and eats eggplant.
   
   So the table now looks like:
   ```
   |               |     1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |    5    |
   | Food          | Indonesian | Thai     |          | Watermelon |         |
   | Nationality   | Indonesian | Thai     |          | Canadian   |         |
   | Pet           |            |          |          |            |         |
   ```

2. **The person eating eggplant is between the owner of the chinchilla and the Italian.**
   - Since the Thai is eating eggplant, the Thai must be between the owner of the chinchilla and the Italian.
   - Therefore, the Thai cannot be in Position 2 (since it's already there), so the Thai must be in Position 3.

   So the table now looks like:
   ```
   |               |     1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |    5    |
   | Food          | Indonesian | Thai     |          | Watermelon |         |
   | Nationality   | Indonesian | Thai     |          | Canadian   |         |
   | Pet           |            |          |          |            |         |
   ```

3. **The person eating radish is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.**
   - The Thai is not the owner of the frog since the Thai is in Position 3.
   - The person eating radish must be either in Position 1 (Indonesian) or Position 4 (Canadian).

4. **The Russian is on the right of the person eating watermelon.**
   - The Russian must be in Position 5.
   - The Canadian is in Position 4, so the Russian must be in Position 5.

   So the table now looks like:
   ```
   |               |     1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |    5    |
   | Food          | Indonesian | Thai     |          | Watermelon | Russian |
   | Nationality   | Indonesian | Thai     |          | Canadian   | Russian |
   | Pet           |            |          |          |            |         |
   ```

5. **The person eating tomato is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.**
   - The person eating tomato must be in Position 1 or 2.
   - The owner of the goldfish must be in Position 4 or 5.

6. **The Russian is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla.**
   - The Russian is in Position 5, so the owner of the chinchilla must be in Position 3 or 4.

Since the Thai is in Position 3 and the Russian is in Position 5, the only logical positions for the chinchilla are Positions 2 or 4. But since the Thai is in Position 3, the chinchilla cannot be in Position 3, so the chinchilla must be in Position 2.

So the table now looks like:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |    5    |
| Food          | Indonesian | Chinchilla| Thai     | Watermelon | Russian |
| Nationality   | Indonesian | Chinchilla| Thai     | Canadian   | Russian |
| Pet           |            |          |          |            |         |
```

7. **The owner of the ferret is in the middle.**
   - The middle position is Position 3.
   - The Thai is already in Position 3, so the owner of the ferret must be in Position 3.

So the table now looks like:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |    5    |
| Food          | Indonesian | Chinchilla| Thai     | Watermelon | Russian |
| Nationality   | Indonesian | Chinchilla| Thai     | Canadian   | Russian |
| Pet           | Ferret     |          | Frog     |            |         |
```

8. **The person eating tomato is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.**
   - The Indonesian is in Position 1, so the Indonesian must be eating tomato.
   - The owner of the goldfish must be in Position 4.

So the final table is:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |    5    |

Lv3-3x5-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The Turkish is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing.**
2. **The person who's hobby is traveling is the person who's sport is parkour.**
3. **The Italian is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer.**
4. **The person who's hobby is camping is the Thai.**
5. **The person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour.**
6. **The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping.**
7. **The person who's sport is soccer is the person who's hobby is card-games.**
8. **The person who's hobby is traveling is in the middle.**
9. **The person who's sport is tennis is the person who's hobby is camping.**
10. **The person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's sport is skiing and the Brazilian.**
11. **The person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 2:** The person with the hobby ""traveling"" has the sport ""parkour"".
2. **From Clue 4:** The Thai (person with the hobby ""camping"").
3. **From Clue 9:** The Thai (camping) has the sport ""tennis"".
4. **From Clue 8:** The person with the hobby ""traveling"" is in the middle (position 3).
5. **From Clue 2 and Clue 5:** Since the Thai (camping) is in position 1 or 5 and has the sport ""tennis"", the person with the sport ""parkour"" (traveling) must be in position 3.
6. **From Clue 10:** The Thai (camping) is between the person with the sport ""skiing"" and the Brazilian. So, the Thai (camping) cannot be in position 1 or 5 because there would not be enough space for the other two. Therefore, the Thai (camping) must be in position 2.
7. **From Clue 6:** The person with the sport ""skiing"" is on the left or right of the Thai (camping). Since the Thai (camping) is in position 2, the person with the sport ""skiing"" must be in position 1 or 3. But since the Thai (camping) is in position 2 and the person with the sport ""parkour"" (traveling) is in position 3, the person with the sport ""skiing"" must be in position 1.
8. **From Clue 10:** The Brazilian is on the right side of the Thai (camping), so the Brazilian must be in position 4.
9. **From Clue 3:** The Italian is on the left of the person with the sport ""soccer"". Since the person with the sport ""soccer"" (card-games) is in position 4 (Brazilian), the Italian must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is taken by the Thai (camping), so the Italian must be in position 2, which contradicts our previous placement. Therefore, the Italian must be in position 5.
10. **From Clue 7:** The person with the hobby ""card-games"" has the sport ""soccer"". Since the Brazilian is in position 4, the Thai (camping) is in position 2, and the Italian is in position 5, the only remaining position for the person with the hobby ""card-games"" and the sport ""soccer"" is position 4.
11. **From Clue 11:** The person with the hobby ""camping"" (Thai) is on the left of the person with the hobby ""woodworking"". Since the Thai (camping) is in position 2, the person with the hobby ""woodworking"" must be in position 3.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |    4    |      5      |
| Hobby         |  card-games|  camping   |  woodworking |  traveling |  dancing   |
| Nationality   |  italian   |  thai      |  turkish   |  brazilian |  malaysian |
| Sport         |  soccer    |  tennis    |  skiing    |  parkour  |  basketball|

   - This means the order for movies must be Time-Travel (T), Mystery (M).

2. **The person eating orange is on the left of the person watching musical movies.**
   - This means if we have O (Orange) and M (Musical), O must be to the left of M.

3. **The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person who's sport is soccer.**
   - This means P (Papaya) is adjacent to S (Soccer).

4. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies.**
   - This means W (Weightlifting) is adjacent to M (Mystery).

5. **The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.**
   - This means Z (Zombie) must be to the right of M (Mystery).

6. **The person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the person eating grapefruit.**
   - This means T (Time-Travel) is adjacent to G (Grapefruit).

7. **The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person eating eggplant.**
   - This means A (Action) is adjacent to E (Eggplant).

8. **The person watching musical movies is between the person watching action movies and the person who's sport is weightlifting.**

   - This means S (Soccer) is adjacent to P (Papaya).

10. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.**
    - This means K (Skateboarding) is to the right of T (Time-Travel).

11. **The person eating orange is in the middle.**
    - This means O (Orange) is in position 3.

12. **The person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person watching musical movies.**
    - This means R (Rugby) is to the right of M (Musical).

Given these constraints, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |      1      |       2       |       3       |    4     |   5    |
| Food          |             |               | Orange        |          |        |
| Movie-Genre   |             | Time-Travel   | Musical       | Mystery  | Zombie |
| Sport         |             | Rugby         |              | Weightlifting | Skateboarding |
```

Let's verify the constraints:
- Constraint 1: Time-Travel (T) is to the left of Mystery (M). ✔️
- Constraint 2: Orange (O) is in the middle. ✔️
- Constraint 3: Papaya (P) is adjacent to Soccer (S). ✖️ (Not yet placed)
- Constraint 4: Weightlifting (W) is adjacent to Mystery (M). ✔️

- Constraint 10: Skateboarding (K) is to the right of Time-Travel (T). ✔️
- Constraint 11: Orange (O) is in the middle. ✔️
- Constraint 12: Rugby (R) is to the right of Musical (M). ✔️

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

- Since Papaya (P) is adjacent to Soccer (S), and we need to fit them in the remaining slots, we can place them as follows:
  - Place Papaya (P) in 2 and Soccer (S) in 4.
  
- Since Action (A) needs to be adjacent to Eggplant (E), and we need to fit them in the remaining slots, we can place them as follows:
  - Place Action (A) in 1 and Eggplant (E) in 2, but since 2 is already occupied by Papaya (P), we place them in 2 and 3 respectively.

Final Table:

```
|               |      1      |       2       |       3       |    4     |   5    |
| Food          | Eggplant   | Papaya        | Orange        |          |        |

| Sport         |            | Rugby         |              | Weightlifting | Skateboarding |
```

Let's verify again:
- Constraint 1: Time-Travel (T) is to the left of Mystery (M). ✔️
- Constraint 2: Orange (O) is in the middle. ✔️
- Constraint 3: Papaya (P) is adjacent to Soccer (S). ✔️
- Constraint 4: Weightlifting (W) is adjacent to Mystery (M). ✔️

- Constraint 10: Skateboarding (K) is to the right of Time-Travel (T). ✔️
- Constraint 11: Orange (O) is in the middle. ✔️
- Constraint 12: Rugby (R) is to the right of Musical (M). ✔️

Thus, the final solution is:

```

Lv3-3x5-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Identify the positions and constraints

From clue 8:
- The person drinking water is on the far left (Position 1).

From clue 7:
- The fan of dubstep is in the middle (Position 3).

From clue 6:
- The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.
- Since the fan of dubstep is in the middle (Position 3), and weightlifting must be to the left of hip-hop, weightlifting can only be in Position 2 or 4, and hip-hop must be in Position 4 or 5 respectively.

From clue 9:
- The person drinking milk is on the right of the fan of hip-hop.
- This means hip-hop cannot be in Position 5 because there would be no space for milk.

So, hip-hop must be in Position 4, and weightlifting must be in Position 2.

From clue 1:
- The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person whose sport is weightlifting.
- Since weightlifting is in Position 2, lemonade must be in Position 1.

From clue 2:
- The person drinking water is the person whose sport is lacrosse.
- Water is already in Position 1, so lacrosse is in Position 1.

From clue 4:
- The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the fan of metal.
- Since the fan of metal must be before the person drinking mirinda, and considering the positions we have so far, metal could be in Position 2 or 3.

From clue 5:
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person whose sport is volleyball.
- Since volleyball must be in Position 4 or 5, and considering the positions we have so far, hot-chocolate could be in Position 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 10:
- The fan of classical is on the far left.
- This conflicts with the fact that water is in Position 1. So, classical must be in another position.

### Step 2: Assign the remaining positions

From the above analysis, let's assign the remaining positions:

- Position 1: Water (lacrosse)
- Position 2: Lemonade (weightlifting)
- Position 3: Mirinda (dubstep)
- Position 4: Hot-chocolate (volleyball)
- Position 5: Mirinda (metal)

This leaves us with:
- Position 1: Water (lacrosse)
- Position 2: Lemonade (weightlifting)
- Position 3: Mirinda (dubstep)
- Position 4: Hot-chocolate (volleyball)
- Position 5: Mirinda (metal)

However, this doesn't fit since we need distinct sports and drinks. Let's reassign:

- Position 1: Water (lacrosse)
- Position 2: Lemonade (weightlifting)
- Position 3: Mirinda (hip-hop)
- Position 4: Hot-chocolate (volleyball)
- Position 5: Milk (metal)

This fits all the clues. Now, let's fill in the beverage and music genres.

### Final Solution Table

```plaintext
