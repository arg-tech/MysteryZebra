Lv3-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The Indian is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.**
   - Let's denote the person watching drama movies as D.
   - The Indian (I) can be either to the left or right of D.

2. **The person eating orange is on the far left or far right.**
   - Let's denote the person eating orange as O.
   - O can be in position 1 or 3.

3. **The person whose sport is skateboarding is on the far right.**
   - Let's denote the person whose sport is skateboarding as S.
   - S must be in position 3.

4. **The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the British.**
   - Let's denote the person watching comedy movies as C.
   - The British (B) must be in position 1 or 2, and C must be to the right of B.

5. **The person whose sport is tennis is the person eating orange.**
   - Let's denote the person whose sport is tennis as T.
   - T = O.

6. **The person whose sport is weightlifting is the person watching comedy movies.**
   - Let's denote the person whose sport is weightlifting as W.
   - W = C.

7. **The fan of classical is on the right of the person watching drama movies.**
   - Let's denote the fan of classical as Cl.
   - Cl must be to the right of D.

8. **The person eating cucumber is on the right of the person eating cauliflower.**
   - Let's denote the person eating cucumber as Cu and the person eating cauliflower as Ca.
   - Cu must be to the right of Ca.

9. **The fan of funk is on the right of the mechanic.**
   - Let's denote the fan of funk as Fu.
   - Fu must be to the right of M (mechanic).

10. **The musician is on the far right.**
    - The musician (Mu) must be in position 3.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the elements:

### Initial Placement:
- Since the Indian (I) is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies (D), and the person eating orange (O) is on the far left or right, we need to consider both positions for O and I.
- The person whose sport is skateboarding (S) is on the far right, so S must be in position 3.
- The person whose sport is tennis (T) is the person eating orange (O).
- The person whose sport is weightlifting (W) is the person watching comedy movies (C).
- The person watching comedy movies (C) is on the right of the British (B).
- The fan of classical (Cl) is on the right of the person watching drama movies (D).
- The person eating cucumber (Cu) is on the right of the person eating cauliflower (Ca).
- The fan of funk (Fu) is on the right of the mechanic (M).
- The musician (Mu) is on the far right, so Mu must be in position 3.

Let's place the elements step-by-step:

1. **Sport Placement:**
   - S (skateboarding) in position 3.
   - T (tennis) = O (orange) in position 1 or 3 (but since S is already in 3, O must be in 1).
   - W (weightlifting) = C (comedy) in position 2 or 3 (but since S is already in 3, C must be in 2).

2. **Nationality Placement:**
   - Since C (comedy) is in position 2 and W (weightlifting) is in position 2, the British (B) cannot be in position 2.
   - The Indian (I) can be in position 1 or 3, but since O is in position 1, I must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, B must be in position 1.

3. **Food Placement:**
   - O (orange) in position 1.
   - Cu (cucumber) is on the right of Ca (cauliflower). So, if O is in 1, then Ca must be in 1 or 2, and Cu must be in 2 or 3. Since C is in 2, Ca must be in 1 and Cu must be in 2.

4. **Music Genre and Movie Genre Placement:**
   - Fu (funk) is on the right of M (mechanic). Since M cannot be in position 3 (S is there), M must be in position 1 or 2. If M is in position 1, then Fu must be in position 2.
   - Cl (classical) is on the right of D (drama). Since D cannot be in position 3 (S is there), D must be in position 1 or 2. If D is in position 1, then Cl must be in position 2.

5. **Job Placement:**
   - Mu (musician) is in position 3.
   - M (mechanic) cannot be in position 3 (Mu is there), so M must be in position 1.
   - Fu (funk) must be in position 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Clue 10:** The videographer is on the far left.
   - **Position 1:** Videographer

2. **Clue 4:** The person drinking water is in the middle.
   - **Position 2:** Water

3. **Clue 5:** The person drinking water is between the videographer and the analyst.
   - Since the videographer is on the far left (Position 1) and the person drinking water is in the middle (Position 2), the analyst must be on the far right (Position 3).
   - **Positions:** 1: Videographer, 2: Water, 3: Analyst

4. **Clue 2:** The owner of the bird is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
   - Since the horse is owned by the person drinking juice (Clue 9), and the bird can be either to the left or right of the person drinking juice, the bird owner cannot be in Position 2 (since that is occupied by water).

5. **Clue 1:** The owner of the horse is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading.
   - The person drinking juice is the owner of the horse (Clue 9). Therefore, the person with the horse is in Position 2 (Water).
   - The person with the horse (juice drinker) must be on the left of the person with the hobby of reading.

6. **Clue 3:** The fan of disco is on the right of the person eating papaya.
   - Since the person drinking juice is in Position 2, the person eating papaya cannot be in Position 2. The fan of disco must be in Position 3 (Analyst).

7. **Clue 6:** The entrepreneur is between the fan of jazz and the person eating papaya.
   - The fan of jazz cannot be in Position 3 (Analyst) because the Analyst is the fan of disco. Therefore, the fan of jazz must be in Position 1 (Videographer) and the person eating papaya must be in Position 2 (Water).

8. **Clue 7:** The person eating apple is on the left or right of the fan of disco.
   - Since the fan of disco is in Position 3 (Analyst), the person eating apple can be in Position 1 (Videographer) or Position 2 (Water). But since the person eating papaya is in Position 2 (Water), the person eating apple must be in Position 1 (Videographer).

9. **Clue 8:** The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - The person with the hobby of reading is in Position 3 (Analyst), and the person with the hobby of baking must be in Position 2 (Water).

Now let's summarize the positions:
- Position 1: Videographer (entrepreneur, jazz fan, eating apple)
- Position 2: Water (juice drinker, horse owner, reading hobbyist)
- Position 3: Analyst (reading hobbyist, disco fan, eating papaya)

2. **Clue 11**: The Brazilian is the person driving the subway.
   - So, the Brazilian is in position 1 or 2.

   - This person must be in position 2 (the Brazilian).

10. **Clue 4**: The person drinking Juice is on the far right.
    - This person must be in position 3 (the Software Developer).

11. **Clue 5**: The person drinking Almond Milk is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
    - The person whose hobby is puzzles is in position 2 (Brazilian), so the person drinking Almond Milk must be in position 1 (the Teacher).

12. **Clue 6**: The person whose hobby is Video Games is on the left of the person driving the boat.
    - The person driving the boat is in position 3 (Software Developer), so the person whose hobby is Video Games must be in position 1 (Teacher).

  - Job: Accountant
  - Nationality: British

#### Step 2: Identify the Fan of Soul
- From clue 9: The fan of soul is the police officer.
- From clue 3: The person whose hobby is baking is the fan of soul.
  - Hobby: Baking
  - Music-Genre: Soul
  - Job: Police Officer (since the fan of soul is the police officer)
  - Nationality: British (since the police officer is British)

#### Step 3: Determine the Position of the Person Driving the Subway
- From clue 2: The American is on the left of the person driving the subway.

- From clue 8: The Italian is on the left of the person drinking water.

Since the Italian is on the left of the person drinking water (clue 8), and the American is on the left of the person driving the subway (clue 2), we can start placing these positions.

Let's assume:
- Position 1: American
- Position 2: ?

Now, let’s place the other positions:
- Position 2: Person driving the subway (Nationality: Italian)
- Position 3: Person drinking fanta (Nationality: ?)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Owner of the Turtle
From clue 4, the owner of the turtle is on the far right (position 3).

| Food          |           |           | turtle   |
| Movie-Genre   |           |           |          |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |          |
| Nationality   |           |           |          |
| Pet           |           |           | turtle   |
| Transport     |           |           |          |

#### Step 2: Determine the Position of the Rat Owner
From clue 2, the owner of the rat eats nectarine. From clue 7, the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Also, from clue 8, the person driving the airplane is on the right of the owner of the rat. Therefore, the owner of the rat cannot be in position 3 (since the turtle is there), so it must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the person driving the airplane is on the right of the owner of the rat, and the owner of the rat cannot be in position 3, the owner of the rat must be in position 1 or 2. Given that the person driving the airplane is also on the right of the owner of the rat, the owner of the rat must be in position 1, and the person driving the airplane must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Food          | nectarine |           | turtle   |

| Transport     | airplane  | jet-ski   |          |

#### Step 3: Determine the Position of the American
From clue 5, the person driving the airplane is on the left of the American. Since the person driving the airplane is in position 2, the American must be in position 3.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Food          | nectarine |           | turtle   |

| Transport     | airplane  | jet-ski   |          |

#### Step 4: Determine the Position of the Nigerian
From clue 9, the American is on the left or right of the Nigerian. Since the American is in position 3, the Nigerian must be in position 1 or 2. However, position 1 is already occupied by the owner of the rat, so the Nigerian must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Food          | nectarine |           | turtle   |

| Transport     | airplane  | jet-ski   |          |

#### Step 5: Determine the Position of the Fan of D&b
From clue 6, the fan of d&b is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 2, the fan of d&b must be in position 3.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |

| Transport     | airplane  | jet-ski   |          |

#### Step 6: Determine the Position of the Fan of Hip-Hop
From clue 1, the fan of hip-hop is the person watching action movies. Since the person watching sports movies is on the right of the person driving the airplane (clue 3), and the person driving the airplane is in position 2, the person watching sports movies must be in position 3. Therefore, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |

| Transport     | airplane  | jet-ski   |          |

#### Step 7: Determine the Remaining Positions
From clue 2, the owner of the rat eats nectarine, which is correct. From clue 7, the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Since the owner of the rat is in position 1, the person eating blueberry must be in position 2. Therefore, the person eating banana must be in position 3.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Food          | nectarine | blueberry | turtle   |

| Transport     | airplane  | jet-ski   |          |

#### Step 8: Determine the Remaining Music Genre
From clue 3, the person watching sports movies is on the right of the person driving the airplane. This is correct. The remaining music genre is hip-hop.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |

10. The person driving the scooter is the Japanese.
11. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
12. The person whose hobby is Sudoku is the German.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify the positions for the motorbike and scooter:
From clues 1 and 10, we know that the Japanese drives the scooter (clue 10) and is also on the far right (clue 1). Therefore, the Japanese is in position 3 (rightmost).

From clue 2, the German cannot be in position 3 (since the German must be to the right of the person driving the train), so the German must be in position 2.

From clue 3, the person driving the motorbike can only be in position 1 or 3. Since the Japanese is already in position 3, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Motorbike
- Position 2: German
- Position 3: Scooter (Japanese)

#### 2. Identify the German's hobby:
From clue 12, the person whose hobby is Sudoku is the German. So, the German's hobby is Sudoku.

#### 3. Identify the movie genre:
From clue 5, the person watching crime movies has a hobby of drawing. From clue 8, the German (Sudoku) is on the right of the person whose hobby is singing. This implies the person with the hobby of singing is in position 1 (Motorbike).

Since the German (Sudoku) is in position 2, the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 3 (Scooter). Thus, the person with the hobby of drawing watches crime movies.

From clue 7, the person watching mystery movies is the person whose hobby is Sudoku. So, the German watches mystery movies.

From clue 11, the person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the German (Sudoku) is in position 2, the person watching musical movies must be in position 3 (Scooter).

So, the person in position 3 (Scooter) is watching musical movies, and the person in position 2 (German) is watching mystery movies.

#### 4. Identify the nationality and pet:
From clue 6, the person eating potato is the Japanese. So, the Japanese eats potato.

From clue 4, the owner of the goat is on the far right (position 3). Since the Japanese is in position 3, the Japanese owns the goat.

From clue 9, the owner of the lizard is on the left of the person eating spinach. The person eating spinach must be in position 2 (German). So, the German owns the lizard.

The remaining person (in position 1) must own the pony since there are only three pets: goat, lizard, and pony.

#### 5. Identify the food and movie genres:
From clue 6, the person eating potato is the Japanese. So, the Japanese eats potato.

From clue 7, the person watching mystery movies is the person whose hobby is Sudoku. So, the German watches mystery movies and eats spinach.

From clue 5, the person watching crime movies has a hobby of drawing. So, the person in position 1 (Motorbike) has a hobby of drawing and eats lime (since the German eats spinach and the Japanese eats potato).

From clue 11, the person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the German owns the lizard and is in position 2, the person in position 3 (Scooter) watches musical movies and eats potato.

So, we have:
- Position 1 (Motorbike): Drawing, Lime
- Position 2 (German): Sudoku, Spinach
- Position 3 (Scooter): Musical, Potato

#### Final Table:

```
|               |    1     |    2    |     3     |
| Food          |   Lime   |  Spinach|   Potato  |
| Hobby         |  Drawing |  Sudoku |  Musical  |
