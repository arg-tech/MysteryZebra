1. **Clue 6**: The person drinking coffee is on the far right (Position 5).
   - So, Position 5 = Coffee.

2. **Clue 1**: The person drinking coffee is the owner of the pony.
   - Position 5 = Coffee, Owner of Pony.

3. **Clue 8**: The owner of the pony is on the right of the Indian.
   - Since the owner of the pony is in position 5, the Indian must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Position 3 or 4 = Indian.

4. **Clue 5**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is the Mexican.
   - Position 5 = Coffee (Mexican).

5. **Clue 10**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the goldfish.
   - Position 5 = Coffee, Owner of Goldfish.

6. **Clue 14**: The French is on the left of the owner of the goat.
   - Since the owner of the goldfish (hot-chocolate) is in position 5, the French cannot be in position 5.
   - The French must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
   - The owner of the goat must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (since the French is to the left).

7. **Clue 3**: The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 5, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 4.
   - Position 4 = Soy-milk.

8. **Clue 12**: The person drinking fanta is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - Since position 4 is soy-milk, the person drinking fanta must be in position 5 (but it's already occupied by coffee), so fanta must be in position 3.
   - Position 3 = Fanta.

9. **Clue 4**: The person drinking fanta is the person driving the van.
   - Position 3 = Fanta, Driving Van.

10. **Clue 13**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the goat.
    - Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 5, the owner of the goat must be in position 3 or 4.
    - Since position 3 is fanta, the owner of the goat must be in position 4.
    - Position 4 = Owner of Goat.

11. **Clue 11**: The French is on the left or right of the Canadian.
    - The French can only be in positions 1 or 2 since the Indian is in position 3 or 4.
    - The Canadian can only be in positions 2 or 3 since the Indian is in position 3 or 4.
    - Given that the French is on the left of the owner of the goat (position 4), the French must be in position 1.
    - The Canadian must be in position 2.
    - Position 1 = French, Position 2 = Canadian.

12. **Clue 7**: The owner of the goldfish is the person driving the scooter.
    - Position 4 = Owner of Goldfish, Driving Scooter.

13. **Clue 9**: The owner of the fish is the person driving the bike.
    - Position 3 = Fanta, Driving Van.
    - The owner of the fish must be in position 1 or 2.
    - Since position 1 is French and position 2 is Canadian, the owner of the fish must be in position 2.
    - Position 2 = Canadian, Owner of Fish.

14. **Clue 2**: The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person driving the train.
    - Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 4, the person driving the train must be in position 3 or 5.
    - Since position 3 is fanta and position 5 is coffee, the person driving the train must be in position 3.
    - Position 3 = Soy-milk, Driving Train.

15. **Clue 10**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the goldfish.
    - Position 5 = Coffee, Owner of Goldfish.

16. **Clue 11**: The French is on the left or right of the Canadian.

Lv3-4x5-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the table with the given clues. Let's break down each clue and place the information step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
1. The person eating eggplant is in the middle (position 3).

#### Clue 2:
2. The person eating artichoke is on the right of the person eating eggplant.
   - Therefore, the person eating artichoke must be in position 4.

#### Clue 3:
3. The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person driving the trike.
   - We will keep this in mind but need more context to place it.

#### Clue 4:
4. The person driving the subway is between the person watching family movies and the person watching zombie movies.
   - This means the person driving the subway is in position 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are taken by eggplant and artichoke respectively).
   - Therefore, the person watching family movies is in position 2, and the person watching zombie movies is in position 4 (but we already know that is artichoke).

#### Clue 5:
5. The person eating radish is on the far right.
   - Therefore, the person eating radish is in position 5.

#### Clue 6:
6. The person eating radish is the person driving the trike.
   - Therefore, the trike is in position 5.

#### Clue 7:
7. The German is between the person driving the skateboard and the Egyptian.
   - Since the German is between them, they cannot be in adjacent positions.

#### Clue 8:
8. The German is on the left or right of the Egyptian.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

#### Clue 9:
9. The Dutch is on the far right.
   - But from Clue 5, the far right is occupied by the person eating radish (German).

#### Clue 10:
10. The person watching crime movies is between the person driving the scooter and the Malaysian.
   - The scooter and Malaysian can't be in positions 1 and 2 because the person watching crime movies is in position 2.

#### Clue 11:
11. The German is on the left or right of the Egyptian.
   - Consistent with Clue 8.

#### Clue 12:
12. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far right.
   - But from Clue 5, the far right is occupied by the person eating radish (German).

#### Clue 13:
13. The person eating lettuce is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - Since the skateboard driver is not in position 5 (trike), and the German is not in position 5, the skateboard could be in position 2 or 4.

#### Clue 14:
14. The person watching zombie movies is the person eating artichoke.
   - Already known from Clue 2.

#### Clue 15:
15. The person eating lettuce is on the right of the Argentine.
   - The Argentine cannot be in position 5, so the lettuce-eater must be in position 4 (artichoke) or 5 (radish).

### Final Placement:

Let's summarize and fill in the table:

1. **Food**
   - Position 1: Cabbage (no restrictions)
   - Position 2: Lettuce (left of Argentine)

From Clue 3 and Clue 4:
- Blues is at position 5.
- Reggae is at position 4.

From Clue 1:
- Water-polo is at position 5 and it's watching superhero movies.

From Clue 7:
- Documentary movies are at position 3 (the middle).

From Clue 13:
- Handball is at position 1, which means the person watching western movies is at position 5.

From Clue 11:
- Rat is at position 4 (since the owner of the rat is the person who's sport is cricket, and cricket is at position 4).

From Clue 14:
- Superhero movies are on the left or right of the fan of d&b, so d&b must be at position 2.

From Clue 2:
- Volleyball is at position 2 or 4. Since d&b is at position 2, volleyball must be at position 4, which conflicts with the fact that the fan of reggae is at position 4. Therefore, volleyball must be at position 2.

From Clue 6:
- Rabbit is at position 1, and the fan of house is at position 2, so the person watching musical movies is at position 3 (documentary movies).

From Clue 8:
- The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the person watching musical movies, so the owner of the rabbit is at position 1.

From Clue 9:
- Handball is at position 1, and the person watching martial-arts movies is at position 2.

From Clue 12:
- The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the rabbit is at position 1, the owner of the hedgehog must be at position 5 (right of the owner of the mouse), and the owner of the mouse is at position 4.

From Clue 5:
- The owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right, so the owner of the hedgehog is at position 1 or 5. Since the owner of the rabbit is at position 1, the owner of the hedgehog is at position 5.

Lv3-4x5-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Step 1: Analyze and Organize Clues

1. **Clue 2**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right.
2. **Clue 3**: The person driving the ship is on the far left or far right.
3. **Clue 6**: The architect is the person driving the subway.
4. **Clue 9**: The architect is on the left of the person drinking milk.
5. **Clue 10**: The person drinking water is the architect.
6. **Clue 5**: The person eating blueberry is the person drinking hot-chocolate.

From Clues 2, 3, 6, and 9:
- The architect (driving the subway) must be on the far left or far right.
- Since the architect is also drinking water (Clue 10), they must be on the far left.
- Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate (Clue 5) must be on the far right.

### Step 2: Update the Table

|             |     1     |     2     |      3      |    4    |       5       |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Beverage    |           |           |             |         |               |
| Food        |           |           |             |         |               |
| Job         |           |           |             |         |               |
| Transport   | Bike      |           |             |         | Subway        |

### Step 3: Continue with Clues

7. **Clue 7**: The person eating onion is the person drinking coffee.
8. **Clue 11**: The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.
9. **Clue 12**: The analyst is on the left of the person driving the ship.
10. **Clue 13**: The person driving the car is on the left of the analyst.

From Clue 12:
- The analyst is to the left of the person driving the ship.

From Clue 13:
- The person driving the car is on the left of the analyst.

Since the analyst cannot be in position 5 (as there is a person driving the ship in that position), and the person driving the ship is either in position 1 or 5 (Clue 3):
- If the person driving the ship is in position 1, then the analyst must be in position 2.
- If the person driving the ship is in position 5, then the analyst must be in position 4.

From Clue 11:
- The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.

Since the person drinking coffee is eating onion (Clue 7), the person driving the car must be in position 2 or 4.

### Step 4: Further Analysis

14. **Clue 14**: The person driving the bike is the scientist.

So, the scientist is driving the bike and eating pomegranate (Clue 14).

### Step 5: Final Placement

From Clue 1:
- The person driving the bike (scientist) is on the left of the person eating spinach.
- Therefore, the person eating spinach must be in position 3 or 4.

Since the person driving the ship is in position 1 or 5, and the person drinking milk is to the right of the architect (Clue 9):
- If the person driving the ship is in position 1, then the person drinking milk must be in position 4.
- If the person driving the ship is in position 5, then the person drinking milk must be in position 4 as well.

#### Step 2: Placing the Fan of Classical on the Far Left
- The fan of classical must be in position 1.

|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5    |

#### Step 3: Placing the Owner of the Chinchilla
- The owner of the chinchilla must be on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
- Also, the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the Colombian.
- Since the Russian is in the middle (position 3), the chinchilla owner cannot be in position 3.

Let's assume the chinchilla owner is in position 1 (left) and the rabbit owner is in position 5 (right).

|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5    |

#### Step 4: Placing the German
- The German is on the left or right of the fan of classical.
- Since the fan of classical is in position 1, the German can only be in position 2.

|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5    |

| Pet           | chinchilla|            |         |           | rabbit  |

#### Step 5: Placing the Person Watching Superhero Movies
- The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the fan of blues.
- The person watching superhero movies must be in position 1 or 2 since the fan of blues cannot be in position 1.

Since the German is in position 2, the superhero fan must be in position 1.

|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5    |

| Pet           | chinchilla|            |         |           | rabbit  |

#### Step 6: Placing the Fan of Blues
- The fan of blues must be on the right of the superhero fan.
- Therefore, the fan of blues is in position 2.

|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5    |

#### Step 7: Placing the Person Watching Satire Movies
- The person watching satire movies is in the middle (position 3).
- Therefore, the person watching satire movies is in position 3.

|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5    |

| Pet           | chinchilla|            |         |           | rabbit  |

#### Step 8: Placing the Fan of Country
- The fan of country is between the Italian and the fan of ambient.

Lv3-4x5-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information in the correct order. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person drinking tea is the Chinese.
2. **Clue 5**: The Dutch is the person who's hobby is skydiving.
3. **Clue 10**: The American is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
4. **Clue 11**: The Chinese is the person who's sport is tennis.
5. **Clue 3**: The person drinking tea is on the left of the American.
6. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far right.
7. **Clue 12**: The Japanese is between the American and the person drinking soy-milk.
8. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography.
9. **Clue 13**: The person who's sport is soccer is in the middle.

From Clue 4, we know:
- Chinese drinks tea.

From Clue 5, we know:
- Dutch likes skydiving.

From Clue 10, we know:
- American is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.

From Clue 11, we know:
- Chinese (who drinks tea) plays tennis.

From Clue 12, we know:
- Japanese is between the American and the person drinking soy-milk.

From Clue 7, we know:
- Board-games is on the far right.

From Clue 13, we know:
- Soccer is in the middle.

Now let's place these pieces of information:

- The Chinese (drinks tea, plays tennis) must be in one of the first two positions because they are on the left of the American.
- The American must be on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
- The Japanese must be between the American and the person drinking soy-milk.
- The Dutch likes skydiving, so they must be somewhere in the sequence.
- Board-games is on the far right, so the last position is for board-games.
- Soccer is in the middle, so it must be in the third position.

Given that Chinese is the first or second and is on the left of the American, and the American is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking, the American cannot be in the first or second position. Therefore, the American must be in the fourth position, and the Chinese must be in the first position.

Let's fill in the known positions:
```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis)
2. ? (hobby)
3. ? (soccer)
4. American (hobby)
5. ? (board-games)
```

Since the Dutch likes skydiving, they can't be in the first or fifth position. They must be in the second or fourth position. But since the American is in the fourth position, the Dutch must be in the second position.

```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis)
2. Dutch (skydiving)
3. ? (soccer)
4. American (hobby)
5. ? (board-games)
```

The Japanese must be between the American and the person drinking soy-milk. Since the American is in the fourth position, the Japanese must be in the third position.

```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis)
2. Dutch (skydiving)
3. Japanese (hobby, soy-milk)
4. American (hobby)
5. ? (board-games)
```

Since the Chinese is on the left of the American, the Chinese must have a hobby that is not board-games. The only remaining hobby for the Chinese is photography.

```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis, photography)
2. Dutch (skydiving)
3. Japanese (hobby, soy-milk)
4. American (hobby)
5. ? (board-games)
```

The American must have a hobby that is not photography, skydiving, or board-games. The only remaining hobby is cooking.

```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis, photography)
2. Dutch (skydiving)
3. Japanese (cooking, soy-milk)
4. American (hiking)
5. ? (board-games)
```

The person drinking soy-milk must be either the first or the last. Since the Chinese already drinks tea, the Japanese must drink soy-milk.

```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis, photography)
2. Dutch (skydiving)
3. Japanese (cooking, soy-milk)
4. American (hiking)
5. ? (board-games)
```

The only sport left for the first position is rowing. The person drinking fanta must be in the first or last position, but since rowing is in the first position, fanta must be in the last position.

```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis, photography)
2. Dutch (skydiving)
3. Japanese (cooking, soy-milk)
4. American (hiking)
5. ? (board-games, fanta)
```

The only sport left for the fifth position is board-games.

```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis, photography)
2. Dutch (skydiving)
3. Japanese (cooking, soy-milk)
4. American (hiking)
5. American (board-games, fanta)
```

Finally, the person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since photography is in the first position, the person with cricket must be in the fifth position.

```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis, photography)
2. Dutch (skydiving)
3. Japanese (cooking, soy-milk)
4. American (hiking)
5. American (board-games, fanta, cricket)
```

Thus, the final arrangement is:
```
1. Chinese (tea, tennis, photography)
2. Dutch (skydiving)
3. Japanese (cooking, soy-milk)
4. American (hiking)
5. American (board-games, fanta, cricket)
```

The final solution table is:

| Beverage      | Chinese (tea) |         | Japanese (soy-milk) | American (fanta) | American (board-games, cricket) |
