Lv3-1x3-1	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step.

We have three positions (1, 2, and 3) and three music genres: rock, soul, and trance. We need to place these genres in the table based on the given clues:

1. The fan of trance is on the far left or far right.
2. The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of trance.

Let's denote:
- Position 1 as Left
- Position 2 as Middle
- Position 3 as Right

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The fan of trance is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the fan of trance can be either in position 1 or position 3.

2. **The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of trance.**
   - If the fan of trance is in position 1, then the fan of soul must be in position 1 (which is not possible since only one person can occupy each position) or position 2.
   - If the fan of trance is in position 3, then the fan of soul must be in position 2.

Given these constraints, let's test the possibilities:

#### Case 1: Trance is in position 1
- If trance is in position 1, then soul must be in position 2.
- This leaves rock for position 3.

So, we get:
- Position 1: Trance
- Position 2: Soul
- Position 3: Rock

This satisfies both clues:
- Trance is on the far left.
- Soul is on the left of Trance.

#### Case 2: Trance is in position 3
- If trance is in position 3, then soul must be in position 2.
- This leaves rock for position 1.

So, we get:
- Position 1: Rock
- Position 2: Soul
- Position 3: Trance

This also satisfies both clues:
- Trance is on the far right.
- Soul is on the left of Trance.

However, we need to check if both cases are valid. Since both cases satisfy the conditions, we should choose the most logical one. Given that the problem does not specify which side is ""far,"" we can conclude that either arrangement is correct based on the provided information.

For clarity and consistency, let's present the most straightforward solution:

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |  1   |  2   |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | Rock | Soul | Trance |

Lv3-1x3-2	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given clues and determine the correct arrangement:

1. The owner of the horse is on the far left or far right.
2. The owner of the snake is in the middle.
3. The owner of the snake is on the right of the owner of the hamster.

From clue 2, we know the snake must be in position 2 (the middle).

From clue 3, since the snake is in position 2, the hamster must be in position 1 (the far left) because the snake is on the right of the hamster.

This leaves position 3 for the horse, which fits with clue 1 as the horse can be on the far right.

So, the arrangement is:
- Position 1: Hamster
- Position 2: Snake
- Position 3: Horse

Here is the final solution table:

```
|       |    1    |   2   |   3   |
| Pet   | Hamster | Snake | Horse |

Lv3-1x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the tram is on the far left or far right.
2. The person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the taxi.

### Analysis:

- **Clue 1:** The person driving the tram must be either in position 1 (far left) or position 3 (far right).

- **Clue 2:** The person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the taxi. This means if the tram is in position 1, the taxi must be in position 2. If the tram is in position 3, the taxi must be in position 2 or 1 (but since the tram cannot be in position 1 if the taxi is also there, it must be in position 2).

Let's consider both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Tram is in Position 1
- Tram is in position 1.
- Taxi must be in position 2 (since the tram is on the right of the taxi).
- Therefore, the remaining position (position 3) must be occupied by the train.

This arrangement satisfies both clues.

#### Scenario 2: Tram is in Position 3
- Tram is in position 3.
- Taxi must be in position 2 (since the tram is on the right of the taxi).
- Therefore, the remaining position (position 1) must be occupied by the train.

However, this scenario contradicts Clue 1 because the tram cannot be in position 3 and still be on the far right. Hence, this scenario is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The only valid arrangement is:
- Tram in position 1
- Taxi in position 2
- Train in position 3

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Transport   | Tram  | Taxi | Train|

Lv3-1x3-4	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left.
2. The person who's hobby is writing is on the far left or far right.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the person with the hobby of dancing is on the far left (position 1), the person in position 1 must be the dancer.
- This leaves positions 2 and 3 for the other two hobbies, which are writing and sudoku.

Now, let's consider the second clue:
- The person with the hobby of writing is either on the far left (position 1) or the far right (position 3).

Since position 1 is already occupied by the dancer, the person with the hobby of writing must be in position 3.

This leaves position 2 for the person with the hobby of sudoku.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Dancing
- Position 2: Sudoku
- Position 3: Writing

Here is the final solution table:

```
|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |
| Hobby   |  Dancing| Sudoku |  Writing|

### Clues:
1. The fan of techno is on the far right.
2. The fan of classical is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of techno is on the far right.
   - This means that the person in column 3 prefers techno.

2. **Clue 2:** The fan of classical is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the fan of techno is already on the far right (column 3), the fan of classical must be on the far left (column 1).

3. **Determine the remaining genre for column 2:**
   - We have three genres: classical, folk, and techno.
   - Column 1 is classical.
   - Column 3 is techno.
   - Therefore, the only remaining genre for column 2 is folk.

### Final Table:

Lv3-1x3-6	"Based on the given conditions, let's analyze the puzzle step-by-step:

1. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies.
2. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
3. The person watching documentary movies is in the middle.

From condition 3, we know that the person watching documentary movies must be in position 2 (the middle position).

From condition 2, since the person watching documentary movies is in position 2 and the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of this person, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 3.

Therefore, the only remaining position for the person watching adventure movies is position 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Adventure
- Position 2: Documentary
- Position 3: Martial-Arts

Here is the final solution table:

Lv3-1x3-7	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given conditions and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

1. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
2. The person drinking coffee is on the far left or far right.

Given these conditions, we can deduce the positions of the people based on their favorite beverages.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Condition 2**: The person drinking coffee must be either in position 1 (far left) or position 3 (far right).
- **Condition 1**: If the person in position 1 is drinking coffee, then the person in position 2 cannot be drinking coffee because it would violate the condition that the coffee drinker is on the left of the hot-chocolate drinker. Therefore, if the coffee drinker is in position 1, the hot-chocolate drinker must be in position 3.

Let's explore both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Coffee drinker is in position 1
- Position 1: Coffee
- Position 2: Tea (since the coffee drinker cannot be in position 2)
- Position 3: Hot-chocolate

This scenario satisfies both conditions:
- Condition 1: The person drinking coffee (position 1) is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate (position 3).
- Condition 2: The coffee drinker is in the far left (position 1).

#### Scenario 2: Coffee drinker is in position 3
- Position 1: Tea (since the coffee drinker cannot be in position 1)
- Position 2: Hot-chocolate (since the coffee drinker must be to the left of the hot-chocolate drinker)
- Position 3: Coffee

This scenario also satisfies both conditions:
- Condition 1: The person drinking coffee (position 3) is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate (position 2).
- Condition 2: The coffee drinker is in the far right (position 3).

Since both scenarios satisfy the conditions, we need to choose one of them. Typically, puzzles like this have a unique solution, but here, both solutions fit. For clarity, let's present the first scenario as the primary solution.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |   1    |       2       |  3  |
| Beverage   | Coffee |       Tea     | Hot-chocolate |

Lv3-1x3-8	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

Given:
- There are three different beverages: almond-milk, lemonade, and mirinda.
- The person drinking mirinda is either on the far left or far right.
- The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left.

We need to place these beverages in the positions 1, 2, and 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1 (far left):**
   - According to the puzzle, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.

2. **Positions 2 and 3:**
   - Since position 1 is occupied by almond-milk, we have two remaining positions (2 and 3) for lemonade and mirinda.
   - The person drinking mirinda can only be in position 2 or 3 because it cannot be in position 1 (as that is occupied by almond-milk).

3. **Determine the placement of mirinda:**
   - If mirinda were in position 2, then lemonade would have to be in position 3.
   - If mirinda were in position 3, then lemonade would have to be in position 2.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Mirinda in Position 2
- Position 1: Almond-milk
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 3: Lemonade

This scenario satisfies all the conditions:
- Almond-milk is in position 1.
- Mirinda is in position 2.
- Mirinda is not in position 1 (it is in position 2).

#### Scenario 2: Mirinda in Position 3
- Position 1: Almond-milk
- Position 2: Lemonade
- Position 3: Mirinda

This scenario also satisfies all the conditions:
- Almond-milk is in position 1.
- Mirinda is in position 3.
- Mirinda is not in position 1 (it is in position 3).

Since both scenarios are valid, we can choose either one. Let's use the first scenario for simplicity.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |      1      |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage   | Almond-milk | Mirinda  | Lemonade |

Lv3-1x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.

1. The manager is on the far left or far right.
2. The fisherman is on the right of the manager.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the manager must be either on the far left (position 1) or far right (position 3), and the fisherman must be to the right of the manager, the only possible positions for the manager and fisherman are:
  - Manager in position 1, Fisherman in position 3.
  - Manager in position 3, Fisherman in position 2 (but this would violate clue 2 since the fisherman cannot be to the right of the manager).

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- Manager in position 1
- Fisherman in position 3
- The remaining position (2) must be the firefighter.

So, the final solution table looks like this:

```
|       |    1    |     2     |      3      |
| Job   | Manager | Firefighter | Fisherman  |

Lv3-1x3-10	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. The Colombian is on the far left.
2. The Turkish is on the right of the Mexican.
3. The Mexican is on the left or right of the Turkish.

From clue 1, we know that the Colombian must be in position 1. So, the table looks like this:
```
|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |
| Nationality   | Colombian |         |         |
```

Now, let's use clue 2 and clue 3 together. Clue 2 states that the Turkish is on the right of the Mexican, and clue 3 states that the Mexican is on the left or right of the Turkish. This means that the only possible arrangement for positions 2 and 3 is that the Mexican is in position 2 and the Turkish is in position 3. This satisfies both clues 2 and 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
```
|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Mexican | Turkish |
```

Thus, the final solution table is:
```
|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Mexican | Turkish |
