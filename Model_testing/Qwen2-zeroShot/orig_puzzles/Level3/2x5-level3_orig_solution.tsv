Lv3-2x5-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the hobbies and modes of transport into the table based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The person who's hobby is drawing is the person driving the boat.**
   - This means the hobby ""drawing"" and the transport ""boat"" must be in the same column.

2. **The person who's hobby is filmmaking is in the middle.**
   - This means the hobby ""filmmaking"" must be in column 3.

3. **The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person driving the trike.**
   - This means the transport ""helicopter"" and ""trike"" cannot be in adjacent columns.

4. **The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person driving the trike.**
   - This means the transport ""helicopter"" must be in a column to the right of the transport ""trike"".

5. **The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person driving the van.**
   - This means the hobby ""filmmaking"" and the transport ""van"" must be in the same column.

6. **The person who's hobby is baking is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the hobby ""baking"" must be in column 1 or column 5.

7. **The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person driving the scooter.**
   - Since the person with the hobby ""drawing"" drives the boat (from clue 1), and the person with the hobby ""drawing"" is on the right of the person driving the scooter (clue 7), the scooter must be in column 1 or 2, and the boat must be in column 2 or 3. Given that the boat is driven by the person with the hobby ""drawing"" and the van is driven by the person with the hobby ""filmmaking"" (clue 5), the boat must be in column 2 and the van in column 4.

8. **The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter.**
   - This means the hobby ""hiking"" can be in column 1, 2, 4, or 5, but it must be next to the column where the helicopter is driven.

9. **The person driving the scooter is the person who's hobby is chess.**
   - This means the hobby ""chess"" and the transport ""scooter"" must be in the same column.

Let's summarize the information:
- Boat (Hobby: Drawing) -> Column 2
- Van (Hobby: Filmmaking) -> Column 4
- Scooter (Hobby: Chess) -> Column 1
- Helicopter -> Column 3 (since it must be on the right of the trike)

Now, let's fill in the remaining columns:
- Baking can only be in column 1 or 5. Since column 1 is taken by chess, baking must be in column 5.
- Hiking can only be in column 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since columns 1, 2, and 5 are taken, hiking must be in column 4 (next to the helicopter).

So, the final solution is:

```
|             |    1    |    2    |     3      |   4    |     5      |
| Hobby       | Chess  |         | Drawing    | Hiking | Baking    |
| Transport   | Scooter|         | Boat       | Helicopter | Van      |

Lv3-2x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.**
   - This means if someone has drawing as a hobby, the person to their immediate right must have cooking as a hobby.
   
2. **The Russian is the person who's hobby is baking.**
   - The Russian's hobby is baking.
   
3. **The person who's hobby is baking is in the middle.**
   - Since there are 5 positions, the person with baking as a hobby must be in position 3.
   
4. **The Russian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.**
   - This means the Russian could be directly to the left or right of the person who likes drawing.
   
5. **The person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left.**
   - The person with gardening as a hobby is in position 1.
   
6. **The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the Mexican.**
   - This means the Mexican is in a position to the left of the person with fishing as a hobby.
   
7. **The Chinese is on the right of the Thai.**
   - The Chinese person is to the right of the Thai person.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1: Gardening (from clue 5)**
   - H: Gardening
   - N: (Not determined yet)

2. **Position 3: Baking (from clue 2 and 3)**
   - H: Baking
   - N: (Not determined yet)

3. **Drawing and Cooking (clue 1)**
   - Since the person with drawing is on the left of the person with cooking, and the Russian is in position 3, the only possible positions for drawing and cooking are positions 1 and 2 (left side) or positions 4 and 5 (right side).
   - Given that the Russian is either to the left or right of the person with drawing, we need to consider these possibilities:
     - If the person with drawing is in position 1, the person with cooking would be in position 2.
     - If the person with drawing is in position 4, the person with cooking would be in position 5.
   - Since the Russian is in position 3, the person with drawing cannot be in position 4 or 5 because the Russian would not be to the right of the person with drawing.

4. **Russian and Drawing/Cooking (clue 4)**
   - The Russian is on the left or right of the person with drawing.
   - If the person with drawing is in position 1, the Russian can be in position 2.
   - If the person with drawing is in position 2, the Russian can be in position 3 or 4.
   - Since the Russian is in position 3, the person with drawing must be in position 2, and the person with cooking must be in position 4.

5. **Fishing and Mexican (clue 6)**
   - The Mexican is to the left of the person with fishing.
   - If the person with fishing is in position 4, the Mexican must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Since position 2 is taken by the person with drawing, the Mexican must be in position 3 and the person with fishing must be in position 4.

6. **Chinese and Thai (clue 7)**
   - The Chinese is to the right of the Thai.
   - The Thai cannot be in position 5 because the Mexican is already there.
   - Therefore, the Thai must be in position 1 and the Chinese must be in position 2.

### Final Table:

From Clue 7 and Clue 1, we can infer:
- The person drinking tea is in position 5 (far right).
- The person driving the quad-bike is in position 4 (since the person drinking tea is in position 5).

From Clue 4:
- The person driving the roller is in position 3 (since the person driving the quad-bike is in position 4 and the person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike).

From Clue 3:
- The person driving the taxi is in position 2 (since the person driving the taxi is between the person drinking mirinda and the person driving the roller, and the person driving the roller is in position 3).

From Clue 5:
- The person drinking mirinda is in position 1 (since the person driving the taxi is in position 2 and the person drinking mirinda is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the roller).

From Clue 1:
- The person drinking lemonade is in position 3 (since the person driving the roller is in position 3 and the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the roller).

From Clue 8:
- The person drinking 7up is in position 2 (since the person driving the taxi is in position 2 and the person drinking 7up is the person driving the taxi).

| Transport   | Boat    | Taxi | Roller   | Quad-bike |         |

Since the remaining beverage (juice) must be in the fourth position (as all others are placed), and the remaining transport (airplane) must be in the fourth position (as all others are placed):

|             |    1    |  2   |    3     |     4     |    5     |
|-------------|---------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Beverage    | Mirinda | 7up  | Lemonade | Juice     | Tea      |
| Transport   | Boat    | Taxi | Roller   | Airplane |         |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1: Biathlon**
   - From clue 8, the person with biathlon is in position 1.
   
2. **Position 2: Rowing**
   - From clue 7, the person with rowing is in position 2 (since they drink water).
   - From clue 1, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3 (since the person with rowing is to the right of the person drinking lemonade).
   - From clue 5, the person drinking tea must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is biathlon, and position 2 is rowing, the person drinking tea must be in position 4 or 5.

3. **Position 3: Lemonade**
   - From clue 5, the person drinking lemonade is between the person with rowing (position 2) and the person drinking tea. So, the person drinking tea must be in position 4 or 5.

4. **Position 4 and 5: Tea and the remaining sports**

Lv3-2x5-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis

1. **Singing (S) is to the left of Card-games (C)**
   - S < C

2. **Puzzles (P) is to the left or right of Subway (Su)**
   - P = Su-1 or P = Su+1

3. **Singing (S) is to the left of Subway (Su)**
   - S < Su

4. **Puzzles (P) is the person driving Roller (R)**
   - P = R

5. **Collecting (Col) is to the right of Roller (R)**
   - Col > R

6. **Jet-ski (JS) is to the left of Ship (Sh)**
   - JS < Sh

7. **Singing (S) is to the right of Reading (Re)**
   - Re < S

8. **Reading (Re) is the person driving Jet-ski (JS)**
   - Re = JS

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. From Clue 8:
   - Re = JS

2. From Clue 7 and Clue 8:
   - Re < S
   - Since Re = JS, we can write JS < S

3. From Clue 1:
   - S < C

4. Combining Clues 7 and 1:
   - JS < S < C

5. From Clue 3:
   - S < Su

6. From Clue 4:
   - P = R

7. From Clue 5:
   - Col > R

8. From Clue 6:
   - JS < Sh

Now, let's assign the positions based on these relationships:

- JS (Re) must be in position 1 because it is the leftmost.
- S must be in position 2 because it is to the right of JS and to the left of C.
- C must be in position 4 because it is to the right of S.
- P (R) must be in position 3 because it is to the right of JS and to the left of Col.
- Col must be in position 5 because it is to the right of R.

So, the positions for hobbies are:
- Position 1: Re (Reading)
- Position 2: Singing (S)
- Position 3: Puzzles (P)
- Position 4: Card-games (C)
- Position 5: Collecting (Col)

Next, let's assign the transports based on the remaining clues:

- JS (Re) is in position 1, so JS (Roller) must be in position 1.
- P (R) is in position 3, so R (Roller) must be in position 3.
- Col is in position 5, so Col (Subway) must be in position 5.
- Sh must be in position 4 because JS (Roller) is in position 1 and it is to the left of Sh.
- Su must be in position 2 because S (Singing) is in position 2 and it is to the left of Su.

So, the positions for transport are:
- Position 1: Roller (R)
- Position 2: Subway (Su)
- Position 3: Roller (R)
- Position 4: Ship (Sh)
- Position 5: Subway (Su)

However, we need to correct the transport assignments as follows:
- Position 1: Roller (R)
- Position 2: Subway (Su)
- Position 3: Roller (R)
- Position 4: Ship (Sh)
- Position 5: Subway (Su)

Since R cannot be in two positions, we correct it to:
- Position 1: Roller (R)
- Position 2: Subway (Su)
- Position 3: Ship (Sh)
- Position 4: Jet-ski (JS)
- Position 5: Subway (Su)

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|             |    1    |    2    |     3      |    4    |     5      |
| Hobby       | Reading | Singing | Puzzles    | Card-games | Collecting |
| Transport   | Roller  | Subway  | Ship       | Jet-ski   | Subway     |

   ```

5. **Clue 2:** Owner of fish is on the left or right of the owner of the bird.
   - Since the owner of the fish is in column 4, the owner of the bird must be in column 1 or 5.
   - But column 5 is occupied by the rabbit, so the owner of the bird must be in column 1.
   ```
   |               |   1    |   2    |     3      |    4     |     5     |

6. **Clue 1:** Person watching musical is on the right of the person watching comedy.
   - Since columns 1 and 5 are filled, the only possible places for comedy and musical are columns 2 and 3.
   - Since the owner of the bird is in column 1, the owner of the fish must be in column 4 (already filled with goldfish), so the only place for fish is column 2.
   - Thus, the owner of the fish is in column 2, and the owner of the bird is in column 1.
   - Therefore, the owner of the bird watches comedy, and the owner of the fish watches musical.

Lv3-2x5-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating cabbage is the dressmaker.
   - Dressmaker: Cabbage

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating corn is on the left of the person eating artichoke.
   - Corn must be to the left of Artichoke.

3. **Clue 3:** The dressmaker is on the left or right of the firefighter.
   - Since the dressmaker is eating cabbage (Clue 1), the firefighter can be either to the left or right of the dressmaker.

4. **Clue 4:** The scientist is between the person eating corn and the person eating cabbage.
   - This means the scientist is in the middle of the person eating corn and the person eating cabbage.
   - Since the dressmaker is eating cabbage, the scientist must be between the person eating corn and the dressmaker.
   - Therefore, the sequence involving these three is: Corn, Scientist, Cabbage.

5. **Clue 5:** The dressmaker is on the left or right of the scientist.
   - Since the scientist is between corn and cabbage, and the dressmaker is eating cabbage, the scientist must be to the left of the dressmaker.
   - Therefore, the sequence is: Corn, Scientist, Cabbage.

6. **Clue 6:** The dancer is on the right of the person eating apricot.
   - This means the dancer cannot be in position 1, and the apricot-eater cannot be in position 5.

7. **Clue 7:** The person eating corn is on the far left or far right.
   - Since we already have the sequence Corn, Scientist, Cabbage, and considering Clue 6, the corn-eater must be in position 1 (far left).

Now let's arrange everything based on the above deductions:

- Position 1: Corn
- Position 2: Scientist
- Position 3: Cabbage
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

Since the firefighter cannot be next to the dressmaker (Clue 3) and the scientist is in position 2, the firefighter must be in position 4.

That leaves the positions for apricot and the remaining job (dancer):

- Position 1: Corn
- Position 2: Scientist
- Position 3: Cabbage
- Position 4: Firefighter
- Position 5: ?

Considering Clue 6, the dancer must be in position 5 and the apricot-eater in position 1 (already taken by corn).

So, the only remaining job is the photographer for position 5.

Final arrangement:
- Position 1: Corn
- Position 2: Scientist
- Position 3: Cabbage
- Position 4: Firefighter
- Position 5: Photographer

Now, let's fill in the food and job table:

Lv3-2x5-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and place the information step by step.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **The fan of blues is the Canadian**.
2. **The fan of indie is on the far left**.
3. **The fan of electronic is on the right of the American**.
4. **The fan of indie is on the left of the American**.
5. **The Turkish is in the middle**.
6. **The Turkish is on the left or right of the French**.
7. **The fan of r&b is on the right of the Turkish**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From clue 2**: The fan of indie is on the far left (position 1).
   - Position 1: Indie

2. **From clue 4**: The fan of indie is on the left of the American.
   - Therefore, the American cannot be in position 1 (already occupied by indie).

3. **From clue 5**: The Turkish is in the middle (position 3).
   - Position 3: Turkish

4. **From clue 6**: The Turkish is on the left or right of the French.
   - Since Turkish is in position 3, French must be in position 2 or 4.

5. **From clue 3**: The fan of electronic is on the right of the American.
   - The American cannot be in position 5 (since there would be no space to the right).
   - The American must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

6. **From clue 7**: The fan of r&b is on the right of the Turkish.
   - Since Turkish is in position 3, r&b must be in position 4 or 5.
   - If r&b is in position 4, then the electronic fan (from clue 3) must be in position 2.
   - If r&b is in position 5, then the electronic fan must be in position 4.

7. **From clue 1**: The fan of blues is the Canadian.
   - The Canadian cannot be in position 1 (occupied by indie), 3 (Turkish), or 5 (r&b if it's in position 5).
   - Therefore, the Canadian must be in position 2 or 4.

8. **Combining clues 3 and 7**:
   - If the Canadian is in position 2, then the American must be in position 4 (since the fan of electronic is on the right of the American).
   - This means the electronic fan is in position 4, and r&b must be in position 5.

9. **Checking consistency**:
   - If the Canadian is in position 2, then the American is in position 4, and the electronic fan is in position 4.
   - The r&b fan is in position 5, which satisfies clue 7.
   - The remaining positions (1 and 3) are for indie and Turkish, respectively, which satisfies all clues.

### Final Table:

```
|               |   1    |    2     |     3      |   4    |    5     |
| Music-Genre   | Indie  | Blues    | Turkish    | R&B    | Electronic |
| Nationality   | Canadian | American | Turkish   | Polish | French   |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv3-2x5-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the owner of the dog.
2. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
3. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the owner of the dog.
4. The owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person who's hobby is baking.
5. The person who's hobby is skydiving is the owner of the rabbit.
6. The owner of the rat is on the right of the owner of the dog.
7. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
8. The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Skydiving Owner
From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving owns the rabbit. So, the rabbit is placed in one of the positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

#### Step 2: Position of Drawing and Dog
Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the owner of the dog. Clue 8 states that the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Therefore, the drawing and dog must be in adjacent positions with drawing to the left of dog.

#### Step 3: Position of Reading and Dog
Clue 3 states that the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the owner of the dog. Since the dog can only be in two positions relative to drawing (either immediately to the right or in the position after drawing), the reading must be in one of those positions as well.

#### Step 4: Position of Horse
Clue 4 states that the owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person who's hobby is baking. Since the skydiving owner has the rabbit, the horse must be between the skydiving owner and the baking owner.

#### Step 5: Position of Rat and Hedgehog
Clue 6 states that the owner of the rat is on the right of the owner of the dog. Clue 7 states that the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. This means the hedgehog cannot be in the last position, and the rabbit must be in a position where the owner of the hedgehog is to the left.

#### Step 6: Final Placement
Let's try placing the elements based on the above clues:

1. If drawing is in position 1, then the dog must be in position 2 (since it must be to the right of drawing).
2. The reading must be in position 3 or 4 (since it must be to the right of the dog or next to the dog).
3. The skydiving owner has the rabbit, so the rabbit must be in position 4 or 5.
4. The horse must be between the skydiving owner and the baking owner.
5. The rat must be to the right of the dog, so if the dog is in position 2, the rat must be in position 4 or 5.
6. The hedgehog must be to the left of the rabbit, so if the rabbit is in position 5, the hedgehog must be in position 3.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements:

- Drawing: 1
- Dog: 2
- Reading: 3 (must be to the right of the dog)
- Skydiving: 4 (owner of rabbit)
- Baking: 5 (must be to the left of the horse)
- Horse: 3 (between skydiving and baking)

This leaves the reading and horse to be placed correctly:

1. Drawing
2. Dog
3. Horse
4. Skydiving (rabbit)
5. Baking

Now, the reading must be in position 3, and the horse must be in position 2. This gives us:

1. Drawing
2. Horse
3. Reading
4. Skydiving (rabbit)
5. Baking

Finally, the owner of the rat must be in position 5, which is the only remaining position.

So, the final arrangement is:

|         |      1      |     2     |    3    |   4    |    5    |
| Hobby   |  Drawing    |  Horse    |  Reading| Skydiving (Rabbit) | Baking   |
| Pet     |             |           |         |        |         |

The owner of the rat is in position 5.
