Lv3-2x3-1	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching adventure movies is the person driving the subway.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the subway.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies.
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the subway is on the far left.

From Clue 4, we know that the person driving the subway (subway driver) must be in position 1.

Since the subway driver is in position 1 and they are watching adventure movies, the first row for position 1 must be ""adventure"".

From Clue 2, the taxi driver must be in position 2 because the taxi driver is on the right of the subway driver.

From Clue 1, the taxi driver cannot be watching adventure movies since the subway driver is already doing so. Therefore, the taxi driver can either be watching mystery movies or scientific movies.

Now let's look at Clue 3:
- The taxi driver is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies.
- If the taxi driver were to watch mystery movies, then the taxi driver would have to be in position 2 and the person watching mystery movies would have to be in position 3. This would leave the person in position 2 to watch scientific movies, which contradicts the fact that the taxi driver is in position 2.

Thus, the taxi driver must be watching scientific movies, and the person watching mystery movies must be in position 3.

Summarizing:
- Position 1: Subway driver, watching adventure movies.
- Position 2: Taxi driver, watching scientific movies.
- Position 3: Person watching mystery movies.

So the final solution table is:

```

Lv3-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and use logical deduction to solve this puzzle.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's sport is golf is on the left of the person who's sport is handball.
2. The pilot is on the left of the fisherman.
3. The person who's sport is golf is on the far left or far right.
4. The librarian is the person who's sport is ice-hockey.

### Deduction Steps:

1. **From clue 3:**
   - The person who plays golf must be either in position 1 or position 3.

2. **From clue 1:**
   - The person who plays golf is to the left of the person who plays handball.
   - Therefore, if the golfer is in position 1, the handball player must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **From clue 2:**
   - The pilot is to the left of the fisherman.
   - This means that the pilot cannot be in position 3.

4. **From clue 4:**
   - The librarian is the one who plays ice-hockey.

### Possible Positions for Golf Player:
- If the golfer is in position 1, then the handball player can be in position 2 or 3.
- If the golfer is in position 3, then the handball player must be in position 2.

### Let's consider each case:

#### Case 1: Golfer in Position 1
- Position 1: Golfer
- Position 2: Handball (from clue 1)
- Position 3: Ice-hockey (from clue 4)

This would mean:
- The librarian is in position 3 (ice-hockey).
- The pilot and fisherman need to fit into positions 2 and 3, but since the librarian is already in position 3, the only option left is:
  - Position 2: Fisherman
  - Position 3: Pilot

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Golfer (position 1) is to the left of Handball (position 2).
2. Pilot (position 2) is to the left of Fisherman (position 3).
3. Golfer is in position 1 (far left).
4. Librarian (position 3) is playing ice-hockey.

#### Case 2: Golfer in Position 3
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: Handball (from clue 1)
- Position 3: Golfer

This would mean:
- The librarian is in position 2 (ice-hockey).
- The pilot and fisherman need to fit into positions 1 and 2, but since the librarian is already in position 2, this is not possible.

### Final Solution:
The only valid solution is:
- Position 1: Pilot
- Position 2: Fisherman
- Position 3: Librarian (playing ice-hockey)

Thus, the final table is:

```
|         |   1   |     2     |     3      |
| Job     | Pilot | Fisherman | Librarian  |

Lv3-2x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Recap:
1. The fan of r&b is on the far left or far right.
2. The accountant is on the far right.
3. The paramedic is the fan of techno.
4. The fan of r&b is on the right of the fan of techno.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 2:** The accountant is on the far right.
   - This means the accountant must be in position 3.
   
2. **Clue 1 & 4:** The fan of r&b is on the far left or far right, and they must be to the right of the fan of techno.
   - Since the accountant (position 3) is not the fan of r&b (from Clue 1), the fan of r&b must be either in position 1 or 2.
   - The fan of techno is the paramedic (from Clue 3), and the fan of r&b must be to the right of the fan of techno.
   - Therefore, the fan of techno (paramedic) cannot be in position 2 because the fan of r&b would then need to be in position 3, but the accountant is already there. So, the fan of techno must be in position 1, making the fan of r&b in position 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The paramedic is the fan of techno.
   - From the above steps, we know the paramedic is in position 1 and is the fan of techno.

4. **Remaining Positions:**
   - Position 2 must be the fan of r&b.
   - Position 3 must be the accountant.

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv3-2x3-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step to determine the correct arrangement.

### Given Information:
1. The person with the hobby of video-games is on the left of the person with the hobby of fishing.
2. The person with the hobby of video-games is either on the left or right of the person with the hobby of fishing (redundant with point 1).
3. The owner of the fish is between the person with the hobby of video-games and the owner of the mouse.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Hobbies
- Video-games must be to the left of fishing.
- This means the possible order for hobbies is:
  - Video-games, _, Fishing
  - Video-games, Fishing, _
  - _, Video-games, Fishing

#### Step 2: Analyze the Pets
- The owner of the fish is between the person with the hobby of video-games and the owner of the mouse.

Given the possible orders from Step 1, let's test each one:

1. **Order: Video-games, _, Fishing**
   - The fish owner must be between the video-games and the mouse owner.
   - Possible positions for the fish owner are 2 (between Video-games and Fishing).

2. **Order: Video-games, Fishing, _**
   - The fish owner must be between the video-games and the mouse owner.
   - This is not possible because there is no space for the fish owner between Video-games and Fishing.

3. **Order: _, Video-games, Fishing**
   - The fish owner must be between the video-games and the mouse owner.
   - This is not possible because there is no space for the fish owner between Video-games and Fishing.

So, the only feasible order is:
- Video-games, _, Fishing

#### Step 3: Determine the Remaining Hobbies and Pets
- We have three hobbies: baking, fishing, video-games.
- We have three pets: fish, guinea-pig, mouse.

Since the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 1, and the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 3, the remaining hobby must be baking in position 2.

- Video-games (1)
- Baking (2)
- Fishing (3)

Now, we need to place the pets:
- The fish owner must be between the video-games and the mouse owner.
- Therefore, the fish owner must be in position 2, and the mouse owner must be in position 3.

This leaves the guinea-pig for the video-games owner.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|         |      1      |    2    |   3    |
| Hobby   | Video-games | Baking  | Fishing |
| Pet     | Guinea-pig  | Fish    | Mouse   |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|         |      1      |    2    |   3    |
| Hobby   | Video-games | Baking  | Fishing |
| Pet     | Guinea-pig  | Fish    | Mouse   |

Lv3-2x3-5	"Let's break down the given information and constraints step-by-step to solve the puzzle.

### Given Information:
1. The people prefer 3 different movie-genres: action, disaster, family.
2. The people use 3 different means of transport: ship, subway, taxi.
3. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching action movies (Constraint 1).
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the ship (Constraint 2).
5. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person watching action movies (Constraint 3).
6. The person watching action movies is between the person watching disaster movies and the person driving the taxi (Constraint 4).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Constraint 1 and Constraint 3**:
   - The person driving the taxi is on both the left and the right of the person watching action movies.
   - This implies that the person watching action movies cannot be in the middle position (position 2) because there would be no place for the person driving the taxi to be on both sides.
   - Therefore, the person watching action movies must be either in position 1 or position 3.

2. **Constraint 4**:
   - If the person watching action movies is in position 1, then the person driving the taxi must be in position 3 (since they are on the right of the person watching action movies).
   - If the person watching action movies is in position 3, then the person driving the taxi must be in position 1 (since they are on the left of the person watching action movies).
   - But this would contradict Constraint 1 and Constraint 3 since the person driving the taxi can only be on one side of the person watching action movies.

3. **Conclusion from Constraints 1 and 3**:
   - The person watching action movies must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person driving the taxi must be in position 1.

4. **Constraint 2**:
   - The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the ship.
   - Since the person driving the taxi is in position 1, the person driving the subway must be in position 2 and the person driving the ship must be in position 3.

5. **Constraint 4**:
   - The person watching action movies is between the person watching disaster movies and the person driving the taxi.
   - Since the person watching action movies is in position 3 and the person driving the taxi is in position 1, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 2.

### Final Solution:

| Movie-Genre   | Transport   |
|---------------|-------------|
| Action        | Taxi        |

Lv3-2x3-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given clues to determine the correct arrangement.

### Clues Recap:
1. The lawyer is on the left of the accountant.
2. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
3. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking.
4. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the engineer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The lawyer is on the left of the accountant.
   - This means the lawyer must be in position 1 and the accountant must be in position 2 or 3.

2. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the engineer.
   - This means the engineer cannot be in position 3 (because then there would be no space for the person with the baking hobby).

3. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This means the person with the baking hobby must be in position 1 or 2, and the person with the chess hobby must be in position 2 or 3.

4. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This means the person with the baking hobby must be in position 1 or 2, and the person with the traveling hobby can be either to the left or right of them.

### Let's Try Different Arrangements:

#### Scenario 1: Baking in Position 1
- If baking is in position 1, then:
  - The chess hobbyist must be in position 2 or 3.
  - The traveling hobbyist can be in position 2 or 3.
  - The lawyer must be in position 1 (leftmost), so the accountant must be in position 2 or 3.
  - The engineer cannot be in position 3 because the baking hobbyist is in position 1.

#### Sub-scenario 1.1: Chess in Position 2, Traveling in Position 3
- Baking in 1, Chess in 2, Traveling in 3
- Engineer must be in position 2 or 3. Since Chess is in 2, the only option for the engineer is position 3.
- This leaves the lawyer in position 1 and the accountant in position 2.

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 1: Lawyer (1) is on the left of Accountant (2).
- Clue 2: Chess (2) is on the right of Baking (1).
- Clue 3: Traveling (3) is on the right of Baking (1).
- Clue 4: Baking (1) is on the right of Engineer (3).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Lawyer
- Position 2: Accountant
- Position 3: Engineer

Lv3-2x3-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The fan of techno is on the right of the Dutch.
2. The Malaysian is on the left of the fan of funk.
3. The Malaysian is on the left or right of the fan of rock.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The fan of techno is on the right of the Dutch.
This means the Dutch cannot be in position 3 (since there would be no space to the right). So, the Dutch must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 2: The Malaysian is on the left of the fan of funk.
This means the Malaysian cannot be in position 3 (since there would be no space to the left). So, the Malaysian must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 3: The Malaysian is on the left or right of the fan of rock.
This gives us two possible positions for the Malaysian: either in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's consider the possible placements:

1. If the Malaysian is in position 1:
    - The fan of funk must be in position 2 (since the Malaysian is on the left).
    - The fan of rock can be in position 3 (since the Malaysian is on the right of the fan of rock).

2. If the Malaysian is in position 2:
    - The fan of funk can be in position 1 (since the Malaysian is on the left).
    - The fan of rock can be in position 3 (since the Malaysian is on the right of the fan of rock).

However, we need to ensure that these placements satisfy all the clues.

### Testing the Possible Arrangements:

#### Case 1: Malaysian in position 1
- Position 1: Malaysian
- Position 2: Fan of funk
- Position 3: Fan of rock

Checking Clue 1: The fan of techno must be on the right of the Dutch.
- The Dutch can only be in position 2 (since position 3 is occupied by the fan of rock and position 1 is occupied by the Malaysian).
- This means the Dutch is in position 2, and the fan of techno must be in position 3.
- This conflicts with our initial assumption since the fan of rock is already in position 3.

So, this case is invalid.

#### Case 2: Malaysian in position 2
- Position 1: Dutch
- Position 2: Malaysian
- Position 3: Fan of rock

Checking Clue 1: The fan of techno must be on the right of the Dutch.
- The fan of techno must be in position 3.
- This means the fan of funk must be in position 1 (since the Malaysian is on the left of the fan of funk).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- Position 1: Fan of funk
- Position 2: Malaysian
- Position 3: Fan of techno

Thus, the correct arrangement is:
- Position 1: Fan of funk
- Position 2: Malaysian
- Position 3: Fan of techno

And the corresponding nationalities:
- Position 1: Dutch
- Position 2: Malaysian
- Position 3: Australian (since the remaining nationality is Australian)

Lv3-2x3-8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

1. **The person drinking cola is the person eating grapes.**
2. **The person eating orange is in the middle.**
3. **The person drinking milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta.**
4. **The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person eating grapes.**

We can represent the positions as follows:
- Position 1
- Position 2 (middle)
- Position 3

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The person drinking cola is the person eating grapes.
This means that the beverage and food at position 1 must be cola and grapes respectively.

#### Clue 2: The person eating orange is in the middle.
This means that the food at position 2 must be orange.

So far, we have:
```
|            |      1      |   2    |   3    |
| Beverage   |    cola     |        |        |
| Food       |    grapes   |  orange|        |
```

#### Clue 3: The person drinking milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
Since the person drinking cola is already in position 1, the only options for positions 2 and 3 are milk and fanta. Given Clue 3, the person drinking milk must be in position 2, and the person drinking fanta must be in position 3.

#### Clue 4: The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person eating grapes.
Since the person eating grapes is in position 1, the person drinking fanta must be in position 3 (which it already is).

Now, we fill in the remaining details:
```
|            |      1      |   2    |   3    |
| Beverage   |    cola     |   milk |  fanta |
| Food       |    grapes   |  orange|  pomegranate |

| Music-Genre   |           |       |         |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3:** The nurse is on the right of the fan of techno. This means:
   - If the nurse is in position 2, then the fan of techno must be in position 1.
   - If the nurse is in position 3, then the fan of techno must be in position 1 or 2.
   
2. **Clue 1:** The fisherman is on the left or right of the nurse. This means:
   - If the nurse is in position 1, the fisherman can be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the nurse is in position 2, the fisherman can be in position 1 or 3.
   - If the nurse is in position 3, the fisherman can be in position 1 or 2.
   
3. **Clue 2:** The fan of disco is on the left of the teacher. This means:
   - If the fan of disco is in position 1, the teacher must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the fan of disco is in position 2, the teacher must be in position 3.
   - If the fan of disco is in position 3, there is no valid placement for the teacher (since it would violate Clue 2).

Given these constraints, let's test possible placements:

### Testing Possible Configurations:

**Configuration 1:**
- Nurse in position 2
- Fan of techno in position 1

This configuration satisfies Clue 3. Now we need to place the remaining jobs and music genres:

- Fisherman can be in position 1 or 3.
- Teacher must be in position 3 if the fan of disco is in position 1 (to satisfy Clue 2).

If we place the fisherman in position 1 and the teacher in position 3, the configuration looks like this:

|               |     1     |   2   |    3    |
|---------------|-----------|-------|---------|
| Job           | Fisherman | Nurse | Teacher |
| Music-Genre   | R&B       | Disco | Techno  |

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 1: The fisherman is on the left of the nurse.
- Clue 2: The fan of disco (R&B) is on the left of the teacher.
- Clue 3: The nurse is on the right of the fan of techno (Techno).

Thus, the final solution is:

Lv3-2x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and place the information into the table accordingly.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies.
2. The person watching scientific movies is on the far right.
3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching animation movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2: Scientific Movies
Since the person watching scientific movies is on the far right (position 3), we can place ""scientific"" in the third column under ""Movie-Genre"".

|               |       1       |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      |               |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |               |           | **scientific** |

#### Clue 3: Hot-Chocolate and Animation
The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching animation movies. This means that the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1, and the person watching animation movies must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Hot-Chocolate
- Position 2: Animation

|               | **hot-chocolate** | **animation** | **scientific** |
| Beverage      |                  |               |                |
| Movie-Genre   |                  |               | **scientific** |

#### Clue 1: Water and Animation
The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 2, the person drinking water must be in position 1 or 3. But since position 1 is already occupied by hot-chocolate, the person drinking water must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 3: Water

|               | **hot-chocolate** | **animation** | **water**      |
| Beverage      |                  |               |                |
| Movie-Genre   |                  |               | **scientific** |

Now, let's fill in the beverage for the remaining position (position 2).

Since the person drinking water is in position 3, and the person watching scientific movies is also in position 3, there is no contradiction. Therefore, the only beverage left for position 2 is sprite.

|               | **hot-chocolate** | **sprite**   | **water**      |
| Beverage      |                  |              |                |
| Movie-Genre   |                  |              | **scientific** |

Finally, let's fill in the movie genre for the remaining position (position 1).

Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, and the person watching animation movies is in position 2, the only movie genre left for position 1 is animation.

|               | **hot-chocolate** | **sprite**   | **water**      |
| Beverage      | **animation**     |              |                |
| Movie-Genre   |                  |              | **scientific** |

However, this contradicts our earlier placement. Let's correct it by placing animation in position 2 and sprite in position 1.

|               | **sprite**        | **animation**| **water**      |
| Beverage      | **hot-chocolate** |              |                |
| Movie-Genre   |                  |              | **scientific** |

This configuration satisfies all the given clues.
