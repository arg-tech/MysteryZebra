Lv3-7x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each attribute (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Nationality, Pet, Sport) into the correct positions based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
2. The owner of the horse is on the left of the malaysian.
3. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
4. The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
5. The person who's sport is volleyball is the person who's hobby is reading.
6. The social-worker is the person eating pineapple.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Sport and Hobby
From clue 5, we know that the person who plays volleyball has the hobby of reading. This means:
- **Sport 1:** Volleyball
- **Hobby 1:** Reading

From clue 3, the person with the hobby of reading is on the left of the person with the hobby of chess. Therefore, the second person must have the hobby of chess:
- **Hobby 2:** Chess

So, the table looks like this:
```
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |            |               |
| Food          |            |               |
| Hobby         | Reading    | Chess         |
| Job           |            |               |
| Nationality   |            |               |
| Pet           |            |               |
| Sport         | Volleyball |             |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the Sport and Hobby for the Second Person
Since the first person is playing volleyball and has the hobby of reading, the second person must be playing chess and has the hobby of chess.

#### Step 3: Determine the Pet and Nationality
From clue 2, the owner of the horse is on the left of the malaysian. This means the person with the pet horse is either in position 1 or 2, and the malaysian is on the right side of the person with the pet horse.

From clue 1, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry. This means the chinchilla and raspberry eater are adjacent.

Let's assume the chinchilla is in position 1 and the raspberry eater is in position 2 (or vice versa). We'll check both scenarios.

**Scenario 1: Chinchilla in Position 1, Raspberry Eater in Position 2**
- **Pet 1:** Chinchilla
- **Food 2:** Raspberry

**Scenario 2: Chinchilla in Position 2, Raspberry Eater in Position 1**
- **Pet 2:** Chinchilla
- **Food 1:** Raspberry

We need to check which scenario fits all the clues.

#### Step 4: Determine the Remaining Attributes
From clue 4, the person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Given our scenarios, we can determine the positions of the beverages.

**Scenario 1:**
- **Beverage 1:** Hot-Chocolate
- **Beverage 2:** Tea

**Scenario 2:**
- **Beverage 1:** Tea
- **Beverage 2:** Hot-Chocolate

From clue 6, the social-worker eats pineapple. This means:
- **Job 1:** Social-Worker
- **Food 1:** Pineapple

Since the social-worker eats pineapple, the person eating pineapple cannot be the person with the hobby of chess (who also eats pineapple). Therefore, the person with the hobby of chess must eat something else.

#### Final Table:
Based on the above analysis, let's assume Scenario 1 fits all clues:

```
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Tea        |
| Food          | Pineapple    | Raspberry   |
| Hobby         | Reading      | Chess       |

| Nationality   | Malaysian    | Brazilian   |
| Pet           | Chinchilla   | Horse      |
| Sport         | Volleyball   | Golf       |
```

### Final Solution Table:

   - Condition 3: The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
   - Condition 4: The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is dancing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Condition 1:
- If the Russian is on the right of the person with the hobby of dancing, then the person with the hobby of dancing cannot be in position 2 (since there would be no one to the right).

#### Condition 2:
- The fan of folk is on the left of the social-worker.
- This means the social-worker cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to the left).

#### Condition 3:
- The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
- This implies that the person watching horror movies cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to the left).

#### Condition 4:
- The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person with the hobby of dancing.
- Since the person with the hobby of dancing cannot be in position 2, the owner of the goat must be in position 1.

Lv3-7x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information into the table. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Beverages and Sports:**
   - The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person drinking cola.
   - The person drinking cola is the person whose sport is handball.
   
   This means:
   - Person 1 (left) drinks cola and plays handball.
   - Person 2 (right) watches sports movies.

2. **Music Genre and Nationality:**
   - The fan of pop is on the left or right of the videographer.
   - The Brazilian is the person drinking iced tea.
   
   Since the Brazilian is drinking iced tea, let's place that first:
   - Person 1 (left) drinks iced tea and is Brazilian.
   - Person 2 (right) can be either the fan of pop or the videographer.

3. **Job and Transport:**
   - The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the firefighter.
   
   This means:
   - Person 1 (left) drives the skateboard and is not the firefighter.
   - Person 2 (right) is the firefighter.

4. **Movie Genre and Job:**
   - The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person drinking cola.
   - The person drinking cola is the person who's sport is handball.
   
   We already know:
   - Person 1 (left) drinks cola and plays handball.
   - Person 2 (right) watches sports movies.

5. **Putting It All Together:**
   - Person 1 (left):
     - Drinks cola.
     - Plays handball.
     - Drives skateboard.
     - Is Brazilian.
   - Person 2 (right):
     - Watches sports movies.
     - Is firefighter.

6. **Final Assignment of Remaining Information:**
   - The fan of pop is on the left or right of the videographer.
   - Since Person 1 is Brazilian and drinks iced tea, the remaining nationality must be Russian.
   - The remaining job is videographer, so Person 2 (right) is the videographer.
   - The remaining music genre is indie, so Person 1 (left) is the fan of pop.

### Final Solution Table:

```

     | Transport     | Skateboard     |           |
     ```

2. **Clue 5:** The Pakistani is the person driving the van.
   - This gives us:
     ```

     | Transport     | Skateboard     | Van      |
     ```

3. **Clue 1:** The fan of techno is on the left of the Pakistani.
   - Since the Pakistani is in position 2, the fan of techno must be in position 1.
   - This gives us:
     ```
     |               |       1        |     2     |
     | Food          |                |           |

     | Transport     | Skateboard     | Van      |
     ```

4. **Clue 2:** The person watching western movies is on the left of the person whose sport is rowing.
   - We need to place ""Western"" and ""Rowing"" such that ""Western"" is to the left of ""Rowing"".
   - Possible positions for ""Western"" and ""Rowing"" could be (1, 2) or (2, 3). But since ""Western"" cannot be in position 2, it must be in position 1 and ""Rowing"" in position 2.
   - This gives us:
     ```
     |               |       1        |     2     |
     | Food          |                |           |

     | Transport     | Skateboard     | Van      |
     ```

5. **Clue 3:** The person eating plum is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - From Clue 4, we know the person driving the skateboard is the security-guard (position 1).
   - So, the person eating plum can be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since position 1 is already taken by the security-guard, the person eating plum must be in position 2.
   - This gives us:
     ```
     |               |       1        |     2     |
     | Food          | Plum           | Avocado   |

6. The owner of the pony is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2 and Clue 3**: The electrician is on the far right and also owns the pony. Therefore, the pony is on the far right.

   | Transport     |             | scooter       |

2. **Clue 1**: The person with rock-climbing as a hobby is on the far right (already placed).

3. **Clue 4**: The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person whose sport is climbing. Since the electrician (who drives the scooter) is on the far right, the person whose sport is climbing must be on the far left.

   | Transport     | scooter     |               |

4. **Clue 5**: The person eating carrot is on the right of the fan of funk. This means the fan of funk must be on the left of the person eating carrot.

5. **Clue 6**: The owner of the pony is on the far left or far right. We already know the pony is on the far right, so the owner of the pony (the electrician) cannot be on the far left. Thus, the owner of the pony must be on the far right, which is already correct.

6. **Determine the remaining details**:
   - The job of the person on the far left is the librarian since the electrician is on the far right.
   - The person whose hobby is video-games must be on the far left because rock-climbing is on the far right.
   - The person eating carrot must be on the far right because the fan of funk is on the left, and they need to be next to each other.
   - The fan of funk must be the person on the far left, and the person eating carrot is on the far right.
   - The music genre for the person on the far left is funk, and the person on the far right eats carrot.
   - The sport for the person on the far left is golf, and the person on the far right has climbing as their sport.
