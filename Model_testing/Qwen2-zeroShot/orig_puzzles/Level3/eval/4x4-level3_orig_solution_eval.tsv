1. **Clue 9:** The person driving the quad-bike is on the far left.
   - This means the person driving the quad-bike is in position 1.

2. **Clue 10:** The owner of the dog is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
   - This means the chinchilla and dog cannot be in positions 1 and 4 (since the chinchilla must be to the left of the dog).

3. **Clue 1:** The person eating banana is on the left or right of the person driving the ship.
   - Since the person driving the ship can only be in position 1 or 4, the person eating banana must be in position 2 or 3.

4. **Clue 2:** The person drinking milk is the person eating pineapple.
   - This means these two individuals must occupy the same row.

5. **Clue 7:** The person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating grapes.
   - This means the person eating grapes must be in position 2 or 3, and the person drinking tea must be in position 3 or 4.

6. **Clue 8:** The person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating grapes.
   - From Clue 7, if grapes are in position 2, then tea must be in position 3 or 4. If grapes are in position 3, then tea must be in position 4.

7. **Clue 4:** The person driving the tram is on the right of the person drinking milk.
   - Since the person drinking milk must be in position 2 or 3, the person driving the tram must be in position 3 or 4.

   - This means the owner of the cat must be in position 2 or 3 if grapes are in position 1 or 4.

9. **Clue 5:** The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking milk.
   - This means the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1 or 2, and the person drinking milk must be in position 2 or 3.

Now let's fill in the table based on the clues:

- **Position 1:** The person driving the quad-bike (Clue 9)
- **Position 4:** The person driving the ship (Clue 1)

Given the constraints, let's try to fit the other items:

- **Position 2:** Person eating banana (Clue 1)
- **Position 3:** Person drinking tea (Clue 7) and driving the tram (Clue 4)

Since the person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking mirinda (Clue 5), and the person drinking milk is also the person eating pineapple (Clue 2):

- **Position 2:** Person eating banana (Clue 1)
- **Position 3:** Person drinking tea (Clue 7) and driving the tram (Clue 4)
- **Position 4:** Person driving the ship (Clue 1)

Now we need to place the remaining items:

From Clue 6, the owner of the cat is in position 2 or 3, and the person eating grapes is in position 2 or 3. Given that the person eating grapes is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (Clue 6), and the person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating grapes (Clue 7), the only way to fit everything is:

- **Position 1:** Dog (owner of the dog is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla)
- **Position 2:** Chinchilla (owner of the chinchilla)
- **Position 3:** Cat (owner of the cat)
- **Position 4:** Frog (owner of the frog)

Finally, placing the beverages and foods:

- **Position 1:** Tram (Clue 4)
- **Position 2:** Banana (Clue 1)
- **Position 3:** Tea (Clue 7)
- **Position 4:** Ship (Clue 1)

- **Beverages:**

   - Since we already placed the car driver in position 1, this confirms that the car driver is in position 1.

7. **Tennis (Trike)**
   - From clue 6, the person who's sport is tennis is the person driving the trike.
   - So, the tennis player drives the trike.

8. **Soccer (Left of Rowing)**
   - From clue 1, the person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing.
   - The only positions left for soccer and rowing are 2 and 3. Since the bartender is in position 2, soccer must be in position 2 and rowing must be in position 3.

9. **Indian (Left of Turkish)**
   - From clue 9, the Indian is on the left of the Turkish.

Lv3-4x4-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues step by step to fill in the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching family movies is on the left of the person watching epic movies.**
   - This means the order for these two jobs must be: Family -> Epic.

2. **The australian is on the right of the person watching satire movies.**
   - This means the australian cannot be in the first position (satire) and must be somewhere to the right of the person watching satire.

3. **The photographer is the person watching scientific movies.**
   - The photographer's job is scientific.

4. **The person watching satire movies is on the far left.**
   - Satire is in position 1.

5. **The french is the person watching scientific movies.**
   - The french person's job is scientific.

6. **The Canadian is on the far left or far right.**
   - The Canadian is either in position 1 or 4.

7. **The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the snake.**
   - Rabbit -> Snake.

8. **The videographer is between the owner of the chinchilla and the polish.**
   - This means the videographer is in position 2, with chinchilla and polish in positions 1 and 3, or 3 and 4.

9. **The librarian is on the left or right of the owner of the snake.**
   - The librarian is either in position 1 or 3 if the snake is in position 2, or in position 3 or 4 if the snake is in position 2.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. From clue 4, Satire is in position 1.
2. From clue 1, Family is in position 2.
3. From clue 2, the australian cannot be in position 1 (satire), so they must be in position 3 or 4.
4. From clue 5, the french is in position 3 (scientific).
5. From clue 3, the photographer is in position 4 (scientific), but from clue 5, the french is already in position 3, so this is a contradiction unless the photographer is not the same as the french.
6. From clue 6, the Canadian is either in position 1 or 4. Since position 1 is satire, the Canadian must be in position 4.
7. From clue 8, the videographer is in position 2, and the chinchilla and polish are in positions 1 and 3, or 3 and 4.
8. From clue 7, the librarian is either in position 1 or 3 if the snake is in position 2, or in position 3 or 4 if the snake is in position 2. But since the snake is on the right of the rabbit, and the videographer is in position 2, the snake cannot be in position 2. So the snake must be in position 3, and the rabbit in position 2.
9. Now, the videographer is in position 2, and the chinchilla and polish are in positions 1 and 3. Since the Canadian is in position 4, the Polish must be in position 3, and the Chinchilla in position 1.
10. Finally, the librarian must be in position 4 because it fits all conditions.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |      2       |     3     |      4       |

Lv3-4x4-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 4**: The owner of the rabbit is on the far right.
   - Rabbit -> 4

2. **Clue 8**: The owner of the rabbit is the person driving the snowmobile.
   - Snowmobile -> 4

3. **Clue 10**: The person drinking Fanta is on the far right.
   - Fanta -> 4

Since the owner of the rabbit and the person drinking Fanta are both in position 4, we can deduce that:
- Rabbit -> 4
- Fanta -> 4

4. **Clue 11**: The owner of the lizard is the person eating watermelon.
   - Watermelon -> Lizard

5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the trike is between the person eating watermelon and the person eating raspberry.
   - Trike -> Between Watermelon and Raspberry
   - Given that Watermelon is at 4, Raspberry must be at 2 (since it cannot be at 4 as the trike is between them).

6. **Clue 6**: The person eating grapes is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
   - Grapes -> Right of Lizard
   - Since Lizard -> Watermelon (4), Grapes must be at 3.

7. **Clue 1**: The person eating grapes is on the left of the person driving the train.
   - Train -> Right of Grapes
   - Since Grapes -> 3, Train must be at 4, but we already have the train at 4. So, this clue confirms our previous deductions.

8. **Clue 2**: The person driving the train is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
   - Train -> 4 (confirmed)
   - Cat -> Left or Right of Train
   - Since Train is at 4, Cat must be at 1 or 2.

9. **Clue 3**: The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person eating grapes.
   - Soy-milk -> Left or Right of Grapes
   - Grapes -> 3, so Soy-milk must be at 2 or 4. But 4 is occupied by Fanta and Train, so Soy-milk -> 2.

10. **Clue 7**: The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person eating papaya.
    - Almond-milk -> Left or Right of Papaya
    - Papaya -> 1 (since Grapes is at 3 and Cat can only be at 1 or 2, and Soy-milk is at 2)

11. **Clue 9**: The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon.
    - Cat -> Left or Right of Watermelon
    - Watermelon -> 4 (rabbit)
    - Cat -> 1 (since Grapes is at 3 and Papaya is at 1)

Lv3-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Hiking** is on the left of **Gospel**.
2. **Hiking** is on the left of **Mouse**.
3. **Basketball** is on the right of **Horse**.
4. **Parkour** is on the left or right of **Mouse**.

8. **Pop** is the hobby of **Magic-Tricks**.
9. **Gospel** is on the right of **Basketball**.
10. **Baseball** is on the left or right of **Hiking**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify the positions for each activity based on the clues:
- From clue 9: Gospel is on the right of Basketball.
- From clue 5: Basketball is between Collecting and Baseball. So, the sequence must be: Collecting -> Basketball -> Baseball.
- From clue 10: Baseball is on the left or right of Hiking. Since it's between Collecting and Basketball, Baseball must be to the right of Hiking.
- From clue 3: Hiking is on the left of Mouse. Therefore, Hiking must be on the leftmost position (1) and Mouse must be to its right (2).
- From clue 2: Hiking is on the left of Gospel. Since Hiking is already in position 1, Gospel must be in position 4.
- From clue 6: Salsa is the sport of Tennis. So, Tennis must be in position 4.
- From clue 7: Mouse is between Parkour and Bird. Since Mouse is in position 2, Parkour must be in position 3 and Bird in position 1. But we already know Hiking is in position 1, so this needs adjustment.
- From clue 4: Parkour is on the left or right of Mouse. Since Mouse is in position 2, Parkour must be in position 3.
- From clue 8: Pop is the hobby of Magic-Tricks. So, Magic-Tricks must be in position 4.

### Final Arrangement:

1. **Hiking**
2. **Mouse**

Lv3-4x4-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left.
   - This means ice-hockey is in position 1.

2. **Clue 4**: The pakistani is on the far left or far right.
   - Since ice-hockey is already at position 1, the pakistani must be at position 4.

3. **Clue 10**: The person watching epic movies is on the left of the malaysian.
   - This means the malaysian cannot be at position 1, and the person watching epic movies is to the left of the malaysian.

4. **Clue 9**: The polish is the person drinking fanta.
   - The polish person drinks fanta, and since the pakistani is at position 4, the polish must be at position 1 (but we already have ice-hockey there), so the polish must be at position 4.

5. **Clue 3**: The egyptian is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - The person drinking iced-tea is not at position 4 because the polish is there. So, the person drinking iced-tea is either at position 2 or 3, and the egyptian is to their right.

6. **Clue 6**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing.
   - This means hot-chocolate is not at position 4, and the person who's sport is surfing is to their right.

7. **Clue 5**: The polish is on the left of the person watching musical movies.
   - The polish is at position 4, so the person watching musical movies is at position 3.

8. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.
   - We need to determine the positions of the sports and movie genres.

9. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person watching musical movies.
   - The person watching musical movies is at position 3, so the person watching baseball is at position 4. But the pakistani is at position 4, so the person watching baseball is not the pakistani. Thus, the person watching baseball is at position 3, and the person watching musical movies is at position 2.

10. **Clue 11**: The pakistani is the person drinking cola.
    - The pakistani is at position 4, so they drink cola.

Now let's summarize and fill in the table:

- Position 1: Ice-hockey
- Position 2: Musical movies
- Position 3: Baseball
- Position 4: Surfing

Since the polish is at position 4, they watch musical movies and drink fanta. The pakistani is at position 4, so they drink cola. The person drinking iced-tea is at position 3, and the egyptian is to their right, so the egyptian is at position 4, but that conflicts with the pakistani. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea is at position 2, and the egyptian is at position 3.

Finally, the person drinking hot-chocolate is at position 1, and the person who's sport is surfing is at position 4.

So the final table looks like this:

Lv3-4x4-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating cauliflower is the journalist.
2. **Clue 2:** The paramedic is the person eating banana.
3. **Clue 3:** The journalist is on the left or right of the person eating eggplant.
4. **Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is dancing is the person watching horror movies.
5. **Clue 5:** The person watching spy movies is between the chef and the person whose hobby is magic tricks.
6. **Clue 6:** The journalist is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
7. **Clue 7:** The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person eating banana.
8. **Clue 8:** The chef is between the person watching comedy movies and the person whose hobby is board games.
9. **Clue 9:** The person eating banana is on the left of the engineer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 1:** The journalist eats cauliflower.
2. **From Clue 2:** The paramedic eats banana.
3. **From Clue 3:** The journalist (who eats cauliflower) is on the left or right of the person who eats eggplant. This means the person who eats eggplant can be in positions 2 or 4.
4. **From Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is dancing watches horror movies.
5. **From Clue 5:** The person watching spy movies is between the chef and the person whose hobby is magic tricks.
6. **From Clue 6:** The journalist (who eats cauliflower) is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
7. **From Clue 7:** The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person eating banana.
8. **From Clue 8:** The chef is between the person watching comedy movies and the person whose hobby is board games.
9. **From Clue 9:** The person eating banana is on the left of the engineer.

### Deductions:

- Since the journalist eats cauliflower, they cannot eat banana, which is eaten by the paramedic. Therefore, the journalist must be in position 1 or 3.
- The person eating eggplant is either in position 2 or 4, and since the journalist (position 1 or 3) is on their left or right, this helps us place them.
- The person whose hobby is dancing watches horror movies, so we need to place that correctly.
- The person watching spy movies is between the chef and the person whose hobby is magic tricks.
- The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person eating banana.
- The chef is between the person watching comedy movies and the person whose hobby is board games.
- The person eating banana is on the left of the engineer.

### Final Placement:

- From Clue 6: The journalist (who eats cauliflower) is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
- From Clue 9: The person eating banana is on the left of the engineer.
- From Clue 7: The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person eating banana.
- From Clue 8: The chef is between the person watching comedy movies and the person whose hobby is board games.

Based on these constraints, let's try to fit everything in:

1. **Journalist (Cauliflower)**: Position 1 (since they are on the left of someone and not on the right of the person eating eggplant)
2. **Paramedic (Banana)**: Position 2 (since they are on the left of the engineer)
3. **Person Eating Eggplant**: Position 4 (since journalist is on the left of the person watching horror movies and not on the right of the person eating eggplant)

Now we need to place the rest:

- **Dancing (Horror)**: Since the journalist (position 1) is on the left of the person watching horror movies, the person watching horror movies must be in position 3.
- **Spy Movies**: Between the chef and the person whose hobby is magic tricks.
- **Superhero Movies**: On the left or right of the person eating banana (position 2).

Given all these, let's place the remaining details:

- **Hobby**: Dancing (position 3), Magic Tricks (position 4), Board Games (position 1), and the remaining is Board Games (position 2).
- **Job**: Chef (position 2), Engineer (position 3), Journalist (position 1), and the remaining is Paramedic (position 4).
- **Movie Genre**: Comedy (position 1), Horror (position 3), Spy (position 2), and Superhero (position 4).

11. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left or right of the writer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1 & 5:
- The owner of the pony is the person who's sport is volleyball.
- The person who's sport is volleyball is the owner of the pony.

Thus, the owner of the pony = volleyball.

#### Clue 2:
- The designer is between the owner of the dog and the owner of the pony.
- Since the owner of the pony is in position 4 (from clue 1), the designer must be in position 2, and the owner of the dog must be in position 1.

So, we have:
1. Dog
2. Designer
3. ?
4. Pony (Volleyball)

#### Clue 4:
- The owner of the fish is on the right of the owner of the pony.
- Thus, the owner of the fish is in position 3.

So, we have:
1. Dog
2. Designer
3. Fish
4. Pony (Volleyball)

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
- Therefore, the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 4.

So, we have:
1. Dog
2. Designer
3. Fish
4. Sudoku

Since the pony (volleyball) is in position 4, this confirms our placement.

#### Clue 6 & 7:
- The person who's hobby is dancing is between the person who's sport is swimming and the person who's hobby is writing.
- The person who's hobby is dancing is the person who's sport is rugby.

Thus, the person with the hobby of dancing is in position 2 (between the designer and the person with the hobby of writing).

So, we have:
1. Dog
2. Dancing (Rugby)
3. Fish
4. Sudoku (Volleyball)

#### Clue 8:
- The owner of the fish is on the right of the teacher.
- Therefore, the teacher must be in position 1.

So, we have:
1. Teacher
2. Dancing (Rugby)
3. Fish
4. Sudoku (Volleyball)

#### Clue 9:
- The writer is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
- Since the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 4, the writer can only be in position 3.

So, we have:
1. Teacher
2. Dancing (Rugby)
3. Writer
4. Sudoku (Volleyball)

#### Clue 10 & 11:
- The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
- The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left or right of the writer.

Since the writer is in position 3 and the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 4, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 1 (teacher).

So, we have:
1. Teacher
2. Dancing (Rugby)
3. Writer
4. Sudoku (Volleyball)

The remaining hobbies and sports must be assigned to the remaining people. Since the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is in position 1, the person with the hobby of writing must be in position 2 (Dancing). This leaves us with the remaining hobbies and sports for the remaining positions.

Finally, the assignments are as follows:
- Position 1: Teacher - Magic-Tricks
- Position 2: Dancing (Rugby)
- Position 3: Writer - Sudoku
- Position 4: Sudoku (Volleyball)
