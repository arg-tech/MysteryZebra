Lv3-3x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down each clue step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The fan of indie is on the right of the person driving the van.**
   - If we denote the fan of indie as I and the person driving the van as V, then V must be to the left of I.

2. **The person driving the van is between the australian and the fan of folk.**
   - If we denote the australian as A, the fan of folk as F, and the person driving the van as V, then the order must be A-V-F or F-V-A.

3. **The person driving the ship is on the far left.**
   - This means the person driving the ship is in position 1.

4. **The person driving the ship is on the left of the fan of rock.**
   - Since the person driving the ship is in position 1, the fan of rock (R) must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The argentine is on the left of the person driving the subway.**
   - If we denote the argentine as Ar and the person driving the subway as S, then Ar must be to the left of S.

6. **The mexican is on the right of the fan of indie.**
   - If we denote the mexican as M and the fan of indie as I, then I must be to the left of M.

7. **The person driving the van is on the left or right of the fan of indie.**
   - This means V can be either to the left or to the right of I.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 3, the person driving the ship is in position 1.**
   - Position 1: Ship (S)

2. **From Clue 4, the fan of rock (R) must be in position 2, 3, or 4.**

3. **From Clue 5, the argentine (Ar) is on the left of the person driving the subway (S).**
   - Since S is in position 1, Ar must be in position 2 or 3.

4. **From Clue 6, the mexican (M) is on the right of the fan of indie (I).**
   - This means I must be in position 1 or 2 (since M cannot be in position 1).

5. **From Clue 2, the person driving the van (V) is between the australian (A) and the fan of folk (F).**
   - This means A, V, and F must be in positions such that A is to the left of V and V is to the left of F.

6. **Combining Clue 1 and Clue 2, if V is to the right of I, and V is between A and F, we need to place these elements.**
   - Let's consider the possible positions:
     - If I is in position 1, then V must be in position 2 or 3.
     - If I is in position 2, then V must be in position 1 or 3.
     - If I is in position 3, then V must be in position 2 or 4.
     - If I is in position 4, then V must be in position 3.

7. **Considering all constraints together:**
   - Position 1: Ship (S)
   - Position 2: Argentine (Ar) or Fan of Rock (R)
   - Position 3: Person Driving Van (V), Fan of Folk (F), or Mexican (M)
   - Position 4: Fan of Indie (I) or Person Driving Subway (S)

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:
- The person driving the ship (S) is in position 1.
- The person driving the ship (S) is on the left of the fan of rock (R), so R must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- The argentine (Ar) is on the left of the person driving the subway (S), so Ar must be in position 2 or 3.
- The mexican (M) is on the right of the fan of indie (I).
- The fan of indie (I) is on the right of the person driving the van (V), and V is between the australian (A) and the fan of folk (F).

By trying different combinations, we find:
- Position 1: Ship (S)
- Position 2: Argentine (Ar)
- Position 3: Person Driving Van (V)
- Position 4: Fan of Indie (I)

Thus, the final arrangement should be:
- Position 1: Ship (S)
- Position 2: Argentine (Ar)
- Position 3: Person Driving Van (V)
- Position 4: Fan of Indie (I)

Now, filling in the remaining elements based on the clues:
- The fan of rock (R) must be in position 2 or 3, but since Ar is in position 2, R must be in position 4.
- The mexican (M) must be in position 3.
- The australian (A) must be in position 1.
- The person driving the subway (S) must be in position 2 (since Ar is in position 2).

Lv3-3x4-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the appropriate categories (Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre) for each person. Let's break down the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is photography is on the far left.**
   - This means the first column corresponds to the person with photography as their hobby.

2. **The person eating avocado is on the left of the person eating peach.**
   - This means if we denote the positions as 1, 2, 3, 4, then the person eating avocado must be in position 1 or 2, and the person eating peach must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the person eating corn.**
   - This means if the person eating corn is in position 3 or 4, then the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1 or 2.

4. **The person watching thriller movies is on the far left.**
   - This means the first column also corresponds to the person watching thriller movies.

5. **The person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing.**
   - Since the first column is already occupied by the person watching thriller movies, the person whose hobby is singing must be in the second, third, or fourth column.

6. **The person watching epic movies is on the right of the person eating corn.**
   - If the person eating corn is in position 3 or 4, then the person watching epic movies must be in position 4.

7. **The person eating cucumber is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.**
   - This means if the person's hobby is card-games, they must be in position 1 or 2, and the person eating cucumber must be in position 2 or 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 1 and 4:**
   - The first column is both for photography and thriller movies.
   - So, the first column is ""photography"" and ""thriller"".

2. **From Clue 2:**
   - Avocado is on the left of peach.
   - Therefore, the second column cannot be avocado, and the third or fourth column cannot be peach.

3. **From Clue 3:**
   - Superhero is on the left of corn.
   - Therefore, the person eating corn cannot be in the first column, and the superhero must be in the first or second column.

4. **From Clue 5:**
   - Thriller is on the left or right of singing.
   - Since thriller is already in the first column, singing must be in the second, third, or fourth column.

5. **From Clue 6:**
   - Epic is on the right of corn.
   - If corn is in the third or fourth column, epic must be in the fourth column.

6. **From Clue 7:**
   - Cucumber is on the right of card-games.
   - Therefore, card-games must be in the first or second column, and cucumber must be in the second or third column.

### Final Placement:

Let's start placing the elements based on these clues:

- **First Column:**
  - Photography (Clue 1)
  - Thriller (Clue 4)

- **Second Column:**
  - Since avocado is on the left of peach, and superhero is on the left of corn, let's assume:
    - Card-games (to satisfy Clue 7)
    - Cucumber (right of card-games, Clue 7)

- **Third Column:**
  - Peach (since it's on the right of avocado, Clue 2)
  - Corn (superhero must be on the left, Clue 3)

- **Fourth Column:**
  - Epic (right of corn, Clue 6)
  - Superhero (Clue 3)

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |      4      |
| Food          | avocado     | cucumber  | peach      | epic        |
| Hobby         | photography | card-games| singing    | woodworking |
| Movie-Genre   | thriller    | superhero | romance    | superhero   |
```

Note: There seems to be an inconsistency with the superhero genre being in two columns. Let's correct it:

Since the person watching superhero movies is on the left of the person eating corn (Clue 3), and the person watching epic movies is on the right of the person eating corn (Clue 6), the superhero must be in the second column, and epic in the fourth column.

### Corrected Final Table:

```
|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |      4      |
| Food          | avocado     | cucumber  | peach      | epic        |
| Hobby         | photography | card-games| singing    | woodworking |
| Movie-Genre   | thriller    | superhero | romance    | thriller    |
```

This should now be consistent with all the given clues."	{'food': ['avocado', 'cucumber', 'peach', 'epic'], 'hobby': ['photography', 'card-games', 'singing', 'woodworking'], 'movie-genre': ['thriller', 'superhero', 'romance', 'thriller']}	True	6	False
Lv3-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The Dutch is on the far right.
2. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the Malaysian.
3. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the British.
4. The person drinking almond milk is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
5. The Malaysian is on the far left or far right.
6. The person drinking soy milk is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball.
7. The person drinking almond milk is on the far left.
8. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person drinking Fanta.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From clue 7:**
   - Almond milk is on the far left (position 1).

2. **From clue 1:**
   - The Dutch is on the far right (position 4).

3. **From clue 5:**
   - The Malaysian is either on the far left (position 1) or far right (position 4).
   - Since position 1 is already taken by almond milk, the Malaysian must be on position 4 (the Dutch).

4. **From clue 3:**
   - The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the British.
   - Since the Dutch (Malaysian) is on position 4, the British cannot be on position 4.
   - The British can only be on positions 2 or 3.

5. **From clue 4:**
   - The person drinking almond milk is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
   - This confirms that the person drinking almond milk (position 1) is to the left of the person with sailing as their sport.

6. **From clue 2:**
   - The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the Malaysian.
   - Since the Malaysian is on position 4, the person drinking coffee can be on positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - But since position 1 is taken by almond milk, the person drinking coffee can be on positions 2 or 3.

7. **From clue 6:**
   - The person drinking soy milk is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball.
   - This means the person with baseball as their sport must be on a position to the left of the person drinking soy milk.

8. **From clue 8:**
   - The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person drinking Fanta.
   - This means the person drinking Fanta must be on a position to the left of the person with cycling as their sport.

### Arranging the positions:

- Position 1: Almond milk (from clue 7 and 7)
- Position 4: Dutch (from clue 1 and 5)

Now we need to place the remaining elements (coffee, British, soy milk, baseball, cycling, sailing):

- Since the British can only be on positions 2 or 3 (clue 3), let's try placing them in position 2 for now.
- If the British is on position 2, then the person with baseball as their sport must be on a position to the left of the person drinking soy milk (clue 6).

Let's test with British in position 2:

- Position 2: British
- Position 3: Sport (baseball or cycling)
- Position 3 cannot be cycling because it would violate clue 8 (cycling is to the right of Fanta). So, position 3 must be baseball.
- Position 3: Baseball
- Position 3 is also to the left of the person drinking soy milk (clue 6), so the person drinking soy milk must be in position 4 (Dutch).

This leaves position 2 for the person drinking coffee, which fits all conditions.

So, the arrangement is:

- Position 1: Almond milk (Malaysian)
- Position 2: Coffee (British)
- Position 3: Baseball (Malaysian)
- Position 4: Soy milk (Dutch)

### Final Solution Table:

- Position 1: Kiwi
- Position 2: Lizard
- Position 4: Pineapple
- Position 4: Dog (owner)

Lv3-3x4-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Summary:
1. The person eating eggplant is on the far right.
2. The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi.
3. The lawyer is the person watching action movies.
4. The architect is between the person eating mango and the person eating kiwi.
5. The lawyer is on the right of the librarian.
6. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person eating raspberry.
7. The person eating mango is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
8. The person eating mango is the person watching romance movies.
9. The person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions of the foods.
- From clue 1, the person eating eggplant is in position 4.
- From clue 9, the person eating kiwi is either to the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
- From clue 7, the person eating mango is either to the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
- From clue 7 and clue 9, we can infer that the person eating raspberry cannot be in position 4 (eggplant), and the person eating mango cannot be in position 4 (eggplant).
- From clue 6, the person eating raspberry must be in a position where the person watching drama movies is to their right.

Given these constraints, let's place the foods:
- Eggplant (E) is in position 4.
- Kiwi (K) and Raspberry (R) are adjacent.
- Mango (M) is also adjacent to either K or R but not in position 4.

#### Step 2: Identify the positions of the jobs.
- From clue 3, the lawyer (L) is the person watching action movies (A).
- From clue 4, the architect (Arch) is between the person eating mango and the person eating kiwi.
- From clue 5, the lawyer (L) is on the right of the librarian (Lib).

Given these constraints, let's place the jobs:
- L is in position 4 (action movies, which means E is in position 4).
- Arch is between K and M.
- Lib is to the left of L.

#### Step 3: Identify the movie genres.
- From clue 8, the person eating mango (M) is the person watching romance movies (Rom).
- From clue 6, the person eating raspberry (R) is the person watching drama movies (Drama).

Given these constraints, let's place the movie genres:
- M is in position 3 (Romance).
- R is in position 2 (Drama).

#### Final Placement:
- Position 1: Kiwi (K)
- Position 2: Raspberry (R)
- Position 3: Mango (M) (Romance)
- Position 4: Eggplant (E)

Now, let's place the jobs based on the remaining constraints:
- Since L is in position 4, and Lib is to the left of L, Lib is in position 3.
- Arch is between K and M, so Arch is in position 2.

Final placements:
- Position 1: Kiwi (K), Job: Librarian (Lib)
- Position 2: Raspberry (R), Job: Architect (Arch)
- Position 3: Mango (M), Job: Lawyer (L)
- Position 4: Eggplant (E), Job: (unassigned, but we know it's not a job from the list given)

Lv3-3x4-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person who's sport is biathlon is the coach.**
   - This means the coach's sport is biathlon.
   - Let's denote this as: **Coach: Biathlon**

2. **The person who's sport is golf is the fan of rock.**
   - This means the person who likes rock is the one who plays golf.
   - Let's denote this as: **Rock: Golf**

3. **The coach is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.**
   - Since the coach is biathlon and he is on the left of the person who plays baseball, we can place:
   - **Biathlon (Coach): 1st position, Baseball: 2nd position**

4. **The fan of indie is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf.**
   - Since the person who plays golf is the fan of rock, the fan of indie could be either to the left or right of the person who plays golf.
   - Possible positions for indie: 1st or 2nd if golf is 2nd; 3rd or 4th if golf is 1st.

5. **The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon.**
   - Since the person who plays biathlon is the coach, the fan of reggae could be either to the left or right of the coach.
   - Possible positions for reggae: 2nd or 3rd if coach is 1st; 1st or 2nd if coach is 2nd.

6. **The entrepreneur is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing.**
   - The person who plays rowing cannot be in the first position because the entrepreneur must be to the left of them.
   - Possible positions for rowing: 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

7. **The doctor is on the right of the fan of funk.**
   - The doctor cannot be in the first position, so the fan of funk must be to the left of the doctor.
   - Possible positions for funk: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd; doctor: 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

8. **The doctor is on the left of the fan of rock.**
   - Since the fan of rock is the person who plays golf, and the doctor is on the left of this person, the doctor must be in a position before the person who plays golf.
   - Possible positions for doctor: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd; fan of rock (golf) must be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

### Determining the Final Positions:

- From points 1 and 2, we know:
  - Coach: Biathlon (1st)
  - Rock: Golf (2nd)

- From point 3, since the coach is in the 1st position, the person with baseball must be in the 2nd position.
  - Baseball: 2nd

- From point 4, since the fan of rock is in the 2nd position, the fan of indie could be in the 1st or 3rd position.
  - If indie is 1st, then reggae must be 3rd (since reggae is on the left or right of biathlon).

- From point 5, since the coach is in the 1st position, reggae could be 2nd or 3rd.
  - Given that baseball is 2nd, reggae must be 3rd.

- From point 6, the entrepreneur must be to the left of the person who plays rowing.
  - If reggae is 3rd, the only remaining position for rowing is 4th.
  - Entrepreneur: 3rd

- From point 7 and 8, the doctor must be on the right of the fan of funk and on the left of the fan of rock.
  - Since rock is 2nd, the fan of funk must be 1st, and the doctor must be 2nd (which conflicts with rock being 2nd). Therefore, the fan of funk must be 3rd, and the doctor must be 4th.
  - Fan of Funk: 3rd
  - Doctor: 4th

9. The American is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
10. The dancer is on the left or right of the doctor.
11. The dancer is the Japanese.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11**: The dancer is the Japanese.
   - This means the Japanese person is also the dancer.

2. **Clue 4**: The doctor is on the right of the Japanese.
   - Since the Japanese is the dancer, the doctor must be on the right of the dancer.
   - So, the Japanese (dancer) is in position 1 or 2, and the doctor is in position 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 8**: The Japanese is on the left or right of the videographer.
   - Since the Japanese is in position 1 or 2, the videographer must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the Japanese is in position 1, the videographer can only be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the Japanese is in position 2, the videographer can only be in position 4.

4. **Clue 5**: The Japanese is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
   - This means the person with the hobby of gardening must be in a position to the right of the Japanese.
   - Given the Japanese is the dancer and is in position 1 or 2, the gardening person must be in position 3 or 4.

5. **Clue 9**: The American is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
   - The American cannot be in position 1 because there is no one to the left of the American.
   - Therefore, the gardening person must be in position 3, and the American in position 4.

6. **Clue 7**: The doctor is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - Since the doctor is in position 2 or 3, and the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 1 or 2.
   - If the doctor is in position 2, the camping person must be in position 1.
   - If the doctor is in position 3, the camping person must be in position 2.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who's hobby is traveling is the person who's hobby is traveling.
   - This is redundant but confirms that the person with the hobby of traveling is in the same position as mentioned previously.

8. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the Brazilian.
   - Given the Brazilian is in position 1 or 2, the writing person must be in position 2 or 3.

9. **Clue 2**: The Japanese is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling.
   - Since the Japanese is in position 1 or 2, the traveling person must be in position 2 or 3.

10. **Clue 10**: The dancer is on the left or right of the doctor.
    - Since the dancer is the Japanese and the doctor is in position 2 or 3, the dancer (Japanese) must be in position 1 or 2, and the doctor in position 2 or 3.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements step-by-step:

- Position 1: Japanese (dancer)
- Position 2: Doctor
- Position 3: Gardening
- Position 4: American

Now, we need to assign hobbies and jobs:

- **Hobbies**:

  - Position 4 (American): Camping

- **Jobs**:
  - Position 1 (Japanese): Bartender

From clue 4, the person watching spy movies is on the far right (position 4).

| Food          | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|               |               |               |

| Pineapple     | Spy           |               |

#### Step 2: Determine the Position of the Person Eating Pineapple
From clue 5, the person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating watermelon. Therefore, the person eating watermelon must be in position 1 or 2, and the person eating pineapple must be in position 2 or 3.

Since the person watching spy movies is in position 4, the person eating pineapple cannot be in position 4. Thus, the person eating pineapple must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Determine the Position of the Person Eating Watermelon
From clue 5, the person eating watermelon must be in position 1 or 2, and the person eating pineapple must be in position 2 or 3. Since the person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating watermelon, the person eating watermelon must be in position 1 and the person eating pineapple must be in position 2.

| Food          | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |

|               |               |               |
|               | Spy           |               |

#### Step 4: Determine the Position of the Person Whose Hobby is Dancing
From clue 1, the person whose hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple. Since the person eating pineapple is in position 2, the person whose hobby is dancing can be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 6, the person whose hobby is dancing is on the right of the person watching western movies. Therefore, the person watching western movies must be in position 1, and the person whose hobby is dancing must be in position 3.

| Food          | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Watermelon    | Dancing       |               |

|               | Western       |               |
|               | Spy           |               |

#### Step 5: Determine the Position of the Person Watching Action Movies
From clue 2, the person watching action movies is on the right of the person eating pineapple. Since the person eating pineapple is in position 2, the person watching action movies must be in position 3.

| Food          | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Watermelon    | Dancing       | Action        |
| Pineapple     |               |               |
|               | Western       |               |
|               | Spy           |               |

#### Step 6: Determine the Position of the Person Whose Hobby is Hiking
From clue 3, the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is hiking. Since the person watching western movies is in position 3, the person whose hobby is hiking can be in position 1 or 4.

From clue 8, the person whose hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is not yet determined, we need to consider both possibilities.

#### Step 7: Determine the Position of the Person Whose Hobby is Magic-Tricks
From clue 7, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini. Since the person eating zucchini is not yet determined, we need to consider both possibilities.

Given the constraints, let's assume the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 4 and the person eating zucchini is in position 1.

| Food          | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|

| Broccoli      | Hiking        |               |

From clue 3, the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is hiking. Since the person whose hobby is hiking is in position 4, the person watching western movies must be in position 3.

From clue 8, the person whose hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 4 and the person whose hobby is hiking is in position 4, this is consistent.

Thus, the final solution is:

### Clues Recap:
1. The dressmaker is on the far right.
2. The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the doctor.
3. The person drinking Fanta is on the far left or far right.
4. The nurse is on the right of the security guard.

6. The person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking water.
7. The security guard is on the right of the person drinking Sprite.
8. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Far Right Clues:
- From clue 1: The dressmaker is on the far right (Position 4).
- From clue 5: The person watching musical movies is on the far right (Position 4).

So, we can place:
```
|               |     1     |       2        |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           |                |           |   Musical  |
| Job           |           |                |           |   Dressmaker  |
| Movie-Genre   |           |                |           |   Musical  |
```

#### 2. Far Left Clue:
- From clue 3: The person drinking Fanta is on the far left or far right.
- Since Position 4 is already taken by ""Musical"" and ""Dressmaker,"" the person drinking Fanta must be in Position 1.

So, we can place:
```
|               |     1     |       2        |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |   Fanta   |                |           |   Musical  |
| Job           |           |                |           |   Dressmaker  |
| Movie-Genre   |           |                |           |   Musical  |
```

#### 3. Doctor and Documentary Clue:
- From clue 2: The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the doctor.
- Since Position 4 is already taken by ""Musical"" and ""Dressmaker,"" the only remaining positions for the doctor and the person watching documentary movies are Positions 1 and 2.

Since Fanta is at Position 1, the doctor cannot be there. So, the doctor must be in Position 2 and the person watching documentary movies must be in Position 3.

So, we can place:
```
|               |     1     |       2        |     3     |     4      |

| Movie-Genre   |   Doc     |                |   Doc     |   Musical  |
```

#### 4. Security Guard and Sprite Clue:
- From clue 4: The nurse is on the right of the security guard.
- From clue 7: The security guard is on the right of the person drinking Sprite.

Since the nurse is in Position 2 and the security guard cannot be there, the security guard must be in Position 3 and the nurse must be in Position 4.

From clue 7, the person drinking Sprite must be in Position 1, which is already taken by Fanta. This means the person drinking Sprite must be in Position 3, and the security guard must be in Position 4.

So, we can place:
```
|               |     1     |       2        |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |   Fanta   |                |   Sprite  |   Musical  |
| Job           |   Doctor  |   Nurse        |   Sec-G    |   Dressmaker  |
| Movie-Genre   |   Doc     |                |   Sec-G    |   Musical  |
```

#### 5. Tea and Water Clue:
- From clue 6: The person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking water.
- Since Fanta, Sprite, and Musical are already placed, the only remaining beverages are Tea and Water.

From clue 6, the person drinking tea must be in Position 1 and the person drinking water must be in Position 2.

So, we can place:
```
|               |     1     |       2        |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |   Tea     |   Water        |   Sprite  |   Musical  |
| Job           |   Doctor  |   Nurse        |   Sec-G    |   Dressmaker  |
| Movie-Genre   |   Doc     |                |   Sec-G    |   Musical  |
```

Finally, we need to assign the remaining movie genres (Animation and Documentary) based on clue 8:
- From clue 8: The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.

Since the doctor is watching documentary movies (from clue 2), the nurse must be watching animation movies.

So, we can place:
```
|               |     1     |       2        |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |   Tea     |   Water        |   Sprite  |   Musical  |
| Job           |   Doctor  |   Nurse        |   Sec-G    |   Dressmaker  |
| Movie-Genre   |   Doc     |   Animation    |   Sec-G    |   Musical  |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |       2        |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |   Tea     |   Water        |   Sprite  |   Musical  |

6. The Mexican is on the right of the person eating cauliflower.
7. The person watching crime movies is on the left of the Egyptian.
8. The person eating garlic is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 4 and Clue 5:**
   - The person eating raspberry is on the far right.
   - The person watching thriller movies (and eating raspberry) is also on the far right.
   - So, we can place **Raspberry** and **Thriller** in position 4.

   |               |    1     |     2     |      3      |     4     |

2. **From Clue 1 and Clue 2:**
   - The person watching horror movies is on the far left or far right.
   - The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person eating nectarine.
   - Since the person eating raspberry is already in position 4, the person watching horror movies must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the person watching horror movies (position 1) is on the left of the person eating nectarine (position 3).

   | Nationality   |          |           |            |           |

3. **From Clue 3:**
   - The person eating garlic is on the left or right of the Chinese.
   - Since the person eating nectarine is in position 3, the person eating garlic cannot be in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person eating garlic must be in position 2 or 4. But since position 4 is occupied by Raspberry, it must be in position 2.

   |               | Horror  | Garlic  | Nectarine  |     4     |

   - The Mexican is on the right of the person eating cauliflower.
   - Since the person eating cauliflower is in position 1, the Mexican must be in position 3.

5. **From Clue 7:**
   - The person watching crime movies is on the left of the Egyptian.
   - Since the person watching horror movies is in position 1, the person watching crime movies must be in position 2.

6. **From Clue 8:**
   - The person eating garlic is on the far left or far right.
   - We already placed Garlic in position 2, so it must be the person eating garlic who is on the far left.

   |               | Garlic  | Crime   | Mexican   |     4     |
