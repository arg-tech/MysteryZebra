Lv3-1x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze and arrange the beverages step by step based on the given clues:

1. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
2. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
3. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking juice.
4. The person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right.
5. The person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking cola.
6. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
7. The person drinking milk is on the far left or far right.
8. The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
9. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.

From clues 3 and 5, we can deduce that:
- Cola must be to the right of juice, and juice must be to the left of cola. This means the order is Juice -> Cola.

From clues 4 and 7, we have two possibilities for 7up:
- 7up is either on the far left or the far right.
- Milk is also on the far left or the far right.

Since 7up and milk cannot both be on the same side (far left or far right), one must be on the far left and the other on the far right. Let's assume 7up is on the far left for now and see if it fits all clues.

From clue 9, since 7up is on the right of iced-tea, iced-tea must be to the left of 7up, which contradicts our assumption that 7up is on the far left. Therefore, 7up must be on the far right.

Now, the arrangement looks like:
- Far left: 7up
- Far right: Sprite (since iced-tea must be to the left of 7up and lemonade is to the right of sprite)

Given the above setup, let's place the remaining beverages:
- From clue 3 and 5, we know juice is to the left of cola.
- From clue 6, lemonade is to the right of sprite.
- From clue 2, milk is to the left or right of juice. Since 7up is on the far left and iced-tea is to the left of 7up, milk must be to the right of juice and to the left of iced-tea.

So the final arrangement could be:
- Far left: 7up
- Next to 7up: Sprite
- Next to Sprite: Iced-tea
- Next to Iced-tea: Milk
- Next to Milk: Juice
- Next to Juice: Cola

Let's verify:
- 7up is on the far right (clue 4 and 9).
- 7up is on the right of iced-tea (clue 9).
- Juice is on the left of cola (clue 3 and 5).
- Milk is on the right of juice (clue 2 and 6).

The final solution is:

```

Lv3-1x7-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and place the jobs accordingly.

1. **The pilot is on the left or right of the chef**.
2. **The designer is on the left or right of the videographer**.
3. **The chef is on the right of the photographer**.
4. **The pilot is on the far right**.
5. **The videographer is on the left or right of the electrician**.
6. **The electrician is on the left of the photographer**.
7. **The electrician is on the left of the photographer** (repeated from clue 6).
8. **The designer is between the videographer and the dressmaker**.

Let's start placing the clues:

- From clue 4, the pilot must be in position 7.
- From clue 3, the chef cannot be in position 1 because the chef must be to the right of the photographer. So, the photographer can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- From clue 6 and clue 7, the electrician must be to the left of both the photographer and the videographer. Since the pilot is in position 7, the photographer must be in position 6 (to satisfy clue 6 and 7).
- Now, the electrician must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it has to be to the left of the photographer).

Let's try placing the electrician in position 1:
- If the electrician is in position 1, then the photographer must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But since the photographer needs to be to the right of the electrician, the photographer must be in position 2 or 3.
- Let's assume the photographer is in position 2. Then the electrician is in position 1.
- The designer must be between the videographer and the dressmaker (clue 8). This means the designer cannot be in position 1, 2, or 7 (as these positions are occupied or not possible based on other clues).
- The videographer must be to the left or right of the electrician (clue 5). So, the videographer could be in position 3 or 4.
- If the videographer is in position 3, then the designer must be in position 4 and the dressmaker in position 5.
- The chef must be to the right of the photographer (clue 3), so the chef can only be in position 4, 5, or 6. But position 4 is taken by the designer, so the chef must be in position 5 or 6. Since the pilot is in position 7, the chef must be in position 6.
- This leaves the remaining job (dressmaker) for position 5.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Electrician
- Position 2: Photographer
- Position 3: Videographer
- Position 4: Designer
- Position 5: Dressmaker
- Position 6: Chef
- Position 7: Pilot

Lv3-1x7-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct seating arrangement.

1. **The Argentine is on the far left or far right.**
2. **The American is between the Argentine and the Colombian.**
3. **The Colombian is on the right of the American.**
4. **The American is on the left or right of the Argentine.** (This is redundant with statement 1 and 2)
5. **The Turkish is on the left of the Indian.**
6. **The Turkish is between the Australian and the Indian.**
7. **The Indian is on the left or right of the Canadian.**

From statements 1 and 2, we know that:
- The Argentine must be at position 1 or 7.
- If the Argentine is at position 1, then the American must be at position 2 or 3, and the Colombian at position 3 or 4.
- If the Argentine is at position 7, then the American must be at position 6 or 5, and the Colombian at position 5 or 4.

Since statement 3 says the Colombian is on the right of the American, let's explore both scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Argentine at position 1
- American must be at position 2 or 3.
- Colombian must be at position 3 or 4.

If American is at position 2:
- Colombian must be at position 3.
- This leaves positions 4, 5, 6, and 7 for the other nationalities.

Now consider the Turkish and Indian placement:
- From statement 5, Turkish is on the left of the Indian.
- From statement 6, Turkish is between the Australian and the Indian.
- From statement 7, the Indian is on the left or right of the Canadian.

Given these constraints, let's try:
- Suppose Turkish is at position 4, then Indian must be at position 5 or 6.
- If Indian is at position 5, then Australian must be at position 3 or 2, but this conflicts with American being at position 2.
- So, Indian must be at position 6, then Australian must be at position 4, which conflicts with Turkish at position 4.
- Therefore, Turkish cannot be at position 4.

Suppose Turkish is at position 5, then Indian must be at position 6 or 7.
- If Indian is at position 6, then Australian must be at position 4 or 3.
- If Australian is at position 4, then this conflicts with Turkish being at position 5.
- If Australian is at position 3, then this also conflicts because American would need to be at position 2 or 3, and there's no room for the Canadian.

So, let's try:
- Turkish at position 4, Indian at position 5, and Australian at position 3.
- This leaves positions 2 and 7 for the American and Argentine.
- Since the American must be between the Argentine and the Colombian, and the Argentine must be at position 1, the American must be at position 2 and the Colombian at position 3.
- This fits all conditions.

### Scenario 2: Argentine at position 7
- American must be at position 6 or 5.
- Colombian must be at position 5 or 4.

If American is at position 6:
- Colombian must be at position 5.
- This leaves positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the other nationalities.

Now consider the Turkish and Indian placement:
- From statement 5, Turkish is on the left of the Indian.
- From statement 6, Turkish is between the Australian and the Indian.
- From statement 7, the Indian is on the left or right of the Canadian.

Given these constraints, let's try:
- Suppose Turkish is at position 1, then Indian must be at position 2 or 3.
- If Indian is at position 2, then Australian must be at position 3 or 4.
- If Australian is at position 3, then this conflicts with the American being at position 6.
- If Australian is at position 4, then this also conflicts because there's no room for the Canadian.

So, let's try:
- Turkish at position 2, Indian at position 3, and Australian at position 1.
- This leaves positions 4, 5, and 6 for the American and Argentine.
- Since the American must be between the Argentine and the Colombian, and the Argentine must be at position 7, the American must be at position 6 and the Colombian at position 5.
- This fits all conditions.

Thus, the final seating arrangement is:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |     4      |    5    |   6    |    7     |

Lv3-1x7-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze and apply each clue step-by-step to determine the correct order of the music genres.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the fan of indie.
   - This means hip-hop and indie are adjacent.

2. **Clue 2**: The fan of pop is on the right of the fan of country.
   - This means country and pop are not adjacent, with pop to the right of country.

3. **Clue 3**: The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
   - This means dubstep is to the right of hip-hop.

4. **Clue 5**: The fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of indie.
   - This means indie is to the left of hip-hop.

5. **Clue 6**: The fan of pop is in the middle.
   - Pop must be in position 4 (the middle).

6. **Clue 7**: The fan of country is on the left or right of the fan of reggae.
   - This means country and reggae are adjacent.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 6 (middle)**:
   - From Clue 6, we know that pop is in position 4.
   - So, the arrangement looks like this:
     ```
     |   |   |   | Pop |   |   |   |
     ```

2. **Clue 2**:
   - Country must be either to the left or right of pop.
   - Since pop is in position 4, country can be in positions 3 or 5.

3. **Clue 7**:
   - Reggae and country are adjacent.
   - If country is in position 3, then reggae must be in position 2.
   - If country is in position 5, then reggae must be in position 6.
   - But reggae cannot be in position 6 because it needs to be to the right of r&b, which we will place later.

4. **Clue 1 and 5**:
   - Hip-hop and indie are adjacent, and hip-hop is to the right of indie.
   - If country is in position 3, then reggae is in position 2.
   - Hip-hop and indie must be in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, but reggae is already in position 2.
   - Therefore, country must be in position 3, and reggae must be in position 2.
   - This leaves hip-hop and indie to be in positions 1 and 2, with hip-hop to the right of indie.

5. **Clue 3 and 4**:
   - Dubstep must be to the right of hip-hop.
   - Pop is in position 4.
   - The remaining positions for dubstep, r&b, and the last genre are 5, 6, and 7.
   - Since the fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of r&b (Clue 4), r&b must be in position 5 and reggae in position 6.
   - This leaves dubstep in position 7.

### Final Arrangement:

```
| Indie | Hip-Hop | Reggae | Pop | R&B | Dubstep | Country |
```

### Verification:

- Clue 1: Hip-hop (2) is to the right of indie (1).
- Clue 2: Pop (4) is to the right of country (7).
- Clue 3: Hip-hop (2) is to the left of dubstep (7).
- Clue 5: Hip-hop (2) is to the right of indie (1).
- Clue 6: Pop (4) is in the middle.
- Clue 7: Country (7) is to the right of reggae (6).

Thus, the final solution is:

```
| Indie | Hip-Hop | Reggae | Pop | R&B | Dubstep | Country |

Lv3-1x7-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct arrangement of hobbies for each position.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Person with filmmaking (F) is on the right of the person with puzzles (P).**
   - F > P

2. **Person with writing (W) is in the middle.**
   - W must be in position 4 (since there are 7 positions).

3. **Person with fishing (FISH) is between the person with rock-climbing (ROCK) and the person with dancing (DANCE).**
   - ROCK < FISH < DANCE or DANCE < FISH < ROCK

4. **Person with photography (PHOTO) is on the left or right of the person with filmmaking (F).**
   - PHOTO can be immediately to the left or right of F.

5. **Person with writing (W) is on the left of the person with rock-climbing (ROCK).**
   - W < ROCK

6. **Person with writing (W) is on the right of the person with photography (PHOTO).**
   - PHOTO < W

### Combining Information:

- From points 5 and 6, we know that PHOTO must be in position 3 because W is in position 4 and must be on the right of PHOTO.
- Since W is in position 4 and F is on the right of P, F cannot be in position 4. Therefore, P must be in position 3 (since PHOTO is in 3).
- This makes F in position 5 (since F is on the right of P).

Now we have:
- P in position 3
- W in position 4
- F in position 5

Given the constraint from point 3, FISH must be in positions 2 and 6, and DANCE must be in position 1 or 7. Since PHOTO is in position 3, the only positions left for FISH and DANCE are 2 and 6.

Since DANCE is not on the left of ROCK (from point 5), DANCE must be in position 6 and FISH in position 2.

Finally, the only remaining positions are 1 and 7, which must be PHOTOS and ROCK.

### Final Solution:

- Position 1: Photography (PHOTO)
- Position 2: Fishing (FISH)
- Position 3: Puzzles (P)
- Position 4: Writing (W)
- Position 5: Filmmaking (F)
- Position 6: Rock Climbing (ROCK)
- Position 7: Dancing (DANCE)

### Final Table:

```

Lv3-1x7-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of metal is on the right of the fan of trance.
   - This means Trance cannot be in position 7, and Metal must be to the right of Trance.

2. **Clue 2**: The fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of gospel.
   - This means Soul and Gospel can be adjacent or have one person in between them.

3. **Clue 3**: The fan of d&b is in the middle.
   - This means d&b must be in position 4.

4. **Clue 4**: The fan of disco is on the far left or far right.
   - This means Disco must be in position 1 or 7.

5. **Clue 5**: The fan of disco is on the left of the fan of trance.
   - Since Disco is either at position 1 or 7, and Trance must be to the right of Metal (Clue 1), Disco must be at position 1, and Trance must be at position 7.

6. **Clue 6**: The fan of d&b is between the fan of soul and the fan of metal.
   - Since d&b is in position 4, Soul and Metal must be on either side of d&b. Given that Trance is at position 7, Metal must be to the left of Trance.

Now let's place everything step-by-step:

- **Disco** is at position 1 (from Clue 4 and Clue 5).
- **Trance** is at position 7 (from Clue 1 and Clue 5).
- **d&b** is at position 4 (from Clue 3).
- **Soul** must be to the left of d&b or between d&b and Metal (Clue 6). Since d&b is in position 4, Soul could be in position 2 or 3.
- **Metal** must be to the right of Trance (Clue 1), so it can only be in position 6 or 5. But since Soul must be to the left of d&b or between d&b and Metal, Metal must be in position 6.
- Therefore, Soul must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Disco
- Position 2: Soul
- Position 3: Soul
- Position 4: d&b
- Position 5: Metal
- Position 6: Metal
- Position 7: Trance

This satisfies all the given clues. Let's confirm:

1. Metal (5) is to the right of Trance (7).
2. Soul (2) is on the left or right of Gospel (which would be 3 if placed).
3. d&b (4) is in the middle.
4. Disco (1) is on the far left.
5. Disco (1) is on the left of Trance (7).
6. d&b (4) is between Soul (2) and Metal (5).

The final solution table is:

```
|               |   1   |   2    |   3   |  4  |  5   |   6    |   7    |

Lv3-1x7-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of metal is on the left of the fan of funk.**
   - This means Metal (M) and Funk (F) must be adjacent with M to the left of F.

2. **The fan of d&b is in the middle.**
   - This means d&b (D) must be in position 4.

3. **The fan of classical is on the right of the fan of reggae.**
   - This means Classical (C) and Reggae (R) must be adjacent with C to the right of R.

4. **The fan of dubstep is on the right of the fan of classical.**
   - This means Dubstep (S) and Classical (C) must be adjacent with S to the right of C.

5. **The fan of classical is on the left of the fan of dubstep.**
   - This reaffirms that C and S must be adjacent with C to the left of S, which aligns with clue 4.

6. **The fan of funk is on the left or right of the fan of d&b.**
   - This means F can be either to the left or right of D.

### Arrangement Strategy:
- We know D is in position 4.
- C and S must be next to each other with S to the right of C.
- M and F must be next to each other with M to the left of F.
- R and C must be next to each other with C to the right of R.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements:

1. Since D is in position 4, we have:
   ```
   _ _ _ D _ _ _
   ```

2. C and S must be next to each other with S to the right of C, and they cannot be in positions 4 and 5 (since D is there). Possible positions for CS could be:
   - 1 and 2
   - 2 and 3
   - 3 and 5
   - 5 and 6

3. M and F must be next to each other with M to the left of F, and they cannot be in positions 4 and 5 (since D is there). Possible positions for MF could be:
   - 1 and 2
   - 2 and 3
   - 3 and 5
   - 5 and 6

Considering all constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:
```
M R C D S F _
```

Now, we need to fill the last position with the remaining genre, which is Ambient (A).

Lv3-1x7-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the sports accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming.**
   - This means Lacrosse (L) comes before Swimming (S).

2. **The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.**
   - This means Ice-Hockey (I) comes after Swimming (S).

3. **The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.**
   - This means Skiing (K) comes before Tennis (T).

4. **The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing.**
   - This means Volleyball (V) comes before Skiing (K).

5. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is swimming.**
   - This reiterates that Lacrosse (L) is next to Swimming (S), either to the left or right.

6. **The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means Ice-Hockey (I) is at position 1 or 7.

7. **The person who's sport is surfing is in the middle.**
   - This means Surfing (F) is at position 4.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

- From clue 6, Ice-Hockey (I) must be at position 1 or 7.
- From clue 7, Surfing (F) must be at position 4.
- From clue 3 and 4, Volleyball (V) must be before Skiing (K), so V is before K.
- From clue 2, Swimming (S) must be between Lacrosse (L) and Ice-Hockey (I).
- Since I is at position 1 or 7, S must be next to L but not next to I (because I is at the far end).

Let's test the positions:

- If Ice-Hockey (I) is at position 1:
  - Lacrosse (L) can only be at position 2 (since it's next to S).
  - Swimming (S) must then be at position 3.
  - Volleyball (V) must be before Skiing (K), so V could be at position 5 and K at position 6.
  - Surfing (F) is at position 4.

So, the order would be:
1. Ice-Hockey (I)
2. Lacrosse (L)
3. Swimming (S)
4. Surfing (F)
5. Volleyball (V)
6. Skiing (K)
7. Tennis (T)

This satisfies all the clues.

Lv3-1x7-9	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The Russian is between the Mexican and the Spanish.
2. The Dutch is on the left or right of the Argentine.
3. The Egyptian is on the far left.
4. The Russian is on the left or right of the Mexican.
5. The Spanish is on the right of the Dutch.
6. The Russian is on the right of the Spanish.
7. The Chinese is on the left or right of the Egyptian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3:** The Egyptian is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Egyptian

2. **Clue 1 & 4:** The Russian is between the Mexican and the Spanish, and also on the left or right of the Mexican.
   - This means the order could be Mexican-Russian-Spanish or Spanish-Russian-Mexican.

3. **Clue 6:** The Russian is on the right of the Spanish.
   - This rules out the order Mexican-Russian-Spanish, leaving us with Spanish-Russian-Mexican.

4. **Clue 5:** The Spanish is on the right of the Dutch.
   - Since we have Spanish-Russian-Mexican, the Dutch must be to the left of the Spanish.
   - Therefore, the order so far is: Dutch-Spanish-Russian-Mexican.

5. **Clue 2:** The Dutch is on the left or right of the Argentine.
   - Given the current order (Dutch-Spanish-Russian-Mexican), the Argentine must be to the right of the Dutch.
   - Therefore, the order becomes: Dutch-Armenian-Spanish-Russian-Mexican.

6. **Clue 7:** The Chinese is on the left or right of the Egyptian.
   - Since the Egyptian is in position 1, the Chinese can only be in position 2 or 7.
   - We already have positions 1-4 filled, so the Chinese must be in position 7.

7. **Final Check:**
   - The remaining nationality is Argentine, which fits in position 2.

So, the final arrangement is:

Lv3-1x7-10	"Let's analyze and solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given constraints.

### Constraints Recap:
1. The police-officer is on the left or right of the freelancer.
2. The pilot is in the middle (position 4).
3. The pilot is on the left or right of the designer.
4. The freelancer is on the left or right of the pilot.
5. The software-developer is on the left or right of the police-officer.
6. The designer is on the left or right of the pilot.
7. The designer is on the left of the teacher.

Given that the pilot is in position 4, we can start placing the pilot and then use the other constraints to determine the positions of the other jobs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Pilot in position 4**:
   - \( \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \)
   - Pilot: \( 4 \)

2. **Designers can be on the left or right of the pilot**:
   - Possible positions for designer: 3 or 5
   - Let's try \( \text{designer} = 3 \) first.

3. **Freelancer must be on the left or right of the pilot**:
   - Possible positions for freelancer: 2 or 5
   - Since designer is at 3, let's try \( \text{freelancer} = 5 \).

4. **Police-officer must be on the left or right of the freelancer**:
   - Possible positions for police-officer: 1 or 6
   - Since designer is at 3 and freelancer is at 5, let's try \( \text{police-officer} = 1 \).

5. **Software-developer must be on the left or right of the police-officer**:
   - Possible positions for software-developer: 2 or 6
   - Since police-officer is at 1, let's try \( \text{software-developer} = 2 \).

6. **Freelancer must be on the left or right of the pilot**:
   - Freelancer is already at 5, which is correct.

7. **Police-officer must be on the left or right of the designer**:
   - Police-officer is at 1 and designer is at 3, which is correct.

8. **Software-developer must be on the left or right of the police-officer**:
   - Software-developer is at 2 and police-officer is at 1, which is correct.

9. **Designer must be on the left of the teacher**:
   - Designer is at 3 and the only remaining positions are 6 and 7.
   - Let's place the teacher at 7.

So, the final arrangement is:

\[ \text{software-developer, police-officer, designer, pilot, freelancer, teacher} \]
