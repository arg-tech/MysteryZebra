### Placing Information in the Table:

Let's start by placing some basic information based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 24:** The person driving the motorbike is the American.
2. **Clue 10:** The person driving the motorbike is in the middle (position 3).
3. Therefore, the American is in position 3.

Next, let's place the other information:

4. **Clue 13:** The Accountant is the person whose hobby is writing.
5. **Clue 3:** The Electrician is on the right of the person whose hobby is writing.
6. Since the person with the hobby of writing is in position 3 (the American), the Electrician must be in position 4 or 5.

7. **Clue 18:** The Accountant is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
8. Therefore, the Accountant (writing) must be in position 4 or 5, and the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 2 or 1.

Since the American is already in position 3, the Accountant must be in position 4 or 5. Let's assume the Accountant is in position 5 for now and check consistency.

9. **Clue 19:** The Spanish is the person driving the trike.
10. **Clue 11:** The person driving the trike is on the right of the Chinese.
11. Therefore, the Chinese must be in position 1 or 2, and the Spanish must be in position 3 or 4. But since the American is in position 3, the Spanish must be in position 4 and the Chinese in position 2.

12. **Clue 23:** The Polish is on the right of the Mechanic.
13. Since the Chinese is in position 2 and the Spanish is in position 4, the Polish must be in position 5 and the Mechanic in position 3.

Now, let's fill in the rest of the table:

14. **Clue 22:** The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the photographer.
15. **Clue 2:** The American is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is writing.
16. Since the American is in position 3, the person whose hobby is writing (Accountant) must be in position 4 or 5, and the photographer must be in position 2 or 1.

17. **Clue 25:** The owner of the ferret is the person watching epic movies.
18. **Clue 26:** The person whose hobby is baking is on the right of the owner of the snake.

21. **Clue 6:** The person eating pomegranate is the person watching musical movies.

- The person watching epic movies (ferret owner) is in position 2 or 1.
- The person whose hobby is card-games (lemon eater) is in position 1 or 2.

Given that the American is in position 3, the Accountant (writing) in position 5, and the Spanish in position 4, the remaining positions are 1 and 2.

Let's place the remaining information:

- Position 1: Chinese, eating pomegranate, watching musical movies, owning snake.
- Position 2: Polish, eating lemon, watching epic movies, owning ferret.
- Position 4: Mechanic, eating apple, watching time-travel movies.

Lv3-7x5-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's start by organizing the clues and solving step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11**: The fan of house is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 12**: The Dutch is on the left or right of the fan of house.
3. **Clue 13**: The person eating pear is the person watching animation movies.
4. **Clue 14**: The mechanic is on the right of the person watching animation movies.
5. **Clue 15**: The bartender is on the left of the person eating spinach.
6. **Clue 16**: The mechanic is on the right of the scientist.
7. **Clue 18**: The person watching animation movies is on the left of the Nigerian.
8. **Clue 19**: The person eating orange is on the left or right of the fan of blues.
9. **Clue 20**: The owner of the guinea-pig is the person who's hobby is photography.
10. **Clue 21**: The person watching western movies is the fan of disco.
11. **Clue 22**: The person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the person eating pear.
12. **Clue 23**: The Nigerian is on the far left or far right.
13. **Clue 24**: The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies.

From these clues, we can start placing some information:

#### Clue 11 & 12:
- The fan of house is either at position 1 or 5.
- The Dutch is on the left or right of the fan of house.

Let's assume the fan of house is at position 1 (we will check if this assumption holds).

- Position 1: Fan of house, Dutch is at position 2 or 5.

#### Clue 13 & 14:
- The person eating pear is the person watching animation movies.
- The mechanic is on the right of the person watching animation movies.

If the person watching animation movies is at position 3 (since the person eating pear must be on their left or right), then the mechanic is at position 4.

- Position 3: Person eating pear (watching animation movies).
- Position 4: Mechanic.

#### Clue 15 & 16:
- The bartender is on the left of the person eating spinach.
- The mechanic is on the right of the scientist.

Since the mechanic is at position 4, the scientist must be at position 3 (which conflicts with the person eating pear being there). Therefore, let's re-evaluate and assume the fan of house is at position 5.

- Position 5: Fan of house.
- Position 4: Dutch (since they are on the right of the fan of house).

#### Clue 18 & 23:
- The person watching animation movies is on the left of the Nigerian.
- The Nigerian is on the far left or far right.

Since the person watching animation movies is at position 3, the Nigerian must be at position 1 or 5.

Given the fan of house is at position 5, the Nigerian must be at position 1.

- Position 1: Nigerian.
- Position 3: Person eating pear (watching animation movies).

#### Clue 19:
- The person eating orange is on the left or right of the fan of blues.

Given the person eating pear is at position 3, the person eating orange must be at position 2 or 4. Since the mechanic is at position 4, the person eating orange is at position 2.

- Position 2: Person eating orange.
- Position 4: Mechanic.

#### Clue 20:
- The owner of the guinea-pig is the person who's hobby is photography.

The owner of the guinea-pig is at position 2, so their hobby is photography.

- Position 2: Photography (guinea-pig).

#### Clue 21:
- The person watching western movies is the fan of disco.

The person watching western movies must be at position 5, which is the fan of house.

- Position 5: Fan of house (Western movies).

#### Clue 22:
- The person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the person eating pear.

The person eating pear is at position 3, so the person with the hobby of camping must be at position 2 or 4. Since the person at position 2 is already the photographer, the person at position 4 is the person with the hobby of camping.

- Position 4: Camping (Mechanic).

#### Clue 7:
- The person whose hobby is dancing is on the left of the person whose hobby is camping.

The person at position 2 is the photographer, so the person at position 1 must be the dancer.

- Position 1: Dancing (Nigerian).
- Position 2: Photography (Guinea-pig).

#### Clue 24:
- The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies.

Since the person watching animation movies is at position 3, the Malaysian must be at position 2 or 4. We already know position 2 is the photographer, so the Malaysian is at position 4.

- Position 4: Photography (Guinea-pig, Malaysian).

#### Clue 25:
- The fan of d&b is on the right of the person eating spinach.

The person eating spinach must be at position 3, and the person at position 4 is the Malaysian, so the fan of d&b is at position 5.

- Position 5: Fan of house (Western movies, d&b).

#### Remaining Clues:
- The person eating onion is the person watching action movies.
- The person eating blueberry is the person watching satire.
- The person eating spinach is the person watching time-travel.
- The person eating pear is the person watching animation.
- The person eating orange is the person watching time-travel.
- The person eating blueberry is the person watching satire.
- The person eating onion is the person watching action.
- The person eating spinach is the person watching time-travel.

Now we can fill in the remaining details:

- Position 3: Time-travel (Pear, Animation).
- Position 4: Action (Onion).
- Position 5: Satire (Blueberry, House).
