Lv3-2x2-1	"Let's analyze the given conditions step by step:

1. **Condition 1:** The person drinking tea is either on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
2. **Condition 2:** The person eating lemon is on the right of the person drinking tea.

We have two columns (1 and 2) and two rows (Beverage and Food). Let's denote:
- The person in column 1 as Position 1
- The person in column 2 as Position 2

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Condition 1 Analysis:
- If the person drinking tea is in Position 1, then the person drinking juice must be in Position 2.
- If the person drinking tea is in Position 2, then the person drinking juice must be in Position 1.

#### Condition 2 Analysis:
- If the person eating lemon is in Position 2, then the person drinking tea must be in Position 1 (since the person eating lemon is to the right of the person drinking tea).

### Combining Conditions:

- From Condition 2, we know the person eating lemon is in Position 2.
- Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in Position 1 (to satisfy Condition 2).
- Now, from Condition 1, since the person drinking tea is in Position 1, the person drinking juice must be in Position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1 (Beverage): Tea
- Position 2 (Beverage): Juice

Given that the person eating lemon is in Position 2 (from Condition 2), the only remaining food for Position 1 is Kiwi.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1 (Beverage): Tea
- Position 1 (Food): Kiwi
- Position 2 (Beverage): Juice
- Position 2 (Food): Lemon

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |  1   |   2   |
| Beverage   | Tea  | Juice |
| Food       | Kiwi | Lemon |
```"	{'beverage': ['tea', 'juice'], 'food': ['kiwi', 'lemon']}	True	4	True
Lv3-2x2-2	"Certainly! Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is surfing is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking water is on the far right.

Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), and the person drinking water must be on the far right (position 2), we can place the person drinking water in position 2.

So, the layout looks like this:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: Water

Since the person who drinks water is on the far right, the person who practices surfing must be on the left (position 1) because they need to be next to the person drinking water.

Therefore, the person who practices golf must be the one on the right (position 2).

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|            |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage   |  Almond-milk | Water |
| Sport      |    Surfing   |  Golf |
```

This satisfies both clues:
- Clue 1: The person who practices surfing (position 1) is next to the person drinking water (position 2).
- Clue 2: The person drinking water is on the far right (position 2).

Here is the final solution table:

```
|            |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage   |  Almond-milk | Water |
| Sport      |    Surfing   |  Golf |

Lv3-2x2-3	"Let's break down the puzzle and solve it step-by-step.

We have:
- Two movie genres: Sports and Western
- Two nationalities: French and Nigerian

The clues provided are:
1. The French person is on the left of the person watching Western movies.
2. The French person is on the left or right of the person watching Western movies.

From clue 1, we know that the French person must be on the left side of the person watching Western movies. This means if one of them is in position 1, the other must be in position 2.

From clue 2, this is redundant with clue 1 since it just reiterates that the French person can be either to the left or right of the person watching Western movies, which is already covered by clue 1.

Given these clues, let's place the people in the table:

|               |   1    |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Western  |
| Nationality   | French | Nigerian |

Here, the French person is in position 1 (left) and the Nigerian person is in position 2 (right), and the person in position 2 is watching Western movies.

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |   1    |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Western  |
| Nationality   | French | Nigerian |

Lv3-2x2-4	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step.

Given:
- There are two beverages: Fanta and Sprite.
- There are two types of food: Apricot and Tomato.
- The person eating apricot is to the right of the person drinking Sprite.
- The person drinking Fanta is either on the far left or far right.

We need to fill in the table based on these clues:

|            |   1    |    2    |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Beverage   |        |         |
| Food       |        |         |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The person drinking Fanta is either on the far left or far right.
   - This means that Fanta can only be in position 1 or position 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking Fanta is on the far left or far right.
   - This reinforces Clue 3 and tells us the exact positions for Fanta.

3. **Clue 1**: The person eating apricot is to the right of the person drinking Sprite.
   - If the person drinking Sprite is in position 1, then the person eating apricot must be in position 2.
   - If the person drinking Sprite is in position 2, then there would be no room for the person eating apricot (since they must be to the right).

Let's consider both possible positions for Fanta:

#### Case 1: Fanta is in position 1
- If Fanta is in position 1, then the remaining beverage (Sprite) must be in position 2.
- Now, we need to place the foods such that the person eating apricot is to the right of the person drinking Sprite.
  - Since Sprite is in position 2, the person eating apricot must be in position 2.
- This placement satisfies all the given clues.

So, the table looks like this:

|            |   1    |    2    |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Beverage   | Fanta  | Sprite  |
| Food       | Tomato | Apricot |

#### Case 2: Fanta is in position 2
- If Fanta is in position 2, then the remaining beverage (Sprite) must be in position 1.
- Now, we need to place the foods such that the person eating apricot is to the right of the person drinking Sprite.
  - Since Sprite is in position 1, the person eating apricot cannot be placed in position 2 (because there is no position to the right).
- This placement does not satisfy the clue that the person eating apricot must be to the right of the person drinking Sprite.

Therefore, the only valid solution is:

|            |   1    |    2    |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Beverage   | Fanta  | Sprite  |
| Food       | Tomato | Apricot |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |   1    |    2    |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Beverage   | Fanta  | Sprite  |
| Food       | Tomato | Apricot |

Lv3-2x2-5	"Let's break down the information and constraints provided to solve the puzzle step by step.

1. **Music-Genres:**
   - Ambient
   - Salsa

2. **Nationalities:**
   - American
   - Australian

3. **Constraints:**
   - The Australian is on the right of the fan of salsa.
   - The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of ambient.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible arrangements:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Constraint 1:
- The Australian is on the right of the fan of salsa.

This means if the fan of salsa is in position 1, then the Australian must be in position 2. If the fan of salsa is in position 2, then there is no one to the right (so this scenario is not possible under this constraint).

So, we can only have:
- Salsa in position 1, and Australian in position 2.

#### Constraint 2:
- The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of ambient.

Since the fan of salsa is in position 1, the fan of ambient must be in position 2 to satisfy this constraint.

### Final Arrangement:

- Position 1: Salsa
- Position 2: Ambient

- Position 1: Australian
- Position 2: American

Thus, the final arrangement that satisfies all the given constraints is:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Music-Genre   |  Salsa  |  Ambient  |
| Nationality   | Australian | American |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Music-Genre   |  Salsa  |  Ambient  |

Lv3-2x2-6	"Let's break down the information and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

We have:
- Two music genres: Ambient and D&B
- Two nationalities: Malaysian and Mexican
- The fan of Ambient is on the left or right of the Mexican.
- The Mexican is on the right of the Malaysian.

Given these constraints, we need to place the names in the table such that all conditions are satisfied.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions for the nationalities**:
   - Since the Mexican must be on the right of the Malaysian, the only possible arrangement is:
     - Malaysian (left)
     - Mexican (right)

2. **Determine the music genre preferences**:
   - The fan of Ambient can be either on the left or right of the Mexican.
   - Given the above nationality arrangement, the possible placements for the music genres are:
     - Malaysian on the left with either Ambient or D&B
     - Mexican on the right with the remaining genre

3. **Apply the condition that the fan of Ambient is on the left or right of the Mexican**:
   - If the Malaysian is on the left, then the Mexican must be on the right.
   - Therefore, the fan of Ambient must be either the Malaysian or the Mexican.

Since there are only two genres and two people, and one person must be the fan of Ambient while the other must be the fan of D&B, we can conclude:
- If the Malaysian is the fan of Ambient, then the Mexican must be the fan of D&B.
- If the Malaysian is the fan of D&B, then the Mexican must be the fan of Ambient.

### Final Table Configuration:

Given the above reasoning, the only valid configuration is:

```
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient   | D&B     |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Mexican |
```

Or, if you reverse the roles:

```
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   | D&B       | Ambient |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Mexican |
```

Both configurations satisfy all the given conditions. However, since the problem does not specify which one is correct, we will provide both as potential solutions.

Lv3-2x2-7	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
1. There are two nationalities: Malaysian and Thai.
2. There are two pets: Cat and Snake.
3. The Thai person is either to the left or right of the Malaysian.
4. The owner of the snake is to the left of the Thai.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Possible Arrangements for Nationalities:**
   - Since the Thai can be either to the left or right of the Malaysian, we have two possible arrangements:
     - Thai (T) is to the left of Malaysian (M): T, M
     - Thai (T) is to the right of Malaysian (M): M, T

2. **Identify Possible Arrangements for Pets:**
   - The owner of the snake (S) must be to the left of the Thai (T).
   - This means if T is to the left of M, then S must be to the left of T.
   - If T is to the right of M, then S must be to the left of M.

3. **Combine the Two Conditions:**
   - If T is to the left of M: S must be to the left of T.
     - Possible arrangement: S, T, M
   - If T is to the right of M: S must be to the left of M.
     - Possible arrangement: S, M, T

### Conclusion:
The only valid arrangement that satisfies both conditions is:
- S (Snake) is to the left of T (Thai), who is to the right of M (Malaysian).

Lv3-2x2-8	"Let's break down the given information and constraints to solve the puzzle:

1. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.
2. The manager is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

From these clues, we can infer the following:

- Since the person with the hobby of woodworking must be on the left of the person with the hobby of singing, the arrangement for hobbies must be:
  - Woodworking (W) on the left
  - Singing (S) on the right

So, the possible arrangements for hobbies are:
- Row 1: W, S

Next, we need to place the jobs based on the second clue:
- The manager (M) is either on the left or right of the person with the hobby of woodworking.

Given the arrangement of hobbies (W, S), let's consider both possibilities for the manager:

### Case 1: Manager (M) is on the left of the person with the hobby of woodworking (W)
This is not possible because the manager cannot be on the left of the person with the hobby of woodworking if the person with the hobby of woodworking is already on the leftmost position.

### Case 2: Manager (M) is on the right of the person with the hobby of woodworking (W)
This means the arrangement for the jobs must be:
- Row 1: M, C (where C is chef)

Since we have only two positions and two jobs, the remaining job must go to the other position.

Therefore, the final solution is:
- Row 1: M (Manager), C (Chef)
- Row 2: W (Woodworking), S (Singing)

Here is the final solution table:

```
|         |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Woodworking | Singing |
| Job     |    Manager  |    Chef |

Lv3-2x2-9	"Certainly! Let's break down the information and constraints given in the puzzle to determine the correct arrangement.

### Constraints:
1. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
2. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.

### Analysis:

Let's denote:
- \( C \) for Coffee
- \( I \) for Iced Tea
- \( A \) for Avocado
- \( P \) for Papaya

From constraint 1, we know that if someone is drinking iced tea (I), then the person eating avocado (A) must be on their right. This means the arrangement could be:
- \( I \) (left) and \( A \) (right)

From constraint 2, we know that the person drinking coffee (C) can be either on the left or right of the person drinking iced tea (I). However, since the person eating avocado (A) must be on the right of the person drinking iced tea (I), the only possible positions for the coffee drinker (C) are:
- \( C \) (left) and \( I \) (middle), \( A \) (right)
- \( I \) (left), \( C \) (middle), \( A \) (right)

Given these constraints, let's fill in the table:

|            |    1     |    2    |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Beverage   |    C     |    I    |
| Food       |    A     |    P    |

This arrangement satisfies both constraints:
1. The person eating avocado (A) is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (I).
2. The person drinking coffee (C) is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (I).

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |    1     |    2    |
| Beverage   |    C     |    I    |

Lv3-2x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement:

1. There are two movie genres: comedy and musical.
2. There are two means of transport: quad-bike and van.
3. The person driving the van is either on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.
4. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person watching comedy movies.

Let's denote:
- Person A as the one driving the quad-bike.
- Person B as the one driving the van.
- Person C as the one watching comedy movies.

From clue 3, we know that if Person A (quad-bike) is on the left, then Person B (van) must be on the right, or vice versa.

From clue 4, we know that Person A (quad-bike) must be to the left of Person C (comedy).

Given these constraints, let's explore the possible arrangements:

### Scenario 1: Person A (quad-bike) is on the left.
- If Person A is on the left, then Person B (van) must be on the right.
- Since Person A (quad-bike) is on the left and needs to be to the left of Person C (comedy), Person C must be on the right.

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions:
- Person A (quad-bike) is on the left.
- Person B (van) is on the right.
- Person C (comedy) is on the right.

### Scenario 2: Person A (quad-bike) is on the right.
- This would mean Person B (van) is on the left.
- However, Person A (quad-bike) cannot be to the left of Person C (comedy) because Person C must be on the right, which contradicts this scenario.

Thus, only Scenario 1 is valid.

Now, let's place the information into the table:

```
|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical   | Comedy |
| Transport     | Quad-bike | Van    |
```

Here, ""Quad-bike"" is on the left and ""Van"" is on the right, with ""Comedy"" on the right side of the table and ""Musical"" on the left side of the table.

Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical   | Comedy |
| Transport     | Quad-bike | Van    |
