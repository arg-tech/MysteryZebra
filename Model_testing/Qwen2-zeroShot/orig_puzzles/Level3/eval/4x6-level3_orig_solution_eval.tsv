### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **From clue 8:** Freelancer is on the far left (position 1).
2. **From clue 1:** Rock-climber is on the far left or right. Since the freelancer is already on the far left, the rock-climber must be on the far right (position 6).
3. **From clue 2:** Librarian (card-games) is on the far right (position 6).
4. **From clue 9:** Chess is the engineer, so the engineer is not on the far left (position 1). Since the rock-climber is on the far right (position 6), the engineer must be somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
5. **From clue 11:** Magic-tricks is on the left of the engineer. This means the engineer must be in position 3 or 4 (since the magic-tricks person cannot be in position 5 or 6).
6. **From clue 10:** Camping is on the left of the person drinking juice. This means the person drinking juice is in position 3, 4, or 5.
7. **From clue 14:** Animation movies are on the left or right of card-games. Since the card-games person is on the far right (position 6), animation movies could be in position 5.
8. **From clue 17:** Animation movies are on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This means the person drinking soy-milk is in position 6, which is already occupied by the librarian. So, animation movies must be in position 5, and the person drinking soy-milk is in position 6.
9. **From clue 13:** The rock-climber (position 6) watches animation movies.
10. **From clue 18:** The dressmaker (horror movies) is between the software-developer and the person watching comedy movies. This means the dressmaker must be in position 3 or 4.

12. **From clue 16:** The dressmaker watches horror movies, so the dressmaker must be in position 3.
13. **From clue 19:** Almond-milk is on the left or right of romance movies. Since the software-developer is on the left or right of almond-milk, and the software-developer cannot be in position 1 (freelancer), the software-developer must be in position 2 or 4. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 4, the software-developer must be in position 2.
14. **From clue 3 and 4:** Almond-milk is on the right of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3.
15. **From clue 7:** Comedy movies are on the right of soy-milk. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 6, the person watching comedy movies must be in position 5.

Lv3-4x6-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The Mexican is on the far left.
2. **Clue 3:** The Nigerian is on the far right.
3. **Clue 5:** The Librarian is on the far right (same as Clue 3).
4. **Clue 6:** The Firefighter is on the left of the person eating pineapple.
5. **Clue 7:** The owner of the bird is on the left or right of the Nigerian (same as Clue 3).
6. **Clue 8:** The owner of the pony is on the right of the dressmaker.
7. **Clue 9:** The owner of the pony is on the far left or far right (same as Clue 1 and Clue 3).

From Clues 1, 3, and 5:
- Position 1: Mexican
- Position 6: Nigerian and Librarian

Since the owner of the pony must be in position 1 or 6, and we already have a Nigerian in position 6, the owner of the pony must be in position 1.

So:
- Position 1: Mexican (owner of the pony)
- Position 6: Nigerian and Librarian

8. **Clue 10:** The owner of the lizard is the Spanish.
9. **Clue 11:** The owner of the lizard is the Musician (same as Clue 10).

This means the Spanish and Musician are the same person, which is incorrect since they should be two different people. Let's correct this:
- The owner of the lizard is the Spanish.
- The owner of the lizard is not the Musician.

10. **Clue 12:** The owner of the ferret is on the left of the Spanish.
13. **Clue 16:** The person eating radish is the Musician.
14. **Clue 17:** The person eating cabbage is on the left of the designer.
15. **Clue 18:** The person eating raspberry is on the right of the owner of the lizard.

Now, let's place the remaining people and food items based on the clues.

### Final Placement:

- **Position 1:** Mexican (owner of the pony)
- **Position 2:** (To be determined)
- **Position 3:** (To be determined)
- **Position 4:** (To be determined)
- **Position 5:** (To be determined)
- **Position 6:** Nigerian and Librarian

Since the owner of the pony is in position 1, the person eating radish (Musician) cannot be in position 1. Let's place the Musician in position 5 (since it needs to be on the left of the person eating pineapple).

- **Position 1:** Mexican (owner of the pony)
- **Position 2:** (To be determined)
- **Position 3:** (To be determined)
- **Position 4:** (To be determined)
- **Position 5:** Musician (eating radish)
- **Position 6:** Nigerian and Librarian

The person eating pineapple must be on the right of the Firefighter, so the Firefighter must be in position 4 (since position 5 is taken by the Musician).

- **Position 1:** Mexican (owner of the pony)
- **Position 2:** (To be determined)
- **Position 3:** (To be determined)
- **Position 4:** Firefighter (eating pineapple)
- **Position 5:** Musician (eating radish)
- **Position 6:** Nigerian and Librarian

The designer eats lettuce, and the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the Nigerian (position 6). So, the designer must be in position 2.

- **Position 1:** Mexican (owner of the pony)
- **Position 2:** Designer (eating lettuce)
- **Position 3:** (To be determined)
- **Position 4:** Firefighter (eating pineapple)
- **Position 5:** Musician (eating radish)

The person eating cabbage is on the left of the designer, so the person eating cabbage must be in position 3.

- **Position 1:** Mexican (owner of the pony)
- **Position 2:** Designer (eating lettuce)
- **Position 3:** Person eating cabbage
- **Position 4:** Firefighter (eating pineapple)
- **Position 5:** Musician (eating radish)
- **Position 6:** Nigerian and Librarian

The person eating raspberry is on the right of the owner of the lizard (Spanish), and the owner of the lizard is in position 3 (since the designer is in position 2 and the person eating cabbage is in position 3).

- **Position 1:** Mexican (owner of the pony)
- **Position 2:** Designer (eating lettuce)
- **Position 3:** Spanish (eating cabbage)
- **Position 4:** Firefighter (eating pineapple)
- **Position 5:** Musician (eating radish)
- **Position 6:** Nigerian and Librarian

The owner of the bird is on the left or right of the Nigerian (position 6), so the owner of the bird must be in position 2 (since the designer is in position 2).

- **Position 1:** Mexican (owner of the pony)
- **Position 2:** Owner of the bird (Designer)
- **Position 3:** Spanish (eating cabbage)
- **Position 4:** Firefighter (eating pineapple)
- **Position 5:** Musician (eating radish)
- **Position 6:** Nigerian and Librarian

The librarian is on the far right, so the librarian must be in position 6, and the Nigerian must be on the left side of the librarian.

- **Position 1:** Mexican (owner of the pony)
- **Position 2:** Owner of the bird (Designer)
- **Position 3:** Spanish (eating cabbage)
- **Position 4:** Firefighter (eating pineapple)
