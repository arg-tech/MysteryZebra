Lv3-3x3-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The fan of rock is on the far left or far right.**
2. **The person eating potato is on the far left or far right.**
3. **The fan of folk is the person watching romance movies.**
4. **The fan of reggae is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.**
5. **The person eating peach is between the person watching superhero movies and the person eating potato.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of rock and potato fans.
- From clue 1, the fan of rock must be either in position 1 or 3.
- From clue 2, the person eating potato must be either in position 1 or 3.

Since both rock and potato fans cannot occupy the same position (because they are distinct categories), one must be in position 1 and the other in position 3.

#### Step 2: Apply clue 3.
- The fan of folk is the person watching romance movies.
- This means that the person watching romance movies is also the fan of folk.

#### Step 3: Apply clue 4.
- The fan of reggae is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.
- This means the person watching superhero movies cannot be in position 1 because there would be no left position for the fan of reggae.

#### Step 4: Apply clue 5.
- The person eating peach is between the person watching superhero movies and the person eating potato.
- Since the person eating potato can only be in position 1 or 3, and the person eating peach must be in the middle, the person eating peach must be in position 2.

### Deduction:
- If the person eating potato is in position 1, then the person eating peach must be in position 2, and the person eating potato cannot be the fan of rock (clue 1).
- If the person eating potato is in position 3, then the person eating peach must be in position 2, and the person eating potato cannot be the fan of rock (clue 1).

Given these constraints, let's assume the fan of rock is in position 1 and the person eating potato is in position 3:

- Position 1: Fan of rock
- Position 2: Person eating peach
- Position 3: Person eating potato

Now we need to place the genres and foods:

- The fan of folk (and thus the person watching romance movies) must be in position 2 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied by the fan of rock and the person eating potato, respectively).
- The fan of reggae must be in position 1 (left of the person watching superhero movies).
- The person watching superhero movies must be in position 3 (right of the person eating peach).

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Food          | Rock   | Peach   | Potato   |
| Movie-Genre   | Reggae | Romance | Superhero |
| Music-Genre   | Folk   | Reggae  | Thriller |
```

This configuration satisfies all the given clues."	{'food': ['rock', 'peach', 'potato'], 'movie-genre': ['reggae', 'romance', 'superhero'], 'music-genre': ['folk', 'reggae', 'thriller']}	True	4	False
Lv3-3x3-2	"Let's break down the clues step by step to solve the puzzle.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person watching crime movies is on the far left or far right.**
2. **The Russian is on the right of the person watching crime movies.**
3. **The person watching romance movies is between the owner of the turtle and the German.**
4. **The owner of the turtle is on the left of the owner of the dog.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching crime movies is on the far left or far right.
   - This means the person watching crime movies can be in position 1 or 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The Russian is on the right of the person watching crime movies.
   - If the person watching crime movies is in position 1, the Russian must be in position 2.
   - If the person watching crime movies is in position 3, the Russian must be in position 2 or 3 (but not position 1 because it would violate Clue 1).

3. **Clue 3**: The person watching romance movies is between the owner of the turtle and the German.
   - This implies that the person watching romance movies cannot be in position 1 or 3, as they need to be between two other positions.

4. **Clue 4**: The owner of the turtle is on the left of the owner of the dog.
   - This means the owner of the turtle cannot be in position 3 if the owner of the dog is in position 1 or 2.

### Combining Clues:

- Since the person watching crime movies can only be in position 1 or 3:
  - If the person watching crime movies is in position 1, then the Russian must be in position 2. This leaves position 3 for either the person watching romance movies or the owner of the dog.
  - If the person watching crime movies is in position 3, then the Russian must be in position 2 or 3. But since the Russian cannot be in position 3 (because the person watching crime movies is in position 3), the Russian must be in position 2, leaving position 1 for either the person watching romance movies or the owner of the turtle.

### Positioning the People:

- Let's assume the person watching crime movies is in position 1.
  - Then the Russian is in position 2.
  - The person watching romance movies must be in position 3 (since position 1 and 2 are occupied).
  - The owner of the turtle must be in position 1 (since the owner of the dog must be to the right of the owner of the turtle).

This positioning satisfies all the clues:
- The person watching crime movies (position 1) is on the far left.
- The Russian (position 2) is on the right of the person watching crime movies.
- The person watching romance movies (position 3) is between the owner of the turtle (position 1) and the German (position 2).
- The owner of the turtle (position 1) is on the left of the owner of the dog (position 2).

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |    2    |      3       |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime      | Romance | Martial-Arts |
| Nationality   | Russian    | German  | Indonesian   |
| Pet           | Turtle     | Dog     | Goat         |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions."	{'movie-genre': ['crime', 'romance', 'martial-arts'], 'nationality': ['russian', 'german', 'indonesian'], 'pet': ['turtle', 'dog', 'goat']}	True	6	False
Lv3-3x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's use the given clues to fill out the table step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating radish is the writer.
2. The person who's sport is baseball is on the far left.
3. The musician is in the middle.
4. The person eating avocado is the person who's sport is baseball.
5. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person eating onion.
6. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Sports
- From clue 2, the person who's sport is baseball is on the far left (position 1).
- From clue 4, the person eating avocado is the person who's sport is baseball, so position 1 also has avocado.

So, we have:
```
|         |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Food    | avocado  |          |            |
| Job     |          |          |            |
| Sport   | baseball |          |            |
```

#### Step 2: Positioning the Jobs
- From clue 3, the musician is in the middle (position 2).

So, we have:
```
|         |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Food    | avocado  |          |            |
| Job     |          | musician |            |
| Sport   | baseball |          |            |
```

#### Step 3: Positioning the Foods
- From clue 1, the person eating radish is the writer. Since the writer cannot be in position 1 (baseball), and the musician is in position 2, the writer must be in position 3. Therefore, the person in position 3 eats radish and is the writer.

So, we have:
```
|         |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Food    | avocado  |          | radish     |
| Job     |          | musician | writer    |
| Sport   | baseball |          |            |
```

#### Step 4: Determining the Remaining Foods
- The only remaining food is onion, which must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|         |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Food    | avocado  | onion    | radish     |
| Job     |          | musician | writer    |
| Sport   | baseball |          |            |
```

#### Step 5: Positioning the Sports for the Remaining Positions
- From clue 6, the person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling.
- From clue 5, the person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person eating onion.

Since the person eating onion is in position 2, the person who's sport is basketball can only be in position 1 or 3. But since position 1 is already occupied by baseball, the person with basketball must be in position 3.

Therefore, the person with cycling must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|         |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Food    | avocado  | onion    | radish     |
| Job     |          | musician | writer    |
| Sport   | cycling  | baseball | basketball |
```

#### Step 6: Assigning the Jobs
- The musician is in position 2, so the remaining job (nurse) must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|         |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Food    | avocado  | onion    | radish     |
| Job     | nurse    | musician | writer    |
| Sport   | cycling  | baseball | basketball |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Food    | avocado  | onion    | radish     |
| Job     | nurse    | musician | writer    |

Lv3-3x3-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person eating kiwi.
2. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person eating plum.
3. The person who's sport is climbing is between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the person who's hobby is puzzles.
4. The person eating plum is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
5. The person who's sport is soccer is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5: Soccer is on the far right.
This means:
- Sport 3: Soccer

#### Clue 3: Climbing is between Lacrosse and Puzzles.
This means:
- If Lacrosse is on the left, then Puzzles must be on the right.
- If Lacrosse is on the right, then Puzzles must be on the left.
- Therefore, we can deduce that Lacrosse is in the middle (Sport 2), and Puzzles is either on the left (Sport 1) or the right (Sport 3).

Since Soccer is on the far right, Lacrosse must be in the middle.

#### Clue 2: Lacrosse is on the left or right of the person eating plum.
Since Lacrosse is in the middle, it cannot be on the left or right of the person eating plum. This implies:
- The person eating plum must be in the middle (Sport 2).

#### Clue 4: Plum is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
Since Plum is in the middle (Sport 2), the person with the hobby of puzzles must be on one of the other positions (Sports 1 or 3).

#### Clue 1: Photography is on the left of the person eating kiwi.
Since Photography cannot be in the middle (Sport 2) because Lacrosse is there, Photography must be on the left (Sport 1), and Kiwi must be on the right (Sport 3).

#### Final Arrangements:
- Sport 1: Photography
- Sport 2: Lacrosse
- Sport 3: Soccer

Now let's assign the foods and hobbies based on the remaining constraints:

- Since Plum is in the middle (Sport 2), the person with the hobby of puzzles must be in Sports 1 or 3.
- Since Photography (left) is on the left of Kiwi (right), and Plum is in the middle, the person with the hobby of puzzles must be in Sport 1 (Photography).

Thus:
- Sport 1: Photography (Hobby: Puzzles)
- Sport 2: Lacrosse (Food: Plum)
- Sport 3: Soccer (Hobby: Kiwi)

Finally, the person with the hobby of singing must be in Sport 3 since Puzzles and Kiwi are already assigned.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|         |    1     |      2      |    3    |
| Food    |   Kiwi   |     Plum    |  Corn   |
| Hobby   |  Puzzles |    Singing  |  Corn   |
| Sport   | Photography |  Lacrosse |  Soccer |
```

Lv3-3x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each nationality, pet, and type of food into the correct position based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the positions step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The Japanese is on the left of the owner of the bird.
2. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
3. The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
4. The Japanese is on the right of the Brazilian.
5. The person eating asparagus is on the far left or far right.
6. The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.
7. The person eating asparagus is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 7**: The person eating asparagus is on the far left. Therefore, Asparagus must be in position 1.

2. **Clue 4**: The Japanese is on the right of the Brazilian. This means the Japanese cannot be in position 1 (since it's already occupied by asparagus). So, the Japanese and Brazilian must be in positions 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The Japanese is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the Japanese cannot be in position 1, they must be in position 2, and the owner of the bird must be in position 3.

4. **Clue 2**: The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Therefore, the owner of the lizard must be in position 1, which contradicts our earlier placement of asparagus in position 1. Hence, the owner of the lizard must be in position 2, and the owner of the bird must be in position 3. This means the Japanese is in position 3.

5. **Clue 3**: The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the lizard is in position 2, the owner of the horse must be in position 3. However, we already have the owner of the bird in position 3, so this clue doesn't provide new information but confirms the previous placements.

6. **Clue 6**: The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. Since the owner of the lizard is in position 2, the person eating cauliflower can be in position 1 or 3. But since position 1 is asparagus and position 3 is bird, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2.

7. **Clue 5**: The person eating asparagus is on the far left. We already placed asparagus in position 1.

Now let's summarize the positions:

- Position 1: Asparagus (Japanese)
- Position 2: Cauliflower (Brazilian)
- Position 3: Bird (Japanese)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | Asparagus | Cauliflower | Bird       |
| Nationality   | Japanese  | Brazilian  | Japanese   |
| Pet           | None      | None      | Bird       |
```

This is the final solution based on the given clues."	{'food': ['asparagus', 'cauliflower', 'bird'], 'nationality': ['japanese', 'brazilian', 'japanese'], 'pet': ['none', 'none', 'bird']}	True	2	False
Lv3-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching musical movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating orange is on the far left.
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person eating cherry.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking water is on the far right.
5. **Clue 5:** The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda.

Given the layout:
```
| Beverage      |     1     |    2    |     3      |
| Food          |           |         |      melon |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |            |
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- The person eating orange is on the far left (position 1).

So, we have:
```
| Beverage      | lemonade  |         |            |
| Food          | orange    |         |      melon |
| Movie-Genre   |          |         |            |
```

#### Clue 4:
- The person drinking water is on the far right (position 3).

So, we have:
```
| Beverage      | lemonade  |         | water     |
| Food          | orange    |         |      melon |
| Movie-Genre   |          |         |           |
```

#### Clue 1:
- The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching musical movies.

This means the person watching musical movies must be in position 3 (since position 2 would conflict with the person drinking water being in position 3).

So, we have:
```
| Beverage      | lemonade  |         | water     |
| Food          | orange    |         |      melon |
| Movie-Genre   |          | comedy  | musical   |
```

#### Clue 3:
- The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person eating cherry.

Since the person eating orange is in position 1, the person eating cherry must be in position 2 (because it can't be in position 1 and there is no other position available for the person eating cherry).

So, we have:
```
| Beverage      | lemonade  | mirinda  | water     |
| Food          | orange    | cherry   |      melon |
| Movie-Genre   |          | comedy   | musical   |
```

#### Clue 5:
- The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda.

From our current arrangement, the person drinking water is already in position 3, and the person drinking mirinda is in position 2. This clue is satisfied as the person drinking water is to the right of the person drinking mirinda.

So, the final solution is:
```
| Beverage      | lemonade  | mirinda  | water     |
| Food          | orange    | cherry   |      melon |
| Movie-Genre   |          | comedy   | musical   |

Lv3-3x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the van**:
   - This means if the person driving the van is in position 1, then the person driving the bike must be in position 2 or 3.
   
2. **The person driving the boat is on the far left or far right**:
   - This means the person driving the boat can only be in position 1 or 3.
   
3. **The owner of the goat is on the left of the person watching adventure movies**:
   - This means the goat owner cannot be in the last column (rightmost column).
   
4. **The owner of the goat is on the right of the owner of the hamster**:
   - This means the hamster owner cannot be in the last column either, and the goat owner must be to the right of the hamster owner.
   
5. **The person watching comedy movies is between the person driving the bike and the person driving the boat**:
   - This means the person watching comedy movies must be in the middle (position 2) if the boat driver is in position 1 and the bike driver is in position 3, or vice versa.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the positions for the boat driver**:
   - From clue 2, the boat driver can be in position 1 or 3.
   - If the boat driver is in position 1, the bike driver must be in position 3 (from clue 1), and the person watching comedy movies would be in position 2 (from clue 5).

2. **Assign the goat owner and the hamster owner based on clue 4**:
   - The goat owner must be to the right of the hamster owner.
   - Since the goat owner cannot be in the last column (clue 3), and the hamster owner also cannot be in the last column, the goat owner must be in position 2 and the hamster owner in position 1.

3. **Assign the adventure movie watcher**:
   - From clue 3, the goat owner (in position 1) is on the left of the adventure movie watcher, so the adventure movie watcher must be in position 3.

4. **Assign the comedy movie watcher**:
   - From clue 5, the comedy movie watcher is between the boat driver (position 1) and the bike driver (position 3). So, the comedy movie watcher must be in position 2.

5. **Assign the remaining genres and pets**:
   - The remaining genre for position 1 is mystery.
   - The remaining genre for position 3 is comedy (already assigned to position 2).

Now let's fill in the table with the information we have:

1. The person eating radish is on the left or right of the person watching action movies.
2. The person eating cucumber is on the far right.
3. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
4. The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
5. The owner of the snake is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5: The owner of the snake is on the far left.
This means the first column must be for the snake owner.

|               |   1 (Snake) |    2     |    3     |
| Food          |            |          |          |
| Movie-Genre   |            |          |          |
| Pet           |            |          |          |

#### Clue 2: The person eating cucumber is on the far right.
This means the third column must be for the cucumber eater.

|               |   1 (Snake) |    2     |    3 (Cucumber) |
| Food          |            |          |                |
| Movie-Genre   |            |          |                |
| Pet           |            |          |                |

#### Clue 1: The person eating radish is on the left or right of the person watching action movies.
Since the cucumber eater is in the third column, the radish eater can only be in the second column. So, the radish eater is in the second column.

|               |   1 (Snake) |    2 (Radish) |    3 (Cucumber) |
| Food          |            |              |                |
| Movie-Genre   |            |              |                |
| Pet           |            |              |                |

#### Clue 4: The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
This means the person watching action movies must be in the first column and the person watching thriller movies must be in the third column.

|               |   1 (Snake) |    2 (Radish) |    3 (Cucumber) |
| Food          |            |              |                |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     |              | Thriller       |
| Pet           |            |              |                |

#### Clue 3: The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
Since the action movie watcher is in the first column, the hamster owner must be in the second column, and the satire movie watcher must be in the third column.

|               |   1 (Snake) |    2 (Hamster) |    3 (Cucumber) |
| Food          |            |              |                |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     |              | Thriller       |
| Pet           | Snake      | Hamster      | Cucumber       |

Now we need to assign the remaining foods and genres:

- The hamster owner is in the second column, so the hamster owner cannot eat cucumber or radish. Therefore, the hamster owner must eat grapes.

|               |   1 (Snake) |    2 (Hamster) |    3 (Cucumber) |
| Food          |            | Grapes         |                |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     |              | Thriller       |
| Pet           | Snake      | Hamster       | Cucumber       |

- The person watching action movies is the snake owner, so the snake owner watches action movies.
- The person watching satire movies is the hamster owner, so the hamster owner watches satire movies.
- The person watching thriller movies is the cucumber eater, so the cucumber eater watches thriller movies.

Finally, the remaining food is radish, which must be eaten by the owner of the frog.

|               |   1 (Snake) |    2 (Hamster) |    3 (Cucumber) |
| Food          | Radish     | Grapes         | Radish         |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     | Satire         | Thriller       |
| Pet           | Snake      | Hamster       | Cucumber       |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |   1 (Snake) |    2 (Hamster) |    3 (Cucumber) |

Lv3-3x3-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions of the sports:**
   - From clue 3: The person who's sport is rowing is on the far left.
   - From clue 6: The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
   - From clue 5: The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person driving the taxi.
   - From clue 1: The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person whose sport is rugby.
   - From clue 2: The person whose sport is rugby is on the right of the person whose hobby is collecting.
   - From clue 4: The person whose sport is rugby is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is collecting (this confirms clue 2).

2. **Determine the positions:**
   - Rowing must be in position 1.
   - Rugby cannot be in position 1 (since it is to the right of collecting) and cannot be in position 3 (since rowing is in position 1).
   - Rugby must be in position 2.
   - Collecting must be in position 1 or 2 (since rugby is to its right).
   - Since collecting cannot be in position 1 (because rowing is there), collecting must be in position 2.
   - Rugby is then in position 3.
   - The taxi driver must be in position 1 or 2 (since the motorbike driver is to its right).
   - The motorbike driver must be in position 2 or 3 (since the taxi driver is to its left).
   - The quad-bike driver must be in position 3 (since the motorbike driver is to its left).
   - Therefore, the taxi driver must be in position 1, the motorbike driver in position 2, and the quad-bike driver in position 3.

3. **Assign the hobbies and sports:**
   - The person with hobby ""collecting"" is in position 2 (same as rugby).
   - The person with hobby ""fishing"" must be in position 1 (leftmost position not assigned yet).
   - The person with hobby ""video-games"" must be in position 3 (rightmost position not assigned yet).
   - The person with sport ""rowing"" is in position 1.
   - The person with sport ""rugby"" is in position 3.
   - The person with sport ""skiing"" must be in position 2 (since rowing and rugby are taken).

4. **Assign the transportation:**
   - The person with transport ""motorbike"" is in position 2.
   - The person with transport ""taxi"" is in position 1.
   - The person with transport ""quad-bike"" is in position 3.

### Final Table:

```
|             |     1      |     2     |      3      |
| Hobby       | fishing    | collecting| video-games |
| Sport       | rowing     | skiing    | rugby       |
| Transport   | taxi       | motorbike | quad-bike   |
```

### Final Solution:

```
|             |     1      |     2     |      3      |
| Hobby       | fishing    | collecting| video-games |
| Sport       | rowing     | skiing    | rugby       |
| Transport   | taxi       | motorbike | quad-bike   |

Lv3-3x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The owner of the turtle is on the far left.**
   - This means the first column is for the turtle owner.

2. **The person driving the car is on the right of the scientist.**
   - The scientist cannot be in the far right (since the person driving the car must be to the right of the scientist).

3. **The security-guard is on the left of the scientist.**
   - This means the security-guard cannot be in the far right either (since the scientist must be to the right of the security-guard).

4. **The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the mouse.**
   - This means if the mouse owner is in column 1 or 2, the chinchilla owner must be in column 2 or 3 respectively.

5. **The security-guard is on the far left or far right.**
   - Since the turtle owner is already in the far left, the security-guard must be in the far right.

6. **The person driving the scooter is on the far left.**
   - This conflicts with clue 5 since the far left is already taken by the turtle owner. Therefore, we need to reconsider the placement of the scooter driver.

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- **Turtle Owner:** Far left (Column 1)
- **Security Guard:** Far right (Column 3)

Since the security guard is on the far right and the turtle owner is on the far left, the only remaining position for the car driver (from clue 2) is Column 2.

Now, let's place the jobs:
- **Car Driver:** Column 2 (since it must be to the right of the scientist and the security guard is in Column 3)

From clue 3, the security guard is on the left of the scientist, so the scientist must be in Column 2 (which is already taken by the car driver). Thus, the scientist must be in Column 3 (security guard's right), making the car driver in Column 1.

So far, we have:
- **Turtle Owner:** Column 1
- **Car Driver:** Column 2
- **Scientist:** Column 3
- **Security Guard:** Column 3 (conflict, but let's resolve it next)

Now, let's place the pets and transport:
- **Owner of Chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the mouse** (clue 4).
- **Scooter driver is on the far left** (clue 6).

Since the turtle owner is in Column 1, the mouse owner must be in Column 2 (the only column left for the mouse owner), and the chinchilla owner must be in Column 3.

So, we have:
- **Mouse Owner:** Column 2
- **Chinchilla Owner:** Column 3

This leaves the remaining job for the car driver:
- **Architect:** Column 1 (since the car driver is in Column 2 and the scientist is in Column 3)
- **Scientist:** Column 2 (car driver)
- **Security Guard:** Column 3

And the remaining pet and transport:
- **Turtle Owner:** Column 1 (architect)
- **Chinchilla Owner:** Column 3 (security guard)
- **Mouse Owner:** Column 2 (scientist)
- **Transport:** Car (Column 1), Helicopter (Column 2), Scooter (Column 3)

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|             |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job         | Architect      | Scientist  | Security Guard |
| Pet         | Turtle         | Mouse      | Chinchilla   |
| Transport   | Car            | Helicopter | Scooter     |
