Lv3-2x4-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate values in the table.

Let's start by summarizing the clues:

1. The person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies.
2. The person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies.
3. The person driving the car is on the far left or far right.
4. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
5. The person driving the roller is between the person driving the car and the person driving the motorbike.
6. The person watching thriller movies is the person driving the bike.

From clues 1 and 2, we can deduce that the order for the movie genres must be:
- Thriller (left)
- Crime (right)

So, we have:
- Thriller: 1st position
- Crime: 4th position

From clue 3, we know the person driving the car is either at position 1 or 4. Since Thriller is at 1 and Crime is at 4, the person driving the car must be at position 4.

From clue 6, the person watching thriller movies is the person driving the bike, so:
- Bike: 1st position
- Thriller: 1st position

This leaves us with:
- Car: 4th position
- Crime: 4th position

From clue 5, the person driving the roller is between the person driving the car and the person driving the motorbike. Since the car is at 4th position, the roller must be at 3rd position, and the motorbike at 2nd position.

From clue 4, the person watching musical movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike is at 2nd position, the musical must be at 3rd position.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Bike: 1st position (Thriller)
- Motorbike: 2nd position (Musical)
- Roller: 3rd position (Disaster)
- Car: 4th position (Crime)

Now, let's fill in the table:

```

Lv3-2x4-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person driving the helicopter.**
   - This means the hip-hop fan and the helicopter driver must be next to each other with the hip-hop fan to the left.

2. **The person driving the trike is on the far left or far right.**
   - This gives us two possible positions for the trike driver: position 1 or position 4.

3. **The fan of techno is on the left of the person driving the trike.**
   - If the trike driver is in position 1, then the techno fan must be in position 2.
   - If the trike driver is in position 4, then the techno fan must be in position 3.

4. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the helicopter.**
   - If the trike driver is in position 4, the helicopter driver must be in position 3 (since the trike driver is on the right).
   - If the trike driver is in position 1, the helicopter driver must be in position 2 (since the trike driver is on the left).

5. **The fan of rock is on the far right.**
   - This means the rock fan must be in position 4.

6. **The person driving the bus is on the far left.**
   - This means the bus driver must be in position 1.

### Combining the Information:

- From point 6, the bus driver is in position 1.
- From point 2, the trike driver can only be in position 1 or 4. Since the bus driver is in position 1, the trike driver must be in position 4.
- From point 3, the techno fan must be in position 3 (since the trike driver is in position 4).
- From point 1, the hip-hop fan must be in position 2 (since the helicopter driver must be in position 3, and the hip-hop fan is on the left of the helicopter driver).
- From point 5, the rock fan must be in position 4 (since it is specified as the far right).

Now we have:
- Position 1: Bus Driver
- Position 2: Hip-hop Fan
- Position 3: Helicopter Driver
- Position 4: Trike Driver / Rock Fan

Since the trike driver is in position 4 and the rock fan is also in position 4, the remaining genres must fit the remaining positions.

- The techno fan is in position 3.
- The fan of gospel must be in position 2 (since all other positions are filled).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4   |

| Transport     | Bus    |            |            | Trike |
```

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4   |

Lv3-2x4-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the snake is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.
2. The fan of jazz is on the far left.
3. The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the fan of rock.
4. The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the fan of house.
5. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the fan of pop.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- The fan of jazz is on the far left (Position 1).

So, we have:
| Music-Genre |   1    |   2   |   3    |  4   |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|------|
| Pet         |        |       |        |      |
| Jazz        | Snake  |       |        |      |

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the snake is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.

Since the fan of jazz is in Position 1, the snake must be in either Position 2 or Position 4.

#### Clue 5:
- The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the fan of pop.

This means the rabbit cannot be in Position 1 or 2 because there would not be enough positions to the right for the fan of pop and the rabbit.

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the fan of rock.

This means the rabbit must be in Position 2 or 3, and the fan of rock must be in Position 3 or 4.

#### Clue 4:
- The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the fan of house.

This means the cat can be in any position except the one already occupied by the snake, rabbit, and the fan of jazz.

### Deduction:

1. **Snake must be in Position 4** (since it can only be in Position 2 or 4, and if it were in Position 2, the rabbit could not fit in Position 3 or 4).
2. **Rabbit must be in Position 2** (since it must be on the left of the fan of rock and on the right of the fan of pop, and the fan of jazz is in Position 1).
3. **Fan of rock must be in Position 3** (since the rabbit is in Position 2 and the fan of rock must be to the right of the rabbit).
4. **Fan of pop must be in Position 4** (since the rabbit is in Position 2 and the fan of pop must be to the left of the rabbit).
5. **Fan of house must be in Position 3** (since the fan of rock is in Position 3 and the fan of house must be to the left of the fan of rock).

Finally, the only pet that fits in Position 1 is the cat (since the cat can be on the left or right of the fan of house and all other positions are taken).

So, the final arrangement is:

| Music-Genre |   1    |   2   |   3    |  4   |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|------|
| Pet         | Cat    | Rabbit| Rock   | Pop  |
| Jazz        | Snake  |       |        |      |

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Music-Genre |   1    |   2   |   3    |  4   |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|------|
| Pet         | Cat    | Rabbit| Rock   | Pop  |
| Jazz        | Snake  |       |        |      |

  - Board-Games must be in position 2 (but Dancing is already there), so this case is invalid.

- **Case 2**: Indian in position 2, Dancing in position 3.
  - Egyptian can be in position 1 or 4.
  - If Egyptian is in position 1, Fishing must be in position 2, but that's not possible.
  - If Egyptian is in position 4, Fishing must be in position 3, and Board-Games in position 2.
  - This is valid.

- **Case 3**: Indian in position 3, Dancing in position 4.
  - Egyptian can be in position 2.

Lv3-2x4-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
3. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
4. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
5. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person drinking soy-milk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Hiker
From clue 1, we know that the person with the hobby ""hiking"" is in position 1 (the far left).

| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | Singing | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  |         |         |         |             |

#### Step 2: Place the Person Drinking Soy-Milk
From clue 5, we know that the person with the hobby ""woodworking"" drinks soy-milk.

| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | Singing | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  |         |         |         | Soy-milk    |

#### Step 3: Place the People with Beverages and Hobbies
From clue 4, the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking 7up. This means fanta and 7up must be in consecutive positions, and fanta must be to the right.

From clue 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Therefore, hot-chocolate must be in the last position.

From clue 3, the person with the hobby ""drawing"" is either to the left or right of the person with the hobby ""hiking"". Since the person with the hobby ""hiking"" is in position 1, the person with the hobby ""drawing"" can only be in position 2 or 4.

Given the above constraints, let's try to place the beverages:

- If we place 7up in position 2 and fanta in position 3, then hot-chocolate will be in position 4.
- This leaves position 3 for fanta, which contradicts clue 2. So, we need to adjust.

Instead, let's place 7up in position 3 and fanta in position 4. Then hot-chocolate will be in position 4.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Hiking
- Position 2: Drawing (since it must be to the left or right of Hiking)
- Position 3: 7up
- Position 4: Fanta (and Hot-Chocolate)

So the table looks like this:
| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | 7up     | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  |         |         | 7up     | Soy-milk    |

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining beverage (Hot-Chocolate) in position 2:

| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | 7up     | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  | Hot-Chocolate |         | 7up     | Soy-milk    |

Thus, the final solution is:

```
| Hobby     | Drawing | Hiking  | 7up     | Woodworking |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Beverage  | Hot-Chocolate | Fanta  | 7up     | Soy-milk    |

Lv3-2x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking juice.**
   - This means if we have a person drinking juice in position \(x\), the person drinking soy-milk must be in position \(x+1\).

2. **The person driving the train is between the person driving the tram and the person drinking juice.**
   - This implies that the person driving the train cannot be in the first or last position (since the person driving the tram is in the last position, and the person drinking juice must be to the left of the person drinking soy-milk).

3. **The person driving the boat is between the person driving the train and the person drinking coffee.**
   - This means the person driving the boat must be in the middle, with the person driving the train to their left and the person drinking coffee to their right.

4. **The person driving the tram is on the far right.**
   - This places the tram driver in position 4.

5. **The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.**
   - This means fanta can be in position 2 or 3 if soy-milk is in position 3 or 4, respectively.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Tram Driver Position:**
   - From clue 4, the tram driver is in position 4.
   
   ```
   |             |   1    |   2   |    3     |   4   |
   | Beverage    |        |       |          |       |
   | Transport   |        |       |          | Tram  |
   ```

2. **Train Driver Position:**
   - From clue 2, the train driver is between the tram driver and the person drinking juice.
   - Since the tram driver is in position 4, the train driver must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the train driver were in position 3, the juice drinker would be in position 2, but there's no restriction on who can be in position 2 yet. Let's try position 3 for now.

   ```
   |             |   1    |   2   |    3     |   4   |
   | Beverage    |        |       | Juice    |       |
   | Transport   |        | Train | Soy-milk | Tram  |
   ```

3. **Boat Driver Position:**
   - From clue 3, the boat driver is between the train driver and the person drinking coffee.
   - The train driver is in position 3, so the boat driver must be in position 1, and the coffee drinker in position 2.

   ```
   |             |   1    |   2   |    3     |   4   |
   | Beverage    | Coffee | Fanta  | Juice    |       |
   | Transport   | Boat   | Train | Soy-milk | Tram  |
   ```

4. **Soy-Milk and Fanta Position:**
   - From clue 1, the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking juice.
   - From clue 5, the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - We already have the juice drinker in position 2, so the soy-milk drinker must be in position 3.
   - The fanta drinker can only be in position 1 because it has to be either to the left or right of the soy-milk drinker.

   ```
   |             |   1    |   2   |    3     |   4   |
   | Beverage    | Fanta  | Coffee | Juice    | Soy-milk|
   | Transport   | Boat   | Train  | Soy-milk | Tram   |
   ```

This satisfies all the given clues.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |   1    |   2   |    3     |   4   |

Lv3-2x4-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person driving the van is on the right of the Egyptian.
2. The Egyptian is on the far left or far right.
3. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
4. The Indian is between the French and the Thai.
5. The person driving the ship is the person driving the ship (redundant information).
6. The person driving the ship is between the person driving the snowmobile and the Thai.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- The Egyptian is either in position 1 or 4.

#### Clue 1:
- If the Egyptian is in position 1, then the person driving the van must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- If the Egyptian is in position 4, then the person driving the van must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the ship is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

#### Clue 4:
- The Indian is between the French and the Thai.

#### Clue 6:
- The person driving the ship is between the person driving the snowmobile and the Thai.

### Possible Positions for the Egyptian:

- If the Egyptian is in position 1:
  - The person driving the van can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
  - The person driving the ship must be to the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and also between the person driving the snowmobile and the Thai.
  - This creates a conflict because if the ship is between the snowmobile and the Thai, the ship cannot be to the left of the snowmobile.

- Therefore, the Egyptian must be in position 4.

### Placing the Egyptian:

- Egyptian is in position 4.
- The person driving the van is in position 3 (since the van is on the right of the Egyptian).

### Placing the Ship and Snowmobile:

- From Clue 3 and Clue 6, the person driving the ship must be between the person driving the snowmobile and the Thai.
- The only remaining positions for the ship and snowmobile are 1 and 2.
- Since the ship must be between the snowmobile and the Thai, and the ship cannot be in position 4 (Egyptian), it must be in position 1.
- The snowmobile must be in position 2.

### Placing the Indian and French:

- From Clue 4, the Indian is between the French and the Thai.
- The only remaining positions for the Indian, French, and Thai are 1 and 2 (but we already have the ship in position 1 and the snowmobile in position 2).
- Therefore, the Indian must be in position 3 (between the French and the Thai).

### Final Arrangement:

- Position 1: Ship (Egyptian)
- Position 2: Snowmobile (Thai)
- Position 3: Van (Indian)
- Position 4: Van (French)

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1     |  2   |   3    |     4      |
| Nationality   | Egyptian | Thai | Indian | French    |
| Transport     | Ship     | Snowmobile | Van    | Van       |

- The person with the hobby ""board-games"" must be in column 1 or 2.
- The person with the hobby ""drawing"" must be in column 2 or 3.

Since ""fishing"" is in column 1, ""board-games"" and ""drawing"" can only fit in columns 2 and 3, respectively. Therefore, the person with the hobby ""board-games"" is in column 2 and the person with the hobby ""drawing"" is in column 3.

### Final Table:
```
|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4     |
| Hobby         | Board-games | Drawing | Filmmaking | Fishing  |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery    | Horror  | Superhero  | Scientific|
```

This satisfies all the given conditions."	{'hobby': ['board-games', 'drawing', 'filmmaking', 'fishing'], 'movie-genre': ['mystery', 'horror', 'superhero', 'scientific']}	True	1	False
Lv3-2x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the correct arrangement of pets and sports for each position. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues:
1. The owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball.
2. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far right.
3. The person who's sport is volleyball is the owner of the snake.
4. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the fish.
5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the far left or far right.
6. The owner of the fish is between the person who's sport is skiing and the person who's sport is basketball.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far right.
   - This means position 4 must be either volleyball or snake.
   - From Clue 3, the person who's sport is volleyball is the owner of the snake.
   - So, position 4 must be the snake.

2. **Clue 5**: The owner of the chinchilla is on the far left or far right.
   - Since position 4 is the snake, the chinchilla owner cannot be in position 4.
   - Therefore, the chinchilla owner must be in position 1 (far left).

3. **Clue 4**: The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the fish.
   - Since the chinchilla owner is in position 1, the fish owner must be in position 2 or 3.
   - But from Clue 6, the fish owner is between the person who's sport is skiing and the person who's sport is basketball.
   - So, the fish owner cannot be in position 3 because there would not be enough space for the skiing and basketball owners.
   - Thus, the fish owner must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 1**: The owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball.
   - Since the fish owner is in position 2, the basketball owner must be in position 3.

5. **Clue 6**: The owner of the fish is between the person who's sport is skiing and the person who's sport is basketball.
   - This confirms that the fish owner (position 2) is indeed between the skiing and basketball owners (positions 1 and 3).

6. **Remaining Sports and Pets**:
   - We have the sports: basketball, skiing, tennis, and volleyball.
   - We have the pets: chinchilla, fish, horse, snake.
   - From the above steps, we know:
     - Position 1: Chinchilla
     - Position 2: Fish
     - Position 3: Basketball
     - Position 4: Snake
   - The remaining sports are skiing and tennis.
   - The remaining pets are horse and the one not yet assigned.

7. **Assign Remaining Sports and Pets**:
   - Since the chinchilla owner is at position 1 and the fish owner is at position 2, the remaining positions (3 and 4) are already assigned.
   - The only logical assignment left is:
     - Position 1 (chinchilla): skiing (since it needs to fit the pattern)
     - Position 3 (basketball): tennis (since it fits the pattern)

So, the final solution is:

     ```

2. **Clue 4**: The Nigerian is on the left of the Chinese.
   - Since the Chinese is in position 4, the Nigerian must be in position 1.
   - So, we have:
     ```
     |               |     1     |     2      |     3     |    4    |

     ```

3. **Clue 1**: The Argentine is on the right of the Chinese.
   - Since the Chinese is in position 4, the Argentine must be in position 3.
   - So, we have:

     ```

4. **Clue 2**: The fan of Jazz is between the Russian and the Chinese.
   - We already know that the Chinese is in position 4 and the Argentine is in position 3.
   - Therefore, the Russian must be in position 2.
   - So, we have:
     ```
     |               |     1     |     2      |     3     |    4    |

     | Nationality   | Nigerian  | Russian    | Argentine | Chinese |
     ```

5. **Clue 5**: The fan of Salsa is on the left or right of the Argentine.
   - We already placed the Argentine in position 3 and the Chinese in position 4.
   - The only position left for Salsa is position 4, which is occupied by the Chinese.
   - Therefore, the fan of Salsa must be the Argentine.
   - So, we have:
     ```
     |               |     1     |     2      |     3     |    4    |
