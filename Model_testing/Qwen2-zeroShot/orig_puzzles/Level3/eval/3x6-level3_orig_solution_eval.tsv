Lv3-3x6-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information into the table. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze and Place Information

#### Clues:
1. The fan of blues is on the right of the fan of metal.
2. The person who's sport is climbing is on the far left or far right.
3. The Colombian is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
4. The Pakistani is on the left or right of the fan of soul.
5. The fan of d&b is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.
6. The fan of d&b is on the right of the person who's sport is golf.
7. The Colombian is on the far left or far right.
8. The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the Russian.
9. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
10. The person who's sport is volleyball is the Colombian.
11. The Malaysian is the fan of metal.

14. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
15. The Russian is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing.

### Step 2: Determine Positions

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is climbing must be at position 1 or 6.

From clue 7, the Colombian can only be at position 1 or 6.

From clue 10, the Colombian is also the person who's sport is volleyball.

Combining clues 2 and 7, since the Colombian cannot be in both positions 1 and 6, one of them must be incorrect. Let's assume the Colombian is at position 1 (we will check if this leads to a contradiction).

If the Colombian is at position 1, then the sport is climbing at position 6.

From clue 11, the Malaysian is the fan of metal, so the Malaysian cannot be at position 6 (where the sport is climbing). Therefore, the Malaysian must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

From clue 1, the fan of blues is on the right of the fan of metal. Since the Malaysian is the fan of metal, the fan of blues cannot be at position 2 (because the Malaysian would be to the left of the blues fan).

From clue 3, the Colombian (at position 1) is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. This means the person with the sport of skateboarding must be at position 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 4, the Pakistani is on the left or right of the fan of soul. If the Pakistani is on the left, they could be at position 2, 3, or 4; if on the right, they could be at position 3, 4, or 5.

From clue 5, the fan of d&b is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the Colombian (who is the person with volleyball) is at position 1, the fan of d&b must be at position 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 6, the fan of d&b is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. If the fan of d&b is at position 2, the person with golf must be at position 1 (which is not possible since the Colombian is there). Therefore, the fan of d&b must be at position 3, 4, or 5, and the person with golf must be at position 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 9, the fan of blues is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. If the person with skateboarding is at position 2, the fan of blues must be at position 3, 4, or 5. If the person with skateboarding is at position 3, the fan of blues must be at position 2, 4, or 5. If the person with skateboarding is at position 4, the fan of blues must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

From clue 12, the Indonesian is on the left of the fan of salsa. If the Indonesian is at position 2, the fan of salsa must be at position 3, 4, or 5. If the Indonesian is at position 3, the fan of salsa must be at position 4, 5, or 6. If the Indonesian is at position 4, the fan of salsa must be at position 5 or 6.

From clue 13, the Spanish is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. If the person with sailing is at position 2, the Spanish must be at position 3, 4, or 5. If the person with sailing is at position 3, the Spanish must be at position 4, 5, or 6. If the person with sailing is at position 4, the Spanish must be at position 5 or 6.

From clue 14, the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of r&b. If the fan of salsa is at position 3, the fan of r&b must be at position 2, 4, or 5. If the fan of salsa is at position 4, the fan of r&b must be at position 3, 5, or 6. If the fan of salsa is at position 5, the fan of r&b must be at position 4 or 6.

From clue 15, the Russian is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the sport of climbing is at position 6, the Russian must be at position 5.

### Step 3: Finalize the Solution

Given all these constraints, let's try to fit everything together:

1. Colombian (Volleyball) - Position 1
2. Malaysian (Metal) - Position 2
3. Person with Golf - Position 3
4. Fan of D&B - Position 4
5. Russian - Position 5
6. Person with Sailing - Position 6

Now, let's fill in the music genres and nationalities based on the remaining constraints:

1. Colombian (Volleyball) - Position 1
2. Malaysian (Metal) - Position 2
3. Person with Golf - Position 3
4. Fan of D&B - Position 4
5. Russian (Sailing) - Position 5
6. Person with Sailing - Position 6

For the remaining positions and music genres:
- The fan of blues is on the right of the fan of metal (Malaysian).
- The fan of d&b is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball (Colombian).
- The fan of d&b is on the right of the person who's sport is golf.
- The fan of blues is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
- The Colombian is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
- The Pakistani is on the left or right of the fan of soul.
- The Indonesian is on the left of the fan of salsa.
- The Spanish is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing.
- The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.

After fitting everything together, we get the following table:

```
|               |     1      |    2    |     3     |    4    |       5       |     6      |

Lv3-3x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding items in their correct positions. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 8:** The firefighter is the person eating papaya.
   - This gives us:
     ```
     | Food          |         1          |     2      |      3      |    4    |       5        |      6       |
     | Job           |                    |            |             |         |                |              |
     | Movie-Genre   |                    |            |             |         |                |              |
     Papaya | Firefighter       |            |             |         |                |              |
     ```

2. **Clue 12:** The person eating pepper is on the right of the software-developer.
   - This means the software-developer cannot be in position 6.

3. **Clue 13:** The person eating pepper is the person watching crime movies.
   - This gives us:
     ```
     | Food          |         1          |     2      |      3      |    4    |       5        |      6       |
     | Job           |                    |            |             |         |                |              |
     | Movie-Genre   | Crime              |            |             |         |                |              |
     Pepper | Firefighter       |            |             |         |                |              |
     ```

4. **Clue 1:** The person eating pepper is on the left of the firefighter.
   - Since the firefighter is already placed at position 4 (papaya), this is consistent.

5. **Clue 4:** The person eating papaya is between the person eating pepper and the person watching family movies.
   - Given that the person eating papaya is the firefighter, the person watching family movies must be in either position 1 or 2. Let’s assume it’s in position 2 for now (we will check consistency later).

6. **Clue 3:** The person eating peach is on the left or right of the person eating banana.
   - And the person eating papaya is between the person eating pepper and the person watching family movies.
   - This gives us two possible arrangements:
     - Peach and Banana can be in positions 1 and 2 (with Family Movies in position 2).
     - Or Peach and Banana can be in positions 2 and 3 (with Family Movies in position 3).

7. **Clue 6:** The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person watching spy movies.
   - This is consistent with our current setup since the person watching crime movies (pepper) is not next to the person watching spy movies.

8. **Clue 5:** The person eating grapes is on the right of the person watching spy movies.
   - This gives us more information about the positions of grapes and spy movies.

9. **Clue 10:** The security-guard is on the right of the person watching family movies.
   - This means the security-guard cannot be in position 1 or 2 if family movies are in position 2.

10. **Clue 9:** The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the freelancer.
    - This helps us place the freelancer relative to the horror movies.

11. **Clue 11:** The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the freelancer.
    - This helps us place the freelancer relative to the carrot.

12. **Clue 7:** The person eating pepper is on the right of the software-developer.
    - This confirms the placement of the software-developer in position 3 or 5.

### Final Arrangement:

Let's test the arrangement based on the above deductions:

```
| Food          |         1          |     2      |      3      |    4    |       5        |      6       |
| Job           |                    |            |             |         |                |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime              | Spy       | Family      | Fireman | Software-Dev   | Teacher     |
| Banana        | Freelancer         | Security  | Chef        | Papaya  | Grapes         | Carrot      |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues:

- Clue 2: Security (Teacher) is on the right of Teacher.
- Clue 3: Peach (Freelancer) is on the right of Banana (Freelancer).

Lv3-3x6-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to fill in the table step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The Indian is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 6**: The Fisherman is on the far left.
3. **Clue 1**: The Police-Officer is the Indian. Since the Indian is on the far left (from Clue 5), the Police-Officer must be in position 1.
4. **Clue 8**: The person eating Papaya is the Police-Officer. So, the person in position 1 is eating Papaya.

Now our table looks like this:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |     5      |       6        |
| Food          |  Papaya   |             |           |           |            |                |
| Job           |  Police-Officer |         |           |           |            |                |
| Nationality   |  Indian   |             |           |           |            |                |
```

5. **Clue 6**: The Fisherman is on the far left. So, the Fisherman is in position 1, but we already know that position 1 is occupied by the Police-Officer. This means there's a contradiction unless we re-evaluate. Since the Indian is the Police-Officer and must be in position 1, the Fisherman must be in another position.

6. **Clue 12**: The Australian is on the left or right of the person eating Artichoke. Let's assume the Australian is not in position 1 (since the Indian/Police-Officer is there).

7. **Clue 11**: The person eating Cauliflower is on the left of the German. So, if the German is in position 3, the person eating Cauliflower must be in position 2.

8. **Clue 7**: The person eating Cucumber is on the left of the person eating Grapefruit. So, if the person eating Grapefruit is in position 4, the person eating Cucumber must be in position 3.

9. **Clue 3**: The Doctor is on the left of the Chef. So, the Doctor must be in position 2 and the Chef in position 3, but position 3 is already taken by the person eating Cauliflower. Thus, the Doctor must be in position 1 and the Chef in position 2, which contradicts the previous placement. Re-evaluating, the Doctor must be in position 3 and the Chef in position 4.

10. **Clue 10**: The Chef is on the left or right of the Bartender. So, the Bartender must be in position 5 and the Chef in position 6.

11. **Clue 2**: The person eating Cauliflower is on the right of the person eating Avocado. So, if the person eating Avocado is in position 1, the person eating Cauliflower must be in position 2. But position 2 is already taken by the Doctor. Re-evaluating, the person eating Avocado must be in position 3 and the person eating Cauliflower in position 4.

12. **Clue 4**: The Writer is on the left or right of the Brazilian. So, the Brazilian can be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

13. **Clue 9**: The Bartender is on the right of the German. So, the German must be in position 1 and the Bartender in position 2, but position 2 is already taken by the Doctor. Re-evaluating, the German must be in position 5 and the Bartender in position 6.

14. **Clue 14**: The Bartender is between the Mexican and the Chef. So, the Mexican must be in position 4 and the Chef in position 6.

Now our table looks like this:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |     5      |       6        |

| Job           |  Doctor   |  Chef       |  Bartender |  Mexican  |  German    |  Writer       |
| Nationality   |  Indian   |  Brazilian  |  Canadian  |  Australian|  German    |  Indian       |
