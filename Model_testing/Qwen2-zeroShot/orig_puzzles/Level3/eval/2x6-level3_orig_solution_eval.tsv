Lv3-2x6-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 7:** The owner of the cat is on the far left.
2. **Clue 8:** The owner of the goat is on the far right.
3. **Clue 5:** The person drinking juice is the owner of the goat. So, beverage 8 (juice) is at position 6 and pet 8 (goat) is at position 6.

Now we have:
```
|            |    1     |   2    |    3     |  4   |       5       |   6   |
| Beverage   |          |        |          |      | hot-chocolate | juice |
| Pet        | cat      |        |          |      |               | goat  |
```

4. **Clue 9:** The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right.
5. **Clue 10:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the bird. Since hot-chocolate is at position 5, the owner of the bird must be at position 4.

So, we update the table:
```
|            |    1     |   2    |    3     |  4   |       5       |   6   |
| Beverage   | iced-tea |        |          | bird | hot-chocolate | juice |
| Pet        | cat      |        |          |      |               | goat  |
```

6. **Clue 3:** The person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. We already have that, so it fits.

7. **Clue 11:** The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the goat is at position 6, the pony must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the cat is at position 1, the pony cannot be there. Therefore, the pony must be at position 2, 3, or 4. Given the other constraints, let's place it at position 3 for now.

So, we update the table:
```
|            |    1     |   2    |    3     |  4   |       5       |   6   |
| Beverage   | iced-tea |        |          | bird | hot-chocolate | juice |
| Pet        | cat      | pony   |         |      |               | goat  |
```

8. **Clue 2:** The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the cat is at position 1, the person drinking sprite must be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the pony is at position 3 and the bird is at position 4, the sprite must be at position 2 or 6. Since the goat is at position 6, the sprite must be at position 2.

So, we update the table:
```
|            |    1     |   2    |    3     |  4   |       5       |   6   |
| Beverage   | iced-tea | sprite |          | bird | hot-chocolate | juice |
| Pet        | cat      | pony   |         |      |               | goat  |
```

9. **Clue 1:** The owner of the snake is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta. Since the fanta is not yet placed, the snake can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the cat is at position 1, the snake must be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the sprite is at position 2, the snake must be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the pony is at position 3, the snake must be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Since the bird is at position 4, the snake must be in positions 5 or 6. Since the hot-chocolate is at position 5, the snake must be at position 6.

So, we update the table:
```
|            |    1     |   2    |    3     |  4   |       5       |   6   |
| Beverage   | iced-tea | sprite |          | bird | hot-chocolate | juice |
| Pet        | cat      | pony   |         |      |               | goat  |
```

10. **Clue 4:** The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta. Since the sprite is at position 2 and the fanta is at position 6, this fits.

11. **Clue 6:** The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the fanta is at position 6 and the bird is at position 4, this fits.

12. **Clue 12:** The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. This is already satisfied.

Finally, the beverage at position 3 must be iced-tea, as all other beverages are accounted for.

So, the final table is:
```
|            |    1     |   2    |    3     |  4   |       5       |   6   |
| Beverage   | iced-tea | sprite | cola     | bird | hot-chocolate | juice |
| Pet        | cat      | pony   | hedgehog|      |               | goat  |
```"	{'beverage': ['iced-tea', 'sprite', 'cola', 'bird', 'hot-chocolate', 'juice'], 'pet': ['cat', 'pony', 'hedgehog', '', '', 'goat']}	True	7	False

2. **Clue 6**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is the Italian.
   - Position 2: Italian, Hot-Chocolate

3. **Clue 7**: The person drinking milk is between the person drinking coffee and the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - Since the Italian is at position 2, the milk drinker must be between the coffee drinker and the Italian.
   - Coffee -> Milk -> Hot-Chocolate
   - Positions 1, 3, 2: Coffee, Milk, Italian

4. **Clue 1**: The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking milk.
   - This is already satisfied by the above arrangement.

5. **Clue 8**: The Russian is on the left of the person drinking milk.
   - Position 1: Russian

6. **Clue 9**: The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking milk.
   - This is already satisfied by the above arrangement.

   - Since the Italian is at position 2, the Japanese must be at position 3.
   - Positions 2, 3: Italian, Japanese

8. **Clue 3**: The Japanese is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
   - Since the Japanese is at position 3, they cannot be next to the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be at position 4.
   - Positions 3, 4: Japanese, Tea

9. **Clue 11**: The Nigerian is on the left or right of the Argentine.
   - Since the Nigerian is at position 6, the Argentine must be at position 5.

    - Positions 4: Mirinda

11. **Clue 13**: The Italian is on the left of the person drinking juice.
    - Since the Italian is at position 2, the juice drinker must be at position 4.
    - However, position 4 is already occupied by the Mirinda drinker.
    - This means the juice drinker must be at position 6, but the Nigerian is already there.
    - Recheck: The juice drinker must be at position 6, and the Nigerian must be at position 5.
    - Positions 4, 6: Mirinda, Juice

12. **Clue 14**: The Italian is on the left or right of the American.
    - Since the Italian is at position 2, the American must be at position 4.

Lv3-2x6-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step to find the correct arrangement of jobs and means of transport.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the left or right of the analyst.**
   - This means the analyst cannot be in position 5 (since the quad-bike is at position 6).

2. **The librarian is on the left of the person driving the airplane.**
   - The librarian cannot be in position 6 (since the airplane is to their right).

3. **The analyst is on the right of the person driving the bus.**
   - The analyst cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since they must be to the right of the bus driver).

4. **The electrician is on the left or right of the person driving the bus.**
   - The electrician cannot be in position 1 (since the bus driver is to their left).

5. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the far right.**
   - This means the quad-bike is in position 6.

6. **The journalist is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike.**
   - The journalist cannot be in position 6 (since the motorbike is to their right).

7. **The dressmaker is between the journalist and the electrician.**
   - This means the dressmaker is in the middle of the journalist and the electrician.

8. **The librarian is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.**
   - The librarian cannot be in position 1 (since the snowmobile is to their left).

Now let's place these constraints into the table:

1. Since the quad-bike is in position 6, the analyst cannot be in position 6.
2. Since the librarian is on the left of the airplane, the librarian cannot be in position 6.
3. Since the analyst is on the right of the bus, the analyst cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
4. Since the electrician is on the left or right of the bus, the electrician cannot be in position 1.
5. Since the person driving the quad-bike is on the far right, the quad-bike is in position 6.
6. Since the journalist is on the left or right of the motorbike, the journalist cannot be in position 6.
7. Since the dressmaker is between the journalist and the electrician, the dressmaker must be in the middle.
8. Since the librarian is on the right of the snowmobile, the librarian cannot be in position 1.

Let's start placing the elements based on the above constraints:

- Position 6: Quad-bike (from constraint 5)
- Position 1: Snowmobile (from constraint 8, since the librarian must be to its right)
- Position 2: Librarian (from constraint 8)
- Position 3: Analyst (from constraint 3, since the analyst must be to the right of the bus)
- Position 4: Electrician (from constraint 4, since the electrician must be on the left or right of the bus, and it can't be in 1 or 6)
- Position 5: Bus (from constraint 3, since the analyst must be to the right of the bus)

So we have:
- Position 1: Snowmobile
- Position 2: Librarian
- Position 3: Analyst
- Position 4: Electrician
- Position 5: Bus
- Position 6: Quad-bike

Now, let's assign the jobs and means of transport:

1. **Snowmobile**: Electrician (from constraint 4)
2. **Librarian**: Journalist (from constraint 2)
3. **Analyst**: Writer (from constraint 1, 3, and 4)
4. **Electrician**: Dressmaker (from constraint 7)
5. **Bus**: Analyst (from constraint 3)
6. **Quad-bike**: Journalist (from constraint 1 and 3)

Thus, the final solution is:

```

6. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.
7. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta.
8. The person drinking tea is between the person who's hobby is camping and the person drinking soy-milk.
9. The person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
10. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 2, we know that the person with the hobby of drawing drinks soy-milk.
2. From clue 3, we know that the person with the hobby of writing drinks juice.
3. From clue 1, the person with the hobby of writing (drinking juice) must be to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
4. From clue 4, the person with the hobby of camping is either at position 1 or 6.
5. From clue 5, the person with the hobby of camping is on the left of the person drinking tea.
6. From clue 8, the person drinking tea is between the person with the hobby of camping and the person drinking soy-milk (drawing).
7. From clue 9, the person with the hobby of camping is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
8. From clue 6, the person with the hobby of card-games is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.

### Positioning:
- Since the person with the hobby of camping is either at position 1 or 6, and they are on the left of the person drinking tea, and the person drinking tea is between the person with the hobby of camping and the person drinking soy-milk, the only possible positions for the person with the hobby of camping are 1 or 5.
- If the person with the hobby of camping is at position 1, then the person drinking tea would be at position 2, and the person drinking soy-milk (with the hobby of drawing) would be at position 3.
- This leaves positions 4 and 5 for the person with the hobby of writing and the person drinking juice, which matches clue 3.
- The person with the hobby of camping being at position 1 means the person drinking 7up must be at position 2, as per clue 10.
- Therefore, the person with the hobby of writing (drinking juice) must be at position 5, and the person drinking hot-chocolate must be at position 6.

### Final Table:
```
|            |    1    |    2    |    3     |     4      |    5    |       6       |

7. **Clue 7**: The person eating radish is on the far right.
8. **Clue 8**: The Nigerian is on the far left.
9. **Clue 9**: The American is on the left of the Chinese.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: Japanese is on the far right (position 6).
2. **Clue 7**: Radish is on the far right (position 6). Therefore, Japanese and Radish must be in positions 5 and 6 respectively.
   
   |               |     1      |     2      |     3      |    4    |     5     |    6     |

3. **Clue 6**: American is the person eating strawberry.
4. **Clue 3**: The Nigerian is on the left of the person eating strawberry.
5. **Clue 8**: The Nigerian is on the far left (position 1).

   |               |     1      |     2      |     3      |    4    |     5     | radish   |

6. **Clue 4**: The Polish person is the one eating cranberry.
7. **Clue 2**: The Polish person is on the left or right of the Japanese. Since Japanese is in position 6, Polish must be in position 4 or 5.

   Since the Polish person cannot be in position 6 (Japanese), let's place Polish in position 4 for now.

   |               |     1      |     2      |     3      |    4    |     5     | radish   |

   | Nationality   | nigerian   |            |            | polish  |           | japan    |

8. **Clue 1**: The person eating grapefruit is between the person eating cabbage and the person eating strawberry. The only possible positions for grapefruit are 2 or 3.

   - If grapefruit is in position 2, cabbage must be in position 1 and strawberry must be in position 3 (but strawberry is already in position 1).
   - Therefore, grapefruit must be in position 3, cabbage in position 2, and strawberry in position 4 (but strawberry is already in position 4).

   Let's adjust:

   |               |     1      |     2      |     3      |    4    |     5     | radish   |

9. **Clue 9**: The American is on the left of the Chinese. The only positions left for American and Chinese are 1 and 2.

   Since Nigerian is already in position 1, American must be in position 2 and Chinese in position 3.

Lv3-2x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the jobs and sports accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the bartender.
2. **Clue 2:** The bartender is between the person who's sport is snowboarding and the scientist.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the firefighter.
5. **Clue 5:** The lawyer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is soccer is on the far right.
7. **Clue 7:** The bartender is the person who's sport is volleyball.
8. **Clue 8:** The lawyer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
9. **Clue 9:** The scientist is on the right of the person who's sport is golf.
10. **Clue 10:** The dancer is on the far left.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The bartender is the person who's sport is volleyball (Clue 7).
- The bartender is between the person who's sport is snowboarding and the scientist (Clue 2). Therefore, the sequence involving the bartender must be:
  - [Person with snowboarding] - Bartender - Scientist
- The person who's sport is soccer is on the far right (Clue 6), so Soccer is in position 6.
- The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the bartender (Clue 1). Given that the bartender is between snowboarding and scientist, the person with snowboarding must be in position 1 or 5.
- The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding (Clue 3), so if snowboarding is in position 1, soccer must be in position 2. If snowboarding is in position 5, soccer must be in position 6, but since soccer is already in position 6, snowboarding must be in position 1.
- The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the firefighter (Clue 4), so the firefighter must be in position 3.
- The dancer is on the far left (Clue 10), so the dancer is in position 1.
- The person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 1, so the bartender is in position 2, and the scientist is in position 3.
- The lawyer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (Clue 5 and 8). Since the lawyer cannot be in position 1 (dancer) or 2 (bartender), and the scientist is in position 3, the lawyer must be in position 4 or 5.
- The scientist is on the right of the person who's sport is golf (Clue 9), so the person with golf must be in position 2 or 3. But since the bartender is in position 2, the person with golf must be in position 3, which is the scientist. So, the person with golf is in position 3.
- The remaining positions are for the lawyer and the person with skateboarding. Since the lawyer cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3, the lawyer must be in position 4. Thus, the person with skateboarding must be in position 5.

Lv3-2x6-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct pet and transport mode for each position. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.
2. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the person driving the subway.
3. The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person driving the ship.
4. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the person driving the ship.
5. The person driving the subway is on the left or right of the owner of the goat.
6. The person driving the van is on the right of the owner of the goldfish.
7. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the ferret.
8. The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
9. The person driving the subway is the owner of the goldfish.
10. The owner of the goat is between the owner of the goldfish and the person driving the scooter.
11. The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Owner of the Goldfish
From clue 9, the person driving the subway is the owner of the goldfish. Therefore:
- Position 5 (Subway) = Goldfish

#### Step 2: Use Clue 1
From clue 1, the owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since the owner of the goldfish is in position 5, the owner of the goat must be in position 4.
- Position 4 (Goat)

#### Step 3: Use Clue 10
From clue 10, the owner of the goat is between the owner of the goldfish and the person driving the scooter. Since the owner of the goat is in position 4 and the owner of the goldfish is in position 5, the person driving the scooter must be in position 3.
- Position 3 (Scooter)

#### Step 4: Use Clue 6
From clue 6, the person driving the van is on the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the owner of the goldfish is in position 5, the person driving the van must be in position 6.
- Position 6 (Van)

#### Step 5: Use Clue 3 and Clue 4
From clue 3, the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person driving the ship.
From clue 4, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the person driving the ship.

Since the person driving the ship cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 6 (as these are occupied by Goat, Goldfish, and Van respectively), the person driving the ship must be in position 2. This means the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 1.
- Position 1 (Ship)
- Position 2 (Snowmobile)

#### Step 6: Use Clue 7
From clue 7, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the person driving the ship is in position 1 and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2, the owner of the guinea-pig cannot be in position 1 or 2. The only possible positions for the owner of the guinea-pig are 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since the person driving the ship is in position 1, the owner of the guinea-pig can only be in position 3, 4, or 5. But since the person driving the ship is in position 1 and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 3 or 4. Given that the owner of the goat is in position 4, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 3.
- Position 3 (Guinea-pig)

#### Step 7: Use Clue 2 and Clue 11
From clue 2, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3 and the person driving the subway is in position 5, the owner of the guinea-pig is not on the left of the person driving the subway, so they must be on the right. This confirms the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3.

From clue 11, the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the person driving the ship is in position 1 and the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3, the person driving the ship is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.

Finally, from clue 8, the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the person driving the ship is in position 1, the owner of the hedgehog cannot be in position 1. The only remaining positions for the owner of the hedgehog are 2, 3, 4, or 5. Given that the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 2. This means the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 5.
- Position 2 (Hedgehog)
- Position 5 (Quad-bike)

#### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |    1     |     2     |    3     |     4      |   5    |     6      |
| Pet         |    Ship  |  Hedgehog | Guinea-pig |   Goat    | Quad-bike |   Van     |
| Transport   |   Snowmobile |   Scooter |    Subway  |  Chinchilla |   Van    |   Quad-bike |
```

However, there seems to be an inconsistency with the placement of the chinchilla and the ferret. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

1. Re-evaluate the placement of the chinchilla and ferret:
   - From clue 7, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3, the owner of the ferret must be in position 4 or 5. But the owner of the goat is in position 4, so the owner of the ferret must be in position 5.
   - From clue 8, the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 2, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 6.
   - From clue 2, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3 and the person driving the subway is in position 5, the owner of the guinea-pig is not on the left of the person driving the subway, so they must be on the right.
   - From clue 11, the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the person driving the ship is in position 1 and the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3, the person driving the ship is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - From clue 3, the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is in position 1 and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2, the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person driving the ship.
   - From clue 4, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the person driving the ship. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3 and the person driving the ship is in position 5, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the person driving the ship.
   - From clue 6, the person driving the van is on the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the owner of the goldfish is in position 5 and the person driving the van is in position 6, the person driving the van is on the right of the owner of the goldfish.

11. **Clue 6**: The person drinking iced-tea is to the left or right of the person drinking juice.

From the above clues, we can start filling in the table:

|            |       1       |     2     |   3   |    4     |    5    |     6      |
|------------|--------------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| Beverage   | hot-chocolate |           |       |          |         | iced-tea   |
| Hobby      | photography   |           |       |          |         | collecting |

Now let's fill in the rest based on the remaining clues:

- Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the far right (6), and they have the hobby of Sudoku, we place Sudoku in position 6.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person drinking water (clue 2). Since water is in position 6, hot-chocolate must be in position 1.
- The person drinking tea is on the far right (6), so tea must be in position 6.
- The person whose hobby is collecting drinks tea, so collecting must be in position 6.
- The person whose hobby is chess drinks juice, so juice must be in position 4.
- The person whose hobby is skydiving drinks water, so water must be in position 6.
- The person whose hobby is writing is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea, so writing must be in position 5.
- The person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking tea (clue 5). Since tea is in position 6, cola must be in position 5.
- The person drinking iced-tea is to the left or right of the person drinking juice (clue 6). Since iced-tea is in position 6 and juice is in position 4, iced-tea is to the right of juice.

Thus, the final table looks like this:

|            |       1       |     2     |   3   |    4     |    5    |     6      |

| Beverage   | hot-chocolate |           |       |  juice   |  cola   | iced-tea   |
| Hobby      | photography   |           |       |  chess   |  writing| collecting |

Now, let's fill in the missing values for the second row:

- Position 2: The only beverage left is cola.
- Position 3: The only beverage left is water.
- Position 4: The only beverage left is juice.
- Position 5: The only beverage left is cola.
- Position 6: The only beverage left is iced-tea.

Final solution:

5. **Clue 5**: The German owns the Goldfish.
   - German owns the Goldfish.

6. **Clue 6**: The owner of the Lizard is on the left or right of the Spanish.
   - Since the Spanish owns the Pony and is to the left of the Canadian, the Lizard must be owned by the Canadian.

7. **Clue 9**: The German is between the Japanese and the owner of the Lizard.
   - Since the Lizard is owned by the Canadian, the German must be in between the Japanese and the Canadian.
   - This means the order could be: Japanese, German, Canadian or Canadian, German, Japanese.

8. **Clue 4**: The owner of the Hamster is on the left or right of the Spanish.
   - Since the Spanish owns the Pony, the Hamster could be owned by either the German, the Japanese, or the Brazilian.

    - Since the Spanish owns the Pony, the Australian could be on either side of the Spanish.

Given these constraints, let's place the nationalities and pets:

- **Position 1**: Australian (since the Brazilian is on the right of the Japanese and the Brazilian cannot be at position 1)
- **Position 2**: Japanese (since the Brazilian is on the right of the Japanese)
- **Position 3**: German (between the Japanese and the owner of the Lizard)
- **Position 4**: Brazilian (owns the Bird and is on the right of the Japanese)

- Position 1: Australian (Hamster or Goldfish)
- Position 2: Japanese (Hamster or Goldfish)
- Position 3: German (Goldfish)
- Position 4: Brazilian (Bird)
- Position 5: Canadian (Lizard)
- Position 6: Spanish (Pony)

Since the German owns the Goldfish and the Brazilian owns the Bird, the remaining pets for the Australian and Japanese must be the Hamster and the Goldfish. Given that the German is between the Japanese and the Canadian, and the Canadian owns the Lizard, the only logical placement for the remaining pets is:

- Position 1: Australian (Hamster)
- Position 2: Japanese (Goldfish)

- **Position 5: Hot-Chocolate**
- **Position 6: 7up**

And for sports:
- **Position 1: Climbing**
- **Position 2: Baseball**
- **Position 3: Surfing**

This fits all the clues:
1. Surfing (6) is next to Baseball (2).
2. Soy-milk (1) is on the far left.
3. Climbing (1) is on the right of Parkour (4).
4. Soy-milk (1) is on the left of Rowing (2).
