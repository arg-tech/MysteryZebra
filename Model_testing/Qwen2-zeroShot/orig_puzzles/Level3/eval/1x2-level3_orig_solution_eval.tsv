Lv3-1x2-1	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given conditions and place the beverages accordingly.

1. The person drinking soy-milk is on the far left or far right.
2. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

Given the layout:

|            |    1     |   2   |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Beverage   |          |       |

Let's consider the two possible positions for the person drinking soy-milk:

### Case 1: Soy-milk is at position 1
- If soy-milk is at position 1, then fanta must be at position 2 (since fanta is to the right of soy-milk).
- This satisfies both conditions:
  - Soy-milk is on the far left.
  - Fanta is to the right of soy-milk.

The table would look like this:

|            |    1     |   2   |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Fanta |

### Case 2: Soy-milk is at position 2
- If soy-milk is at position 2, then fanta must be at position 1 (since fanta is to the right of soy-milk).
- However, this does not satisfy the condition that soy-milk is on the far left or far right because it would be in the middle.

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:

|            |    1     |   2   |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Fanta |

Here is the final solution table surrounded by `#############`:

| Job   | Architect| Electrician |
```

### Explanation:
- From the second clue: ""the electrician is on the right of the architect,"" we know that the order must be Architect (A) and then Electrician (E).
- From the first clue: ""the architect is on the left or right of the electrician"" is consistent with the second clue since it confirms that the architect can only be on the left side of the electrician.

Therefore, the only arrangement that satisfies both clues is:

- Position 1: Architect
- Position 2: Electrician

Lv3-1x2-3	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given logic puzzle step-by-step.

We have two people and two hobbies: camping and woodworking. The conditions provided are:

1. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping.
2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.

Let's denote:
- Person 1 as \( P1 \)
- Person 2 as \( P2 \)

And their hobbies as:
- Camping (C)
- Woodworking (W)

### Analyzing the Conditions:

**Condition 1:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping.
- This means that W can be either to the left or to the right of C.

**Condition 2:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
- This means that W must be to the left of C.

Combining both conditions, we see that W must be to the left of C.

### Possible Arrangements:

Given the constraints, there are only two possible arrangements for the hobbies:
1. \( P1 \) has woodworking (W), and \( P2 \) has camping (C).
2. \( P1 \) has camping (C), and \( P2 \) has woodworking (W).

However, the second arrangement contradicts Condition 2 (Woodworking must be on the left of Camping). Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:

- \( P1 \) has woodworking (W)
- \( P2 \) has camping (C)

### Final Solution Table:

This table represents the solution where the person with woodworking is on the left (Person 1) and the person with camping is on the right (Person 2)."	{'hobby': ['w', 'c']}	True	0	False
Lv3-1x2-4	"Sure, let's analyze the given information step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement.

### Given Information:
1. The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of house.
2. The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of soul.

### Analysis:
- From point 1, we know that if someone is a fan of soul, they must be on the left side of the person who is a fan of house.
- From point 2, we need to consider both possibilities for the relative positions of the fans of house and soul.

Given these points, the only way to satisfy both conditions is to have the fan of soul on the left and the fan of house on the right. This satisfies both conditions because:
- The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of house (point 1).
- The fan of house is on the right of the fan of soul (which is consistent with point 1).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |  1   |   2   |
| Music-Genre   | Soul | House |

This arrangement ensures that all given conditions are met."	{'music-genre': ['soul', 'house']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-5	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given puzzle step by step:

1. The manager is on the far left.
2. The scientist is on the left or right of the manager.

Given these clues, we can deduce the positions of the jobs as follows:

- Since the manager is on the far left (position 1), the only possible position for the scientist is position 2.

Therefore, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Manager
- Position 2: Scientist

Here is the final solution table:

Lv3-1x2-6	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given logic puzzle step by step.

We have two people and two hobbies: camping and card-games. We need to place these hobbies in the positions (1 and 2) based on the given conditions:

1. The person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
2. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.

Let's denote:
- Person 1 as P1
- Person 2 as P2
- Hobby 1 as H1
- Hobby 2 as H2

From condition 2, we can directly infer that:
- The person with the hobby of card-games must be on the left (position 1).
- The person with the hobby of camping must be on the right (position 2).

Therefore, the arrangement must be:
- Position 1: Card-games
- Position 2: Camping

Now, let's fill this into the table:

```
|         |     1      |    2    |

```

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-1x2-7	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given information and solve the puzzle step by step.

We have two people using two different means of transport: bike and bus. The conditions provided are:

1. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the bike.
2. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the bike (this is essentially the same as the first condition).

Given these conditions, we can deduce that the person driving the bus must be on the right side, and the person driving the bike must be on the left side.

Now let's fill in the table based on this deduction:

```markdown
|             |  1   |  2  |

This table satisfies both conditions:
- The person driving the bus (Bus) is on the right of the person driving the bike (Bike).
- The person driving the bus (Bus) is on the left or right of the person driving the bike (Bike).

Lv3-1x2-9	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given puzzle and constraints step-by-step.

We have two jobs: bartender (B) and social-worker (S). We need to place these jobs in positions 1 and 2, considering the following constraints:

1. The social-worker is on the left or right of the bartender.
2. The social-worker is on the left of the bartender.

From constraint 2, we can deduce that the social-worker must be in position 1 and the bartender must be in position 2. This satisfies both constraints because:
- The social-worker (S) is on the left of the bartender (B).
- The social-worker (S) is also on the left or right of the bartender (B), which is true since S is directly to the left of B.

So, the solution is:
- Position 1: Social-worker (S)
- Position 2: Bartender (B)

Explanation:
- From clue 2, we know that the person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
- Clue 1 reiterates this, confirming that the person drinking sprite must be either to the left or right of the person drinking cola, which aligns with clue 2.
