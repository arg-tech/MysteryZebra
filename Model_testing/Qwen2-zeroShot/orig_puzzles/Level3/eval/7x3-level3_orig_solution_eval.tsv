Lv3-7x3-4	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the final arrangement.

### Clues Breakdown:

10. **Clue 10:** The person eating pineapple is between the fan of soul and the security-guard.
11. **Clue 11:** The person drinking milk is on the left of the person eating cucumber.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions based on Clues 1, 2, 8, and 11
- From Clue 8: The person drinking milk watches comedy movies.
- From Clue 11: The person drinking milk is on the left of the person eating cucumber.
- From Clue 2: The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking milk.
- From Clue 1: The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person drinking cola.
- From Clue 10: The person eating pineapple is between the fan of soul and the security-guard.

We can start with:
```
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
```

#### Step 2: Assign the person drinking milk and the related positions
- Since the person drinking milk is on the left of the person eating cucumber (Clue 11), and the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking milk (Clue 2), we can place:
  - Adventure movies at position 1
  - Comedy movies at position 2 (drinking milk)
  - Cucumber at position 3 (eating)

So we have:
```
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
|  |  | Pineapple |
|  |  | Cola |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the person eating pineapple and the person drinking cola
- From Clue 1, the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person drinking cola.
- From Clue 10, the person eating pineapple is between the fan of soul and the security-guard.

Thus, we can place:
- Pineapple at position 1
- Cola at position 3
- Soul at position 2 (fan of soul)

So we have:
```
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Pineapple | Soul | Cola |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the person watching adventure movies
- From Clue 2, the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking milk.
- We already know the person drinking milk is at position 2 (comedy).

So, the person watching adventure movies must be at position 1.

So we have:
```
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Adventure | Soul | Cola |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the remaining positions for food, hobbies, jobs, movie genres, music genres, and pets
- From Clue 3, the person watching western movies has the hobby of baking.
- From Clue 5, the fan of salsa is on the left of the security-guard.
- From Clue 6, the owner of the bird is on the far right.
- From Clue 7, the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.
- From Clue 9, the owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the goat.
- From Clue 4, the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the paramedic.

We need to fit these into the remaining positions:

- Western movies and baking go together.
- Salsa, security-guard, and the security-guard's position relative to salsa.
- Bird goes on the far right.
- Traveling and the paramedic's position relative to the person drinking milk.

Given all constraints, the final arrangement is:
```
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Adventure | Soul | Cola |
| Nectarine | Pineapple | Cucumber |
| Baking | Traveling | Woodworking |
| Paramedic | Doctor | Security-guard |
| Comedy | Western | Adventure |
| D&B | Salsa | Soul |
| Goat | Hamster | Bird |
```

Lv3-7x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate items in the correct positions. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze Clues

1. **Clue 2:** The person eating tomato is on the far right.
2. **Clue 3:** The person eating plum is on the left of the fan of metal.
3. **Clue 6:** The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the bus.
4. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far right.
5. **Clue 9:** The owner of the turtle is on the far left.
6. **Clue 10:** The fan of metal is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
7. **Clue 11:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the fan of dubstep.

From these clues, we can infer:
- Tomato is eaten by the person in position 3 (far right).
- Plum is eaten by someone who is on the left of the rock-climber (clue 3).
- Rock-climbing is a hobby of the person in position 1 (far left) or position 2 (clue 11).
- Metal is a music genre preferred by the rock-climber (clue 10).

### Step 2: Place Known Information

1. **Position 1:** Turtle owner (clue 9)
2. **Position 3:** Tomato eater (clue 2)

### Step 3: Deduce Further

From clue 10:
- Rock-climbing is a hobby of the person in position 1 (Turtle owner).

From clue 11:
- The person with rock-climbing as a hobby is on the left of the fan of dubstep.

So, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2.

From clue 3:
- The person eating plum is on the left of the fan of metal.
- Since the fan of metal is in position 2 (dubstep), the person eating plum must be in position 1 (Turtle owner).

Now we have:
1. Turtle owner (Plum eater, Rock-climber)
2. Dubstep fan
3. Tomato eater

### Step 4: Use Remaining Clues

From clue 8:
- The person with chess as a hobby is on the left of the owner of the dog.
- Since the owner of the dog is not yet placed, and the Turtle owner is in position 1, the person with chess as a hobby must be in position 2 (Dubstep fan).

From clue 5:
- The person whose sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies.
- The person watching musical movies cannot be in position 1 (Turtle owner) because the person with chess as a hobby is in position 2.

From clue 6:
- The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the bus.
- If the person driving the bus is in position 1 (Turtle owner), the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 3 (Tomato eater).

From clue 4:
- The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
- The person watching horror movies must be in position 2 (Dubstep fan).

From clue 12:
- The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski.
- The person driving the jet-ski is in position 3 (Tomato eater), so the person with ice-hockey as a sport could be in position 1 (Turtle owner) or position 2 (Dubstep fan).

Since the person with chess as a hobby is in position 2 (Dubstep fan), the person with ice-hockey as a sport must be in position 1 (Turtle owner).

- The person whose sport is handball is on the left of the person whose sport is badminton.

Since Ice-Hockey is at the far right, Handball must be on the left of Badminton.

Since the person driving the tram is the one with the sport Ice-Hockey, and Ice-Hockey is on the far right, the person watching disaster movies and the person with the hobby of magic tricks must be on either side of the tram.

#### Clue 5:
- The person drinking hot chocolate is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.

Since Hot Chocolate is on the far right, Coffee must be on the left.
