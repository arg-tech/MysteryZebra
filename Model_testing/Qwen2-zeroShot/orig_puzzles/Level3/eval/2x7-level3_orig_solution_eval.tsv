1. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the owner of the rat.
2. The owner of the frog is the person watching western movies.
3. The person watching mystery movies is on the far left or far right.
4. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.
5. The person watching crime movies is on the right of the owner of the lizard.

10. The person watching family movies is the owner of the goat.
11. The person watching family movies is between the owner of the goldfish and the person watching epic movies.
12. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the rat.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Mystery Movies (Clue 3):**
   - Mystery movies must be in position 1 or 7.

2. **Western Movies (Clue 2):**
   - Western movies are watched by the owner of the frog.

3. **Fantasy Movies (Clue 1):**
   - Fantasy movies must be to the left of the owner of the rat.

4. **Crime Movies (Clue 5):**
   - Crime movies must be to the right of the owner of the lizard.

5. **Epic Movies (Clue 6):**
   - Epic movies must be to the left of the owner of the lizard.

6. **Mouse Owner (Clue 4 & 7):**
   - The owner of the mouse must be next to the owner of the frog.
   - The owner of the mouse must also be to the left of the owner of the frog.

7. **Snake Owner (Clue 8):**
   - The owner of the snake must be next to the owner of the goat.

8. **Family Movies (Clue 10):**
   - Family movies are watched by the owner of the goat.

9. **Goldfish and Epic Movies (Clue 11):**
   - The owner of the goldfish must be next to the person watching epic movies.

### Initial Placement:

- Since the person watching mystery movies is either at position 1 or 7 (Clue 3), let's assume they are at position 1 for now.

- Western movies are at position 2 (Clue 2).

- Fantasy movies must be to the left of the owner of the rat (Clue 1). Let's place them at position 3.

- Crime movies must be to the right of the owner of the lizard (Clue 5) and the owner of the lizard must be to the left of the owner of the epic movies (Clue 6). Let's place the lizard at position 4, then the owner of the crime movies at position 5.

- The owner of the mouse must be next to the owner of the frog and to the left of the owner of the frog (Clue 4 & 7). Let's place the mouse at position 6 and the frog at position 7.

- The snake owner must be next to the goat (Clue 8). The owner of the goldfish must be next to the person watching epic movies (Clue 11). Let's place the goat at position 3 (already taken by fantasy movies) or 7 (already taken by the frog), so the goat must be at position 5, and the snake at position 4.

- Finally, the family movies are watched by the owner of the goat (Clue 10) and must be between the owner of the goldfish and the person watching epic movies (Clue 11). Since the goat is at position 5, the only possible positions for the goldfish and epic movies are 4 and 6, respectively.

### Final Solution:

```

Lv3-2x7-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the nationalities and beverages in the correct positions. Let's go through the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The Mexican is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.**
2. **The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the Polish.**
3. **The person drinking lemonade is on the far left or far right.**
4. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right.**
5. **The Russian is in the middle.**
6. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking 7up.**
7. **The Mexican is on the left or right of the Nigerian.**
8. **The person drinking iced-tea is between the Polish and the Colombian.**
9. **The Nigerian is on the right of the Mexican.**
10. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.**
11. **The Chinese is on the right of the Colombian.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Russian in the middle.
- The Russian must be in position 4 (since it's the middle of 7).

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Beverage} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \_ \\
\hline
\text{Nationality} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \_ \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 2: Determine the positions for lemonade and hot-chocolate.
- Lemonade and hot-chocolate must be on the far left or far right.
- Since the Russian is in the middle, they can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.
- Therefore, lemonade and hot-chocolate must be in positions 1 and 7.

Let's assume:
- Lemonade is in position 1.
- Hot-chocolate is in position 7.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Lemonade} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\text{Nationality} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \_ \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 3: Use clue 6 to place soy-milk.
- Soy-milk must be on the left of 7up.
- Since lemonade is in position 1, soy-milk must be in position 2.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Lemonade} & \text{Soy-Milk} & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\text{Nationality} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \_ \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 4: Use clue 3 and 4 to place the remaining beverages.
- The person drinking lemonade is on the far left (position 1).
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right (position 7).
- Therefore, the remaining beverages are almond-milk, 7up, iced-tea, and milk.

Since soy-milk is in position 2 and 7up must be to its right, 7up must be in position 3.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Lemonade} & \text{Soy-Milk} & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\text{Nationality} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \_ \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 5: Place 7up in position 3.
- 7up is in position 3.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Lemonade} & \text{Soy-Milk} & \text{7up} & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\text{Nationality} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \_ \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 6: Use clue 2 to place almond-milk.
- Almond-milk is on the right of the Polish.
- Polish cannot be in position 5 or 6 (since Russian is in the middle), so Polish must be in position 3 (but 7up is already there).

Thus, Polish must be in position 5.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Lemonade} & \text{Soy-Milk} & \text{7up} & \text{Russian} & \text{Polish} & \_ & \_ & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\text{Nationality} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \_ \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 7: Use clue 8 to place iced-tea.
- Iced-tea is between the Polish and the Colombian.
- Polish is in position 5, so iced-tea must be in position 4.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Lemonade} & \text{Soy-Milk} & \text{7up} & \text{Russian} & \text{Polish} & \text{Iced-Tee} & \_ & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\text{Nationality} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \_ \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 8: Use clue 10 to place milk.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
- Since hot-chocolate is in position 7, milk must be in position 6.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Lemonade} & \text{Soy-Milk} & \text{7up} & \text{Russian} & \text{Polish} & \text{Iced-Tee} & \text{Milk} & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\text{Nationality} & \_ & \_ & \text{Russian} & \_ & \_ & \_ & \_ \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 9: Use clue 7 and 9 to place the nationalities.
- The Mexican is on the left or right of the Nigerian.
- The Nigerian is on the right of the Mexican.
- The Mexican cannot be in position 5 (Polish) or 6 (Iced-tea) or 7 (Hot-chocolate).

Thus, the Mexican must be in position 1 and the Nigerian in position 2.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Mexican} & \text{Nigerian} & \text{7up} & \text{Russian} & \text{Polish} & \text{Iced-Tee} & \text{Milk} & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\text{Spanish} & \text{Chinese} & \text{Russian} & \text{Polish} & \text{Colombian} & \text{Iced-Tee} & \text{Milk} & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Finally, the Spanish and Chinese must be placed as follows:

- Spanish is on the right of the Colombian.
- Chinese is on the right of the Colombian.

Thus, the final solution is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Mexican} & \text{Nigerian} & \text{7up} & \text{Russian} & \text{Polish} & \text{Iced-Tee} & \text{Milk} & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\text{Spanish} & \text{Chinese} & \text{Colombian} & \text{Polish} & \text{Colombian} & \text{Iced-Tee} & \text{Milk} & \text{Hot-Chocolate} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Lv3-2x7-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the hobbies and pets accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the owner of the ferret.**
   - RC (Rock Climbing) > F (Ferret)

2. **The owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games.**
   - H (Hamster) = CG (Card Games) - Left or Right

3. **The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.**
   - P (Puzzles) > RC (Rock Climbing)

4. **The owner of the hamster is in the middle.**
   - H (Hamster) is in position 4 (since there are 7 positions).

5. **The owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is card-games.**
   - B (Bird) = CG (Card Games)

6. **The person who's hobby is drawing is the owner of the snake.**
   - D (Drawing) = S (Snake)

7. **The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.**
   - F (Ferret) = R (Rat) - Left or Right

8. **The owner of the chinchilla is the person who's hobby is puzzles.**
   - C (Chinchilla) = P (Puzzles)

9. **The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the snake.**
   - B (Bird) > S (Snake)

10. **The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games.**
    - BG (Board Games) = VG (Video Games) - Left or Right

11. **The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the owner of the ferret.**
    - BG (Board Games) < F (Ferret)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 4, the owner of the hamster is in position 4.
   - H (Hamster) = 4

2. From clue 5, the owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - B (Bird) = 5 (CG)
   - CG (Card Games) = 5

3. From clue 8, the owner of the chinchilla is the person who's hobby is puzzles.
   - C (Chinchilla) = 3 (P)
   - P (Puzzles) = 3

4. From clue 2, the owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - Since H (Hamster) = 4 and CG (Card Games) = 5, H must be on the left of CG.
   - So, H (Hamster) = 4 and CG (Card Games) = 5.

5. From clue 1, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the owner of the ferret.
   - RC (Rock Climbing) > F (Ferret)
   - Since H (Hamster) = 4 and CG (Card Games) = 5, RC and F must be on either side of 4 and 5.

6. From clue 3, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
   - P (Puzzles) = 3
   - RC (Rock Climbing) > P (Puzzles)
   - So, RC must be on the right of 3 (Puzzles).
   - Possible positions for RC are 5 or 6.

7. From clue 9, the owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the snake.
   - B (Bird) = 5 (CG)
   - S (Snake) = 6 (D)
   - So, S (Snake) = 6.

8. From clue 7, the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
   - F (Ferret) = 2 or 3 (since H (Hamster) = 4 and CG (Card Games) = 5)
   - R (Rat) = 1 or 4 (since H (Hamster) = 4 and CG (Card Games) = 5)
   - Since RC (Rock Climbing) must be on the right of F (Ferret), and RC cannot be 3 (Puzzles), RC must be 5 and F must be 4.
   - So, F (Ferret) = 4 and R (Rat) = 3.

9. From clue 10, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
   - BG (Board Games) = 1 or 2
   - VG (Video Games) = 2 or 3
   - Since F (Ferret) = 4 and R (Rat) = 3, BG must be 1 and VG must be 2.
   - So, BG (Board Games) = 1 and VG (Video Games) = 2.

10. From clue 11, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the owner of the ferret.
    - BG (Board Games) = 1
    - F (Ferret) = 4
    - This confirms our placement.

Lv3-2x7-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The Argentine is on the far left**:
   - Position 1: Argentine

2. **The person drinking Sprite is on the far right**:
   - Position 7: Sprite

3. **The person drinking Juice is on the right of the German**:
   - If German is at position \(i\), then Juice is at position \(i+1\).

4. **The person drinking Hot-Chocolate is the Russian**:
   - Position: Russian (Hot-Chocolate)

5. **The Argentine is on the left or right of the Nigerian**:
   - Argentine is either in position 1 or next to the Nigerian.

6. **The person drinking Cola is on the left of the person drinking Lemonade**:
   - Cola must be to the left of Lemonade.

7. **The Nigerian is between the person drinking Lemonade and the person drinking 7Up**:
   - If Lemonade is at position \(j\), then 7Up is at position \(j+1\) and Nigerian is at \(j-1\).

8. **The person drinking Hot-Chocolate is on the left or right of the person drinking Sprite**:
   - Since Sprite is at position 7, Hot-Chocolate can be at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

9. **The Mexican is on the right of the Russian**:
   - Position: Mexican (right of Russian).

10. **The person drinking Hot-Chocolate is on the left or right of the Malaysian**:
    - Hot-Chocolate can be at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and Malaysian can be at positions 1 through 6.

11. **The person drinking Milk is on the right of the person drinking Juice**:
    - If Juice is at position \(k\), then Milk is at position \(k+1\).

### Putting the pieces together:

1. **Position 1: Argentine**
2. **Position 7: Sprite**

From clue 4, the Russian drinks Hot-Chocolate, so let's place it somewhere between 1 and 6.

From clue 8, Hot-Chocolate can be next to Sprite (position 7) or next to the person who drinks Sprite (position 6).

From clue 9, the Mexican is on the right of the Russian, so we need to place them accordingly.

From clue 3, the German is on the left of Juice, and from clue 11, the Milk drinker is on the right of the Juice drinker.

From clue 7, the Nigerian is between Lemonade and 7Up, and from clue 6, Cola is on the left of Lemonade.

Let's start placing the known values and deducing the rest:

- Position 1: Argentine
- Position 7: Sprite
- Position 4: Russian (Hot-Chocolate)
- Position 5: Mexican (since Mexican is right of Russian)

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions:

- Since the Nigerian is between Lemonade and 7Up, and considering the positions:
  - If Lemonade is at position 3, then 7Up is at position 4, but 4 is already taken by the Russian.
  - If Lemonade is at position 2, then 7Up is at position 3, and Nigerian is at position 1, which contradicts the Argentine being at position 1.
  - If Lemonade is at position 6, then 7Up is at position 7, which is already taken by Sprite.
  - Therefore, Lemonade must be at position 3, 7Up at position 4, and Nigerian at position 2.

- Since the German is on the left of Juice, and Juice cannot be at position 4 (Russian), it must be at position 2 or 3.
  - But position 2 is taken by the Nigerian, so Juice is at position 3, and German at position 2.

- Now, Cola must be to the left of Lemonade, so Cola is at position 1, and Lemonade is at position 3.

- Finally, Milk must be to the right of Juice, so Milk is at position 4.

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv3-2x7-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step 1: Analyze Constraints

1. The fan of r&b is on the left or right of the chef.
2. The fan of metal is on the left or right of the police-officer.
3. The fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of d&b.
4. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the entrepreneur.
5. The entrepreneur is on the far left or far right.
6. The chef is between the fan of salsa and the fan of r&b (2 positions apart).
7. The nurse is on the left of the police-officer.
8. The fan of rock is the project-manager.
9. The chef is on the left or right of the freelancer.
10. The fan of salsa is on the left of the pilot.
11. The fan of dubstep is on the far right.
12. The freelancer is on the left or right of the fan of hip-hop.
13. The fan of dubstep is the fan of dubstep.

### Step 2: Deduce Positions

From constraint 11:
- The fan of dubstep must be in position 7.

From constraint 4:
- The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the entrepreneur.
- Since the entrepreneur is either on the far left or far right, and the fan of hip-hop must be to the left of the entrepreneur, the entrepreneur cannot be in position 1 (because there would be no space for the fan of hip-hop).

From constraint 5:
- The entrepreneur is on the far left or far right.
- If the entrepreneur were on the far right (position 7), it would conflict with the fan of dubstep being in position 7. Therefore, the entrepreneur must be in position 1.

From constraint 4:
- The fan of hip-hop is in position 2 (since the entrepreneur is in position 1).

From constraint 2:
- The fan of metal is on the left or right of the police-officer.
- The police-officer cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since those positions are occupied by the entrepreneur and the fan of hip-hop). So, the police-officer could be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

From constraint 3:
- The fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of d&b.
- The chef is between the fan of salsa and the fan of r&b (2 positions apart).

From constraint 6:
- The chef is between the fan of salsa and the fan of r&b.
- Let's denote the positions of the fan of salsa, chef, and fan of r&b as S, C, and R respectively.
- Possible positions for S, C, and R are (1, 3, 5) or (3, 5, 7) but since the fan of salsa is on the left of the pilot, and the pilot cannot be in position 7, the only valid combination is (S, C, R) = (3, 5, 7).

From constraint 9:
- The chef is on the left or right of the freelancer.
- The chef is in position 5, so the freelancer can be in position 4 or 6.

From constraint 10:
- The fan of salsa is on the left of the pilot.
- The fan of salsa is in position 3, so the pilot can be in position 4, 5, or 6. But since the chef is in position 5, the pilot must be in position 6.

From constraint 8:
- The fan of rock is the project-manager.
- The project-manager must be in position 4.

From constraint 7:
- The nurse is on the left of the police-officer.
- The nurse can be in position 1, 2, or 3. But since the entrepreneur is in position 1, and the fan of hip-hop is in position 2, the nurse must be in position 3, and the police-officer must be in position 4 (but the project-manager is already in position 4).

12. The fan of classical is on the left or right of the fan of rock.
13. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
14. The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the fan of folk.
15. The fan of classical is on the left of the fan of indie.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions for specific genres based on direct clues.
- **Clue 2**: The fan of funk (horror) is in position 2.
- **Clue 4**: The fan of indie (superhero) is in position 4.
- **Clue 8**: The fan of pop is in position 1 or 7.
- **Clue 13**: The person watching horror (funk) is on the right of the fan of folk.
- **Clue 9**: The fan of funk (horror) is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
- **Clue 10**: The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of electronic.

From these, we can deduce:
- Position 2: Horror (funk)
- Position 4: Superhero (indie)
- Position 1 or 7: Pop

Since the fan of funk is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies, and the person watching horror (funk) is on the right of the fan of folk, the fan of folk must be in position 1, and the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Folk
- Position 2: Horror (funk)
- Position 3: Fantasy
- Position 4: Superhero (indie)

#### Step 2: Use additional clues to fill in remaining positions.
- **Clue 1**: The fan of folk (position 1) is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.
- **Clue 5**: The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies.
- **Clue 6**: The fan of classical is on the left or right of the fan of indie (position 4).
- **Clue 7**: The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the fan of electronic.
- **Clue 11**: The fan of classical is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
- **Clue 12**: The fan of classical is on the left or right of the fan of rock.
- **Clue 14**: The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the fan of folk (position 1).

Given that the fan of folk is in position 1, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 7 (since it must be on the right of the fan of folk).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Folk
- Position 2: Horror (funk)
- Position 3: Fantasy
- Position 4: Superhero (indie)
- Position 7: Mystery

#### Step 3: Determine the remaining positions.
- **Clue 5**: The person watching mystery movies (position 7) is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies.
- **Clue 6**: The fan of classical is on the left or right of the fan of indie (position 4).

Since the fan of indie is in position 4, the fan of classical must be in position 5.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Folk
- Position 2: Horror (funk)
- Position 3: Fantasy
- Position 4: Superhero (indie)
- Position 5: Classical
- Position 7: Mystery

#### Step 4: Finalize the remaining positions.
- **Clue 7**: The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the fan of electronic.
- **Clue 11**: The fan of classical is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
- **Clue 12**: The fan of classical is on the left or right of the fan of rock.

Given that the fan of classical is in position 5, the fan of rock must be in position 6.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Folk
- Position 2: Horror (funk)
- Position 3: Fantasy
- Position 4: Superhero (indie)
- Position 5: Classical
- Position 6: Rock
- Position 7: Mystery

#### Step 5: Assign the remaining genres.
- **Adventure**: Position 3 (Fantasy)
- **Disaster**: Position 6 (Rock)

Lv3-2x7-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and placing each job and nationality in the correct positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The Japanese is the accountant.
   - Japanese = Accountant

2. **Clue 2:** The Indonesian is on the right of the Brazilian.
   - Let's denote the position of the Brazilian as \( B \) and the Indonesian as \( I \). So, \( B < I \).

3. **Clue 3:** The American is the analyst.
   - American = Analyst

4. **Clue 4:** The Entrepreneur is on the left of the Indonesian.
   - If the Entrepreneur is \( E \), then \( E < I \).

5. **Clue 5:** The Brazilian is on the right of the Japanese.
   - This means the Japanese (Accountant) must be to the left of the Brazilian. Since we already know \( B < I \) and \( J < B \), we can place:
     - Japanese = 1, Brazilian = 3, Indonesian = 4 (as an example, but it will be adjusted based on other clues).

6. **Clue 6:** The Indonesian is the firefighter.
   - Indonesian = Firefighter

7. **Clue 7:** The Indonesian is on the left of the American.
   - Since Indonesian is the Firefighter and is on the left of the American, who is the Analyst, we can place:
     - Indonesian = 4, American = 7 (as an example, but it will be adjusted based on other clues).

8. **Clue 8:** The Argentine is on the right of the Librarian.
   - Let's denote the Librarian as \( L \) and the Argentine as \( A \). So, \( L < A \).

9. **Clue 9:** The Mexican is the Librarian.
   - Mexican = Librarian

10. **Clue 10:** The Entrepreneur is on the left or right of the Japanese.
    - Entrepreneur can be either before or after the Japanese, but since the Japanese is at position 1, Entrepreneur can be at position 2 or 7 (but not 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6).

11. **Clue 11:** The Doctor is on the left of the Librarian.
    - Doctor < Mexican (Librarian)

12. **Clue 12:** The Accountant is on the left or right of the Argentine.
    - Accountant (Japanese) can be on the left or right of the Argentine. Since Japanese is at position 1, Argentine can be at position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

Now let's place all the pieces together:

- Japanese (Accountant) = 1
- Brazilian = 3
- Indonesian (Firefighter) = 4
- American (Analyst) = 7
- Mexican (Librarian) = 5
- Argentine = 2 (since Argentine is on the right of the Librarian)
- Entrepreneur = 6 (since it's on the left or right of the Japanese, and not 1, 3, 4, 5, or 7)

- The only job left is Software Developer, which goes to the remaining position (position 2 for Argentine, and position 6 for Entrepreneur).

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |     1     |     2     |         3          |     4      |      5       |      6      |    7     |
| Job           | Accountant| Argentine | Software Developer | Firefighter| Librarian    | Entrepreneur| Analyst  |

11. The person whose sport is handball is on the left of the person eating watermelon.
12. The person eating corn is on the left of the person whose sport is swimming.
13. The person whose sport is cricket is the person eating watermelon.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From clue 2:** 
   - Tomato is eaten by the person whose sport is weightlifting.

2. **From clue 10 and 12:**
   - Corn is eaten by someone to the right of Tomato and also to the left of Swimming.
   - This means Corn must be in position 4, and Swimming must be in position 6.

3. **From clue 3:**
   - Cricket is on the far left or far right.
   - Since Corn is at 4 and Swimming is at 6, Cricket cannot be at 4 or 6. Therefore, Cricket must be at either 1 or 7.

4. **From clue 13:**
   - Watermelon is eaten by the person whose sport is Cricket.
   - So, if Cricket is at 1, Watermelon is at 1. If Cricket is at 7, Watermelon is at 7.

5. **From clue 8:**
   - Lemon is eaten by the person whose sport is Handball.
   - Handball is on the left of Watermelon (Cricket).

6. **From clue 11:**
   - Handball is on the left of Watermelon (Cricket).
   - If Cricket is at 1, then Lemon is at 2. If Cricket is at 7, then Lemon is at 6.

7. **From clue 4:**
   - Swimming is on the left of Cranberry.
   - Swimming is at 6, so Cranberry must be at 7.

8. **From clue 7:**
   - Cranberry is on the left or right of Lemon.
   - If Lemon is at 2 and Cranberry is at 7, this fits.
   - If Lemon is at 6 and Cranberry is at 7, this also fits.

9. **From clue 5:**
   - Eggplant is on the left or right of Tomato.
   - Tomato is at 2 (since Corn is at 4 and Swimming is at 6), so Eggplant can be at 1 or 3.

10. **From clue 1:**
    - Spinach is on the left or right of Baseball.
    - If Tomato is at 2, Baseball could be at 3 or 5.

11. **From clue 10:**
    - Corn is on the right of Tomato.
    - Corn is at 4, so Tomato must be at 2.

12. **From clue 6:**
    - Badminton is on the right of Swimming.
    - Swimming is at 6, so Badminton must be at 7, but we already have Watermelon at 7.

Given these constraints, let's finalize the positions:

- Cricket at 1, Watermelon at 1 (Cricket is the sport for Watermelon).
- Lemon at 2 (Handball is at 1, so Handball is at 2).
- Corn at 4.
- Swimming at 6.
- Cranberry at 7.
- Tomato at 2 (Corn is at 4 and Swimming is at 6).
- Eggplant at 3 (Eggplant is on the left or right of Tomato).
