Lv3-1x6-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and place the jobs accordingly:

1. **The bartender is on the far left.**
   - This means job 1 must be the bartender.

2. **The pilot is on the left of the project-manager.**
   - This means the pilot (job 2) must be to the left of the project-manager (job 3).

3. **The fisherman is on the left or right of the engineer.**
   - This means the fisherman (job 4) can either be immediately to the left or right of the engineer (job 5).

4. **The bartender is on the left or right of the pilot.**
   - Since the bartender (job 1) is already on the far left, the pilot (job 2) cannot be on the far left. Therefore, the pilot must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the bartender (job 1) must be to the left of the pilot.

5. **The pilot is on the right of the bartender.**
   - This confirms that the bartender (job 1) is on the far left, and the pilot (job 2) must be to the right of the bartender.

6. **The project-manager is on the left of the fisherman.**
   - This means the project-manager (job 3) must be to the left of the fisherman (job 4).

Now, let's combine these clues step-by-step:

- From clue 1, we know the bartender (job 1) is in position 1.
- From clue 2, the pilot (job 2) must be to the right of the bartender (job 1), so the pilot could be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- From clue 5, the pilot (job 2) must be to the right of the bartender (job 1). So, the pilot (job 2) must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- From clue 3, the fisherman (job 4) can be either to the left or right of the engineer (job 5).
- From clue 6, the project-manager (job 3) must be to the left of the fisherman (job 4).

Given these constraints, let's place the jobs:

1. Bartender (B)
2. Pilot (P)
3. Project-Manager (PM)
4. Fisherman (F)
5. Engineer (E)
6. Writer (W)

Since the bartender is in position 1, and the pilot must be to the right of the bartender, let's place the pilot in position 2. The project-manager must be to the left of the fisherman, and the fisherman can be either to the left or right of the engineer. The remaining positions will be filled with the engineer and the writer.

Let's try placing the project-manager in position 3, the fisherman in position 4, and the engineer in position 5, leaving the writer in position 6:

- Position 1: Bartender (B)
- Position 2: Pilot (P)
- Position 3: Project-Manager (PM)
- Position 4: Fisherman (F)
- Position 5: Engineer (E)
- Position 6: Writer (W)

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues:
- The bartender is on the far left.
- The pilot is on the left of the project-manager.
- The fisherman is on the right of the engineer.
- The bartender is on the left of the pilot.
- The pilot is on the right of the bartender.
- The project-manager is on the left of the fisherman.

So, the final solution is:

```

Lv3-1x6-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step and determine the correct order of the foods.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person eating watermelon is on the right of the person eating orange.**
   - This means if Orange (O) is at position X, Watermelon (W) must be at position X+1.
   
2. **The person eating watermelon is on the left of the person eating papaya.**
   - This means if Watermelon (W) is at position X, Papaya (P) must be at position X+1.
   
3. **The person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person eating lettuce.**
   - This means Apricot (A) can be immediately before or after Lettuce (L).

4. **The person eating papaya is on the right of the person eating watermelon.**
   - This is redundant as it reiterates clue 2.

5. **The person eating orange is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon.**
   - This is redundant as it reiterates clue 1.

6. **The person eating nectarine is on the left or right of the person eating apricot.**
   - This means Nectarine (N) can be immediately before or after Apricot (A).

7. **The person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating orange.**
   - This means if Nectarine (N) is at position X, Orange (O) must be at position X+1.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

From clues 1 and 2:
- We know that the sequence must include W, O, P in that order.
- Therefore, the sequence looks like: ..., O, W, P, ...

From clue 5 and 7:
- Since N is on the left of O, and O is to the right of W, we have: ..., N, O, W, P, ...

From clue 3:
- A can be either immediately before or after L.
- Considering the sequence so far: ..., N, O, W, P, ...
- The possible positions for A and L are: ..., N, O, W, P, A, L or ..., N, O, W, P, L, A.

From clue 6:
- N can be immediately before or after A.
- Considering the sequence: ..., N, O, W, P, A, L or ..., N, O, W, P, L, A.
- If N is immediately before A: ..., N, O, W, P, A, L.
- If N is immediately after A: ..., N, O, W, P, L, A.

### Final Sequence:

Given all the constraints, the only valid sequence that fits all the clues is:
- Nectarine (N)
- Orange (O)
- Watermelon (W)
- Papaya (P)
- Apricot (A)
- Lettuce (L)

So, the final arrangement is:
```
|        |    1    |    2    |     3     |   4    |     5      |   6    |

Lv3-1x6-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the foods accordingly. Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi.
2. The person eating lime is on the right of the person eating kiwi.
3. The person eating carrot is on the left of the person eating kiwi (conflicts with Clue 1).
4. The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person eating asparagus.
5. The person eating asparagus is on the left or right of the person eating lime.
6. The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person eating asparagus.
7. The person eating pomegranate is between the person eating cranberry and the person eating asparagus.

From Clues 1 and 3, we can deduce that the only way both can be true is if the sequence is:
- Kiwi is in position 1 or 2, Carrot is in position 3, and Lime is in position 4 or 5.

From Clue 2, since Lime is on the right of Kiwi, we have:
- Kiwi in position 1, Carrot in position 3, and Lime in position 4.

Now let's consider Clue 6:
- Pomegranate is on the right of Asparagus.

And from Clue 7:
- Pomegranate is between Cranberry and Asparagus.

Given these constraints, let's try to place them:

1. Kiwi (K) - Position 1
2. Carrot (C) - Position 3
3. Lime (L) - Position 4
4. Pomegranate (P) - Position 5 or 6
5. Asparagus (A) - Position 2 or 3 (but C is in 3)
6. Cranberry (Cr) - Position 2 or 6

Since Pomegranate must be on the right of Asparagus and also between Cranberry and Asparagus, we can deduce:
- Asparagus must be in position 2
- Pomegranate must be in position 5
- Cranberry must be in position 6

So the sequence would be:
- Position 1: Kiwi
- Position 2: Asparagus
- Position 3: Carrot
- Position 4: Lime
- Position 5: Pomegranate
- Position 6: Cranberry

Lv3-1x6-4	"Let's analyze and solve the puzzle step by step.

### Given Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the far left or far right.
2. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.
3. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
4. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
5. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
6. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1:
- Fishing is either in position 1 or 6.

#### Clue 3:
- If fishing is in position 1, then woodworking must be in position 2 (since it must be to the left of fishing).
- If fishing is in position 6, then woodworking must be in position 5 (since it must be to the left of fishing).

#### Clue 2:
- Photography must be to the left of dancing.

#### Clue 5:
- Dancing must be to the right of woodworking.

#### Clue 6:
- Gardening must be to the left of board-games.

#### Clue 4:
- Gardening can be to the left or right of board-games.

Let's consider both scenarios for fishing:

##### Scenario 1: Fishing in Position 1
- Woodworking must be in position 2.
- Photography and dancing must be such that photography is to the left of dancing, and dancing is to the right of woodworking.
- Gardening must be to the left of board-games.

Positions: 1 (Fishing), 2 (Woodworking)

Possible positions for photography, dancing, gardening, and board-games are 3, 4, 5, and 6.

- If gardening is in position 3, board-games must be in position 4, 5, or 6.
- If gardening is in position 4, board-games must be in position 5 or 6.
- If gardening is in position 5, board-games must be in position 6.

Given the constraints, let's try:

- Gardening in position 3, board-games in position 4.
- Photography in position 5, dancing in position 6.

This gives us:
1. Fishing
2. Woodworking
3. Gardening
4. Board-games
5. Photography
6. Dancing

Checking all clues:
1. Fishing is in position 1 (Clue 1 satisfied).
2. Photography (5) is to the left of Dancing (6) (Clue 2 satisfied).
3. Woodworking (2) is to the left of Fishing (1) (Clue 3 satisfied).
4. Gardening (3) is to the left of Board-games (4) (Clue 4 satisfied).
5. Dancing (6) is to the right of Woodworking (2) (Clue 5 satisfied).
6. Gardening (3) is to the left of Board-games (4) (Clue 6 satisfied).

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues.

Lv3-1x6-5	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the subway**.
2. **The person driving the airplane is on the left of the person driving the helicopter**.
3. **The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter**.
4. **The person driving the airplane is on the far left**.
5. **The person driving the trike is on the far right**.

From clue 4, we know:
- The airplane (A) is in position 1.

From clue 5, we know:
- The trike (T) is in position 6.

So, the table looks like this so far:
```
|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   |    A     |            |      |       |        |    T  |
```

Now, from clue 1:
- The trike (T) is on the right of the person driving the subway (S). Since T is in position 6, S must be in position 5.

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   |    A     |            |      |       |    S   |    T  |
```

From clue 2:
- The person driving the airplane (A) is on the left of the person driving the helicopter (H).

Since A is already in position 1, H must be in one of the positions 2 to 4. However, we need to check the remaining positions with other clues.

From clue 3:
- The person driving the taxi (X) is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (H).

Let's try placing H in each possible position and see if it fits all the clues.

### Trying H in position 2:
If H is in position 2, then X can be in position 3 or 4.

```
|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   |    A     |     H      |      |       |    S   |    T  |
```

For X:
- If X is in position 3, then the remaining positions for the subway (S) and taxi (T) would not fit the conditions.
- If X is in position 4, then the remaining positions for the subway (S) and taxi (X) would also not fit the conditions.

### Trying H in position 3:
If H is in position 3, then X can be in position 2 or 4.

```
|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   |    A     |            |    H |       |    S   |    T  |
```

For X:
- If X is in position 2, then the remaining positions for the subway (S) and taxi (T) would not fit the conditions.
- If X is in position 4, then the remaining positions for the subway (S) and taxi (X) would also not fit the conditions.

### Trying H in position 4:
If H is in position 4, then X can be in position 2 or 3.

```
|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   |    A     |            |      |    H  |    S   |    T  |
```

For X:
- If X is in position 2, then the remaining positions for the subway (S) and taxi (T) would fit the conditions.
- If X is in position 3, then the remaining positions for the subway (S) and taxi (X) would also fit the conditions.

Let's place X in position 2:
```
|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   |    A     |     X      |      |    H  |    S   |    T  |
```

This fits all the clues:
- A is on the far left.
- T is on the far right.
- X is on the left of H.
- S is on the left of T.
- X is on the left of H, which allows S to be in position 5.

Thus, the final solution is:
```
|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   |    A     |     X      |      |    H  |    S   |    T  |

Lv3-1x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and use it to determine the order of the movie genres.

### Clues:
1. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person watching horror movies.
2. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching epic movies.
3. The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person watching family movies.
4. The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
5. The person watching family movies is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The person watching family movies is on the far left.
   - This means position 1 is ""family"".

2. **Clue 4**: The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
   - Since we already know that the person watching family movies is in position 1, sports must be in position 2 or 3 (left of horror).

3. **Clue 1**: The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person watching horror movies.
   - This means horror cannot be in position 6 because there would be no space for musical to the right.

4. **Clue 2**: The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching epic movies.
   - This means sports cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since epic would need to be before sports, and there isn't enough space if sports is in position 2).

5. **Clue 3**: The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person watching family movies.
   - Since family is in position 1, scientific can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Given these constraints, let's place the genres step-by-step:

- Position 1: Family
- Position 2: Sports (since it needs to be left of horror and right of epic)
- Position 3: Epic (since it needs to be left of sports)
- Position 4: Horror (since it needs to be right of sports and left of musical)
- Position 5: Musical (since it needs to be right of horror)
- Position 6: Scientific (the only remaining genre)

### Final Order:
1. Family
2. Sports
3. Epic
4. Horror
5. Musical
6. Scientific

Lv3-1x6-7	"Let's break down the clues step by step to find the correct order of sports:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is golf is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's sport is water-polo.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is skiing is between the person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's sport is rugby.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**From Clues 1 and 2:**
- Golf is between Rugby and Water-Polo.
- Golf is also on the left or right of Water-Polo.
This means:
- If Golf is between Rugby and Water-Polo, then the only possible positions for these three sports are: Water-Polo - Golf - Rugby or Rugby - Golf - Water-Polo.

**From Clue 3:**
- Skiing is between Volleyball and Rugby.
- This means Skiing must be immediately before or after Rugby in the sequence.

**From Clue 6:**
- Skiing is on the left of Rugby.
So, the only possible position for Skiing and Rugby based on Clue 3 and Clue 6 is: Skiing - Rugby.

**Combining Clues:**
- We now have Skiing - Rugby and Water-Polo - Golf - Rugby (or Rugby - Golf - Water-Polo).
- Since Skiing is on the left of Rugby, we can place Skiing and Rugby as follows: Skiing - Rugby - Water-Polo - Golf (or Water-Polo - Golf - Rugby).

**From Clue 4:**
- Volleyball is on the right of Lacrosse.
- This places Lacrosse before Volleyball.

**From Clue 7:**
- Volleyball is on the left or right of Skiing.
- Since Skiing is already placed, Volleyball must be on the right of Skiing.

**Combining all clues:**
- Skiing - Rugby - Water-Polo - Golf (or Water-Polo - Golf - Rugby)
- Volleyball must be placed such that it is on the right of Lacrosse and on the right of Skiing.
- The only possible order is: Lacrosse - Volleyball - Skiing - Rugby - Water-Polo - Golf.

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv3-1x6-8	"Let's analyze and solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **The doctor is on the left or right of the videographer.**
2. **The doctor is on the far right.**
3. **The police-officer is on the left or right of the videographer.**
4. **The scientist is on the left of the engineer.**
5. **The bartender is on the left of the scientist.**

From clue 2, we know that the doctor must be in position 6 (the far right).

Now let's place the doctor:
```
|       |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |      5       |   6    |
| Job   |           |           |          |                |              | Doctor |
```

From clue 1, since the doctor is on the far right, the videographer must be either in position 1 or 5.

From clue 3, the police-officer is on the left or right of the videographer. Since the doctor is already in position 6, the police-officer cannot be in position 6. Therefore, if the videographer is in position 1, the police-officer could be in position 2 or 5. If the videographer is in position 5, the police-officer could be in position 4 or 5 (but position 5 is taken by the videographer), so the police-officer would have to be in position 4.

Let's test both scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Videographer in position 1**
```
|       |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |      5       |   6    |
| Job   | Videographer |           |          |                | Police-officer | Doctor |
```

Clue 3 states that the police-officer is on the left or right of the videographer. In this scenario, the police-officer can be in position 2 or 5. But since position 5 is already taken by the videographer, the police-officer must be in position 2.

```
|       |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |      5       |   6    |
| Job   | Videographer | Police-officer |          |                | Police-officer | Doctor |
```

This violates clue 3 as the police-officer is not next to the videographer. So, this scenario is invalid.

**Scenario 2: Videographer in position 5**
```
|       |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |      5       |   6    |
| Job   |           |           |          |                | Videographer | Doctor |
```

Clue 3 states that the police-officer is on the left or right of the videographer. In this scenario, the police-officer can be in position 4 or 5. But position 5 is taken by the videographer, so the police-officer must be in position 4.

```
|       |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |      5       |   6    |
| Job   |           |           |          | Police-officer | Videographer | Doctor |
```

Now we need to place the remaining jobs (bartender, scientist, and engineer) according to the clues:

- Clue 4: The scientist is on the left of the engineer.
- Clue 5: The bartender is on the left of the scientist.

Since the scientist must be to the left of the engineer, and the bartender must be to the left of the scientist, we can place them in positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's try placing the bartender in position 1, the scientist in position 2, and the engineer in position 3.

```
|       |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |      5       |   6    |
| Job   | Bartender | Scientist | Engineer | Police-officer | Videographer | Doctor |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues:
- The doctor is on the far right (clue 2).
- The doctor is on the left or right of the videographer (clue 1).
- The police-officer is on the left or right of the videographer (clue 3).
- The scientist is on the left of the engineer (clue 4).
- The bartender is on the left of the scientist (clue 5).

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|       |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |      5       |   6    |

|        |      1      |    2    |   3    |   4   |    5     |   6    |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Food   | Cauliflower| Garlic  | Eggplant| Carrot| Onion    | Avocado|
```

Here's how we arrived at this solution:

1. **The person eating cauliflower is on the far left.**
   - This means that cauliflower must be in position 1.

2. **The person eating avocado is on the right of the person eating cauliflower.**
   - Since cauliflower is in position 1, avocado must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

3. **The person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the person eating onion.**
   - This means eggplant and onion must be adjacent to each other.

4. **The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the person eating carrot.**
   - This means avocado and carrot must be adjacent to each other.

5. **The person eating onion is on the right of the person eating carrot.**
   - This means the order of carrot and onion must be carrot before onion.

Given these constraints, let's place the foods step by step:

- Position 1 is fixed with cauliflower.
- Position 6 must be avocado because it must be to the right of the person eating cauliflower (from constraint 1).
- Positions 2 through 5 must be filled with the remaining foods: garlic, eggplant, carrot, and onion.

From constraint 3, eggplant and onion must be adjacent and in the order carrot before onion. From constraint 4, avocado and carrot must also be adjacent. Given that avocado is in position 6, carrot must be in position 4 or 5.

Let's try placing them:

- If carrot is in position 4, then onion must be in position 5 (since they are adjacent and in the order carrot before onion). This leaves positions 2 and 3 for garlic and eggplant, which can be placed in any order as long as they are adjacent.

So, one possible arrangement is:
- Position 1: Cauliflower
- Position 2: Garlic
- Position 3: Eggplant
- Position 4: Carrot
- Position 5: Onion
- Position 6: Avocado

This satisfies all the given conditions."	{'food': ['cauliflower', 'garlic', 'eggplant', 'carrot', 'onion', 'avocado']}	True	1	False
Lv3-1x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and place the beverages accordingly:

1. **The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
   - This means that if we have M (mirinda) and H (hot-chocolate), M must be to the left of H.

2. **The person drinking 7up is on the far left.**
   - This means 7up must be in position 1.

3. **The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means iced-tea can only be in position 1 or 6.

4. **The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.**
   - Since 7up is in position 1, it cannot be to the right of any other beverage, so coffee must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

5. **The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.**
   - Mirinda can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not 6.

Let's start placing the beverages based on these clues:

- **Position 1**: 7up (from clue 2)
- **Position 6**: iced-tea (since iced-tea must be either in position 1 or 6, and position 1 is already taken by 7up)

Now we need to place the remaining beverages (coffee, hot-chocolate, mirinda, and tea) in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

From clue 3, since iced-tea is in position 6, the iced-tea cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the iced-tea must be in position 6.

From clue 1, mirinda must be to the left of hot-chocolate. So mirinda cannot be in position 6, and hot-chocolate cannot be in position 1. 

From clue 4, 7up is in position 1, and coffee can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. From clue 5, mirinda must be to the left or right of coffee. 

Given the constraints, let's try placing the beverages:

- Position 1: 7up
- Position 6: iced-tea

Now we need to place coffee, mirinda, hot-chocolate, and tea in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Since mirinda must be to the left of hot-chocolate, let's try placing them:

- If mirinda is in position 2, hot-chocolate must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- If mirinda is in position 3, hot-chocolate must be in position 4 or 5.
- If mirinda is in position 4, hot-chocolate must be in position 5.

We also know from clue 4 that coffee can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and from clue 5, mirinda must be to the left or right of coffee.

Let's test the possible placements:

- If mirinda is in position 2, then hot-chocolate can be in position 3, 4, or 5. Coffee can be in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's try:
  - Position 2: mirinda
  - Position 3: coffee
  - Position 4: hot-chocolate
  - Position 5: tea

This satisfies all the conditions:
- Mirinda (2) is to the left of hot-chocolate (4).
- 7up (1) is to the left of coffee (3).
- Coffee (3) is to the left of hot-chocolate (4).
- Mirinda (2) is to the left of coffee (3).

So, the final arrangement is:

```
|            |  1  |   2    |    3    |       4       |  5  |    6     |
| Beverage   | 7up | mirinda| coffee  | hot-chocolate | tea | iced-tea |
