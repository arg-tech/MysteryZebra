- **Beverage 5: Juice** must be in position 5 because the only remaining beverage is juice.

Let's start filling in the table with these clues:

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |

| Movie-Genre   |          |                    |             |            |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |                    |             |            |            |
| Transport     |          |                    |             |            |            |

**Step 1: Place the fan of gospel and the person watching mystery movies.**

- Clue 1: The person watching mystery movies is the fan of gospel.
- Clue 15: The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies (gospel fan).

So, the person watching mystery movies is in position 3, and the fan of gospel is also in position 3.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |
| Food          |          |                    |             |            |            |
| Job           |          |                    |             |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |          |                    | gospel      |            |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |                    | mystery     |            |            |
| Transport     |          |                    |             |            |            |

**Step 2: Place the musician, potato eater, and the fan of salsa.**

- Clue 3: The musician is the person eating potato.
- Clue 10: The person eating peas is the one watching western movies.
- Clue 8: The fan of salsa is the person watching spy movies.

Since the person eating potato (musician) is on the far left or far right (Clue 4), and the person eating peas (watching western movies) must be in a position that allows for the person eating potato to be at the far end, let's place the potato eater (musician) in position 1.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |

| Movie-Genre   |          |                    | gospel      |            |            |

The person watching western movies (peas eater) must be in position 4.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |

The person watching spy movies (salsa fan) is in position 2.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |
| Food          | potato   | salsa              |             | peas       |            |

| Movie-Genre   |          |                    | gospel      |            |            |
| Music-Genre   | salsa    | spy                | mystery     |            |            |
| Transport     |          |                    |             |            |            |

**Step 3: Place the fan of trance and the fans of r&b and jazz.**

- Clue 9: The fan of trance is between the person eating cauliflower and the person eating strawberry.
- Clue 5: The fan of r&b is on the right of the fan of gospel.
- Clue 14: The fan of jazz is the person driving the car.

Since the person driving the car (jazz fan) is in position 5, the fan of jazz is in position 5.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |
| Food          | potato   | salsa              |             | peas       | jazz       |
| Job           |          |                    |             |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |          | spy                | gospel      |            |            |

The fan of gospel is in position 3, so the fan of r&b must be in position 4.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |

| Job           |          |                    |             |            |            |

The fan of trance is between the person eating cauliflower and the person eating strawberry, and since the person eating strawberry is on the far left or far right (Clue 4), the person eating strawberry must be in position 1.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |

The person eating cauliflower must be in position 2.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |
| Food          | strawberry | cauliflower |             | peas       | jazz       |
| Job           |          |                    |             |            |            |

**Step 4: Place the remaining jobs and foods.**

- Clue 11: The software-developer is on the left of the dressmaker.
- Clue 2: The dressmaker is on the left of the person watching epic movies.

Since the software-developer must be on the left of the dressmaker, and the dressmaker must be on the left of the person watching epic movies, the only positions left for the software-developer and dressmaker are positions 1 and 2.

Since position 1 is already taken by the strawberry eater, the software-developer must be in position 2 and the dressmaker in position 3.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |

The person watching epic movies must be in position 4.

|               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |

Lv3-5x5-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information into the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 13:** The police-officer is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 14:** The person who's sport is surfing is on the far left.
3. **Clue 15:** The Malaysian is on the far right.

From these three clues, we can deduce that:
- The far left position must be the person who surfs.
- The far right position must be the Malaysian.
- The police-officer must be either in position 1 or 5.

Since the person who surfs is on the far left and the Malaysian is on the far right, let's denote:
- Position 1: Surfer
- Position 5: Malaysian
- Position 13 (police-officer) is either 1 or 5.

Given that the police-officer cannot be in position 1 because the surfer is there, the police-officer must be in position 5.

So, we have:
```
|               |       1        |    2     |     3      |     4      |      5      |

```

4. **Clue 10:** The police-officer is the person driving the skateboard.
- Position 5 (Malaysian) drives the train.
- Position 1 (Surfer) drives the skateboard.

So, we have:

   - From Clue 1, the skateboard driver is on the left or right of the project-manager.
   - From Clue 5, the person driving the train is in the middle (Position 3).

2. **Position of Soy-Milk and Chef**:
   - From Clue 2, the person drinking soy-milk is the chef.
   - From Clue 6, the person drinking soy-milk is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the chef is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile (Clue 14), and the person with biathlon is on the far right, the chef must be in Position 4.
   - Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk is in Position 1.

3. **Position of Almond-Milk**:
   - From Clue 13, the person drinking almond-milk is on the far left or far right.
   - From Clue 15, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
   - Since the person drinking soy-milk is in Position 1, the person drinking almond-milk must be in Position 5.

4. **Position of Sprite and Dressmaker**:
   - From Clue 4, the person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the dressmaker.
   - From Clue 7, the person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
   - The person with biathlon is in Position 5, so the person with surfing cannot be in Position 5.
   - The person with surfing must be in Position 1 or 2, and the person drinking 7up must be in Position 3 or 4.
   - Since the person drinking soy-milk is in Position 1, the person with surfing must be in Position 2, and the person drinking 7up must be in Position 3.
   - Therefore, the person drinking sprite is in Position 4, and the dressmaker is in Position 2.

5. **Position of Funk and Rock**:
   - From Clue 8, the fan of soul is between the fan of punk and the fan of rock.
   - From Clue 9, the person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the fan of soul.
   - The person with tennis cannot be in Position 1 or 5 (since the person with biathlon is in Position 5 and the person with surfing is in Position 2).
   - Therefore, the person with tennis must be in Position 4, and the fan of soul must be in Position 3.
   - The fan of punk must be in Position 2, and the fan of rock must be in Position 1.

6. **Position of Snowmobile and Jet-Ski**:
   - From Clue 12, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the videographer.
   - From Clue 14, the chef is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - The chef is in Position 4, so the person driving the snowmobile must be in Position 1.
   - Therefore, the person driving the jet-ski is in Position 2, and the videographer is in Position 3.

7. **Final Placement**:
   - Beverage: 7up, almond-milk, soy-milk, sprite, water
