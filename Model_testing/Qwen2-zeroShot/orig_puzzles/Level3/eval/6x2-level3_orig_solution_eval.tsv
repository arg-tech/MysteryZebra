Lv3-6x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and place the information into the table step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the goldfish is on the far right.
2. The person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person whose sport is rowing.
3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating strawberry.
4. The analyst is on the right of the turkish.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Goldfish Owner
- From clue 1, the owner of the goldfish is in position 2 (the far right).

|               |    1     |     2      |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| Beverage      |          | goldfish   |
| Food          |          |            |
| Job           |          |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |
| Pet           |          | goldfish   |
| Sport         |          |            |

#### Step 2: Place the Analyst and Turkish
- From clue 4, the analyst is to the right of the Turkish. Since we only have two positions for each category, the analyst must be in position 2 and the Turkish in position 1.

|               |    1     |     2      |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| Beverage      |          | goldfish   |
| Food          |          |            |
| Job           | Turkish  | analyst    |
| Nationality   |          |            |
| Pet           |          | goldfish   |
| Sport         |          |            |

#### Step 3: Place the Kiwi and Rowing
- From clue 2, the person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person whose sport is rowing.
- We need to consider the possible positions for these two. Since we already have the Turkish and Analyst in their positions, we can deduce that the person eating kiwi and the one playing rowing should be in positions 1 and 2 (or vice versa) but not next to each other due to the clue.

#### Step 4: Place the Soy Milk and Strawberry
- From clue 3, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating strawberry.
- This means the person drinking soy milk must be in position 1 and the person eating strawberry in position 2.

|               |    1     |     2      |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| Beverage      | soy-milk | goldfish   |
| Food          | kiwi     |            |
| Job           | Turkish  | analyst    |
| Nationality   |          |            |
| Pet           |          | goldfish   |
| Sport         | rowing   |            |

#### Step 5: Determine Remaining Categories
- The remaining categories (Beverage: iced-tea, Food: strawberry, Job: manager, Nationality: British, Pet: frog, Sport: lacrosse) need to be placed.

Since the person eating kiwi (kiwi) is on the left of the person playing rowing, and the person drinking soy milk is on the left of the person eating strawberry, the only remaining positions are:

- The person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1 (since soy milk is there).
- The person eating strawberry must be in position 2 (since kiwi is there).
- The person playing lacrosse must be in position 1 (since rowing is there).
- The person with the British nationality must be in position 1 (since Turkish is there).
- The person with the manager job must be in position 2 (since analyst is there).
- The person with the frog pet must be in position 1 (since goldfish is there).

|               |    1     |     2      |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| Beverage      | iced-tea  | goldfish   |
| Food          | kiwi     | strawberry |
| Job           | manager  | analyst    |
| Nationality   | British  | turkish    |
| Pet           | frog     | goldfish   |

Lv3-6x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the table based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct placement step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the far right.
2. The German is on the left of the fan of pop.
3. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of pop.
4. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating mango.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the guinea-pig is on the far right (position 2).
  - This means the guinea-pig is in position 2 for the ""Pet"" column.

#### Clue 2:
- The German is on the left of the fan of pop.
  - This means the German cannot be in position 2 because the guinea-pig is there.
  - The German must be in position 1.

#### Clue 3:
- The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of pop.
  - Since the German is in position 1 and the guinea-pig is in position 2, the fan of pop must be in either position 1 or 2.
  - Given that the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of pop, and considering the positions, the fan of pop must be in position 2 (since the German is in position 1).

#### Clue 4:
- The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating mango.
  - This means the person eating mango cannot be in position 2 (where the guinea-pig is), so the person eating mango must be in position 1.
  - Therefore, the person driving the taxi must be in position 2.

### Filling in the Table:

Based on the above deductions, we can start filling in the table:

|               |     1     |     2      |

Lv3-6x2-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each attribute (beverage, hobby, movie genre, music genre, nationality, and sport) into the table based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Hobby**: The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
2. **Movie-Genre**: The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing.
3. **Music-Genre**: The fan of reggae is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.
4. **Beverage**: The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the Chinese.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Hobby**:
   - Singing (S) is on the right of woodworking (W).
   - Possible pairs: (W, S)

2. **Sport**:
   - The person whose sport is climbing (C) has reggae (R) on its left.
   - Possible pairs: (R, C)
   - The person whose sport is skiing (Sk) has a documentary (D) on its left or right.
   - Possible pairs: (D, Sk) or (Sk, D)

3. **Beverage**:
   - Lemonade (L) is on the left of the Chinese (Ch).
   - Possible pairs: (L, Ch)

Now let's try to fit these together:

- Since (W, S) must be true for hobby, let's assume W is in position 1 and S is in position 2 for now.
- For sport, since (R, C) must be true, and (D, Sk) or (Sk, D) must also be true, let's assume R is in position 1 and C is in position 2 for now.
- For beverage, L is in position 1 and Ch is in position 2.

Let's test these assumptions:

```
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |     L       |     Ch      |
| Hobby         |     W       |     S       |
| Movie-Genre   |            ? |            ? |
| Music-Genre   |            ? |            ? |
| Nationality   |            ? |            ? |
| Sport         |     R       |     C       |
```

Now we need to fill in the remaining attributes while satisfying all the conditions:

- From clue 2, the person watching documentary movies (D) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing (Sk). Given our current arrangement, D must be in position 1 and Sk in position 2 for this to work.
- From clue 3, the fan of reggae (R) is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing (C), which fits with our current arrangement.

So far, we have:

```
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |     L       |     Ch      |
| Hobby         |     W       |     S       |
| Movie-Genre   |     D       |     Sk      |
| Music-Genre   |            ? |            ? |
| Nationality   |            ? |            ? |
| Sport         |     R       |     C       |
```

Finally, we need to assign the remaining attributes:

- Coffee (Co) and Lemonade (L) are already assigned.
- Indie (I) and Reggae (R) are already assigned.
- Chinese (Ch) and Indonesian (Id) are already assigned.
- Documentaries (D) and Satire (Sa) are already assigned.
- Climbing (C) and Skiing (Sk) are already assigned.

Thus, the only remaining pair for movie genre and music genre is:

```
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |     L       |     Ch      |
| Hobby         |     W       |     S       |
| Movie-Genre   |     D       |     Sa      |
| Music-Genre   |     I       |     R       |
| Nationality   |     Id      |     Ch      |
| Sport         |     R       |     C       |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |     L       |     Ch      |

| Sport         |     R       |     C       |
```"	{'beverage': ['l', 'ch'], 'hobby': ['w', 's'], 'movie-genre': ['d', 'sa'], 'music-genre': ['i', 'r'], 'nationality': ['id', 'ch'], 'sport': ['r', 'c']}	True	0	False
Lv3-6x2-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

1. **Hobbies**: Puzzles, Sudoku
2. **Jobs**: Lawyer, Police Officer
3. **Movie-Genres**: Martial-Arts, Scientific
4. **Music-Genres**: Salsa, Soul
5. **Pets**: Dog, Rabbit

### Constraints:
1. The person driving the tram is on the right of the lawyer.
2. The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is Sudoku.
3. The owner of the rabbit is on the far left or far right.
4. The fan of salsa is the person whose hobby is puzzles.
5. The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Owner of the Rabbit
Since the owner of the rabbit is either on the far left or far right, let's place them in position 1 (far left) and check if it works out:
```
| Hobby         |      1       |       2        |
| Job           |              |                |
| Movie-Genre   |              |                |
| Music-Genre   |              |                |
| Pet           | Rabbit       |                |
| Transport     |              |                |
```

#### Step 2: Place the Person Driving the Tram
According to constraint 1, the person driving the tram must be on the right of the lawyer. Let's assume the lawyer is in position 1 and the person driving the tram is in position 2:
```
| Hobby         |      1       |       2        |
| Job           | Lawyer       | Tram Driver    |
| Movie-Genre   |              |                |

| Pet           | Rabbit       |                |
| Transport     | Skateboard   | Tram           |
```

#### Step 3: Place the Fan of Salsa
According to constraint 4, the fan of salsa is the person whose hobby is puzzles. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles cannot be the owner of the rabbit (constraint 3), they must be in position 2:
```
| Hobby         |      1       |       2        |
| Job           | Lawyer       | Tram Driver    |

| Transport     | Skateboard   | Tram           |
```

#### Step 4: Place the Person with the Hobby of Sudoku
Since the person with the hobby of Sudoku is on the left of the person watching scientific movies (constraint 2), and the person with the hobby of puzzles is already in position 2, the person with the hobby of Sudoku must be in position 1:
```
| Hobby         | Puzzles      | Sudoku        |
| Job           | Lawyer       | Tram Driver   |
| Movie-Genre   |              |               |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa        | Soul          |
| Pet           | Rabbit       |               |
| Transport     | Skateboard   | Tram          |
```

#### Step 5: Place the Person Watching Scientific Movies
According to constraint 2, the person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is Sudoku. Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2:
```
| Hobby         | Puzzles      | Sudoku        |
| Job           | Lawyer       | Tram Driver   |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts | Scientific    |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa        | Soul          |
| Pet           | Rabbit       |               |
| Transport     | Skateboard   | Tram          |
```

#### Step 6: Place the Person with the Job of Police Officer
Since the job of police officer is not assigned yet, and the lawyer is already in position 1, the police officer must be in position 2:
```
| Hobby         | Puzzles      | Sudoku        |
| Job           | Lawyer       | Police Officer|
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts | Scientific    |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa        | Soul          |
| Pet           | Rabbit       |               |
| Transport     | Skateboard   | Tram          |
```

#### Step 7: Place the Owner of the Dog
According to constraint 5, the owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the rabbit is in position 1, the owner of the dog must be in position 2:
```
| Hobby         | Puzzles      | Sudoku        |
| Job           | Lawyer       | Police Officer|
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts | Scientific    |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa        | Soul          |
| Pet           | Dog          | Rabbit        |
| Transport     | Skateboard   | Tram          |
```

### Final Solution Table:

Lv3-6x2-5	"Let's break down the information and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

1. **Beverages**: Sprite, Water
2. **Food**: Avocado, Peas
3. **Hobbies**: Photography, Reading
4. **Movie-Genres**: Fantasy, Western
5. **Sport**: Badminton, Lacrosse
6. **Transport**: Motorbike, Scooter

### Given Clues:
1. The person drinking water is on the right of the person watching Western movies.
2. The person whose hobby is photography is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.
3. The person driving the scooter is the person whose sport is lacrosse.
4. The person whose hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.
5. The person watching Western movies is the person eating avocado.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 5:
- The person watching Western movies is the person eating avocado.
- This means:
  - Western movies → Avocado

#### Clue 1:
- The person drinking water is on the right of the person watching Western movies.
- Since the person watching Western movies is the one eating avocado, the person drinking water must be to their right.
- This means:
  - Water → Right of Avocado

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the scooter is the person whose sport is lacrosse.
- This means:
  - Lacrosse → Scooter

#### Clue 2:
- The person whose hobby is photography is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.
- This means:
  - Photography → Left of Motorbike

#### Clue 4:
- The person whose hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.
- Since we don't yet know the exact positions, let's keep this in mind for now.

### Arranging the Information:
- We know the following pairs so far:
  - Western movies → Avocado
  - Water → Right of Avocado
  - Lacrosse → Scooter
  - Photography → Left of Motorbike

Since Western movies and Avocado are fixed, and Water is to the right of Avocado, we can place them as follows:
```
|      1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | Water     |
| Food        | Avocado   |
| Hobby       |           |
| Movie-Genre | Western   |
| Sport       |           |
| Transport   |           |
```

Next, since Lacrosse is with the Scooter, we can place them as follows:
```
|      1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | Water     |
| Food        | Avocado   |
| Hobby       |           |
| Movie-Genre | Western   |
| Sport       | Lacrosse  |
| Transport   | Scooter   |
```

Now, we need to fit Photography and Motorbike into the remaining slots. Photography must be to the left of Motorbike. Since we don't have any other constraints for these two, we can place them in the remaining slots:
```
|      1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | Water     |
| Food        | Avocado   |
| Hobby       | Photography|
| Movie-Genre | Western   |
| Sport       | Lacrosse  |
| Transport   | Scooter   |
```

For the remaining slots, we need to fit Sprite and Reading. Since the person whose hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person drinking Sprite, and we have no other constraints, we can place them as follows:
```
|      1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | Water     |
| Food        | Avocado   |
| Hobby       | Photography|
| Movie-Genre | Western   |
| Sport       | Lacrosse  |
| Transport   | Scooter   |
```

Finally, the person drinking Sprite would be in position 1 (since it fits the given condition):
```
|      1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | Sprite    |
| Food        | Avocado   |
| Hobby       | Photography|
| Movie-Genre | Western   |
| Sport       | Lacrosse  |
| Transport   | Scooter   |
```

And the person with the hobby of reading would be in position 2:
```
|      1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | Sprite    |
| Food        | Avocado   |
| Hobby       | Reading   |
| Movie-Genre | Western   |
| Sport       | Lacrosse  |
| Transport   | Scooter   |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|      1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | Sprite    |
| Food        | Avocado   |
| Hobby       | Reading   |
| Movie-Genre | Western   |

Lv3-6x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information into the table. Let's break down the clues one by one:

### Clue Analysis

1. **The Malaysian is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.**
   - This means if someone's hobby is magic-tricks, the Malaysian is immediately to their right.

2. **The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies.**
   - This means there is either a carrot eater next to a horror movie watcher or they are directly adjacent.

3. **The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.**
   - This means the horror movie watcher is to the right of the person with the hobby of magic tricks.

4. **The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person drinking tea.**
   - This means the person who drinks tea is immediately to the left of the person who surfs.

### Step-by-Step Solution

Let's denote:
- M for Malaysian
- Ht for Hobby: magic-tricks
- C for Carrot
- Hm for Movie-Genre: horror
- T for Tea
- S for Sport: surfing

From clue 1, we know:
- If Ht is at position 1, M must be at position 2.
- If Ht is at position 2, M must be at position 1 (impossible since only two positions).

So, let's assume Ht is at position 1, then M is at position 2.

From clue 3, we know:
- Hm must be to the right of Ht.
- Since Ht is at position 1, Hm must be at position 2 (but M is already at position 2). This is a contradiction unless Hm is not at position 2 but somewhere else.

Let's assume Ht is at position 1 and Hm is at position 3 (since it must be to the right of Ht and can't be at position 2).

From clue 1 again:
- If Ht is at position 1, M must be at position 2.

Now, from clue 4:
- T must be to the left of S.
- If S is at position 2 (M), T must be at position 1 (Ht).

From clue 2:
- The carrot eater is on the left or right of the horror movie watcher.
- Since Hm is at position 3, the carrot eater could be at position 1 or 2.
- But position 1 is already taken by Ht, so the carrot eater must be at position 2 (M).

Thus, we have:
- Position 1: Ht (magic-tricks)
- Position 2: M (Malaysian, Carrot)
- Position 3: Hm (horror)

Now, we need to place the remaining items:
- T (Tea) must be to the left of S (Surfing).
- Since M is at position 2 (carrot), T and S cannot be at position 2.
- The only remaining positions for T and S are 1 and 4 (or 4 and 5, but we only have 2 columns).

Since T must be to the left of S, and M is already at position 2, the only possible arrangement is:
- Position 1: Ht (magic-tricks)
- Position 2: M (Malaysian, Carrot)
- Position 3: Hm (horror)
- Position 4: T (Tea)
- Position 5: S (Surfing)

### Final Table

Lv3-6x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each attribute (food, job, movie genre, music genre, nationality, and transport) into the correct columns for each person based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step by step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person eating apple is on the right of the person driving the roller.**
2. **The fan of funk is on the far left or far right.**
3. **The software-developer is on the left or right of the mechanic.**
4. **The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the fan of indie.**
5. **The American is on the right of the mechanic.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the fans of funk and the American.
- From clue 2, the fan of funk must be either in position 1 or 2.
- From clue 5, the American must be in position 2 because the mechanic cannot be in position 2 (since the American is to the right of the mechanic).

So, the layout so far is:
```
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          |           |           |
| Job           |           |           |
| Movie-Genre   |           |           |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |
| Nationality   |           | American  |
| Transport     |           | Roller    |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of the fan of funk and the person eating apple.
- Since the American is in position 2, the fan of funk must be in position 1.
- From clue 1, the person eating apple must be in position 2.

So, the layout so far is:
```
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          | Apple    | Asparagus|
| Job           |           |           |

| Music-Genre   |           |           |
| Nationality   | Funk     | American  |
| Transport     | Skateboard| Roller   |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the positions of the software-developer and the mechanic.
- From clue 3, the software-developer must be in position 1 or 2 relative to the mechanic.
- The American (in position 2) is to the right of the mechanic, so the mechanic must be in position 1.

So, the layout so far is:
```
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          | Apple    | Asparagus|
| Job           | Mechanic | Software-Developer|
| Movie-Genre   |           |           |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |
| Nationality   | Funk     | American  |
| Transport     | Skateboard| Roller   |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the positions of the superhero movie preference and the indie music preference.
- From clue 4, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1.
- The fan of indie must be in position 2.

So, the layout so far is:
```
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          | Apple    | Asparagus|
| Job           | Mechanic | Software-Developer|
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero| Indie     |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |
| Nationality   | Funk     | American  |
| Transport     | Skateboard| Roller   |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the remaining attributes.
- From the remaining options, the only music genre left is funk for the first person and indie for the second person.
- The only food left is asparagus for the second person.

So, the final layout is:
```
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          | Apple    | Asparagus|
| Job           | Mechanic | Software-Developer|
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero| Indie     |
| Music-Genre   | Funk     | Indie     |
| Nationality   | Funk     | American  |
| Transport     | Skateboard| Roller   |
```

### Final Solution Table:

Lv3-6x2-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the cat is on the far left.
2. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
3. The fan of hip-hop is the person driving the snowmobile.
4. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.
5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Owner of the cat is on the far left**:
    - Cat is in position 1.

2. **Person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games**:
    - Let's denote the person with video-game hobby as V and the person drinking soy-milk as S.
    - Therefore, V must be to the left of S.

3. **Fan of hip-hop is the person driving the snowmobile**:
    - Let's denote the person driving the snowmobile as D and the person who likes hip-hop as H.
    - Therefore, H = D.

4. **Person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk**:
    - Since D (H) is either to the left or right of S, we need to place them accordingly.

5. **Owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi**:
    - Let's denote the person eating kiwi as K and the person owning the chinchilla as C.
    - Therefore, C must be to the left or right of K.

### Arranging the Table:

Given the constraints, let's try to fit everything into the table.

- **Position 1 (Cat owner)**: Let's start here and fill in the other positions based on the clues.
- **Position 2**: We will determine this based on the other clues.

Let's start placing the items:

1. **Position 1 (Cat owner)**:
    - Cat is in position 1.
    - Let's denote the person as C1.

2. **Position 2**:
    - This can be filled by any combination that fits the other clues.

Let's try to fit the remaining items:

- **Beverage**:
    - Soy-milk (S) must be on the right of the person with video-game hobby (V).
    - Hip-hop (H) and Snowmobile (D) are the same person.
    - Kiwi (K) and Chinchilla (C) are related by their positions.

Based on the clues, let's assume:
- Position 2 could be for the person with the video-game hobby (V), and then soy-milk (S) would be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Cat owner (C1)
- Position 2: Video-game hobby (V)
- Position 3: Soy-milk (S)

Now, we need to fit the rest:
- **Beverage**:
    - Cola must be in position 4 or 5.
    - Soy-milk (S) is in position 3, so cola must be in position 4 or 5.

- **Food**:
    - Kiwi (K) must be in position 4 or 5.
    - Raspberry (R) must be in the remaining position.

- **Hobby**:
    - Collecting (Col) and Video-games (V) are already placed.
    - The remaining hobby must fit the position.

- **Music-Genre**:
    - Blues (Bl) and Hip-hop (H) are already placed.
    - The remaining genre must fit the position.

- **Pet**:
    - Chinchilla (C) must be in position 4 or 5.
    - Cat (Cat) is already placed.

- **Transport**:
    - Snowmobile (D) is in position 2.
    - Ship (Sh) must be in the remaining position.

After fitting all the pieces, we get the following arrangement:

|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |     4      |     5      |
| Beverage      |     Cola    |     -      |    Soy-milk|     -      |     -      |
| Food          |     Kiwi    |     -      |    Raspberry|     -      |     -      |
| Hobby         |     Collecting|     Video-games|     -      |     -      |     -      |
| Music-Genre   |     Blues   |     -      |    Hip-hop |     -      |     -      |
| Pet           |     Cat     |     -      |    Chinchilla|     -      |     -      |
| Transport     |     Ship    |     Snowmobile|     -      |     -      |     -      |

Since the puzzle specifies 2 different positions for each category, we need to fill in the missing positions. Given the constraints, we can deduce:

|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |     4      |     5      |
| Beverage      |     Cola    |     -      |    Soy-milk|     Hip-hop|     Blues  |
| Food          |     Kiwi    |     -      |    Raspberry|     Blues |     Hip-hop|
| Hobby         |     Collecting|     Video-games|     Blues |     Hip-hop|     Cola   |
| Music-Genre   |     Blues   |     -      |    Hip-hop |     Cola  |     Kiwi   |
| Pet           |     Cat     |     -      |    Chinchilla|     Kiwi |     Raspberry|
| Transport     |     Ship    |     Snowmobile|     Cola  |     Kiwi  |     Raspberry|

Finally, the solution is:

```
|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |     4      |     5      |

Lv3-6x2-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the relationships and constraints**:
   - The fan of trance is the person watching action movies.
   - The dressmaker is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies.
   - The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the dressmaker.
   - The Spanish is on the right of the owner of the bird.
   - The owner of the guinea-pig is the person drinking fanta.

2. **Determine the positions of the jobs**:
   - From constraint 3, we know that the person watching comedy movies is on the right of the dressmaker. This means the dressmaker must be in position 1 and the person watching comedy movies must be in position 2.
   - From constraint 2, the dressmaker is either on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is already in position 2, the dressmaker must be in position 1.

3. **Determine the beverages**:
   - From constraint 5, the owner of the guinea-pig drinks fanta. So, the person in position 2 (who watches comedy) drinks fanta.
   - The other person drinks sprite.

4. **Determine the movie genres**:
   - From constraint 1, the fan of trance watches action movies. So, the person in position 2 (who watches comedy) is not the fan of trance. Therefore, the person in position 1 (who is the dressmaker) is the fan of trance and watches action movies.
   - The person in position 2 (who watches comedy) is the fan of comedy.

5. **Determine the nationalities and pets**:
   - From constraint 4, the Spanish is on the right of the owner of the bird. Since the dressmaker (position 1) is the fan of trance and watches action movies, the Spanish cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the Spanish must be in position 2, which is the person who watches comedy.
   - The owner of the bird is therefore in position 1, which is the dressmaker.

Now, let's fill in the table with the information we have:

Lv3-6x2-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person driving the boat.
2. The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the software-developer.
4. The American is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 2
- **Clue 1**: Hiker is on the left of the person driving the boat.
- **Clue 2**: Western movie watcher is on the left or right of the hiker.

This means the hiker cannot be next to the western movie watcher, but they can be either one position apart or separated by another person.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- **Clue 3**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the software-developer.

This implies that the software-developer cannot be in the first column.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
- **Clue 4**: The American is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

This implies that the American cannot be in the first column if the person drinking hot-chocolate is there.

### Initial Setup:

Let's denote the columns as 1 and 2 and fill in what we know:

|               |       1       |         2          |
|-------------- |-------------  |------------------- |
| Beverage      |              |                    |
| Hobby         |              |                    |
| Job           |              |                    |
| Movie-Genre   |              |                    |
| Nationality   |              |                    |
| Transport     |              |                    |

From Clue 3, we know:
- Hot-Chocolate (HC) is on the left of Software-Developer (SD).

From Clue 4, we know:
- American (A) is on the right of HC.

So, let's place these in the table:

|               |       1       |         2          |
|-------------- |-------------  |------------------- |

| Hobby         |              |                    |
| Job           |              |                    |
| Movie-Genre   |              |                    |
| Nationality   |              |                    |
| Transport     |              |                    |

Since A is on the right of HC, and HC must be on the left of SD, let's place them:

|               |       1       |         2          |
|-------------- |-------------  |------------------- |
| Beverage      |              |                    |
| Hobby         |              |                    |
| Job           |              |                    |
| Movie-Genre   |              |                    |
| Nationality   |              |                    |
| Transport     |              |                    |

We now need to place the Hiker (H) and the Western Movie Watcher (WMW). From Clue 1, H is on the left of the person driving the boat (BD):

|               |       1       |         2          |
|-------------- |-------------  |------------------- |
| Beverage      |              |                    |
| Hobby         | H            |                    |
| Job           |              |                    |

| Transport     |              | BD                 |

From Clue 2, WMW is on the left or right of H. Since H is in the second column, WMW can be in the first or third column. Let's consider both possibilities:

**Case 1: WMW is in the first column**

|               |       1       |         2          |
|-------------- |-------------  |------------------- |
| Beverage      |              |                    |
| Hobby         | H            |                    |
| Job           |              |                    |
| Movie-Genre   |              |                    |
| Nationality   |              |                    |
| Transport     | WMW          | BD                 |

**Case 2: WMW is in the third column**

|               |       1       |         2          |
|-------------- |-------------  |------------------- |
| Beverage      |              |                    |
| Hobby         | H            |                    |
| Job           |              |                    |
| Movie-Genre   |              |                    |
| Nationality   |              |                    |
| Transport     |              | BD                 |
| Hobby         |              | WMW                |

Now, we need to place the remaining categories (Job, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Transport) while satisfying all the clues.

### Final Solution:

Considering all the constraints, let's finalize the table:

|               |       1       |         2          |
|-------------- |-------------  |------------------- |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea           |
| Hobby         | Hiking        | Skydiving          |
| Job           | Pilot         | Software-Developer |
| Movie-Genre   | Family        | Western            |
| Nationality   | Indian        | American           |
| Transport     | Boat          | Subway             |

This configuration satisfies all the given clues:
1. Hiker (H) is on the left of the person driving the boat (BD).
2. Western movie watcher is on the left or right of the hiker.
3. Hot-Chocolate is on the left of the software-developer.
4. The American is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

### Final Table:

```
|               |       1       |         2          |
|-------------- |-------------  |------------------- |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea           |
| Hobby         | Hiking        | Skydiving          |
| Job           | Pilot         | Software-Developer |
| Movie-Genre   | Family        | Western            |
| Nationality   | Indian        | American           |
| Transport     | Boat          | Subway             |
```"	{'hobby': ['hiking', 'skydiving'], 'job': ['pilot', 'software-developer'], 'movie-genre': ['family', 'western'], 'nationality': ['indian', 'american'], 'transport': ['boat', 'subway']}	False	0	False
