- Let's assume the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1 (we can check later if it fits all clues).

#### Step 2:
- The person driving the motorbike is also in position 1 (from Clue 6).
- Therefore, the person with photography as a hobby must be in position 4 (from Clue 13).

#### Step 3:
- The person drinking fanta is the person with photography as a hobby (from Clue 10).
- So, the person drinking fanta is in position 4.

#### Step 4:
- The person with chess as a hobby is in position 3 (since the person with photography as a hobby is in position 4 and they must be next to each other according to Clue 4).

#### Step 5:
- The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person with chess as a hobby (Clue 4).
- Since the person with chess as a hobby is in position 3, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2.

#### Step 6:
- The person who's sport is badminton is the fan of salsa (Clue 3).
- The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the fan of salsa (Clue 5).
- So, the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 4 (already taken by the person drinking fanta and photography), thus the fan of salsa must be in position 2.

#### Step 7:
- The person who's sport is badminton is in position 2 (salsa).
- The person who's sport is biathlon is in position 4 (fanta and photography).

#### Step 8:
- The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk (Clue 7).
- The person drinking soy-milk must be in position 4 (already taken by the person with photography and fanta).

#### Step 9:
- The person who's sport is cricket is between the fan of salsa and the person who's hobby is chess (Clue 12).
- The fan of salsa is in position 2, and the person with chess as a hobby is in position 3.
- So, the person who's sport is cricket must be in position 1 (already taken by the person drinking almond-milk).

#### Step 10:
- The person who's sport is lacrosse is the remaining sport (since biathlon, badminton, and cricket are already assigned).

#### Step 11:
- The person who's sport is biathlon is in position 4 (fanta and photography).
- The person who's sport is badminton is in position 2 (salsa).
- The person who's sport is cricket is in position 3 (chess).
- The person who's sport is lacrosse is in position 1 (almond-milk).

#### Step 12:
- The person who's sport is badminton is in position 2 (salsa).
- The person who's sport is biathlon is in position 4 (fanta and photography).
- The person who's sport is cricket is in position 3 (chess).
- The person who's sport is lacrosse is in position 1 (almond-milk).

#### Step 13:
- The person who's hobby is dancing is in position 1 (almond-milk) or 4 (photography).
- Since the person with photography as a hobby is in position 4, the person who's hobby is dancing must be in position 1 (almond-milk).

#### Step 14:
- The person who's hobby is chess is in position 3 (cricket).
- The person who's hobby is dancing is in position 1 (almond-milk).

#### Step 15:
- The person who's hobby is photography is in position 4 (fanta).

11. **Clue 12**: The fan of d&b is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies.
12. **Clue 13**: The fan of blues is the person watching martial-arts movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Place the person eating garlic and their sport
From Clue 5, the person eating garlic is the one doing weightlifting. So, the sport column for the row ""Person Eating Garlic"" should be ""weightlifting"".

#### Step 2: Place the person watching documentary movies
From Clue 10, the person watching documentary movies is the same as the person eating garlic. So, the movie genre column for the row ""Person Eating Garlic"" should be ""documentary"".

#### Step 3: Place the person watching martial-arts movies
From Clue 13, the person watching martial-arts movies is the fan of blues. So, the movie genre column for the row ""Fan of Blues"" should be ""martial-arts"".

#### Step 4: Place the person watching crime movies
From Clue 2, the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person eating cherry. This means the person eating cherry cannot be in position 1.

#### Step 5: Place the owner of the pony
From Clue 3, the owner of the pony is between the person eating cherry and the owner of the hedgehog. From Clue 4, the owner of the pony is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. This means the owner of the pony can only be in position 2.

So, the owner of the pony is in position 2.

#### Step 6: Place the person eating cherry
Since the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person eating cherry, and the owner of the pony (who is in position 2) is between the person eating cherry and the owner of the hedgehog, the person eating cherry must be in position 3.

#### Step 7: Place the owner of the hedgehog
The owner of the hedgehog must be in position 4 because the owner of the pony is between the person eating cherry and the owner of the hedgehog.

#### Step 8: Place the person eating orange
From Clue 8, the person eating orange is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person watching documentary movies (and eating garlic) is in position 1, the person eating orange must be in position 4.

#### Step 9: Place the person watching crime movies
Since the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person eating cherry, and the person eating cherry is in position 3, the person watching crime movies must be in position 1.

#### Step 10: Place the person watching drama movies
From Clue 6, the person watching martial-arts movies (blues) is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3, the person watching drama movies must be in position 4.

#### Step 11: Place the fan of techno
From Clue 1, the fan of techno is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since the owner of the pony is in position 2, the fan of techno must be in position 4.

#### Step 12: Place the fan of d&b
From Clue 12, the fan of d&b is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person watching documentary movies is in position 1, the fan of d&b must be in position 2.

#### Step 13: Place the person watching handball, parkour, and surfing
From Clue 4, the owner of the pony (in position 2) is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Therefore, the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 4. The remaining sports (handball and parkour) must be placed in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
