### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Assigning the Fan of Ambient
16. The fan of ambient is on the far left. So, position 1 is occupied by the fan of ambient.

24. The person eating strawberry is the software developer.

Rechecking, the photographer is in position 4, and the person eating cherry must be in position 6 (skateboard driver).

#### Step 9: Assigning the Owner of the Rabbit
20. The owner of the rabbit is the fan of gospel.
21. The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the fan of gospel.
