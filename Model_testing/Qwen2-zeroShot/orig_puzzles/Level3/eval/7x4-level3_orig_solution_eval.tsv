Lv3-7x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 4**: The coach is on the far left.
2. **Clue 18**: The Indian is the person drinking 7up.

Let's start by placing these two pieces of information:

```
|               |    1     |       2       |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      | 7up      |               |           |           |

| Music-Genre   |          |               |           |           |
| Nationality   | indian   |               |           |           |

```

3. **Clue 1**: The person drinking milk is on the left of the person whose sport is skateboarding.
4. **Clue 11**: The person who drives the subway is on the left of the fisherman.
5. **Clue 8**: The fisherman is the person whose sport is rugby.
6. **Clue 16**: The person whose sport is rugby is on the left or right of the person driving the subway.

From Clues 11 and 16, we can infer that the person driving the subway must be either in position 2 or 3, and the fisherman (rugby) must be in the adjacent position. Since the coach is already in position 1, the fisherman cannot be in position 2 (because it would violate Clue 4). Therefore, the fisherman must be in position 3, and the person driving the subway must be in position 2.
