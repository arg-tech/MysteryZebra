Lv3-4x2-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The social-worker is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta.
2. **Clue 2:** The musician is on the right of the social-worker.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the bike is on the right of the Italian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2:** The musician is on the right of the social-worker. This means that if we have the social-worker in position 1, the musician must be in position 2. Similarly, if the social-worker is in position 2, the musician must be in position 1.

2. **Clue 3:** The person driving the bike is on the right of the Italian. This means that if the Italian is in position 1, the person driving the bike must be in position 2. If the Italian is in position 2, then there is no room for the person driving the bike to be on the right.

3. **Clue 1:** The social-worker is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta. Since the social-worker and the musician must be adjacent (from Clue 2), and the person drinking fanta must be next to the social-worker, let's explore the possible positions.

### Possible Arrangements:

- If the social-worker is in position 1, the musician is in position 2.
  - The person drinking fanta can be in either position 1 or 2 (but not both, as the social-worker is already there).
  - The Italian cannot be in position 1 (since the person driving the bike must be on the right of the Italian).

- If the social-worker is in position 2, the musician is in position 1.
  - The person drinking fanta can be in either position 1 or 2.
  - The Italian cannot be in position 2 (since the person driving the bike must be on the right of the Italian).

Given these constraints, let's place the Italian and the person driving the bike first:

- If the Italian is in position 1, the person driving the bike must be in position 2.
- If the Italian is in position 2, there is no room for the person driving the bike.

Thus, the only valid arrangement is:
- The Italian is in position 1.
- The person driving the bike is in position 2.

Now, we need to fit the social-worker and the musician into the remaining slots while satisfying Clue 1.

### Final Solution:

Since the social-worker and the musician must be adjacent and the person drinking fanta must be next to the social-worker, the only valid arrangement is:
- Social-worker in position 1, musician in position 2.
- Person drinking fanta in position 1 (since the social-worker is already there).

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | Fanta        | Soy-milk  |
| Job           | Social-worker| Musician  |

| Transport     | Bike         | Airplane |
```

### Final Table:

```
|               |       1       |    2     |

Lv3-4x2-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 3:** The person driving the scooter is on the far left.
2. **Clue 1:** The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter.
3. **Clue 2:** The person eating watermelon is on the left of the fan of r&b.

### Initial Setup:

| Pet           |            |            |
| Transport     | Scooter    |            |

Since the person driving the scooter is on the far left (Clue 3), we can place ""Scooter"" in position 1 under ""Transport"".

### Applying Clue 1:
- The owner of the cat is either to the left or right of the person driving the scooter.
- Since the person driving the scooter is in position 1, the owner of the cat must be in position 2.

Lv3-4x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information into the table. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. The fan of r&b is on the far right.
2. The person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the analyst.
3. The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.
4. The person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of r&b.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the fan of r&b
Since the fan of r&b is on the far right (position 2), we can write:
```
|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         |                 | r&b         |
| Job           |                 |             |
| Music-Genre   |                 | folk        |
| Transport     |                 | scooter     |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of hiking and analyst
The person with the hobby of hiking must be on the left of the analyst. Since the fan of r&b is already in position 2, the person with the hobby of hiking must be in position 1. Therefore, the analyst must be in position 2 (the same as the fan of r&b).

```
|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         | hiking          | r&b         |
| Job           |                 |             |
| Music-Genre   |                 | folk        |
| Transport     |                 | scooter     |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the positions of the jobs
Since the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 1 and the analyst is in position 2, the job for position 1 must be the project manager (since the analyst is in position 2).

```
|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         | hiking          | r&b         |
| Job           | project-manager | analyst     |
| Music-Genre   |                 | folk        |
| Transport     |                 | scooter     |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the music genre
The person with the hobby of hiking is in position 1, so their music genre must be folk. The person with the hobby of r&b is in position 2, so their music genre must be r&b.

```
|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         | hiking          | r&b         |
| Job           | project-manager | analyst     |
| Music-Genre   | folk            | r&b         |
| Transport     |                 | scooter     |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the transport methods
We know that the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Also, the person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of r&b is in position 2, the person driving the scooter must be in position 1. Therefore, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 2.

```
|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         | hiking          | r&b         |
| Job           | project-manager | analyst     |
| Music-Genre   | folk            | r&b         |
| Transport     | scooter         | quad-bike   |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |        1        |      2      |

Lv3-4x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step and place the information into the table.

Given:
- There are two different favorite beverages: cola and tea.
- Two different movie genres: action and epic.
- Two different music genres: disco and trance.
- Two different pets: hamster and rat.

Clues:
1. The fan of disco is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
2. The person drinking tea is the owner of the hamster.
3. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person watching epic movies.

Let's start by placing the information from clue 2:

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |    tea  |       |
| Movie-Genre   |         |       |
| Music-Genre   |         |       |
| Pet           | hamster |       |

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking cola is on the right of the person watching epic movies. This means the person in seat 2 drinks cola and watches epic movies.

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |    tea  | cola   |
| Movie-Genre   |         | epic   |
| Music-Genre   |         |       |
| Pet           | hamster |       |

Now, using clue 1, we need to place the fan of disco. Since the person with the rat is either in seat 1 or 2, and the person in seat 2 is drinking cola, the person with the rat must be in seat 1 (because the fan of disco cannot be in seat 2 as it would conflict with clue 3).

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |    tea  | cola   |
| Movie-Genre   |         | epic   |
| Music-Genre   |         |       |
| Pet           | rat     | hamster |

Since the person in seat 1 is the fan of disco, they must have the pet rat and listen to disco.

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |    tea  | cola   |
| Movie-Genre   | disco   | epic   |
| Music-Genre   |         |       |
| Pet           | rat     | hamster |

Finally, since the person in seat 1 listens to disco and has the rat, the person in seat 2 must listen to trance (the other music genre) because there are only two music genres.

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |    tea  | cola   |
| Movie-Genre   | disco   | epic   |
| Music-Genre   | trance  |        |
| Pet           | rat     | hamster |

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |    tea  | cola   |
| Movie-Genre   | disco   | epic   |
| Music-Genre   | trance  |        |
| Pet           | rat     | hamster |

Lv3-4x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
2. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating kale.
3. The accountant is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
- The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating kale.
This means we can establish an order for the food preferences:
- Kale -> Kiwi

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- The accountant is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.
This means:
- Accountant -> Tennis

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
Since the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating kale, and the person eating kiwi could be on either side of the person drinking 7up, we need to consider both possibilities:
- If the person eating kale is on the leftmost position, then the person drinking 7up could be on the right of the person eating kale or the person eating kiwi (who is on the right of the person eating kale).

Let's try placing the people based on these clues:

### Possible Layouts:

**Layout 1:**
1. Kale
2. Kiwi

**Layout 2:**
1. Kale
2. 7up
3. Kiwi

Given that the accountant must be on the left of the person who plays tennis, let's try to fit the jobs and sports accordingly.

### Fitting Jobs and Sports:

#### Layout 1:
1. Kale (Food)
2. Kiwi (Food)
3. 7up (Beverage)
4. Fanta (Beverage)

- Since the accountant must be on the left of the person who plays tennis, and the person eating kale is on the leftmost position, the accountant cannot be in the second position (because there would be no space for the tennis player).
- Therefore, the accountant must be in the first position, and the tennis player must be in the fourth position.

So, we get:
1. Accountant (Job)
2. Kale (Food)
3. 7up (Beverage)
4. Tennis (Sport)

#### Layout 2:
1. Kale (Food)
2. 7up (Beverage)
3. Kiwi (Food)
4. Fanta (Beverage)

- Here, the accountant must still be on the left of the person who plays tennis.
- The only way to fit this is if the accountant is in the first position and the tennis player is in the fourth position.

So, we get:
1. Accountant (Job)
2. Kale (Food)
3. 7up (Beverage)
4. Tennis (Sport)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |     1      |      2       |
| Beverage   |    Fanta   |     7up      |
| Food       |    Kale    |     Kiwi     |
| Job        | Accountant |   Entrepreneur|
| Sport      |   Climbing |      Tennis  |
```

In this layout, the accountant is on the left of the person who plays tennis, and the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating kale. This fits all the given clues."	{'beverage': ['fanta', '7up'], 'food': ['kale', 'kiwi'], 'job': ['accountant', 'entrepreneur'], 'sport': ['climbing', 'tennis']}	True	6	False
Lv3-4x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each item (beverage, food, hobby, pet) in the appropriate columns for the two individuals based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and solve step-by-step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking Mirinda is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is Skydiving.
2. The person drinking Sprite is on the left or right of the owner of the Bird.
3. The person eating Asparagus is on the left of the owner of the Bird.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: Mirinda and Skydiving
- If the person drinking Mirinda is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is Skydiving, we can place these items in two possible positions:
  - Mirinda (M) - Skydiving (S)
  - Skydiving (S) - Mirinda (M)

#### Clue 2: Sprite and Bird
- The person drinking Sprite is on the left or right of the owner of the Bird. This means:
  - Sprite (S) - Bird (B)
  - Bird (B) - Sprite (S)

#### Clue 3: Asparagus and Bird
- The person eating Asparagus is on the left of the owner of the Bird. This means:
  - Asparagus (A) - Bird (B)

### Combining the Clues:
Let's start with Clue 3:
- Asparagus (A) must be on the left of the Bird (B).

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- Since Asparagus is on the left of the Bird, and the Bird is also on the right of the Sprite, Sprite must be on the left of Asparagus. Therefore, Sprite (S) - Asparagus (A) - Bird (B).

Next, let's use Clue 1:
- We know that Mirinda and Skydiving must be in one of the two possible orders: Mirinda (M) - Skydiving (S) or Skydiving (S) - Mirinda (M).
- Given that Asparagus is on the left of the Bird, and Sprite is on the left of Asparagus, the only way to fit Mirinda and Skydiving into the remaining slots without violating any other clue is if:
  - Mirinda (M) - Skydiving (S)

So, we have:
- **Person 1**: Mirinda (M), Asparagus (A)
- **Person 2**: Sprite (S), Bird (B)

We still need to assign the remaining items (Garlic and Hiking) to the two persons.

Since Garlic is the only remaining food and Hiking is the only remaining hobby, they must be assigned accordingly:
- **Person 1**: Mirinda (M), Asparagus (A), Hiking (H)
- **Person 2**: Sprite (S), Bird (B), Garlic (G)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |     1     |    2    |
| Beverage   | Mirinda   | Sprite  |
| Food       | Asparagus | Garlic  |
| Hobby      | Hiking    | Skydiving|
| Pet        | None      | Bird    |
```

Note: The first person does not have a pet mentioned in the clues, so it is marked as ""None""."	{'beverage': ['mirinda', 'sprite'], 'food': ['asparagus', 'garlic'], 'hobby': ['hiking', 'skydiving'], 'pet': ['none', 'bird']}	True	3	False
Lv3-4x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the correct cells of the table. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the owner of the pony.**
   - This means that the person who owns the pony and the person who drives the scooter must be adjacent (either in the same row or one above/below the other).

2. **The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person whose hobby is writing.**
   - This means the person who drives the skateboard must be either directly to the left or above the person with the hobby ""writing"".

3. **The person driving the scooter is the person watching drama movies.**
   - This means the person who drives the scooter has ""drama"" as their preferred movie genre.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the person driving the scooter:**
   - From clue 3, the person driving the scooter watches drama movies.
   - Since there are only two movie genres (drama and epic), the person driving the scooter must be in the ""Movie-Genre"" column for ""drama"".

2. **Determine the person owning the pony:**
   - From clue 1, the person driving the scooter is adjacent to the owner of the pony.
   - If the scooter is in column 1, then the pony must be in column 2.
   - If the scooter is in column 2, then the pony must be in column 1.

3. **Determine the person driving the skateboard:**
   - From clue 2, the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
   - The person with the hobby ""writing"" must be in the ""Hobby"" column for ""writing"".
   - Therefore, the person driving the skateboard must be in the ""Hobby"" column for ""video-games"".

4. **Place the remaining information:**
   - The remaining pet (goat) and transport (skateboard) can be placed accordingly.

### Final Table:

Lv3-4x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the information step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing.
2. The owner of the cat is the person who's sport is sailing.
3. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the bartender.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the cat is the person who's sport is sailing.

This gives us two pieces of information:
- Sailing -> Cat owner

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the bartender.

This tells us about the positions relative to each other:
- Quad-bike -> Bartender (left of bartender)

#### Clue 1:
- The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing.

Given that the person who's sport is sailing also owns the cat, we need to place this person in relation to the roller driver.

### Initial Setup:
We can start by placing the known information into the grid:

|             |     1     |     2     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Job         |           |           |
| Pet         |           |           |
| Sport       | Sailing   |           |
| Transport   | Roller    | Quad-bike |

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the bartender.

So, we can update the grid as follows:
- The bartender must be in position 2 (since the person driving the quad-bike is in position 1).

|             |     1     |     2     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Job         |           | Bartender |
| Pet         |           |           |
| Sport       | Sailing   |           |
| Transport   | Roller    | Quad-bike |

From Clue 2, the cat owner is the person who does sailing:
- Cat owner -> Sailing

Now we can fill in the pet column for position 2:
- Position 2 cannot have the cat because the cat owner is in position 1 (sailing).
- So, position 2 must have the dog.

|             |     1     |     2     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Job         |           | Bartender |
| Pet         | Cat       | Dog       |
| Sport       | Sailing   |           |
| Transport   | Roller    | Quad-bike |

Finally, we need to determine the jobs and sports for positions 1 and 2. We know from Clue 1 that the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing.

Since the person doing sailing is in position 1, the person driving the roller (position 1) could be either the bartender or the lawyer. However, since the bartender is in position 2, the person in position 1 must be the lawyer.

Thus, the final setup is:

|             |     1     |     2     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Job         | Lawyer    | Bartender |
| Pet         | Cat       | Dog       |
| Sport       | Sailing   | Swimming  |
| Transport   | Roller    | Quad-bike |

### Final Solution Table:

Lv3-4x2-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the rat is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf.
2. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.
3. The owner of the cat is on the right of the nigerian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions of the sports and movie genres.
- From clue 2, the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.
- Therefore, we can place ""Scientific"" and ""Golf"" in the first and second positions respectively (or vice versa).

#### Step 2: Determine the nationality and pet based on the remaining positions.
- From clue 3, the owner of the cat is on the right of the nigerian.
- This means the nigerian cannot be in the last position (rightmost) because there would be no space for the cat owner.

#### Step 3: Place the nationalities and pets.
- Since the nigerian cannot be in the last position, let's assume the nigerian is in position 1 and the mexican is in position 2.
- The owner of the cat must be to the right of the nigerian, so the cat owner must be in position 2 if the nigerian is in position 1.

#### Step 4: Place the sports and movie genres.
- From clue 2, the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.
- If the nigerian is in position 1, the mexican is in position 2, then the scientific movie watcher must be in position 1, and the golf player must be in position 2.

#### Step 5: Check the remaining positions for the pets.
- From clue 1, the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf.
- Since the person with the sport of golf is in position 2, the owner of the rat can be in position 1 or 2.
- Given that the scientific movie watcher is in position 1, the rat owner must be in position 2.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific | Golf    |
| Nationality   | Nigerian   | Mexican |
| Pet           | Rat        | Cat     |
| Sport         | Climbing   | Golf    |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."	{'movie-genre': ['scientific', 'golf'], 'nationality': ['nigerian', 'mexican'], 'pet': ['rat', 'cat'], 'sport': ['climbing', 'golf']}	True	7	False
Lv3-4x2-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle.
2. The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the turtle.
3. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of folk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: Basketball and Turtle
- If the person who plays basketball is on the left or right of the turtle owner, we need to place these two in the correct order.

#### Clue 2: Cauliflower and Turtle
- The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the turtle.

#### Clue 3: Turtle and Folk
- The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of folk.

### Initial Setup:
We will denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Left
- Position 2: Right

We need to place the items (food, music genre, pet, sport) in these positions while satisfying all the clues.

### Placing Turtle and Sport:
Since the owner of the turtle must be on the left of the fan of folk, and the person who plays basketball can be either on the left or right of the turtle owner, let's start with placing the turtle and the sport.

- Let's assume the owner of the turtle is in position 1.
- The fan of folk must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the person who plays basketball cannot be in position 1 (since the owner of the turtle is there).

So, the possible setup for now is:
- Position 1: Turtle
- Position 2: Folk

This means the person who plays basketball must be in position 2 (right side), which contradicts our current assumption that the fan of folk is in position 2. Hence, we need to switch the positions.

- Position 1: Folk
- Position 2: Turtle

Now, the person who plays basketball must be in position 1 (left side).

### Placing Cauliflower:
- The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the turtle.
- Since the owner of the turtle is in position 1, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2.

### Final Setup:
- Position 1: Folk
- Position 2: Turtle

Now we need to fill in the remaining items (asparagus, cauliflower, ferret, and basketball).

- The person eating cauliflower is in position 2.
- The person playing basketball is in position 1.

So, the remaining items (asparagus and ferret, and their respective sports) need to be placed in the remaining slots.

### Final Table:
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Asparagus | Cauliflower |
| Music-Genre   | Folk      | Metal       |
| Pet           | Ferret    | Turtle      |
| Sport         | Basketball | Climbing   |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Asparagus | Cauliflower |
| Music-Genre   | Folk      | Metal       |
| Pet           | Ferret    | Turtle      |
