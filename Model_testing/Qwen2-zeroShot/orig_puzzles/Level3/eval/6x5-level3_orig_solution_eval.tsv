### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 10:** The person with the hobby of video-games is on the far left.
2. **Clue 6:** The person driving the bike is on the far right.
3. **Clue 20:** The person who's sport is cricket is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the person who's hobby is video-games (which is already placed at position 1).

From Clue 10 and Clue 6:
```
| Hobby        | Video-Games |             |             |             | Bike       |
| Sport        | Cricket     |             |             |             |            |
```

From Clue 20:
- The person with the hobby of video-games (position 1) is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the person who plays cricket.
- Since the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 1, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 3 or 5, and the person who plays cricket must be in position 2 or 4.

Let's denote the owner of the guinea-pig as G and the person who plays cricket as C. So, we have two possible configurations for positions 1, 2, 3, and 4:
1. \(G, C, \_, \_, \)
2. \(C, G, \_, \_, \)

Next, let's use Clue 1:
- The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the fan of house.
- The person driving the tram is either in position 1 or 2, and the fan of house is in position 2 or 3.

Next, let's use Clue 2:
- The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the fan of electronic.
- The fan of electronic is in position 1, so the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Next, let's use Clue 3:
- The fan of r&b is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
- The person who's sport is soccer is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, so the fan of r&b is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Next, let's use Clue 4:
- The fan of house is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
- The person who's sport is water-polo is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, so the fan of house is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Next, let's use Clue 5:
- The fan of r&b is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography.
- The person who's hobby is photography is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, so the fan of r&b is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Next, let's use Clue 7:
- The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
- This helps us narrow down the positions of the fan of r&b and the person drinking almond-milk.

Next, let's use Clue 8:

- This helps us further narrow down the positions of the person who's sport is soccer and the person drinking fanta.

Next, let's use Clue 15:
- The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter.
- This helps us further narrow down the positions of the person who's sport is skiing and the person driving the scooter.

19. **The software-developer is between the dressmaker and the person eating radish.**
20. **The person eating pear is on the left or right of the dancer.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Dressmaker
- From Clue 1, the dressmaker must be in position 1 or 5.
- From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the dressmaker cannot be in both positions 1 and 5 simultaneously. Therefore, the dressmaker must be in position 1.

So, **Dressmaker = 1**.

#### Step 2: Place the Person Driving the Bike
- From Clue 5, the person eating onion is the person driving the bike.
- From Clue 8, the person eating onion is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies.
- Since the dressmaker is in position 1, the person driving the bike must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Let's assume the person driving the bike is in position 2 (we will check consistency later).

So, **Person Driving the Bike = 2**.

#### Step 3: Place the Person Eating Onion
- From Clue 5, the person eating onion is the person driving the bike.
- So, the person eating onion is in position 2.

So, **Person Eating Onion = 2**.

#### Step 4: Place the Fan of Salsa
- From Clue 4, the person driving the helicopter is the fan of salsa.
- The person driving the bike is in position 2, so the person driving the helicopter must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let's assume the person driving the helicopter is in position 3 (we will check consistency later).

So, **Fan of Salsa = 3**.

#### Step 5: Place the Software-Developer
- From Clue 9, the fan of rock is on the right of the software-developer.
- From Clue 19, the software-developer is between the dressmaker and the person eating radish.
- Since the dressmaker is in position 1, the software-developer must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 3, the software-developer must be in position 4 or 5.

Let's assume the software-developer is in position 4 (we will check consistency later).

So, **Software-Developer = 4**.

#### Step 6: Place the Fan of Rock
- From Clue 9, the fan of rock is on the right of the software-developer.
- Since the software-developer is in position 4, the fan of rock must be in position 5.

So, **Fan of Rock = 5**.

#### Step 7: Place the Person Watching Disaster Movies
- From Clue 11, the software-developer is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
- Since the software-developer is in position 4, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 3.

So, **Person Watching Disaster Movies = 3**.

#### Step 8: Place the Fan of Soul
- From Clue 12, the entrepreneur is on the left of the fan of soul.
- The person watching disaster movies is in position 3, so the fan of soul must be in position 4 or 5.
- Since the software-developer is in position 4, the fan of soul must be in position 5.

So, **Fan of Soul = 5**.

Since the fan of soul is already placed in position 5, there is a conflict. We need to re-evaluate our previous assumptions.

Re-evaluating, let's assume the software-developer is in position 5 instead.

So, **Software-Developer = 5**.

Then, the fan of rock must be in position 4.

So, **Fan of Rock = 4**.

And the person watching disaster movies must be in position 3.

So, **Person Watching Disaster Movies = 3**.

#### Step 9: Place the Project-Manager
- From Clue 15, the project-manager is in the middle.
- The middle position is 3.

So, **Project-Manager = 3**.

#### Step 10: Place the Person Driving the Helicopter
- From Clue 4, the person driving the helicopter is the fan of salsa.
- The person driving the helicopter must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 3 and the fan of rock is in position 4, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 2.

So, **Person Driving the Helicopter = 2**.

#### Step 11: Place the Person Driving the Trike
- From Clue 10, the person driving the trike is the person watching musical movies.
- The person driving the trike must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 2 and the person watching disaster movies is in position 3, the person driving the trike must be in position 4.

So, **Person Driving the Trike = 4**.

#### Step 12: Place the Person Eating Radish
- From Clue 19, the software-developer is between the dressmaker and the person eating radish.
- Since the software-developer is in position 5 and the dressmaker is in position 1, the person eating radish must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the person driving the bike is in position 2, the person eating radish must be in position 3.

So, **Person Eating Radish = 3**.

#### Step 13: Place the Owner of the Horse
- From Clue 7, the owner of the horse is on the left of the person eating lime.
- The person eating radish is in position 3, so the owner of the horse must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the dressmaker is in position 1, the owner of the horse must be in position 2.

So, **Owner of the Horse = 2**.

#### Step 14: Place the Person Eating Lime
- The owner of the horse is in position 2, so the person eating lime must be in position 3.

So, **Person Eating Lime = 3**.

#### Step 15: Place the Owner of the Rabbit
- From Clue 13, the person driving the quad-bike is the owner of the rabbit.
- The person driving the quad-bike must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- Since the person driving the bike is in position 2 and the person driving the helicopter is in position 3, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 4.

So, **Owner of the Rabbit = 4**.

#### Step 16: Place the Owner of the Frog

So, **Owner of the Frog = 5**.

#### Step 17: Place the Owner of the Goat
- From Clue 18, the owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.
- The person watching disaster movies is in position 3, so the owner of the goat must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- Since the person driving the bike is in position 2, the owner of the goat must be in position 4 or 5.
- Since the owner of the rabbit is in position 4, the owner of the goat must be in position 5.

So, **Owner of the Goat = 5**.

#### Step 18: Place the Person Watching Scientific Movies
- The owner of the goat is in position 5, so the person watching scientific movies must be in position 4.

So, **Person Watching Scientific Movies = 4**.

#### Step 19: Place the Person Eating Pear
- From Clue 20, the person eating pear is on the left or right of the dancer.
- The person eating pear must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- Since the person driving the bike is in position 2, the person eating pear must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
