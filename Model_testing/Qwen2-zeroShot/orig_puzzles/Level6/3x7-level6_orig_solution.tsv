### Initial Setup:
- Far left: British (Clue 2)
- Far right: Thai (Clue 6)

### Middle Position (Position 4):
- Juice (Clue 16)

### Analyzing Other Clues:
- Since the Colombian is the fan disco (Clue 20), and the fan disco is on the left or right of the fan electronic (Clue 15), the fan electronic cannot be the Colombian.
- The fan trance is on the right of the Thai (Clue 19) and is not the British (Clue 17).
- The fan trance is also on the left or right of the fan electronic (Clue 9).

### Placing the Remaining Elements:
- Since the British is on the far left, and the Japanese must be on the far right or next to the British (Clue 20), the Japanese can only be in position 2 or 3.
- The Nigerian and Pakistani must be next to each other with the Nigerian on the left (Clue 13).
- The fan classical is between the fan trance and the fan electronic (Clue 18), so the fan trance and fan electronic must be adjacent to the fan classical.
- The person drinking iced-tea is the Thai (Clue 6), so Thai must be in position 7.
- The person drinking 7up is to the left of the fan classical (Clue 10).
- The person drinking cola is to the left or right of the British (Clue 14).
- The person drinking juice is to the left of the person drinking tea (Clue 8).

#### Initial Setup:
We will start by placing some known elements based on clues.

1. **Person watching musical movies**: On the far left (1).
2. **Fan of punk**: Watching superhero movies (4th position, as it’s in an odd position).
3. **Person drinking tea**: Watching time-travel movies (5th position, as it’s on the left of 7up).
4. **Fan of trance**: On the left or right of the person drinking tea (could be 3rd or 4th).

### Placing Known Elements:
```
| Musical |    ?    |    ?    | Superhero |    ?    | Time-travel |    ?    |
|    ?    |    ?    |    ?    |    ?     |    Tea     |     7up    |    ?    |
|    ?    |    ?    |    ?    |    ?     |    ?      |    ?       |    ?    |
```

### Applying More Clues:
1. **Fan of punk**: Superhero (4th position).
2. **Person drinking tea**: Time-travel (5th position).
3. **Fan of trance**: On the left or right of tea (could be 3rd or 4th, but 4th is occupied by punk).

Since the fan of trance cannot be in the 4th position, it must be in the 3rd position.

```
| Musical |    ?    | Trance | Superhero |    ?    | Time-travel |    ?    |
|    ?    |    ?    |    ?    |    ?     |    Tea    |     7up     |    ?    |
|    ?    |    ?    |    ?    |    ?     |    ?      |    ?       |    ?    |
```

4. **Fan of funk**: Between punk and 7up (6th position).
5. **Fan of funk**: Somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa (5th position).

Since the fan of funk is in the 6th position and the fan of salsa is in the 5th position, the person drinking 7up must be in the 7th position.

```
| Musical |    ?    | Trance | Superhero |    ?    | Time-travel | Funk 7up |
|    ?    |    ?    |    ?    |    ?     |    Tea   |     7up     |    ?    |
|    ?    |    ?    |    ?    |    ?     |    ?     |    ?       |    ?    |
```

|    ?    |    ?    |    ?    |    ?     |    Tea  |     7up     |    ?    |
|    ?    |    ?    |    ?    |    ?     |    ?    |    ?       |    ?    |
