2. **Sport and Fan Hip-Hop**:
   - From Clue 6, the person whose sport is snowboarding is the fan hip-hop.
   - From Clue 19, the person whose sport is snowboarding is in an odd position.

3. **Owner of the Ferret and Hedgehog**:
   - From Clue 23, the owner of the hedgehog is in an odd position (1 or 3).
   - From Clue 13, the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.

   - From Clue 6, the person whose sport is snowboarding is the fan hip-hop (position 3).
   - From Clue 7, the person driving the bike is the person whose sport is tennis.
   - From Clue 16, the person driving the trike is on the right of the person whose sport is skiing.
   - From Clue 18, the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person whose sport is tennis.
   - Therefore, the person whose sport is skiing must be in position 2, and the person whose sport is tennis must be in position 4 (owner of the turtle).
   - The person whose sport is snowboarding must be in position 3 (fan hip-hop).

6. **Movies and Owners**:
   - From Clue 22, the owner of the ferret is the person watching spy movies.
   - From Clue 12, the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the fan jazz (position 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Basketball (1)**: From clue 14 and 21, Basketball is at position 1.
2. **Corn**: From clue 3, Corn is to the right of Superhero. From clue 14, Crime is Basketball, so it can't be there. From clue 24, Cricket is to the right of Camp, which means Corn can't be in position 2 (since Cricket is not at position 1).
3. **Superhero**: Since Corn is to the right of Superhero, Superhero must be in position 2 or 3.
4. **Tea**: From clue 5, Tea is at position 5.
5. **Cucumber**: From clue 4, Cucumber is not Tea. From clue 6, Cucumber is to the right of Basketball, so Cucumber can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Since Tea is in 5, Cucumber must be in 3 or 4.
6. **Soy-Milk**: From clue 8, Soy-Milk is to the left of Dancing. From clue 16, Dancing is Milk. So Soy-Milk must be in position 1 or 2. But Basketball is in 1, so Soy-Milk must be in 2.
7. **Milk**: From clue 16, Milk is Dancing.
8. **Weightlifting**: From clue 7, Weightlifting is to the left of Thriller. From clue 9, Weightlifting is to the left of Snowboarding. So Weightlifting must be in position 1 or 2. But Basketball is in 1 and Soy-Milk is in 2, so Weightlifting must be in 3.

12. **Cucumber**: From clue 4, Cucumber is to the right of Superhero. From clue 6, Cucumber is to the right of Basketball. From clue 26, Watermelon is between Fanta and Corn. Since Cucumber is not Tea and must be in 3 or 4, and Thriller is in 4, Cucumber must be in 3.
13. **Superhero**: From clue 3, Superhero is to the left of Corn. Since Cucumber is in 3 and Thriller is in 4, Superhero must be in 2.
14. **Satire**: From clue 13, Dancing (Milk) is to the right of Satire. Since Dancing is in 4, Satire must be in 3, but Cucumber is in 3, so Satire must be in 2, but Superhero is in 2. So, Satire must be in 1, but Basketball is in 1, so this is incorrect. Let's recheck:
