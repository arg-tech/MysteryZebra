Lv6-5x6-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items into their respective positions. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Clue 21:** The fan of trance is the person driving the van.
2. **Clue 22:** The fan of metal is the person driving the tram.
3. **Clue 14:** The person who plays handball is the person driving the van.
4. **Clue 21 & 22 & 14:** This means:
   - Fan of Trance = Van Driver = Handball Player
   - Fan of Metal = Tram Driver

5. **Clue 20:** The fan of Country is somewhere to the right of the Tram Driver.
6. **Clue 26:** The fan of Trance is not the person eating Apricot.
7. **Clue 23:** The person eating Avocado is on the left of the person who plays Handball (Van Driver).
8. **Clue 24:** The person eating Apricot is on the far left or far right.

Since the person eating Apricot is on the far left or far right, and the Van Driver (who eats Avocado) cannot be on the far left or far right, the Apricot eater must be in position 1 or 6.

### Placing Apricot Eater
- If the Apricot eater is in position 1, then the Van Driver (Handball player) must be in position 2, which contradicts Clue 6 (Tram driver is not next to Apricot eater). So, the Apricot eater must be in position 6.

Thus, the Apricot eater is in position 6.

### Placing Van Driver
- Since the Apricot eater is in position 6, the Van Driver (Handball player) must be in position 5.

### Placing Tram Driver
- The Tram Driver (Metal fan) must be in position 4 since the Van Driver (Handball player) is in position 5.

### Placing Country Fan
- The Country fan is somewhere to the right of the Tram Driver (position 4), so the Country fan must be in position 5 or 6. But since position 5 is already occupied by the Van Driver, the Country fan must be in position 6.

### Placing Chinchilla Owner
- The Chinchilla owner is on the left of the Tram Driver, so the Chinchilla owner must be in position 3.

### Placing Rowing Sport
- The person who plays Rowing is on the left or right of the Van Driver, so they can be in position 4 or 5. Since position 5 is the Van Driver, the Rowing player must be in position 4.

### Placing Horse Owner
- The Horse owner is not the Van Driver, so the Horse owner must be in position 2.

### Placing Ferret Owner
- The Ferret owner is on the left of the Boat Driver, and the Ferret owner is also the Cauliflower eater. So, the Ferret owner must be in position 1, and the Cauliflower eater is in position 2.

### Placing Cabbage Eater
- The Cabbage eater is on the left or right of the Rowing player, and the Rowing player is in position 4. So, the Cabbage eater must be in position 3 or 5. Since the Chinchilla owner is in position 3, the Cabbage eater must be in position 5.

### Placing Salsa Fan
- The Salsa fan is on the left or right of the Van Driver, so the Salsa fan must be in position 4 or 5. Since the Rowing player is in position 4, the Salsa fan must be in position 5.

### Placing Corn Eater
- The Corn eater is on the left or right of the Boat Driver, and the Boat Driver is in position 6. So, the Corn eater must be in position 5.

Lv6-5x6-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements accordingly. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 24:** The American drinks Fanta.
2. **Clue 14:** The person drinking Almond-milk is to the left of the person watching Adventure movies.
3. **Clue 25:** The person drinking 7up is between the person eating Orange and the Pakistani.
4. **Clue 11:** The person watching Sports movies is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
5. **Clue 13:** The person watching Superhero movies is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
6. **Clue 12:** The person watching Documentary movies is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

From Clue 11 and Clue 13:
- Sports movies: Even position (2, 4, 6)
- Superhero movies: Odd position (1, 3, 5)

From Clue 12:
- Documentary movies: Odd position (1, 3, 5)

Since there are only three odd positions and three odd positions for movies, we can assign:
- Documentary movies: 1
- Superhero movies: 3
- Sports movies: 4 or 6

### Assigning Positions:

Let's start assigning positions based on other clues.

**Clue 24:** American drinks Fanta, so:
- American: 4 (since they drink Fanta and must be in an even position)

**Clue 13:** Superhero movies are in an odd position, so:
- Superhero movies: 3 (since American is at 4)

**Clue 12:** Documentary movies are in an odd position, so:
- Documentary movies: 1 (since American is at 4)

**Clue 25:** The person drinking 7up is between the person eating Orange and the Pakistani.
- Since American is at 4, the person drinking 7up must be at 2 or 6.

### Positioning the Person Drinking 7up:

If the person drinking 7up is at 2:
- The person eating Orange must be at 1 (Documentary) or 3 (Superhero), but since 3 is taken by Superhero, it must be at 1.
- The Pakistani must be at 3 (Superhero).

If the person drinking 7up is at 6:
- The person eating Orange must be at 5 (Sports).
- The Pakistani must be at 5 (Sports).

Given Clue 25, let's assume the person drinking 7up is at 2:
- Person eating Orange: 1
- Pakistani: 3
- American: 4
- Superhero: 3 (conflict, so assume 7up is at 6):
- Person eating Orange: 5
- Pakistani: 4
- American: 6

### Reassigning:

- Person drinking 7up: 6
- Person eating Orange: 5
- Pakistani: 4
- American: 6

Now, let's continue with the remaining clues.

**Clue 21:** The Indian is on the left of the person watching Adventure movies.
- Indian cannot be at 6 (Pakistani), so Indian is at 1, 3, or 5.
- Person watching Adventure movies: 2, 4, or 6 (not 6, as 6 is 7up).

**Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is Puzzles is to the right of the person drinking Cola.
- Person drinking Cola: 1, 3, or 5.
- Person with Puzzles: 2, 4, or 6.

**Clue 5:** The German is not the person watching Sports movies.
- Sports movies: 4 (American).

**Clue 6:** The Nigerian is to the left of the person watching Sports movies.
- Nigerian: 2, 3, or 5.
- Sports movies: 4.

**Clue 7:** The person eating Raspberry is to the left of the person drinking Cola.
- Person eating Raspberry: 1, 3, or 5.
- Person drinking Cola: 2, 4, or 6.

### Final Assignment:

- Person drinking 7up: 6
- Person eating Orange: 5
- Pakistani: 4
- American: 6
- Person watching Documentary: 1
- Indian: 3
- Person watching Superhero: 3
- Person watching Adventure: 2
- Person with Puzzles: 4
- Person drinking Cola: 1
- Person eating Raspberry: 2
- Person eating Pineapple: 5
- Person eating Cherry: 3
- Person eating Peas: 4
- Person watching Animation: 5
- Person watching Family: 1
- Person watching Sports: 4
- Person watching Animation: 5

Now, let's start filling in the table based on these clues:

|            |       1       |     2      |       3        |      4      |     5     |       6       |
| Beverage   |               |            |                |             |           |               |
| Food       |               |            |                |             |           |               |
| Hobby      |               |            |                |             |           |               |
| Job        |               |            |                |             |           |               |
| Pet        |               |            |                |             |           |               |

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 30**: The person eating mango is the mechanic.
2. **Clue 32**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position (position 2 or 4).
3. **Clue 34**: The person who's hobby is woodworking is in an even position (position 2 or 4).

Since the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in an even position and the person who's hobby is woodworking must also be in an even position, and the mechanic (mango eater) is in position 1, the only available positions for the hot-chocolate drinker and the woodworking hobbyist are positions 2 and 4. 

Let's assume:
- Position 2: Hot-chocolate
- Position 4: Woodworking

4. **Clue 24**: The owner of the chinchilla is not the bartender.
5. **Clue 27**: The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
6. **Clue 28**: The person eating lettuce is somewhere to the left of the owner of the turtle.
7. **Clue 29**: The person eating pineapple is on the left or right of the person eating apricot.
8. **Clue 31**: The social-worker is not the person drinking sprite.
9. **Clue 33**: The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
10. **Clue 36**: The person eating lettuce is not the videographer.
11. **Clue 37**: The bartender is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

Given that the woodworking hobbyist is in position 4, the bartender must be in position 5 or 6. Since the bartender cannot be in position 4 (woodworking), the bartender must be in position 5 or 6.
