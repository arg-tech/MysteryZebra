20. The coach is between the person whose hobby is rock-climbing and the person whose hobby is singing.
21. The person whose hobby is woodworking is not the fisherman.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Fixed Positions:
- From clue 6, the person whose hobby is singing is the person drinking mirinda.
- From clue 10, the coach is the person drinking 7up.
- From clue 16, the coach is on the left or right of the journalist. Since the coach (7up) must be in an odd position (clue 12), the coach must be in position 1 or 3 or 5. Therefore, the journalist must be in position 2 or 4 or 6.
- From clue 19, the person drinking cola is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up (coach). So, cola cannot be in positions 1 or 3 if the coach is in position 1 or 3, respectively.

#### Step 2: Determine Hobbies and Beverages:
- From clue 1, cola is to the left of cooking.
- From clue 2, milk is to the left of the chef.
- From clue 3, juice is to the left of the chef.
- From clue 4, 7up is to the left of rock-climbing.
- From clue 5, skydiving is to the right of woodworking.
- From clue 14, rock-climbing is not mirinda.
- From clue 15, skydiving is to the right of cooking.
- From clue 17, the lawyer is to the right of singing (mirinda).
- From clue 18, rock-climbing is to the left of the bartender.
- From clue 20, the coach (7up) is between rock-climbing and singing (mirinda).

Given these constraints, let's try to place them:

1. Assume the coach (7up) is in position 3:
   - Then the journalist must be in position 4 or 6.
   - Rock-climbing must be in position 2 or 4.
   - Singing (mirinda) must be in position 4 or 6.
   - Since the coach is between rock-climbing and singing, rock-climbing must be in position 2 and singing in position 4.
   - This leaves position 1 for cola (to the left of cooking) and position 5 for juice (to the left of the chef).

2. If the coach (7up) is in position 3:
   - Position 1: cola
   - Position 2: rock-climbing
   - Position 3: 7up (coach)
   - Position 4: singing (mirinda)
   - Position 5: juice
   - Position 6: remaining beverage (milk or sprite)

Since milk and sprite are left, and milk must be to the left of the chef, and juice must be to the left of the chef, milk must be in position 1 and sprite in position 6.

3. Assign remaining hobbies:
   - Cooking must be in position 5 (left of the person with cola in position 1).
   - Skydiving must be in position 6 (right of woodworking).
   - Woodworking must be in position 2 (left of skydiving).

Finally, assign jobs:
- Bartender must be in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Chef must be in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).

Based on the above deductions:

|            |     1     |     2     |       3       |    4    |      5      |     6     |
| Beverage   |   cola    |   milk    |     7up       |  sprite |    juice    |  mirinda  |
| Hobby      |  woodworking | rock-climbing |  singing | skydiving |    cooking  |  mirinda  |
| Job        |   bartender |   fisherman |   coach      |  lawyer |   journalist |   chef    |

Lv6-3x6-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Step 1: Identify Immediate Assignments

1. **Clue 11**: The person drinking mirinda is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking milk is the fan of ambient.
3. **Clue 14**: The person drinking milk is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person who's hobby is traveling.

Since the person drinking milk (ambient fan) must be between skydiving and traveling, and mirinda must be on the far left or far right, let's consider these positions.

### Step 2: Assign Mirinda

- If mirinda is at position 1, then:
  - Skydiving must be at position 2 or 3.
  - Traveling must be at position 4 or 5.
  - Milk must be at position 3 or 4.

- If mirinda is at position 6, then:
  - Skydiving must be at position 5 or 4.
  - Traveling must be at position 3 or 2.
  - Milk must be at position 3 or 4.

Let's assume **mirinda is at position 1** for now and adjust as necessary later.

### Step 3: Assign Milk

- If mirinda is at position 1, then milk must be at position 3 or 4.
- Assume milk is at position 3 (we can switch if it doesn't work).

### Step 4: Assign Skydiving and Traveling

- Skydiving must be at position 2 or 4.
- Traveling must be at position 4 or 5.

Given milk is at position 3, let's try:
- Skydiving at position 2.
- Traveling at position 5.

### Step 5: Assign Cola

- Clue 1: The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling (position 5).
- Cola cannot be at position 5, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 3.
- Since milk is at position 3, cola must be at position 1 or 2.

### Step 6: Assign Cola and Hobbies

- If cola is at position 1, then the person with hobby traveling (position 5) must be on the right of cola.
- If cola is at position 2, then the person with hobby traveling (position 5) must be on the right of cola.

Let's assume cola is at position 1:
- Cola at position 1.
- Person with hobby traveling at position 5.
- Person with hobby hiking must be between classical and reading (clue 4).

### Step 7: Assign Hobbies and Music

- Clue 4: The fan classical is between the person who's hobby is hiking and the person who's hobby is reading.
- Clue 5: The person who's hobby is reading is the person drinking mirinda (position 1).
- Therefore, the person with hobby hiking must be at position 4.

### Step 8: Assign Reading and Hiking

- Reading (mirinda) at position 1.
- Hiking at position 4.
- Classical must be between them (positions 3 or 2).

### Step 9: Assign Remaining Hobbies and Beverages

- Clue 10: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
- Magic-tricks must be at position 6.

- Clue 16: The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
- Card-games must be at position 5.

- Clue 7: The fan r&b is not the person drinking almond-milk.
- Fan r&b must be at position 2.

- Clue 12: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the fan r&b.
- Fan r&b at position 2 (magic-tricks).

- Clue 13: The person who's hobby is traveling is not the fan folk.
- Traveling at position 5, so folk cannot be at position 5.

- Clue 15: The fan dubstep is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking.
- Dubstep must be at position 3.

- Clue 17: The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan folk.
- Cola at position 1, so folk must be at position 2.

- Clue 18: The fan ambient is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
- Ambient (milk) at position 3, so fan ambient must be at position 4.

- Clue 19: The person drinking tea is on the right of the fan r&b.
- Tea must be at position 6.

- Clue 20: The person who's hobby is skydiving is not the fan funk.
- Skydiving at position 2, so fan funk cannot be at position 2.

   - Since the person driving the trike is in position 2, the person driving the boat must be in position 4.
10. **Clue 3:** The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the trike.
    - The person driving the trike is in position 2, so the person drinking soy-milk (social-worker) must be in position 3 or 4 or 5.

    - The social-worker (doctor) is in position 3.
18. **Clue 19:** The person drinking coffee is not the person driving the snowmobile.

Lv6-3x6-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The person eating zucchini is in an odd position.
   - Possible positions for zucchini: 1, 3, 5.

2. **Clue 3**: The person eating zucchini is not the fan of electronic.
   - So, if zucchini is at position 1, 3, or 5, it cannot be paired with electronic.

3. **Clue 6**: The fan soul is between the fan indie and the fan country.
   - This means the order must be Indie, Soul, Country (or Country, Soul, Indie).

4. **Clue 12**: The owner of the pony is on the far left or far right.
   - Possible positions for pony: 1 or 6.

5. **Clue 13**: The fan soul is somewhere to the right of the fan indie.
   - This means the order must be Indie, Soul (or Soul, Indie, but the latter is not possible due to Clue 6).

6. **Clue 14**: The person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person eating tomato.
   - This means radish < tomato.

7. **Clue 16**: The person eating broccoli is between the owner of the turtle and the person eating spinach.
   - This means the order must be Turtle, Broccoli, Spinach (or Spinach, Broccoli, Turtle).

8. **Clue 17**: The person eating spinach is the owner of the fish.
   - So, spinach = fish.

9. **Clue 7**: The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the fan soul.
   - This means the fan soul must be before the owner of the hamster.

10. **Clue 11**: The fan electronic is between the fan indie and the owner of the pony.
    - This means the order must be Indie, Electronic, Pony (or Pony, Electronic, Indie).

Now let's organize the information:

- Position 1 must be either pony or a position for zucchini (since zucchini is in an odd position).
- Position 6 must be either pony or a position for zucchini (since zucchini is in an odd position).

Since pony can only be in position 1 or 6, let's consider both cases:

**Case 1: Pony in position 1**
- Positions 1-3: Pony, Zucchini, ?
- Positions 4-6: ?, ?, ?

From Clue 11:
- The fan electronic is between the fan indie and the owner of the pony.
- If pony is in 1, then electronic must be in 2 or 3.

**Case 2: Pony in position 6**
- Positions 1-3: ?, ?, ?
- Positions 4-6: Zucchini, ?, Pony

From Clue 11:
- The fan electronic is between the fan indie and the owner of the pony.
- If pony is in 6, then electronic must be in 4 or 5.

Let's start with Case 1 (Pony in position 1):

1. Pony
2. ?
3. ?
4. ?
5. ?
6. ?

From Clue 11:
- Electronic must be between Indie and Pony.
- Since Pony is in 1, electronic must be in 2 or 3.

From Clue 6:
- Soul is between Indie and Country.
- Possible orders: Indie, Soul, Country or Country, Soul, Indie.

From Clue 13:
- Soul is to the right of Indie.
- Order must be Indie, Soul, Country.

So, we have:
1. Pony
2. Indie
3. Soul
4. ?
5. Country
6. ?

From Clue 12:
- The owner of the pony is on the far left or far right.
- Pony is in 1, so the owner of the pony is in 1.

From Clue 16:
- Broccoli is between the owner of the turtle and the person eating spinach.
- Spinach is fish, so the order must be Turtle, Broccoli, Fish.

From Clue 14:
- Radish is to the left of tomato.

From Clue 17:
- Spinach is fish.

From Clue 5:
- Zucchini is in an odd position (1, 3, 5).

Since zucchini cannot be in 1 (pony), it must be in 3 or 5.

If zucchini is in 3:
- 1. Pony
- 2. Indie
- 3. Zucchini
- 4. ?
- 5. Country
- 6. ?

From Clue 11:
- Electronic must be between Indie and Pony.
- Electronic must be in 2.

So, we have:
1. Pony
2. Electronic
3. Zucchini
4. ?
