### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is board-games is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
2. **Clue 11**: The mexican is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. This means the mexican cannot be in position 5 or 6 if board-games is in position 1, 3, or 5.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who's hobby is fishing is between the malaysian and the person who's hobby is board-games. This means the positions for board-games and fishing must be consecutive with the malaysian in one of them.

2. **Position 6** for photography (since it’s to the right of board-games).
3. **Position 1** for reading (since it’s to the left of malaysian).
4. **Position 2** for chess (since it’s to the right of dutch and not board-games).
5. **Position 3** for fishing (since it’s between malaysian and board-games).
6. **Position 4** for gardening (since it’s not dutch and not board-games).

Now we assign nationalities:

- **Position 1 (reading)**: Malaysian
- **Position 2 (chess)**: Dutch
- **Position 3 (fishing)**: Argentine
- **Position 4 (gardening)**: German
- **Position 5 (board-games)**: Mexican

14. The person eating blueberry is not the person with the hobby of puzzles (Clue 14).
15. The person eating apricot is between the person with the hobby of fishing and the person with the hobby of writing (Clue 15).

### Solution Steps:
1. **Position of Writing Hobby:**
   - From Clue 16, the person with the hobby of writing is in position 1.
   - Therefore, the person eating food in position 1 has the hobby of writing.

2. **Position of Mango:**
   - From Clue 11, the person eating mango is in an odd position.
   - From Clue 10, the person eating mango is to the left of the person with the hobby of puzzles.
   - Since the person with the hobby of puzzles is the person eating cucumber (Clue 13), and the person eating cucumber must be to the right of the person with the hobby of fishing (Clue 3), the person eating mango must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person eating mango is in position 3.

3. **Position of Cucumber:**
   - From Clue 13, the person with the hobby of puzzles is the person eating cucumber.
   - Therefore, the person eating cucumber is in position 4.
   - From Clue 3, the person eating cucumber is to the right of the person with the hobby of fishing.
   - The person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person eating apricot is between positions 2 and 4, which means the person eating apricot is in position 3, but this conflicts with the cucumber being in position 3. Therefore, the person eating apricot must be in position 2, and the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 1.

4. **Position of Banana:**
   - From Clue 6, the person eating banana is to the left of the person with the hobby of singing.
   - From Clue 7, the person eating pepper is to the right of the person eating banana.
   - Therefore, the person eating banana cannot be in position 4 or 5 because cucumber and mango are already there.
   - The person eating banana must be in position 5.
   - The person with the hobby of singing must be in position 6.

5. **Position of Photography and Puzzles:**
   - From Clue 8, the person with the hobby of photography is to the left or right of the person with the hobby of puzzles.
   - The person with the hobby of puzzles is in position 4 (cucumber).
   - The person with the hobby of photography can only be in position 3 or 5.
   - From Clue 12, the person with the hobby of singing is to the left or right of the person with the hobby of photography.
   - Since the person with the hobby of singing is in position 6, the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 3.

6. **Remaining Foods and Hobbies:**
   - The person eating apricot is in position 2.
   - The person eating blueberry cannot be in position 4 (cucumber) or 5 (banana).
   - Therefore, the person eating blueberry must be in position 1, which conflicts with the writing hobby. So, the person eating blueberry must be in position 6.
   - The person eating pepper must be in position 2 (apricot).

Lv6-2x6-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The Russian is the person who's sport is golf.
2. **Clue 2**: The Mexican is not the person who's sport is swimming.
3. **Clue 3**: The Russian is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cricket.
4. **Clue 4**: The Dutch is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing.
5. **Clue 5**: The Indonesian is the person who's sport is skiing.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is sailing is between the person who's sport is swimming and the Polish.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who's sport is climbing is the Argentine.
10. **Clue 10**: The Russian is on the far left or far right.
11. **Clue 11**: The Indonesian is on the right of the Dutch.

From Clue 1 and Clue 10, we know:
- The Russian is either in position 1 or 6.
- Since the Russian is also playing golf (Clue 1), and they must be on the far left or far right, the only possible positions for the Russian are 1 or 6.

Let's assume the Russian is in position 1 (we will test this and if it doesn't work, we can switch to position 6).

Given the Russian is in position 1 and plays golf (Clue 1):
- Position 1: Russian (golf)

Now, let's place the other sports and nationalities based on the remaining clues:

**Clue 9**: The person who's sport is climbing is the Argentine.
- Position 4: Argentine (climbing)

**Clue 7**: The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing.
- Since the Russian is in position 1 (golf) and the Argentine is in position 4 (climbing), the Russian (golf) is already to the left of the Argentine (climbing).

**Clue 6**: The person who's sport is sailing is between the person who's sport is swimming and the Polish.
- Let's denote the person with sport as swimming as S, the person with sport as sailing as Sa, and the Polish as P.
- S must be to the left of Sa, and Sa must be to the left of P.
- This means S, Sa, and P must be in three consecutive positions.

**Clue 4**: The Dutch is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing.
- This means the Dutch cannot be in the position immediately to the left of Sa.

**Clue 8**: The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
- This means Cricket must be to the left of Sa.

**Clue 5**: The Indonesian is the person who's sport is skiing.
- The Indonesian must play skiing and be placed accordingly.

**Clue 2**: The Mexican is not the person who's sport is swimming.
- The Mexican cannot be S.

Let's start placing the remaining sports and nationalities:

Since the Russian is in position 1 (golf) and the Argentine is in position 4 (climbing), we have:
- Position 1: Russian (golf)
- Position 4: Argentine (climbing)

Given the order constraints and the placement of other sports, let's try to fit everything:

- Position 2: Must be a nationality that is not Indonesian (skiing).
- Position 3: Must be a nationality that is not Russian (golf) or Argentine (climbing).
- Position 5: Must be a nationality that is not Indonesian (skiing) or Argentine (climbing).

Let's test with the following arrangement:
- Position 1: Russian (golf)
- Position 2: Polish (sailing)
- Position 3: Dutch (cricket)
- Position 4: Argentine (climbing)
- Position 5: Indonesian (skiing)
- Position 6: Mexican (swimming)

This fits all the clues:
- The Russian is on the far left (position 1).
- The Argentine is in position 4 (climbing).
- The person who's sport is golf (Russian) is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing (Argentine).
- The Dutch is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing (Polish).
- The person who's sport is sailing (Polish) is between the person who's sport is swimming (Mexican) and the person who's sport is skiing (Indonesian).
- The person who's sport is cricket (Dutch) is to the left of the person who's sport is sailing (Polish).
- The Indonesian is to the right of the Dutch.
- The Mexican is not the person who's sport is swimming.

Thus, the final solution is:

   - This means the sequence involving pumpkin and tomato must be: [radish, tomato, pumpkin].

4. **The writer is in an even position.**
   - The possible positions for the writer are 2, 4, or 6.

5. **The police-officer is somewhere to the left of the person eating eggplant.**
   - This means the police-officer cannot be after the person eating eggplant.

6. **The firefighter is on the right of the person eating eggplant.**
   - This means the firefighter must be after the person eating eggplant.

7. **The person eating eggplant is not the firefighter.**
   - The person eating eggplant and the firefighter are different individuals.

10. **Clue 10**: The fan of electronic music is not the person who's hobby is sudoku.
11. **Clue 11**: The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3** and **Clue 4**: Since the person who's hobby is camping is on the far left or far right and must be to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku (Clue 4), the person with camping can only be in position 1 or 6.

2. **Clue 1**: This confirms that if camping is in position 1, then sudoku must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If camping is in position 6, then sudoku must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The fan of electronic music is to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means electronic cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 6 if sudoku is in 1, 2, or 3. If sudoku is in 4, 5, or 6, then electronic must be in 1, 2, or 3.

4. **Clue 5**: The fan of salsa is to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This means woodworking cannot be in position 6.

5. **Clue 6**: The fan of indie is to the left of the fan of gospel. This means gospel cannot be in position 1.

6. **Clue 7**: The fan of ambient is between the fan of rock and the fan of indie. This means rock, indie, and ambient must be consecutive.

7. **Clue 8**: The fan of indie is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. This means chess cannot be in position 5 or 6.

8. **Clue 9**: The fan of salsa is to the right of the fan of gospel. This means gospel cannot be in position 6.

9. **Clue 10**: The fan of electronic music is not the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means electronic cannot be in the same position as sudoku.

10. **Clue 11**: The person who's hobby is cooking is to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This means woodworking cannot be in position 1.

### Final Placement:

Given all these constraints, let's try to fit the pieces together:

- **Position 1**: Camping (since it must be on the far left)
- **Position 2**: Sudoku (since it must be to the right of camping)
- **Position 3**: Electronic (since it must be to the left of sudoku)
- **Position 4**: Chess (since it must be to the left of indie)
- **Position 5**: Cooking (since it must be to the left of woodworking)
- **Position 6**: Woodworking (since it must be to the right of cooking)

Now, let's fill in the music genres:

- **Electronic** cannot be in position 4 or 5, so it must be in position 3.
- **Salsa** must be to the right of woodworking, so it must be in position 6.
- **Indie** must be to the left of gospel, and since rock is between ambient and indie, the only possible order is indie, ambient, rock, gospel.
- **Salsa** is to the right of gospel, so gospel must be in position 5.
- **Ambient** must be between indie and rock, so indie is in position 4, ambient is in position 3, and rock is in position 2.
- **Gospel** is in position 5, and salsa is in position 6.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |   2    |    3    |    4    |      5      |       6       |
| Hobby         | Camping    | Chess  | Sudoku  | Cooking | Rock Climbing| Woodworking  |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic | Indie  | Ambient | Gospel  | Salsa       | Rock         |

11. The owner of the ferret is not the person drinking juice.
12. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.
13. The owner of the frog is in an odd position.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 7
- The owner of the turtle (T) is the person drinking mirinda (M).

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & & & & & M & \\
\hline
Pet & T & & & & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 10
- The owner of the bird (B) is the person drinking hot-chocolate (H).

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & & & & H & M & \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & & & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 13
- The owner of the frog (F) is in an odd position.

So, F can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 1
- The owner of the rabbit (R) is on the left of the person drinking mirinda (M).

Since M is in position 5, R must be in position 4.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & & & & H & M & \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & & R & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 2
- The owner of the snake (S) is between the person drinking sprite (S) and the person drinking hot-chocolate (H).

Since H is in position 4, S must be in position 3, and S must be in position 2.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & & & S & H & M & \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & S & R & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 3
- The owner of the turtle (T) is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk (J).

Since T is already in position 1, J must be in position 6.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & & & S & H & M & J \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & S & R & & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 7: Analyze Clue 4
- The owner of the frog (F) is not the person drinking hot-chocolate (H).

Since H is in position 4, F cannot be in position 4. Since F is in an odd position, F must be in position 1.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & F & & S & H & M & J \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & S & R & & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 8: Analyze Clue 5
- The person drinking sprite (S) is not the owner of the snake (S).

Since S is in position 3, the person drinking sprite cannot be in position 2.

#### Step 9: Analyze Clue 6
- The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake.

Since S is in position 3, the person drinking sprite must be in position 1.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & F & S & S & H & M & J \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & S & R & & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 10: Analyze Clue 8
- The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person drinking milk.

Since M is in position 5, S must be in position 2.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & F & S & S & H & M & J \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & S & R & & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 11: Analyze Clue 9
- The owner of the turtle (T) is on the right of the person drinking juice (J).

Since T is in position 6, J must be in position 5.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & F & S & S & H & M & J \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & S & R & T & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 12: Analyze Clue 11
- The owner of the ferret (F) is not the person drinking juice (J).

Since J is in position 5, F must be in position 1.

#### Step 13: Analyze Clue 12
- The person drinking coffee (C) is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk (M).

Since M is in position 5, C must be in position 6.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & F & S & S & H & M & C \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & S & R & T & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Finally, we need to assign the remaining beverages to the remaining positions.

- Juice (J) is in position 5.
- Coffee (C) is in position 6.
- The only remaining beverage is juice (J), which must be in position 3.
- The only remaining beverage is coffee (C), which must be in position 4.

Thus, the final solution is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & F & S & J & C & M & C \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & S & R & T & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Beverage & F & S & J & C & M & C \\
\hline
Pet & T & B & S & R & T & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
}

Lv6-2x6-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the beverages and transportation methods accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.
2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the person driving the motorbike.
3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite.
4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the skateboard.
7. **Clue 7**: The person drinking mirinda is not the person driving the taxi.
8. **Clue 8**: The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the roller.
9. **Clue 9**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
10. **Clue 11**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
11. **Clue 12**: The person driving the motorbike is on the far left or far right.
12. **Clue 13**: The person driving the snowmobile is between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking sprite.
13. **Clue 14**: The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.
14. **Clue 15**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Clue 12**: The person driving the motorbike is on the far left or far right. This means the motorbike can only be in position 1 or 6.
2. **Clue 8**: The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the roller. Since the motorbike is at either end, the roller must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Clue 2**: The person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the person driving the motorbike. So if the motorbike is in position 1, the roller must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the motorbike is in position 6, the roller must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
4. **Clue 12** and **Clue 8** together imply that the motorbike must be in position 1 because if it were in position 6, there would be no room for the roller to be to its right.
5. **Clue 11**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person drinking sprite. This means the sprite cannot be in the last position (position 6).
6. **Clue 10**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person drinking sprite. This implies the sprite must be in position 4 or 5, and the snowmobile must be in position 5 or 6.
7. **Clue 13**: The person driving the snowmobile is between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking sprite. This means mirinda must be in position 3, sprite in position 4 or 5, and snowmobile in position 4 or 5.
8. **Clue 9**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. This means mirinda must be in position 5 and sprite in position 4, with the snowmobile in position 4.
9. **Clue 3**: The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite. This means the taxi must be in position 5 or 6.
10. **Clue 7**: The person drinking mirinda is not the person driving the taxi. So the taxi must be in position 6.
11. **Clue 6**: The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the skateboard. This means the skateboard must be in position 5 and the trike in position 4.
12. **Clue 14**: The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since mirinda is in position 5, milk must be in position 4.
13. **Clue 15**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. This is already satisfied since the snowmobile is in position 4 and the skateboard in position 5.
14. **Clue 5**: The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking 7up. This means 7up must be in position 1 and cola in position 2.
15. **Clue 4**: The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. This means juice must be in position 3 or 4 or 5 or 6. Since 7up and cola are in positions 1 and 2, and sprite and mirinda are in positions 4 and 5, juice must be in position 6.
16. **Clue 1**: The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since milk is in position 4 and the trike is in position 4, the person drinking milk must be in position 4.
17. **Clue 10**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person drinking sprite. This is already satisfied.

### Final Table:
```
|             |     1     |   2    |   3    |     4      |     5      |   6   |

Lv6-2x6-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the right of the police-officer.
2. The person who's sport is tennis is not the lawyer.
3. The police-officer is the person who's sport is volleyball.
4. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the project-manager.
5. The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the right of the dressmaker.
6. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far left or far right.
7. The engineer is the engineer (no additional information).
8. The person who's sport is tennis is in an odd position.
9. The person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the lawyer.
10. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
11. The entrepreneur is not the person who's sport is volleyball.
12. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
13. The entrepreneur is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
14. The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing.
15. The engineer is on the right of the project-manager.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Lacrosse and Police-Officer
From clue 6, lacrosse is on the far left or far right.
From clue 12, the person with lacrosse is to the right of the person with badminton.
From clue 1, the person with badminton is to the right of the police-officer.

Possible positions for lacrosse and police-officer:
- Lacrosse: 1st or 6th
- Police-officer: 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th (but not 6th because lacrosse is on the far right)

#### Step 2: Positioning Police-Officer
Since the police-officer plays volleyball (clue 3), and they must be to the right of the badminton player (clue 1), and the badminton player is to the right of the lacrosse player (clue 12), we can place the police-officer in the 5th position.

- Police-officer: 5th
- Lacrosse: 1st or 6th

#### Step 3: Positioning Badminton
Since the police-officer is in the 5th position and the badminton player must be to the right of the police-officer (clue 1), the badminton player cannot be in the 5th position. Also, the badminton player must be to the left of the lacrosse player (clue 12).

Thus, the badminton player is in the 4th position.

- Badminton: 4th
- Lacrosse: 1st (since it's the far left)

#### Step 4: Positioning Sailing and Project-Manager
From clue 4, the sailing player is on the left or right of the project-manager. From clue 14, the badminton player (4th) is on the right of the sailing player. Thus, the sailing player is in the 3rd position.

- Sailing: 3rd
- Project-manager: 2nd (since the sailing player is to the left of the project-manager)

#### Step 5: Positioning Tennis
From clue 8, the tennis player is in an odd position (1st, 3rd, or 5th). Since the 5th position is occupied by the police-officer, the 3rd position is occupied by the sailing player, the only remaining odd position is 1st.

From clue 2, the tennis player is not the lawyer. Therefore, the tennis player is either the dressmaker, engineer, entrepreneur, or project-manager.

#### Step 6: Positioning Skateboarding
From clue 9, the skateboarding player is to the right of the lawyer. From clue 13, the entrepreneur is on the left or right of the skateboarding player. Since the police-officer is the volleyball player and the entrepreneur is not the volleyball player (clue 11), the entrepreneur is the skateboarding player.

- Skateboarding: 6th
- Lawyer: 1st, 3rd, or 4th (but not 4th because the badminton player is there)
- Dressmaker: 2nd (since the police-officer is 5th and the entrepreneur is 6th)

#### Step 7: Final Placement
From clue 10, the skateboarding player (entrepreneur) is to the right or left of the lacrosse player (1st). The only position left for the lawyer is 4th.

- Lawyer: 4th

Thus, the final positions are:
- 1st: Dressmaker
- 2nd: Engineer
- 3rd: Sailing
- 4th: Tennis
- 5th: Police-officer
- 6th: Entrepreneur
