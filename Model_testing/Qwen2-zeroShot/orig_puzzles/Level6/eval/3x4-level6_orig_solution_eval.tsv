Lv6-3x4-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Manager is in an odd position**:
   - Possible positions: 1 or 3

2. **Nurse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket**:
   - This means the nurse is either in position 2 (left) or 4 (right) if the person with cricket is in position 1 or 3 respectively.

3. **Spanish is on the right of the doctor**:
   - The Spanish person must be in position 4 and the doctor in position 3.

4. **Malaysian is the person who's sport is cricket**:
   - The Malaysian is in position 2 or 4 since cricket is in an even position.

5. **American is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer**:
   - The American cannot be in position 1 because the person with soccer is to the left of the American.

6. **Person who's sport is cricket is in an even position**:
   - Possible positions: 2 or 4

7. **Analyst is the person who's sport is ice-hockey**:
   - The Analyst has ice-hockey as their sport.

8. **Manager is on the right of the doctor**:
   - The Manager must be in position 3 and the Doctor in position 2.

9. **Person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the nurse**:
   - The Analyst (ice-hockey) is not the nurse.

10. **Person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket**:
    - The person with soccer is either in position 1 or 3 relative to the person with cricket.

11. **Person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the analyst**:
    - The person with soccer is to the left of the Analyst.

Let's summarize the constraints and fill in the table:

- Position 1: Manager (odd position)
- Position 2: Doctor (since the Manager is on the right)
- Position 3: Malysian (cricket) and Manager
- Position 4: Spanish (right of the Doctor)

From clue 4, the Malaysian (cricket) is in position 2. So:
- Position 2: Malaysian (cricket)
- Position 3: Manager

Now, we need to place the rest:
- Position 1: Manager (odd position, already placed)
- Position 2: Malaysian (cricket)
- Position 3: Manager (on the right of the Doctor)
- Position 4: Spanish (right of the Doctor)

We know:
- The nurse is not in position 2 (Malaysian), so she is in position 1.
- The person with soccer is to the left of the Analyst and also to the left or right of the person with cricket (Malaysian).

Since the Analyst has ice-hockey and cannot be the nurse, the only remaining position for the Analyst is position 4.

So:
- Position 1: Nurse (soccer)
- Position 2: Malaysian (cricket)
- Position 3: Manager
- Position 4: Analyst (ice-hockey)

Now we assign the sports and jobs:
- Position 1: Nurse (soccer)
- Position 2: Malaysian (cricket)
- Position 3: Manager
- Position 4: Analyst (ice-hockey)

The sports can be assigned as follows:
- Position 1: Nurse (soccer)
- Position 2: Malaysian (cricket)
- Position 3: Manager
- Position 4: Analyst (ice-hockey)

Finally, the nationalities can be assigned:
- Position 1: Nurse (Spanish)
- Position 2: Malaysian (French)
- Position 3: Manager (American)
- Position 4: Analyst (Malaysian)

   - Scientist can only be in positions 1 or 3.

2. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is baseball and the engineer.
   - This means the order for these three positions must be either Baseball -> Soccer -> Engineer or Engineer -> Soccer -> Baseball.

3. **Clue 10:** The person who's sport is handball is in an even position.
   - Handball can only be in positions 2 or 4.

4. **Clue 3:** The scientist is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf.
   - If the scientist is in position 1, then golf must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - If the scientist is in position 3, then golf must be in position 4.

5. **Clue 8:** The writer is between the engineer and the fan of electronic.
   - This means the writer cannot be in the first or last position.

6. **Clue 4:** The writer is on the left or right of the fan of rock.
   - If the fan of rock is in position 1, the writer can be in position 2.
   - If the fan of rock is in position 2, the writer can be in position 1 or 3.
   - If the fan of rock is in position 3, the writer can be in position 2 or 4.
   - If the fan of rock is in position 4, the writer can be in position 3.

7. **Clue 9:** The fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
   - If the fan of classical is in position 1, the fan of funk can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - If the fan of classical is in position 2, the fan of funk can be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the fan of classical is in position 3, the fan of funk can be in position 4.
   - If the fan of classical is in position 4, the fan of funk cannot be placed.

8. **Clue 5:** The scientist is not the fan of funk.
   - This helps narrow down the possible positions for the scientist.

### Placing Information:

- **Position 1:** Scientist (odd position)
- **Position 2:** Handball (even position)
- **Position 3:** Golf (since scientist is in 1 and must be left of golf)
- **Position 4:** Baseball (since soccer is between baseball and engineer, and handball is in 2)

Given these placements:
- Scientist is in position 1.
- Handball is in position 2.
- Golf is in position 3.
- Baseball is in position 4.

Now, let's place the sports:
- **Baseball** is in position 4.
- **Soccer** must be between baseball and engineer, so it is in position 3.
- **Handball** is in position 2.
- **Golf** is in position 3.

We now have:
- Position 1: Scientist
- Position 2: Handball
- Position 3: Golf
- Position 4: Baseball

  - This means the engineer must be in position 2 (handball).
  - Therefore, the engineer is in position 2.

- **Clue 8:** Writer is between the engineer and the fan of electronic.
  - Since the engineer is in position 2, the writer can be in position 1 or 3.
  - But since scientist is in position 1, the writer must be in position 3.

- **Clue 4:** Writer is on the left or right of the fan of rock.
  - Since the writer is in position 3, the fan of rock must be in position 1 or 4.
  - Since the scientist is in position 1, the fan of rock must be in position 4.

- **Clue 9:** Fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
  - Since the fan of rock is in position 4, the fan of funk must be in position 4.

- **Clue 5:** Scientist is not the fan of funk.
  - The fan of funk must be in position 4.

Lv6-3x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue step-by-step and place the information into the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is fishing is between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the person watching thriller movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is fishing is between the person watching thriller movies and the person watching satire movies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching satire movies is not the person who's hobby is baking.
4. **Clue 4:** The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is skiing is the person who's hobby is baking.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person watching superhero movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 6:** The person who's sport is skiing is the person who's hobby is baking.
   - So, **Baking** → **Skiing**.

2. **From Clue 5:** The person who's sport is skiing (baking) is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
   - Therefore, **Cooking** must be in position 1 or 2.

3. **From Clue 3:** The person watching satire movies is not the person who's hobby is baking (so not the person who's sport is skiing).
   - Thus, the person watching satire movies cannot be the one with the hobby of baking.

4. **From Clue 1 and Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is fishing is between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the person watching thriller movies, and also between the person watching thriller movies and the person watching satire movies.
   - This means the person who's hobby is fishing must be in the middle (position 2 or 3), and the person watching thriller movies must be on one side, and the person watching satire movies must be on the other side.
   - Let’s assume the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 2 (we can check if this assumption holds).

5. **From Clue 4:** The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
   - If the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 2, then the person watching thriller movies must be in position 1, and the person watching satire movies must be in position 3 (since the person watching sports movies must be on the right of the person watching satire movies).

6. **From Clue 7:** The person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person watching superhero movies.
   - Since the person who's sport is skiing is in position 4, and the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 3 (since the person who's sport is baseball must be on the left of soccer and the person watching superhero movies must be on the right of soccer), we can deduce:
     - Position 1: Thriller Movies
     - Position 2: Fishing
     - Position 3: Soccer
     - Position 4: Sports Movies

7. **From Clue 3:** The person watching satire movies is not the person who's hobby is baking.
   - Since the person who's hobby is baking is skiing (position 4), the person watching satire movies must be either woodworking or cooking.
   - From Clue 2, the person watching satire movies must be on the right of the person watching thriller movies and on the left of the person watching superhero movies.
   - Therefore, the person watching satire movies must be woodworking (since cooking is in position 1 or 2, and woodworking fits the criteria).

8. **Remaining Hobbies and Movies:**
   - Position 1: Thriller Movies
   - Position 2: Fishing
   - Position 3: Soccer
   - Position 4: Sports Movies
   - The person who's hobby is woodworking watches satire movies.
   - The person who's hobby is cooking watches superhero movies.

Lv6-3x4-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Bike Driver**:
   - From clue 1, the bike driver is either in position 1 or 4.
   
2. **Social-Worker and Watermelon**:
   - From clue 2, the social-worker is not eating watermelon.
   - From clue 6, the person eating garlic is on the far right (position 4).
   - From clue 7, the person eating garlic is in an even position (position 4).

3. **Social-Worker Position**:
   - From clue 3, the social-worker is on the right of the person driving the bike.
   - If the bike driver is in position 1, the social-worker must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - Since the social-worker is not eating watermelon (clue 2) and is on the right of the bike driver, and considering the bike driver can only be in position 1, the social-worker must be in position 2.

4. **Watermelon Position**:
   - From clue 4, the person eating watermelon is between the fisherman and the person driving the van.
   - The person driving the van cannot be in position 1 (since the bike driver is there), so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - The person eating watermelon cannot be in position 4 (since garlic is there), so it must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the person driving the van is in position 3, the watermelon eater must be in position 2.
   - But since the social-worker is in position 2, the watermelon eater must be in position 3.

5. **Fisherman and Van Driver**:
   - The fisherman and the van driver must be in positions 2 and 3, but since the social-worker is in position 2, the fisherman must be in position 2 and the van driver in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person eating watermelon is the fisherman in position 3.

6. **Pomegranate and Cauliflower**:
   - From clue 9, the person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person eating cauliflower.
   - From clue 10, the person eating watermelon (fisherman) is on the left or right of the person eating pomegranate.
   - Since the watermelon eater is in position 3, the pomegranate eater must be in position 2 or 4.
   - The garlic eater is in position 4.
   - The cauliflower eater must be in position 2, making the pomegranate eater in position 4.

7. **Project-Manager and Dressmaker**:
   - From clue 5, the project-manager is somewhere to the left of the dressmaker.
   - Since the social-worker is in position 2, the project-manager must be in position 1, and the dressmaker in position 3.

8. **Transportation**:
   - From clue 8, the person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus.
   - The bike driver is in position 1, so the bus driver must be in position 2, and the subway driver in position 3.

Lv6-3x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding elements (food, movie genre, nationality) into the correct positions. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching spy movies is not the turkish.**
   - Spy movies ≠ Turkish.

2. **The Russian is between the person eating mango and the Pakistani.**
   - This means the order must be: (Mango, Russian, Pakistani) or (Pakistani, Russian, Mango).

3. **The American is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies.**
   - This means the American cannot be in position 4, and the superhero movie watcher must be to the right of the American.

4. **The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.**
   - Fantasy < Superhero.

5. **The person eating blueberry is not the person watching fantasy movies.**
   - Fantasy ≠ Blueberry.

6. **The person eating mango is somewhere to the right of the person eating pepper.**
   - Pepper < Mango.

7. **The person watching superhero movies is between the Russian and the American.**
   - This means the order must be: (Russian, Superhero, American) or (American, Superhero, Russian).

8. **The person eating pepper is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - Pepper < Martial-Arts.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 2 and Clue 7:**
   - The order must be (Russian, Superhero, American) or (American, Superhero, Russian).
   - Since American is to the left of Superhero (Clue 3), it must be: (Russian, Superhero, American).

2. **From Clue 6:**
   - Pepper < Mango.
   - From Clue 1, Spy ≠ Turkish.
   - From Clue 4, Fantasy < Superhero.
   - From Clue 5, Fantasy ≠ Blueberry.
   - From Clue 8, Pepper < Martial-Arts.

3. **Positioning based on Clue 2:**
   - Russian is between Mango and Pakistani.
   - So, the order must be (Mango, Russian, Pakistani).

4. **Combining all clues:**
   - We know:
     - Russian = 2, Superhero = 3, American = 4.
     - Mango is in position 1, Pakistani is in position 3.
     - Pepper < Mango, so Pepper = 1, Mango = 2.
     - Fantasy < Superhero, so Fantasy = 1 or 2.
     - Fantasy ≠ Blueberry, so Fantasy = 1.
     - Martial-Arts > Pepper, so Martial-Arts = 4.
     - Spy ≠ Turkish, so Spy = 1 or 4 (but Spy ≠ Fantasy, Spy ≠ Martial-Arts, Spy ≠ Superhero).

5. **Final placements:**
   - Food:
     - Position 1: Pepper
     - Position 2: Mango
     - Position 3: Carrot
     - Position 4: Blueberry
   - Movie-Genre:
     - Position 1: Fantasy

10. The person whose sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
11. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of Scooter Driver
From clue 1, the person driving the scooter is either in position 1 or 4.

#### Step 2: Position of Airplane Driver
From clue 2, the person driving the airplane must be to the right of the person whose sport is climbing. This means the person whose sport is climbing cannot be in position 4 (since there would be no room to the right).

#### Step 3: Position of Subway Driver
From clue 3, the person driving the subway is not the person drinking milk. Also, from clue 5, the person drinking milk is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.

#### Step 4: Position of Rugby Player
From clue 4, the person whose sport is rugby is not the person driving the snowmobile.

#### Step 5: Position of Milk Drinker
From clue 5, the person drinking milk is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. This implies that the person driving the snowmobile is in position 1 or 2, and the milk drinker is in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 6: Position of Sprite Drinker
From clue 7, the person drinking sprite is not the person driving the airplane.

#### Step 7: Position of Climbing Player
From clue 8, the person whose sport is climbing is to the left of the person drinking milk.

#### Step 8: Position of Basketball Player
From clue 9, the person whose sport is basketball is to the left of the person driving the subway.

#### Step 9: Position of Surfing Player
From clue 10, the person whose sport is surfing is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

#### Step 10: Relative Positions of 7up and Mirinda Drinkers
From clue 11, the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.

### Solving the Positions:

1. Since the scooter driver is either in position 1 or 4, and considering the other constraints, we can place the scooter driver in position 1.
2. The airplane driver must be to the right of the climbing player. Since the climbing player cannot be in position 4, and considering the relative positions, the climbing player could be in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. The milk drinker is to the right of the snowmobile driver, so if the snowmobile driver is in position 1, the milk drinker must be in position 2. If the snowmobile driver is in position 2, the milk drinker must be in position 3. If the snowmobile driver is in position 3, the milk drinker must be in position 4.
4. The person whose sport is rugby cannot drive the snowmobile, and the person drinking milk is not the rugby player. Considering the positions, the rugby player could be in position 2 or 3.
5. The sprite drinker cannot drive the airplane, and the person drinking milk is not the rugby player. Considering the positions, the sprite drinker could be in position 2, 3, or 4.
6. The basketball player must be to the left of the subway driver, and the climbing player must be to the left of the milk drinker. This helps us narrow down the positions further.
7. The surfing player must be to the left of the snowmobile driver, which helps us place the surfing player as well.
8. The 7up drinker is to the left of the mirinda drinker.

### Final Placement:

- **Scooter Driver**: Position 1
- **Airplane Driver**: Position 3 (since the climbing player is to the left of the milk drinker, and the airplane driver must be to the right of the climbing player)
- **Subway Driver**: Position 4 (since the milk drinker is to the right of the snowmobile driver, and the subway driver cannot be the milk drinker)
- **Snowmobile Driver**: Position 2 (since the milk drinker is to the right of the snowmobile driver)
- **Climbing Player**: Position 1 (since the climbing player is to the left of the milk drinker, and the airplane driver is to the right of the climbing player)

Lv6-3x4-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position**:
   - Possible positions: 1 or 3.

2. **The person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the guinea-pig**:
   - This means the person in position 2 (since 1 and 3 are taken by almond milk) must be the owner of the guinea-pig and drinking soy-milk.

3. **The owner of the frog is not the person eating raspberry**:
   - The person eating raspberry is on the far left (position 1), so the owner of the frog cannot be in position 1.

4. **The owner of the frog is between the owner of the pony and the owner of the guinea-pig**:
   - Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 2, the owner of the frog must be in position 3 (between positions 2 and 4).

5. **The person drinking juice is on the right of the owner of the pony**:
   - If the owner of the pony is in position 1 or 2, then the person drinking juice must be in position 3 or 4, respectively.

6. **The person eating avocado is somewhere to the right of the person eating apple**:
   - This means the person eating apple must be in position 1 or 2, and the person eating avocado must be in position 3 or 4.

7. **The owner of the turtle is on the left of the person eating radish**:
   - This means the owner of the turtle can only be in position 1 or 2, and the person eating radish must be in position 3 or 4.

8. **The person eating raspberry is on the far left**:
   - This confirms that the person in position 1 is eating raspberry.

9. **The person eating apple is the person eating apple**:
   - This reiterates that the person eating apple is in either position 1 or 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1**: Raspberry (given)
2. **Position 2**: Soy-milk, Guinea-pig (from clue 2)
3. **Position 3**: Frog (from clue 4, as it must be between Pony and Guinea-pig)
4. **Position 4**: Juice (from clue 5, as it must be on the right of the owner of the pony)

Now we need to assign the food and pet to these positions:

- **Apple** must be in position 1 (since it's the only place for it given the constraints).
- **Avocado** must be in position 4 (the only remaining position to the right of Apple).

So the table looks like this:

|            |      1      |       2       |   3   |     4      |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Beverage   | Raspberry   | Soy-milk      |       | Juice     |
| Food       | Apple       |               | Frog  | Avocado   |
| Pet        |             | Guinea-pig    |       |           |

Now, let's assign the remaining pet (Pony and Turtle) to the remaining positions:

- **Turtle** must be on the left of the person eating radish.
- **Radish** must be in position 4 since it's the only remaining position.

Therefore, the final table is:

|            |      1      |       2       |   3   |     4      |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Beverage   | Raspberry   | Soy-milk      |       | Juice     |
| Food       | Apple       |               | Frog  | Avocado   |
| Pet        |             | Guinea-pig    | Turtle| Radish    |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |      1      |       2       |   3   |     4      |

9. **Clue 4**: The owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the person eating asparagus.
   - This means the owner of the rat must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since the owner of the rat cannot be the architect (Clue 5), and the architect is in position 4, the owner of the rat must be in position 1 or 2.

10. **Clue 8**: The person eating corn is not the owner of the rat.
    - The person eating corn must be the owner of the asparagus since the only remaining food is asparagus and corn.

11. **Assigning Foods and Jobs**:

Lv6-3x4-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct arrangement.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person drinking water is between the dressmaker and the person drinking 7up**:
   - This means that the sequence for these three must be either (Dressmaker, Water, 7up) or (7up, Water, Dressmaker).

2. **The social-worker is on the left of the person drinking 7up**:
   - This means the social-worker cannot be in position 4, and must be in one of the first three positions, with the person drinking 7up immediately to their right.

3. **The fan of techno is on the left or right of the dressmaker**:
   - This means the dressmaker can't be in position 1 or 4 because there would be no room for techno on both sides.

4. **The entrepreneur is on the right of the person drinking 7up**:
   - This means the person drinking 7up must be in an odd position (1 or 3), and the entrepreneur must be in the next position to the right.

5. **The person drinking 7up is in an even position**:
   - Combining this with the previous point, the person drinking 7up must be in position 2, and the entrepreneur in position 4.

6. **The fan of r&b is on the right of the person drinking sprite**:
   - This means the person drinking sprite must be in position 1, and the fan of r&b in position 2.

7. **The person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of salsa**:
   - This means the fan of salsa cannot be the person drinking almond-milk.

### Putting it all together:

Given the constraints, let's place the elements step-by-step:

- Position 1: The person drinking sprite (since the fan of r&b is on the right of the person drinking sprite).
- Position 2: The fan of r&b.
- Position 3: The person drinking 7up (even position requirement).
- Position 4: The entrepreneur (right of the person drinking 7up).

Now we need to fill in the remaining details:

- The social-worker must be on the left of the person drinking 7up, so they must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is taken by the person drinking sprite, the social-worker must be in position 2, but since position 2 is the fan of r&b, the social-worker must be in position 1.

- The person drinking water is between the dressmaker and the person drinking 7up. Given the positions, the only possible sequence is (Dressmaker, Water, 7up). Therefore, the person drinking water is in position 2, the dressmaker in position 1, and the person drinking 7up in position 3.

- The person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of salsa. The only remaining position for the person drinking almond-milk is position 4, and the fan of salsa must be in position 3 (the person drinking 7up).

| Hobby       |            |             |           |         |
| Transport   |            |             |           |         |

### Placing Elements:

1. **Hobby:**
   - Reading cannot be in the last position.
   - Writing cannot be in the first position.
   - Woodworking cannot be in the first or last position.

3. **Transport:**
   - Roller must be on the left of woodworking.
   - Tram must be to the right of radish.
   - Train must be on the left of writing.
   - Writing is not the person driving the train.

By trying different combinations, we find:

|             |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4    |

| Hobby       | Reading    | Writing     | Woodworking | Cooking |
| Transport   | Roller     | Train       | Tram      | Van     |

### Verification:
