Lv6-4x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information into the table step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. The manager is not the person eating mango.
3. The person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The manager is not the person eating mango. This means the manager can only be either the person drinking sprite or the person having broccoli or writing as a hobby.

2. **Clue 1**: The person eating mango is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This means we need to place mango and soy-milk in such a way that mango comes before soy-milk in one of the rows.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is writing is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This means we need to place writing and soy-milk in such a way that writing comes before soy-milk in one of the rows.

Let's start by placing the information:

#### Step 1: Place the manager (M) and mango (Mg) constraints.
- Since the manager cannot be the person eating mango, the manager can only be in the beverage or food column for either sprite or broccoli, or in the hobby or job column for either electrician or writing.

#### Step 2: Place the mango and soy-milk constraints.
- Mango must be to the left of soy-milk in either the beverage or food columns.

#### Step 3: Place the writing and soy-milk constraints.
- Writing must be to the left of soy-milk in either the beverage or food columns.

Given these constraints, let's try a logical placement:

- Assume the person with the hobby of writing is in the first row (Hobby).
- Then the person with the hobby of board games must be in the second row (Hobby).

Since the writing person must be to the left of the soy-milk drinker, the writing person must be in the first row (Hobby) and the soy-milk drinker must be in the second row (Beverage).

Now, since the manager cannot be the person eating mango, and the mango must be to the left of the soy-milk drinker, the manager must be in the second row (Beverage) and the soy-milk drinker must be in the first row (Beverage).

This leaves us with the following tentative placements:
- First row (Hobby): Writing
- Second row (Beverage): Soy-milk
- First row (Food): Mango
- Second row (Job): Manager

Now, let's fill in the remaining information based on the above placements:
- The person with the hobby of board games must be in the second row (Hobby), which leaves the person with the hobby of writing in the first row (Hobby).
- The person with the job of electrician must be in the first row (Job), leaving the person with the job of manager in the second row (Job).

Thus, the final solution looks like this:

```
|            |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage   |  Soy-milk   |  Manager    |
| Food       |  Mango      |  Electrician|
| Hobby      |  Writing    |  Board-games|
| Job        |  Electrician|  Manager    |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage   |  Soy-milk   |  Manager    |
| Food       |  Mango      |  Electrician|
| Hobby      |  Writing    |  Board-games|
| Job        |  Electrician|  Manager    |

Lv6-4x2-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The person watching comedy movies is in an odd position (1).
2. The person whose sport is skiing is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
3. The person driving the airplane is not the person drinking almond-milk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The person watching comedy movies is in position 1.

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |             |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy      |             |
| Sport         |             |             |
| Transport     |             |             |

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The person whose sport is skiing is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
- Since the person in position 1 is watching comedy, the person in position 2 must be either skiing or drinking 7up.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The person driving the airplane is not the person drinking almond-milk.

Since we know the person in position 1 is watching comedy, let's consider the possible positions for skiing and 7up:

- If the person in position 2 is drinking 7up, then the person in position 1 must be skiing.
- If the person in position 2 is skiing, then the person in position 1 must be drinking 7up.

Let's test both scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Person in Position 2 Drinks 7up**
- Person in Position 1: Skiing
- Person in Position 2: 7up

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |             | 7up         |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy      |             |
| Sport         | Skiing      |             |
| Transport     |             |             |

Now, we need to place the remaining items (almond-milk, time-travel, volleyball, and airplane) into the remaining cells.

- The person in position 1 is already skiing, so the person in position 2 must be drinking 7up.
- The person in position 2 is already drinking 7up, so the person in position 1 must be skiing.

This scenario fits all the clues.

**Scenario 2: Person in Position 2 Skis**
- Person in Position 1: 7up
- Person in Position 2: Skiing

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | 7up         |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy      |             |
| Sport         | Skiing      |             |
| Transport     |             |             |

This scenario does not fit because it places skiing on the left of 7up, but we need to check if it can be consistent with other clues.

Let's finalize the solution with Scenario 1:

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |             | 7up         |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy      |             |
| Sport         | Skiing      |             |
| Transport     |             |             |
```

We still need to fill in the remaining items:

- The person in position 1 is skiing, so the person in position 2 cannot be skiing.
- The person in position 2 drinks 7up, so the person in position 1 cannot drink 7up.
- The person in position 1 watches comedy, so the person in position 2 cannot watch comedy.
- The person in position 1 drives the airplane, so the person in position 2 cannot drive the airplane.
- The person in position 1 drinks almond-milk, so the person in position 2 cannot drink almond-milk.

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-Milk | 7up         |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy      | Time-Travel |
| Sport         | Skiing      | Volleyball  |
| Transport     | Airplane    | Boat        |

Lv6-4x2-3	"Let's break down the information and constraints given in the puzzle step by step to find the solution.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Beverages**: 
   - There are two different beverages: 7up and soy-milk.
   
2. **Hobbies**:
   - There are two different hobbies: filmmaking and woodworking.
   
3. **Movie-Genres**:
   - There are two different movie genres: scientific and zombie.
   
4. **Transport**:
   - There are two different means of transport: airplane and skateboard.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The person watching zombie movies is on the far left (position 1).
   - The person whose hobby is woodworking is not the person drinking 7up.
   - The person driving the airplane is on the left of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.

### Initial Setup:

|               |      1      |     2      |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Beverage      |             |            |
| Hobby         |             |            |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Transport     |             |            |

### Applying Constraints:

1. **Person Watching Zombie Movies is on the Far Left (Position 1)**:
   - This means Position 1 must be ""zombie"" for the movie genre column.

2. **The Person Whose Hobby is Woodworking is Not Drinking 7up**:
   - If the person with woodworking as a hobby is not drinking 7up, they must be drinking soy-milk.

3. **The Person Driving the Airplane is on the Left of the Person Whose Hobby is Filmmaking**:
   - This means if someone is driving an airplane, that person must be on position 1 or 2, and the person with filmmaking as a hobby must be on the right of the person driving the airplane.

### Deduction:

- Since Position 1 is ""zombie"", we can place ""zombie"" in the movie genre column for Position 1.
- Letâ€™s assume the person driving the airplane is in Position 1. Then, the person with filmmaking as a hobby must be in Position 2.
- If the person driving the airplane is in Position 1, then the person in Position 2 cannot be driving the airplane. Therefore, the person in Position 2 must be using the skateboard.

### Possible Assignments:

1. **Position 1 (zombie)**:
   - Movie-Genre: zombie
   - Beverage: (can be either 7up or soy-milk)
   - Hobby: (can be either filmmaking or woodworking)
   - Transport: airplane

2. **Position 2**:
   - Movie-Genre: scientific
   - Beverage: (can be either 7up or soy-milk)
   - Hobby: (can be either filmmaking or woodworking)
   - Transport: skateboard

### Applying the Second Constraint:

- The person with woodworking as a hobby is not drinking 7up. So, the person with woodworking must be drinking soy-milk.

### Final Assignment:

- If the person with woodworking is drinking soy-milk, the person with filmmaking must be drinking 7up (since woodworking is not 7up).

### Putting It All Together:

|               |      1      |     2      |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Beverage      | soy-milk    | 7up        |
| Hobby         | woodworking| filmmaking |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie      | scientific |
| Transport     | airplane   | skateboard |

### Final Solution Table:

Lv6-4x2-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The Brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller.
2. The person who's sport is tennis is not the fan of punk.
3. The Brazilian is the fan of punk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3: The Brazilian is the fan of punk.
This means the Brazilian person prefers punk music.

#### Clue 2: The person who's sport is tennis is not the fan of punk.
Since the Brazilian (who is the fan of punk) plays tennis, the person who plays tennis cannot be the Brazilian. Therefore, the person who plays tennis must be Dutch and prefers electronic music.

#### Clue 1: The Brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller.
Given that the Brazilian is the fan of punk, and the person who drives the roller is not the Brazilian, this means the person driving the roller must be Dutch. Since the Dutch person does not play tennis (from Clue 2), they must play swimming.

So far, we have:
- **Person 1 (Dutch):**
  - Sport: Swimming
  - Music-Genre: Electronic
  - Nationality: Dutch
  - Transport: Roller

- **Person 2 (Brazilian):**
  - Sport: Tennis
  - Music-Genre: Punk
  - Nationality: Brazilian
  - Transport: Airplane

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |

Lv6-4x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and use a process of elimination to fill in the table.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the journalist.
2. The person watching fantasy movies is not the owner of the rabbit.
3. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions for hobbies and jobs.
- There are two different hobbies: gardening and singing.
- There are two different jobs: dancer and journalist.
- There are two different movie genres: fantasy and scientific.
- There are two different pets: cat and rabbit.

Since there are only two columns, we can place the hobbies and jobs as follows:
- Column 1 will be either gardening or singing.
- Column 2 will be the other hobby (singing if column 1 is gardening, and vice versa).
- Similarly, for jobs: one job in column 1 and the other in column 2.

#### Step 2: Apply Clue 1.
- The person with the hobby of singing must be to the right of the journalist.
- This means the journalist cannot be in column 2 because then singing would not be to the right of it. Therefore, the journalist must be in column 1, and singing must be in column 2.

So, we have:
```
| Hobby         | Job           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| journalist    |               |
| singing       |               |
```

#### Step 3: Apply Clue 2.
- The person watching fantasy movies is not the owner of the rabbit.
- Since singing is in column 2, the person with the hobby of singing might watch fantasy movies. But since they are not the owner of the rabbit, the person watching fantasy movies must be in column 1.

So, we have:
```
| Hobby         | Job           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| journalist    |               |
| singing       |               |
| Movie-Genre   |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| rabbit        |               |
```

#### Step 4: Apply Clue 3.
- The person with the hobby of singing is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
- Since the person with the hobby of singing is in column 2, the owner of the rabbit must be in column 1.

So, we have:
```
| Hobby         | Job           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| journalist    | dancer        |
| singing       |               |
| Movie-Genre   | fantasy       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| rabbit        |               |
```

Now, we need to determine the remaining entries:
- The remaining job is journalist, which must be in column 1.
- The remaining movie genre is scientific, which must be in column 2.
- The remaining pet is cat, which must be in column 2.

So, the final table looks like this:
```
| Hobby         | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| journalist    | dancer        | fantasy     | cat          |
| singing       |               | scientific  | rabbit       |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Hobby         | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| journalist    | dancer        | fantasy     | cat          |

Lv6-4x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies.
   - This means if we list the movie genres from left to right, ""horror"" must come before ""romance"".

2. **Clue 2**: The person whose sport is sailing is not the person eating asparagus.
   - This means the person who eats asparagus cannot be the one who plays sailing.

3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the person eating asparagus.
   - This means if we list the foods from left to right, the person who owns the cat must be to the right of the person who eats asparagus.

### Initial Setup

We can start by setting up the table with placeholders for each category:

```
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | asparagus | tomato  |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |
| Pet           |           |         |
| Sport         |           |         |
```

### Applying Clues

#### Clue 1: Movie Genres

Since ""horror"" must come before ""romance"", we can place them as follows:
- Horror in position 1
- Romance in position 2

```
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | asparagus | tomato  |
| Movie-Genre   | horror    | romance |
| Pet           |           |         |
| Sport         |           |         |
```

#### Clue 2: Sport and Food

The person who eats asparagus does not play sailing. We don't know yet who eats asparagus or plays sailing, but we can use this clue later.

#### Clue 3: Pet Ownership

The owner of the cat is to the right of the person who eats asparagus. This means the person who owns the cat must be in position 2.

Let's assign the pet ownership based on this clue:
- Cat in position 2 (since the owner of the cat must be to the right of the person eating asparagus)

```
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | asparagus | tomato  |
| Movie-Genre   | horror    | romance |
| Pet           | pony      | cat     |
| Sport         |           |         |
```

Now, we need to determine who eats asparagus and who plays sailing. Since the person who eats asparagus does not play sailing, we can assign sports as follows:

- Asparagus cannot be associated with sailing.
- Tomato can be associated with sailing (since asparagus cannot).

So, we have:
- Tomato in position 1 (for sailing)
- Asparagus in position 2 (for some other sport)

Finally, we can complete the table:

```
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | asparagus | tomato  |
| Movie-Genre   | horror    | romance |
| Pet           | pony      | cat     |
| Sport         | golf      | sailing |
```

### Final Solution Table

```
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | asparagus | tomato  |
| Movie-Genre   | horror    | romance |

Lv6-4x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break down the clues one by one:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The fan of pop is not the Chinese.
2. **Clue 2:** The Argentine is on the left of the Chinese.
3. **Clue 3:** The Project-Manager is on the left of the person driving the ship.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions based on Clue 2
- The Argentine is on the left of the Chinese.
- This means the Argentine must be in position 1, and the Chinese must be in position 2.

#### Step 2: Identify the positions based on Clue 3
- The Project-Manager is on the left of the person driving the ship.
- Since the Project-Manager must be on the left, he can only be in position 1 or 2. Given that the Argentine is in position 1, the Project-Manager must be in position 1, and the person driving the ship must be in position 2.

So far, we have:
```
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager |         |
| Music-Genre   |                 |         |
| Nationality   | Argentine       | Chinese |
| Transport     | Roller          | Ship    |
```

#### Step 3: Apply Clue 1
- The fan of pop is not the Chinese.
- Since the Chinese is in position 2, the fan of pop cannot be the Chinese. Therefore, the fan of pop must be the Argentine.

Since the Argentine is already placed in position 1 as a Project-Manager, he cannot be the fan of pop. Thus, the fan of pop must be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:
- Position 1 (Project-Manager) does not have a music genre yet.
- Position 2 (Argentine) is the fan of pop.

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager |         |
| Music-Genre   |                 | Pop     |
| Nationality   | Argentine       | Chinese |
| Transport     | Roller          | Ship    |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the remaining details
- The Project-Manager (position 1) must be either lawyer or project-manager. Since he is already identified as a Project-Manager, he cannot be a lawyer.
- The remaining job for position 2 (Chinese) must be lawyer.

- The remaining music genre for position 1 (Project-Manager) must be r&b.

So, the final table is:
```
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager | Lawyer  |
| Music-Genre   | R&B             | Pop     |
| Nationality   | Argentine       | Chinese |
| Transport     | Roller          | Ship    |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager | Lawyer  |
| Music-Genre   | R&B             | Pop     |

Lv6-4x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information into the table step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person whose hobby is fishing is on the left of the fan of pop.
2. The person eating onion is not the person whose hobby is puzzles.
3. The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies.

### Table Setup:

|               |    1    |     2      |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |         |            |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The person whose hobby is fishing is on the left of the fan of pop.
This means the person with the hobby ""fishing"" must be in position 1, and the person who listens to ""pop"" must be in position 2.

So we can fill in:
- **Hobby 1**: Fishing
- **Music-Genre 2**: Pop

|               |    1    |     2      |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         | Fishing |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |         | Pop        |

#### Clue 2: The person eating onion is not the person whose hobby is puzzles.
This means the person eating onion cannot be the same as the person whose hobby is puzzles. Since we already know the hobby for position 1 (fishing), the person with the hobby puzzles must be in position 2.

So we can fill in:
- **Hobby 2**: Puzzles

|               |    1    |     2      |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         | Fishing | Puzzles    |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |         | Pop        |

Since the person eating onion is not the person whose hobby is puzzles, the person eating onion must be the one with the hobby puzzles. This means the person eating onion must be in position 2, and the person whose hobby is puzzles must be in position 1.

So we need to reassign:
- **Food 1**: Onion
- **Hobby 1**: Puzzles

|               |    1    |     2      |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Food          | Onion   |            |
| Hobby         | Puzzles | Fishing    |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |         | Pop        |

#### Clue 3: The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies.
This means the person who listens to hip-hop must be in position 1, and the person who watches epic movies must be in position 2.

So we can fill in:
- **Music-Genre 1**: Hip-hop
- **Movie-Genre 2**: Epic

|               |    1    |     2      |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Food          | Onion   |            |
| Hobby         | Puzzles | Fishing    |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Epic       |
| Music-Genre   | Hip-hop | Pop        |

### Final Solution:

```
|               |    1    |     2      |

Lv6-4x2-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating corn is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 2**: The person whose hobby is board-games is not the person eating artichoke.
3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person eating artichoke.
4. **Clue 4**: The person whose sport is soccer is on the right of the person drinking water.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Apply Clue 1
Since the person eating corn is either on the far left or far right, we can place ""corn"" in either position 1 or position 2.

#### Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The person with the hobby of board-games cannot be the one eating artichoke. This means if the person eating artichoke is in position 1, the person with the hobby of board-games must be in position 2, and vice versa.

#### Step 3: Apply Clue 3
The person drinking coffee must be to the right of the person eating artichoke. This means if the person eating artichoke is in position 1, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2, and vice versa.

#### Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The person playing soccer must be to the right of the person drinking water. This means if the person drinking water is in position 1, the person playing soccer must be in position 2, and vice versa.

### Combining Clues:

Let's start by placing corn in position 1 (we'll test both positions later):

1. Corn (position 1)
2. _______

From Clue 2, the person with the hobby of board-games cannot be the one eating artichoke, so the person eating artichoke must be in position 2.

1. Corn
2. Artichoke

Now, from Clue 3, the person drinking coffee must be to the right of the person eating artichoke, which means the person drinking coffee is in position 2. However, since we already have artichoke in position 2, this placement conflicts. Therefore, corn must be in position 2.

1. _______
2. Corn

Now, let's try placing corn in position 2:

1. _______
2. Corn

From Clue 2, the person with the hobby of board-games cannot be the one eating artichoke, so the person eating artichoke must be in position 1.

1. Artichoke
2. Corn

From Clue 3, the person drinking coffee must be to the right of the person eating artichoke, which means the person drinking coffee is in position 2. Since corn is already in position 2, this means the person drinking coffee must be in position 1.

1. Coffee
2. Corn

From Clue 4, the person playing soccer must be to the right of the person drinking water. We need to determine the positions for the remaining items: board-games and writing, and soccer and tennis.

Since coffee is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 2 (because soccer must be to the right of the person drinking water).

1. Coffee
2. Water

Now, the only remaining options are:
- Board-games and writing for hobbies
- Soccer and tennis for sports

Since the person with the hobby of board-games cannot be the one eating artichoke (Clue 2), and the person drinking coffee (position 1) has no specific hobby restriction, we can place board-games in position 1 and writing in position 2.

1. Coffee (Beverage: Coffee, Hobby: Board-games, Sport: Not specified yet)
2. Water (Beverage: Water, Hobby: Writing, Sport: Not specified yet)

Finally, since soccer must be to the right of the person drinking water, the person playing soccer must be in position 2 and the person playing tennis must be in position 1.

1. Coffee (Beverage: Coffee, Hobby: Board-games, Sport: Tennis)
2. Water (Beverage: Water, Hobby: Writing, Sport: Soccer)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage   | Coffee    | Water       |

Lv6-4x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize the information and constraints provided into a structured format. Let's break down the given information and apply the constraints step-by-step.

### Given Information:
- **Food**: Lemon, Pomegranate
- **Hobby**: Magic-Tricks, Rock-Climbing
- **Job**: Project-Manager, Security-Guard
- **Transport**: Scooter, Train

### Constraints:
1. The person driving the train is not the project-manager.
2. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person eating pomegranate.
3. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Set up the initial grid
We will create a 4x2 grid to represent the combinations of the four categories (Food, Hobby, Job, Transport).

|             |        1        |       2        |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Food        |                 |                |
| Hobby       |                 |                |
| Job         |                 |                |
| Transport   |                 |                |

#### Step 2: Apply Constraint 1
- The person driving the train is not the project-manager.

This means:
- If someone is driving the train (Transport 1), they cannot be a project-manager (Job 1).
- If someone is driving the train (Transport 2), they cannot be a project-manager (Job 2).

#### Step 3: Apply Constraint 2
- The person driving the scooter (Transport 1) is somewhere to the left of the person eating pomegranate (Food 2).

This means:
- The person eating pomegranate must be in position 2 (right side).

#### Step 4: Apply Constraint 3
- The person with rock-climbing (Hobby 2) is somewhere to the right of the person with magic-tricks (Hobby 1).

This means:
- The person with magic-tricks must be in position 1 (left side).

### Final Grid Based on Constraints:

Let's place the elements based on the constraints:

1. **Person 1**:
   - Since the person with rock-climbing (Hobby 2) is to the right of the person with magic-tricks (Hobby 1), and Person 1 must have magic-tricks, Person 2 must have rock-climbing.
   - Person 1 can't be the project-manager (Job 1) because the train driver (Transport 1) can't be the project-manager. So, Person 1 must be the security-guard (Job 2).
   - Person 1 eats lemon (since the scooter driver is to the left of the pomegranate eater, and Person 2 must eat pomegranate).

2. **Person 2**:
   - Has rock-climbing (Hobby 2).
   - Can't be the security-guard (Job 2) because Person 1 is already the security-guard.
   - Must be the project-manager (Job 1) because the train driver can't be the project-manager.
   - Eats pomegranate (since Person 1 eats lemon and the scooter driver is to the left of the pomegranate eater).

Thus, the final solution is:

|             |        1        |       2        |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Food        | Lemon           | Pomegranate    |
| Hobby       | Magic-Tricks    | Rock-Climbing  |
| Job         | Security-Guard  | Project-Manager|
| Transport   | Scooter         | Train          |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |        1        |       2        |
