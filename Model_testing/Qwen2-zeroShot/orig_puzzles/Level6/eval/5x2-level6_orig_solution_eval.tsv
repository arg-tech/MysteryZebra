Lv6-5x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through each clue step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis

1. **The nurse is the person driving the bike.**
   - Nurse = Bike

2. **The person drinking soy-milk is not the Chinese.**
   - If the person drinking soy-milk is not the Chinese, then the person drinking soy-milk must be Pakistani.

3. **The nurse is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.**
   - Nurse (Bike) can be next to Skydiver.

4. **The photographer is on the right of the Chinese.**
   - Chinese = Photographer (right side)

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Determine the positions based on the photographer and Chinese:**
   - Since the photographer is on the right of the Chinese, we can set up the positions as follows:
     ```
     |               |    1     |      2       |
     | Beverage      |          |              |
     | Hobby         |          |              |
     | Job           |          |              |
     | Nationality   | Chinese  | Photographer |
     | Transport     |          |              |
     ```

2. **Assign the nurse and bike:**
   - The nurse drives the bike, so:
     ```
     |               |    1     |      2       |
     | Beverage      |          |              |
     | Hobby         |          |              |
     | Job           | Nurse    |              |
     | Nationality   | Chinese  | Photographer |
     | Transport     | Bike    |              |
     ```

3. **Assign the hobbies:**
   - The nurse is on the left or right of the skydiver. Since the nurse is in position 1, the skydiver must be in position 2.
     - If the skydiver is in position 2, and the nurse is in position 1, the remaining hobbies are puzzles and skydiving.
     - Since the nurse is in position 1, the skydiver must be in position 2.
     - Therefore, the nurse has the job of photographer (since the photographer is on the right of the Chinese), and the skydiver has the job of nurse.
     - So, the nurse (job) in position 2 must be the skydiver.
     - The remaining job for position 1 is the photographer.
     - The remaining hobby for position 1 is skydiving, and the remaining hobby for position 2 is puzzles.
     ```
     |               |    1     |      2       |
     | Beverage      |          |              |

     | Job           | Photographer| Nurse       |
     | Nationality   | Chinese  | Photographer |
     | Transport     | Bike    |              |
     ```

4. **Assign the beverages:**
   - The person drinking soy-milk is not the Chinese, so it must be the photographer.
   - The person drinking lemonade is the Chinese.
     ```
     |               |    1     |      2       |
     | Beverage      | Lemonade | Soy-milk     |

     | Job           | Photographer| Nurse       |
     | Nationality   | Chinese  | Photographer |
     | Transport     | Bike    |              |
     ```

5. **Assign the transport:**
   - The nurse is driving the bike, so the photographer must be using the van.
     ```
     |               |    1     |      2       |
     | Beverage      | Lemonade | Soy-milk     |

Lv6-5x2-2	"Let's break down the puzzle and solve it step by step.

### Given Information:
1. The people have 2 different hobbies: camping, skydiving.
2. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: jazz, soul.
3. 2 different pets are kept: fish, mouse.
4. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: biathlon, ice-hockey.
5. The people use 2 different means of transport: bike, motorbike.
6. The fan of soul is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike.
7. The owner of the fish is not the person who's sport is biathlon.
8. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine Hobbies and Sports
- Hobbies: Camping (C) and Skydiving (S)
- Sports: Biathlon (B) and Ice-Hockey (I)

Since the person who does biathlon is on the right of the person who does skydiving, we can place them as follows:
- Skydiving (S) must be in position 1 or 2, and Biathlon (B) must be in position 2 or 3 (but since there are only two positions, B must be in position 2).

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Hobby         |    S       |    B     |
| Music-Genre   |            |          |
| Pet           |            |          |
| Sport         |            |          |
| Transport     | motor      |          |
```

#### Step 2: Determine Music Genres
- Music Genres: Jazz (J) and Soul (Soul)

Given that the fan of soul is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike, and the person driving the bike is in position 2, the fan of soul must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Hobby         |    S       |    B     |
| Music-Genre   |   Soul     |    J     |
| Pet           |            |          |
| Sport         |            |          |
| Transport     | motor      |          |
```

#### Step 3: Determine Pets
- Pets: Fish (F) and Mouse (M)

We know that the owner of the fish is not the person who does biathlon. Since the person doing biathlon is in position 2, the owner of the fish cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the owner of the fish must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Hobby         |    S       |    B     |
| Music-Genre   |   Soul     |    J     |
| Pet           |    F       |    M     |
| Sport         |            |          |
| Transport     | motor      |          |
```

#### Step 4: Determine Sports
- Sports: Biathlon (B) and Ice-Hockey (I)

Since the person who does biathlon is in position 2, the person who does ice-hockey must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Hobby         |    S       |    B     |
| Music-Genre   |   Soul     |    J     |
| Pet           |    F       |    M     |
| Sport         |   I        |    B     |
| Transport     | motor      |          |
```

#### Step 5: Determine Transport
- Transport: Bike (Bike) and Motorbike (Motorbike)

Since the person driving the bike is in position 2, the transport for the person in position 1 must be motor.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Hobby         |    S       |    B     |
| Music-Genre   |   Soul     |    J     |
| Pet           |    F       |    M     |
| Sport         |   I        |    B     |
| Transport     | motor      |  Motorbike  |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |

Lv6-5x2-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The owner of the rat is the fan of rock.**
2. **The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.**
3. **The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat.**
4. **The Nigerian is not the person who's sport is rowing.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Owner of the Rat and Fan of Rock:**
   - Let's denote the owner of the rat as R.
   - The fan of rock is R.

2. **Person with Tennis to the Right of Person with Baking:**
   - If B is the person with the hobby of baking, then T (person with tennis) must be to the right of B.

3. **Fan of Dubstep to the Left of Owner of the Rat:**
   - D (fan of dubstep) must be to the left of R (owner of the rat).

4. **Nigerian Not Rowing:**
   - N (Nigerian) cannot be associated with the sport of rowing (R).

### Arranging the Clues:

Let's start by placing the owner of the rat (R) and the fan of rock (R). Since the fan of dubstep (D) must be to the left of R, we can place them in the first two positions. 

We also know that the person with tennis (T) must be to the right of the person with baking (B), so let's try placing B and T accordingly.

Given these constraints, we can try the following arrangement:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |
| Hobby         |     B     |    T     |
| Music-Genre   |     D     |    R     |
| Nationality   |     N     |    A     |
| Pet           |     H     |    R     |
| Sport         |     R     |    T     |
```

Where:
- B = Baking
- T = Tennis
- D = Dubstep
- R = Rock
- N = Nigerian
- A = Argentine
- H = Hedgehog
- R = Rat

### Verification:

1. **Owner of the Rat (R) is the fan of Rock (R):** Correct.
2. **Person with Tennis (T) is to the right of the person with Baking (B):** Correct.
3. **Fan of Dubstep (D) is to the left of the owner of the Rat (R):** Correct.
4. **The Nigerian (N) is not the person who's sport is rowing (R):** Correct (N is Argentine, and T is Tennis).

### Final Solution Table:

Lv6-5x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and place them in the table step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.
2. The entrepreneur is on the far right.
3. The Argentine is not the firefighter.
4. The person watching animation movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Entrepreneur is on the far right:
- This means the entrepreneur is in position 2 for both columns.

|               |      1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Food          |            |              |
| Hobby         |            |              |
| Job           |            | entrepreneur |
| Movie-Genre   |            |              |
| Nationality   |            |              |

#### 2. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games:
- This means if someone is eating carrots, they must be in a position to the left of someone whose hobby is card-games.

#### 3. The Argentine is not the firefighter:
- This means the Argentine cannot be in the same position as the firefighter.

#### 4. The person watching animation movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games:
- This means if someone is watching animation movies, they must be in a position to the left of someone whose hobby is card-games.

### Let's assign the remaining details based on the clues:

#### From clue 1 (carrot and card-games):
- If the person eating carrots is to the left of the person with card-games, we can tentatively place one of them. Let's start by assuming the person eating carrots is in position 1 for at least one column.

|               |      1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Food          | carrot     |              |
| Hobby         |            |              |
| Job           |            | entrepreneur |
| Movie-Genre   |            |              |
| Nationality   |            |              |

Now, the person with card-games must be in position 2 for at least one column.

#### From clue 4 (animation and card-games):
- The person watching animation movies must be to the left of the person with card-games. Given the above placement, the person watching animation movies must be in position 1 for at least one column.

|               |      1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Food          | carrot     |              |
| Hobby         |            |              |
| Job           |            | entrepreneur |
| Movie-Genre   | animation  |              |
| Nationality   |            |              |

Now, the person with card-games must be in position 2 for at least one column.

#### From clue 3 (Argentine and firefighter):
- The Argentine cannot be the firefighter. Since the entrepreneur is already placed in position 2, the firefighter must be in position 1 for at least one column, and the Argentine must be in position 2 for at least one column.

|               |      1      |      2       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Food          | carrot     |              |
| Hobby         |            |              |
| Job           | firefighter | entrepreneur |
| Movie-Genre   | animation  |              |
| Nationality   | argentine  |              |

Now, the Argentine must be in position 2 for the nationality column.

#### Final Assignment:
- We need to assign the remaining details: grapes, skydiving, Indonesian, and satire.

Given the constraints:
- The person eating grapes must be in position 1 for the food column.
- The person with skydiving must be in position 1 for the hobby column.
- The person watching satire movies must be in position 2 for the movie-genre column.
- The Indonesian must be in position 1 for the nationality column.

| Transport     |            |             |
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: The person whose hobby is woodworking is not the fan of electronic music.
This means the person with woodworking as a hobby cannot be the fan of electronic music.

#### Clue 2: The fan of electronic music is either to the left or right of the person drinking Fanta.
This means the fan of electronic music must be in position 1 or 2, and the person drinking Fanta must be in the opposite position.

#### Clue 3: The person drinking Fanta is not the person eating plum.
This means the person drinking Fanta cannot eat plum.

#### Clue 4: The person whose hobby is chess is to the left of the person driving the train.
This means the person with chess as a hobby must be in position 1, and the person driving the train must be in position 2.

### Applying Clues:

1. **Hobby = Chess (1) and Transport = Train (2)**:
   - From Clue 4, the person with chess as a hobby is in position 1, and the person driving the train is in position 2.
   
2. **Music-Genre**:
   - Since the person with woodworking as a hobby is not the fan of electronic music (Clue 1), the person with woodworking cannot be in position 2 if the fan of electronic music is there (Clue 2).
   - Therefore, the fan of electronic music must be in position 1, and the person with woodworking must be in position 2.
   
3. **Beverage and Food**:
   - From Clue 2, the person drinking Fanta must be in position 2 because the fan of electronic music is in position 1.
   - From Clue 3, the person drinking Fanta cannot eat plum. So, the person eating plum must be in position 1.
   
4. **Filling in the remaining options**:
   - Since the person with woodworking is in position 2, the person with chess must be in position 1.
   - The person drinking Fanta is in position 2, and the person eating plum is in position 1.
   - The remaining options for music genres and foods can be filled accordingly.

### Final Solution Table:

Let's start with the most restrictive constraints first.

**Constraint 2 and Constraint 3:**
- From Constraint 2: (D, L).
- From Constraint 3: A is not D, so A must be Sp.

This gives us:
- D -> L
- A -> Sp

**Constraint 1:**
- Since D is next to L, and we already have A and Sp, we need to place S and G.
- The only positions left for S and G are the first and second columns, but S cannot be next to G due to Constraint 1.
- Therefore, S must be on the left and G must be on the right or vice versa.

Since S is not next to D (from Constraint 2), S must be on the left, and G must be on the right.

So, we have:
- S -> 1st column
- G -> 2nd column

**Constraint 4:**
- H must be to the left of Sc.
- The only remaining options are 1st and 2nd columns for H and Sc.

Since S is in the 1st column, H must be in the 1st column, and Sc must be in the 2nd column.

So, we have:
- H -> 1st column
- Sc -> 2nd column

```

This arrangement satisfies all the given constraints."	{'beverage': ['sprite', 'almond milk'], 'food': ['lettuce', 'spinach'], 'hobby': ['gardening', 'traveling'], 'movie-genre': ['horror', 'scientific'], 'music-genre': ['d&b', 'soul']}	True	5	False
Lv6-5x2-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is photography is not the person who's sport is basketball.
2. The fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting.
3. The person who's hobby is collecting is not the person watching adventure movies.
4. The person watching adventure movies is the owner of the ferret.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4: The person watching adventure movies is the owner of the ferret.
- Let's denote the person watching adventure movies as A and the owner of the ferret as F. Therefore, A = F.

#### Clue 3: The person who's hobby is collecting is not the person watching adventure movies.
- Since A (adventure movies) = F (ferret), the person with the hobby of collecting cannot be A or F.

#### Clue 1: The person who's hobby is photography is not the person who's sport is basketball.
- Let's denote the person with the hobby of photography as P and the person with the sport of basketball as B. Therefore, P ≠ B.

#### Clue 2: The fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting.
- This means if the person who likes house music is in column 1, then the person with the hobby of collecting must be in column 2.

### Initial Setup:
|               |      1       |     2      |
| Hobby         | Collecting   | Photography |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure    | Thriller   |
| Music-Genre   | House        | Salsa      |
| Pet           | Ferret       | Snake      |
| Sport         | Basketball   | Snowboarding |

Let's test this setup against the clues:

1. **Clue 4**: The person watching adventure movies is the owner of the ferret.
   - This means the person in column 1 (adventure movies) owns the ferret. So, A (adventure movies) = F (ferret).

2. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is collecting is not the person watching adventure movies.
   - Since A (adventure movies) = F (ferret), the person with the hobby of collecting cannot be A or F.

3. **Clue 2**: The fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting.
   - If the person who likes house music is in column 1, then the person with the hobby of collecting must be in column 2.

Given these constraints, let's assign values:

- The person with the hobby of collecting must be in column 2 because the person who likes house music is in column 1.
- The person with the hobby of photography is in column 1.
- The person watching adventure movies is in column 1 and owns the ferret.

So, we can update our table:

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Hobby         | Photography  | Collecting  |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure    | Thriller   |
| Music-Genre   | House        | Salsa      |
| Pet           | Ferret       | Snake      |
| Sport         | Basketball   | Snowboarding|

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |      1       |     2      |
| Hobby         | Photography  | Collecting  |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure    | Thriller   |
| Music-Genre   | House        | Salsa      |

Lv6-5x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, we need to organize the given information into a table and deduce the correct placements for each category. Let's start by setting up the table:

```
|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |            |             |
| Job           |            |             |
| Nationality   |            |             |
| Sport         |            |             |
| Transport     |            |             |
```

Now let's analyze the clues one by one:

1. **The person drinking sprite is not the person driving the train.**
2. **The Spanish is somewhere to the left of the coach.**
3. **The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.**

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

**Clue 1:** The person drinking sprite is not the person driving the train.
- This means if someone is drinking sprite, they cannot be driving the train.

**Clue 2:** The Spanish is somewhere to the left of the coach.
- This means the Spanish person must be in position 1, and the coach must be in position 2.

**Clue 3:** The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
- This means if someone is drinking almond-milk, that person must be to the right of the person whose sport is water-polo.

Given these constraints, let's place the Spanish and coach first based on Clue 2:

```
|               | Spanish  | Coach    |
| Beverage      |          |          |
| Job           |          |          |
| Nationality   | Dutch    | Spanish  |
| Sport         |          |          |
| Transport     |          |          |
```

Since the Spanish is in position 1 and the coach is in position 2, we can now use Clue 3 to place the sport and beverage:

- If the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo, the only way this can happen is if the person with water-polo is in position 1 and the person with almond-milk is in position 2.

Let's assume:
- Position 1 (Spanish) has water-polo.
- Position 2 (Coach) has almond-milk.

Now, using Clue 1, since the person drinking sprite cannot be the one driving the train, and the Spanish is already in position 1, the coach (in position 2) must be driving the train. Therefore, the person drinking sprite must be in position 1 and must be using a different means of transport.

Since the Spanish is in position 1 and the coach is in position 2, we can now fill in the rest of the table:

```
|               | Spanish  | Coach    |
| Beverage      | Sprite   | Almond-milk|
| Job           |          |          |
| Nationality   | Dutch    | Spanish  |
| Sport         | Water-polo| Soccer   |
| Transport     | Snowmobile| Train    |
```

Finally, we need to determine the job and nationality for each person. Since we have no additional clues about these categories, we can assign them in any order as long as they fit the constraints. For simplicity, let's assign them as follows:

```
|               | Spanish  | Coach    |
| Beverage      | Sprite   | Almond-milk|
| Job           | Writer   | Coach    |
| Nationality   | Dutch    | Spanish  |
| Sport         | Water-polo| Soccer   |
| Transport     | Snowmobile| Train    |
```

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               | Spanish  | Coach    |
| Beverage      | Sprite   | Almond-milk|
| Job           | Writer   | Coach    |
| Nationality   | Dutch    | Spanish  |
| Sport         | Water-polo| Soccer   |
| Transport     | Snowmobile| Train    |

Lv6-5x2-9	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person whose sport is volleyball.
2. The Thai is not the person whose hobby is camping.
3. The person whose hobby is gardening is on the left of the freelancer.

### Table Setup:
|               |     1      |     2      |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Hobby         |            |            |
| Job           |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |
| Sport         |            |            |
| Transport     |            |            |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The person driving the bus is on the right of the person whose sport is volleyball.
This implies that if someone is driving the bus (Transport = bus), then the person whose sport is volleyball must be to their left (position 1).

#### Clue 2: The Thai is not the person whose hobby is camping.
This means the Thai can either have gardening as a hobby or have no specific hobby listed here (which we will deduce later).

#### Clue 3: The person whose hobby is gardening is on the left of the freelancer.
This means if someone has gardening as a hobby (Hobby = gardening), then they must be to the left of the freelancer (Job = freelancer).

### Deduction Process:

1. **Sport and Transport:**
   - Since the person driving the bus is on the right of the person whose sport is volleyball, let's denote this relationship.
   - Let's assume the person in position 1 is the one whose sport is volleyball, and the person in position 2 is the one driving the bus.

2. **Nationality:**
   - The Thai cannot have camping as a hobby. So, the Thai could have gardening as a hobby or no specific hobby mentioned.

3. **Hobby and Job:**
   - The person with gardening as a hobby is on the left of the freelancer.
   - This means the person in position 1 has gardening as a hobby, and the person in position 2 is the freelancer.

4. **Combining Clues:**
   - If the Thai is not camping, and the person with gardening as a hobby is on the left of the freelancer, we need to place the Thai somewhere else.

### Possible Placement:
- Position 1: Gardening (since it must be on the left of the freelancer)
- Position 2: Freelancer
- Position 1 (right of the person with gardening): Volleyball (since the person driving the bus is on the right of the person with volleyball, and the person with volleyball is in position 1)

Given these placements, let's assign the remaining attributes:

- Position 1: Gardening, Thai (since Thai cannot be camping and must be somewhere)
- Position 2: Freelancer, Thai (since Thai cannot be camping and must be somewhere)

### Final Table:

|               |     1      |     2      |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Hobby         | Gardening  | Freelancer |
| Job           | Thai       | Thai       |
| Nationality   |            |            |
| Sport         | Volleyball |            |
| Transport     |            | Bus        |

Since we have not yet assigned the nationality and the sport for position 2, we can infer the remaining details based on the given constraints. The Thai cannot have camping as a hobby, so the remaining nationality and sport can be deduced.

### Final Solution:

Lv6-5x2-10	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person whose hobby is card-games is on the far left (position 1).
2. The person driving the car is not the owner of the fish.
3. The American is in an even position (position 2).
4. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Card-Games Hobbist:**
   - The person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 1.

2. **American Position:**
   - The American is in position 2.

3. **Car Owner:**
   - The person driving the car cannot be the owner of the fish.
   - Since the American is in position 2, we need to consider if they drive the car or own the fish.
   - If the American owns the fish, then the car owner cannot be the American.
   - Let's assume the American does not own the fish, so the car owner could be either position 1 or 2. But since the person in position 1 has card-games, the car owner must be in position 2 (the American).

4. **Fish Owner:**
   - The fish owner cannot be the car owner, which is the American.
   - Therefore, the fish owner must be in position 1, and the person in position 1 cannot be the American.
   - This implies that the person in position 1 (card-games) is not the American.

5. **Carrot Eater:**
   - The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish.
   - The owner of the fish is in position 1, so the person eating carrot must be in position 2 or 3 (since the American is in position 2 and can't eat carrot as they own the fish).

Given these deductions, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |       2       |
