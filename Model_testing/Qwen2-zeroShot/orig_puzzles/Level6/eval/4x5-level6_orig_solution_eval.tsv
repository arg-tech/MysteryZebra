### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify fixed positions
- From clue 6, the chef is the person watching scientific movies.
- From clue 9, the lawyer is the person watching action movies.
- From clue 18, the person watching satire movies is the person whose hobby is video-games.

#### Step 2: Determine positions for hobbies and jobs
- From clue 1, the hobby ""reading"" must be on the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
- From clue 4, the hobby ""collecting"" must be on the left of the person driving the tram.
- From clue 5, the person driving the tram is not the scientist.
- From clue 10, the person whose hobby is collecting is not the person watching time-travel movies.
- From clue 12, the person whose hobby is video-games is to the left of the person whose hobby is cooking.
- From clue 16, the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person whose hobby is collecting.

#### Step 3: Positioning based on clues
- Let's assume the person driving the quad-bike is 2 (since it needs to be either left or right of the person with hobby ""reading"").
- Assume the person driving the tram is 4 (since it needs to be to the right of the person with hobby ""collecting"").

#### Step 4: Final positioning
- The chef (watching scientific movies) cannot be 1, 2, or 4 (as they are taken by the hobby ""reading"", ""collecting"", or ""video-games"").
- Therefore, the chef must be 3.
- The lawyer (watching action movies) cannot be 1, 2, or 3 (as they are taken by the hobby ""reading"", ""collecting"", or ""video-games"").
- Therefore, the lawyer must be 5.

#### Step 5: Finalizing the positions
- The person with hobby ""reading"" must be 1 (left of the person driving the quad-bike).
- The person with hobby ""collecting"" must be 2 (left of the person driving the tram).
- The person with hobby ""video-games"" must be 3 (left of the person with hobby ""cooking"").
- The person with hobby ""singing"" must be 4 (right of the pilot).
- The person with hobby ""cooking"" must be 5 (right of the person with hobby ""video-games"").

19. **Clue 19**: The Colombian is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Positioning the Helicopter Driver
From Clue 11, the person driving the helicopter is in an even position. Therefore, the helicopter driver can be in positions 2 or 4.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Sprite Drinker
From Clue 10, the person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right. Let's assume they are in position 1 (since position 5 would make it difficult to fit other constraints).

#### Step 3: Positioning the Asparagus Eater
From Clue 4, the person eating asparagus is to the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter driver is in position 2 or 4, the asparagus eater must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

#### Step 4: Positioning the Cauliflower Eater
From Clue 3, the person eating cauliflower is the Colombian. From Clue 1, the cauliflower eater is to the right of the helicopter driver. If the helicopter driver is in position 2, the cauliflower eater must be in position 3, 4, or 5. If the helicopter driver is in position 4, the cauliflower eater must be in position 5.

#### Step 5: Positioning the Mango Eater
From Clue 5, the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person eating mango. From Clue 7, the person eating mango is not the Colombian. The mango eater cannot be in position 1 or 2 because the Colombian is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (Clue 19). The mango eater could be in position 3, 4, or 5.

#### Step 6: Positioning the Egyptian
From Clue 6, the Egyptian is on the right of the Brazilian. The Egyptian cannot be in position 1 or 2 because the person drinking sprite is there (Clue 10). The Egyptian could be in position 3, 4, or 5.

#### Step 7: Positioning the Cabbage Eater
From Clue 16, the person eating cabbage is the Egyptian. Therefore, the Egyptian is in position 3, 4, or 5.

#### Step 8: Positioning the Tea Drinker
From Clue 8, the person drinking tea is on the left of the person eating asparagus. If the asparagus eater is in position 3, the tea drinker must be in position 1 or 2. If the asparagus eater is in position 4 or 5, the tea drinker must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

#### Step 9: Positioning the Almond-Milk Drinker
From Clue 18, the person drinking almond-milk is in an even position. Therefore, the almond-milk drinker can be in position 2 or 4.

#### Step 10: Positioning the Milk Drinker
From Clue 9, the Pakistani is between the person eating cauliflower and the person drinking milk. The cauliflower eater is the Colombian, so the Pakistani must be between the Colombian and the milk drinker.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the person who drinks water.
- From clue 7, the person who's hobby is reading is the person drinking water.
- From clue 1, the person drinking water is not the person who's hobby is traveling.
- From clue 3, the person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.
- From clue 4, the person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.
- From clue 5, the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up.
- From clue 12, the person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.
- From clue 16, the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking 7up.

Let's assume the person who drinks water is in position 1 (since it fits all the above constraints).

**Position 1: Water, Reading**

#### Step 2: Determine the person who drinks 7up.
- From clue 16, the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
- From clue 12, the person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.
- Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the person drinking cola must be in position 3 or 4 (to satisfy both clues 12 and 16).

Let's assume the person drinking 7up is in position 2.

**Position 2: 7up**

#### Step 3: Determine the person who drinks cola.
- From clue 16, the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
- If the person drinking 7up is in position 2, the person drinking cola must be in position 3 or 4.

Let's assume the person drinking cola is in position 3.

**Position 3: Cola**

#### Step 4: Determine the person who drinks milk.
- From clue 8, the person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
- From clue 9, the person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
- From clue 17, the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball.
- From clue 18, the person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

Let's assume the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 1, but since the person drinking water is in position 1, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 4 or 5.

Let's assume the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 4.

**Position 4: Weightlifting**

#### Step 5: Determine the person who drinks tea.
- From clue 2, the person drinking tea is on the left of the person eating pear.
- From clue 10, the person eating pineapple is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).

Let's assume the person eating pineapple is in position 5.

**Position 5: Pineapple**

Since the person eating pineapple is in position 5, the person eating pear must be in position 3 or 4. But position 4 is already occupied by the person who's sport is weightlifting, so the person eating pear must be in position 3.

**Position 3: Pear**

#### Step 6: Determine the person who drinks tea.
- From clue 2, the person drinking tea is on the left of the person eating pear.
- The person eating pear is in position 3, so the person drinking tea must be in position 2.

**Position 2: Tea**

#### Step 7: Determine the remaining positions.
- The person who's hobby is reading is in position 1.
- The person who's hobby is traveling is in position 4 (since the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up).
- The person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 2 (since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is tennis).
- The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 5 (since the person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing).
- The person who's sport is basketball is in position 3 (since the person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing).
