Lv6-2x2-1	"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We have two columns (1 and 2) and two rows (Food and Sport). We need to place ""Nectarine"" and ""Pear"" under ""Food"" and ""Soccer"" and ""Volleyball"" under ""Sport"". Here are the clues:

1. The person who's sport is soccer is on the far left.
2. The person who's sport is volleyball is not the person eating pear.

From clue 1, we know that the sport ""Soccer"" must be in column 1. Therefore, the sport ""Volleyball"" must be in column 2.

From clue 2, if the person eating pear is not the one playing volleyball, then the person eating pear must be playing soccer. This means the person playing volleyball cannot be eating pear. Since the person playing soccer is in column 1 and eating pear, the person playing volleyball must be eating nectarine.

So, the final arrangement should be:

- Column 1: Soccer (playing)
- Column 2: Volleyball (playing)
- Row 1 (Food): Nectarine (eating)
- Row 2 (Food): Pear (eating)

Let's put it into the table format:

```
|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    | Nectarine | Pear       |
| Sport   | Soccer    | Volleyball |

3. The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
4. The owner of the goat is not the person eating lemon.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions for the pets:**
   - The owner of the goat must be on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - This means the goat owner is in position 1 and the guinea-pig owner is in position 2.

2. **Assign the food based on the given conditions:**
   - The owner of the goat does not eat lemon. Therefore, the owner of the goat must eat apple.
   - Since the goat owner eats apple, the guinea-pig owner must eat lemon.

### Final Table:

```
|        |   1   |     2      |
| Food   | apple | lemon      |
| Pet    | goat  | guinea-pig |

   - We know the person eating pumpkin must be in position 1, and the person eating plum must be in position 2.

2. **Sports Association:**
   - The person playing handball cannot be the one eating plum. Therefore, the person playing handball must be the one eating pumpkin.

3. **Arranging the Sports:**
   - Since the person eating pumpkin plays handball, the person eating plum must play sailing.

### Final Arrangement:
- **Food:**
  - Position 1: Pumpkin
  - Position 2: Plum

- **Sport:**
  - Position 1: Handball (since the person eating pumpkin is playing handball)
  - Position 2: Sailing (since the person eating plum is playing sailing)

### Given Information:
1. The person eating grapefruit is not the owner of the goldfish.
2. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot.

### Possible Combinations:
- Food options: apricot, grapefruit
- Pet options: goldfish, hamster

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Deduction from Statement 2:**
   - The person eating grapefruit is to the right of the person eating apricot. This means if the person eating apricot is in position 1, then the person eating grapefruit must be in position 2.

2. **Deduction from Statement 1:**
   - The person eating grapefruit cannot own the goldfish. So, if the person eating grapefruit is in position 2, that person cannot be the owner of the goldfish.

3. **Combining Both Statements:**
   - If the person eating apricot is in position 1, then the person eating grapefruit must be in position 2.
   - The person in position 2 (eating grapefruit) cannot be the owner of the goldfish, so they must be the owner of the hamster.

4. **Final Arrangement:**
   - Position 1: Eating apricot, owning goldfish
   - Position 2: Eating grapefruit, owning hamster

### Final Solution Table:
```
|        |    1     |     2      |

### Given Information:
1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: musical, superhero.
2. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: golf, lacrosse.
3. The person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is lacrosse.
4. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the genres and sports:**
   - Genres: Musical, Superhero
   - Sports: Golf, Lacrosse

2. **Use the third condition:**
   - The person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is lacrosse.
   - This means if someone is watching superhero movies, they cannot be doing lacrosse.

3. **Use the fourth condition:**
   - The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
   - This means the person watching superhero movies must be in position 2, because there is only one position (position 1) to the left of position 2.

Given these conditions, we can deduce:
- The person in position 2 must be watching superhero movies.
- Therefore, the person in position 1 must be watching musical movies.
- Since the person in position 2 is watching superhero movies, this person cannot be doing lacrosse (from condition 3).
- Thus, the person in position 1 must be doing lacrosse.
- Consequently, the person in position 2 must be doing golf.

Lv6-2x2-6	"Sure, let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.

We have the following information:

1. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: d&b, indie.
2. There are 2 different nationalities: Japanese, Polish.
3. The fan of d&b is on the far right (column 2).
4. The fan of indie is not Japanese.

Let's fill in the table based on these clues:

|               |   1    |    2     |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Music-Genre   |  indie |  d&b     |
| Nationality   |  Polish|  Japanese|

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. From clue 3, we know that the person who likes d&b is in column 2. Therefore, column 2 must be filled with ""d&b"".
2. Since the person who likes d&b is in column 2, the person in column 1 must like indie.
3. From clue 4, the person who likes indie cannot be Japanese. Therefore, the person who likes indie must be Polish.
4. By process of elimination, the person who likes d&b must be Japanese.

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |   1    |    2     |
| Music-Genre   |  indie |  d&b     |

Lv6-2x2-7	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The accountant is in an odd position.
2. The accountant is not the owner of the hamster.

### Initial Table:
```
|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   |            |               |
| Pet   |            |               |
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The accountant must be in position 1 because it is the only odd position available.

So, we can fill in the job for position 1:
```
|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   | Accountant |               |
| Pet   |            |               |
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The accountant is not the owner of the hamster, so the hamster must belong to the person in position 2.

So, we can fill in the pet for position 2:
```
|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   | Accountant |               |
| Pet   |            | Hamster       |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the Remaining Job and Pet
- Since there are only two jobs (accountant and social worker) and one job has already been assigned to position 1, the remaining job (social worker) must be in position 2.

- Similarly, since there are only two pets (goat and hamster) and one pet has already been assigned to position 2, the remaining pet (goat) must be in position 1.

So, we can fill in the remaining details:
```
|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   | Social Worker | Accountant    |
| Pet   | Goat         | Hamster       |
```

### Final Solution:
```
|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   | Social Worker | Accountant    |
| Pet   | Goat         | Hamster       |

Lv6-2x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the given clues and apply them step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person eating kale is somewhere to the left of the person eating potato.
2. The Japanese is not the person eating potato.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating kale is to the left of the person eating potato. This means that if we have two positions (1 and 2), one person eats kale and the other eats potato, the person who eats kale must be in position 1 and the person who eats potato must be in position 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The Japanese is not the person eating potato. Given Clue 1, if the person eating potato is in position 2, then the Japanese cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the Japanese must be in position 1.

Since the Japanese is in position 1, the person in position 1 must be eating kale (because the person eating kale is to the left of the person eating potato).

So, the person in position 2 must be the Mexican, and they must be eating potato.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1     |    2    |
| Food          | Kale     | Potato  |
| Nationality   | Japanese | Mexican |
```

This arrangement satisfies both clues:
- The person eating kale (kale) is to the left of the person eating potato (potato).
- The Japanese is not the person eating potato; instead, they are eating kale.

```
|               |    1     |    2    |
| Food          | Kale     | Potato  |
| Nationality   | Japanese | Mexican |

Lv6-2x2-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the constraints:**
   - There are two music genres: dubstep and techno.
   - There are two modes of transport: train and trike.
   - The person driving the train is not a fan of techno.
   - The person driving the trike is to the right of the person driving the train.

2. **Determine the positions:**
   - Since the person driving the trike is to the right of the person driving the train, we can infer that the person driving the train must be in position 1 and the person driving the trike must be in position 2.

3. **Apply the genre constraint:**
   - The person driving the train (position 1) cannot be a fan of techno.
   - Therefore, the person driving the train (position 1) must be a fan of dubstep.
   - This leaves the person driving the trike (position 2) as a fan of techno.

4. **Assign the transport modes:**
   - Position 1 (train) is occupied by someone who likes dubstep.
   - Position 2 (trike) is occupied by someone who likes techno.

Given these deductions, we can fill in the table:

```
|               |    1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep | techno |
| Transport     | train   | trike  |
