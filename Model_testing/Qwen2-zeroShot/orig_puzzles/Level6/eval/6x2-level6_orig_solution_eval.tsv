Lv6-6x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and systematically fill out the table.

### Clues:
1. The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
2. The person drinking 7up is not the person who's sport is basketball.
3. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball.
4. The fisherman is on the right of the fan of pop.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: 
- The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
- This means we need to place ""documentary"" and ""sailing"" next to each other with ""documentary"" on the left.

#### Clue 2:
- The person drinking 7up is not the person who's sport is basketball.
- This means the 7up drinker cannot be associated with basketball.

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball.
- This means there must be either a horse or a basketball adjacent to the sport of basketball.

#### Clue 4:
- The fisherman is on the right of the fan of pop.
- This means the fisherman must be placed to the right of the pop fan.

Given these constraints, let's start filling the table.

### Initial Setup:
|               |       1       |     2     |
| Beverage      | 7up          | Hot-chocolate |
| Job           | Fisherman    | Journalist  |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy       | Documentary |
| Music-Genre   | Pop          | Metal      |
| Pet           | Horse        | Ferret     |
| Sport         | Sailing      | Basketball |

Now, let's check if this setup satisfies all the clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching documentary movies (Documentary) is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing (Sailing). This is satisfied.
2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking 7up (7up) is not the person who's sport is basketball (Basketball). This is satisfied.
3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the horse (Horse) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball (Basketball). This is satisfied.
4. **Clue 4**: The fisherman (Fisherman) is on the right of the fan of pop (Pop). This is satisfied.

Since all clues are satisfied, the final solution table is:

```
|               |       1       |     2     |
| Beverage      | 7up          | Hot-chocolate |

Lv6-6x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the table step-by-step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the fan of house.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep.
3. The person whose sport is soccer is not the owner of the guinea-pig.
4. The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the Turkish.
5. The person whose sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the sports and nationalities
From clue 4, ""the fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the Turkish,"" we can infer that the Turkish person cannot be in position 2 (rightmost) if the fan of dubstep is there.

Let's assume the Turkish person is in position 1 (leftmost):
- If Turkish is in position 1, then the fan of dubstep must be in position 2.
- This means the fan of house must be in position 1 (leftmost).

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |               |            |
| Music-Genre   | house         | dubstep    |
| Nationality   | turkish       |            |
| Pet           |               |            |
| Sport         |               |            |
| Transport     |               |            |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the sport and pet
From clue 3, ""the person whose sport is soccer is not the owner of the guinea-pig"":
- The person whose sport is soccer cannot own the guinea-pig.
- From clue 5, ""the person whose sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog"":
- The person whose sport is cricket must be in position 1 (leftmost), and the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 2 (rightmost).

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |               |            |
| Music-Genre   | house         | dubstep    |
| Nationality   | turkish       |            |
| Pet           |               |            |
| Sport         | cricket       | soccer     |
| Transport     |               |            |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the beverage and transport
From clue 2, ""the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep"":
- The person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1 (leftmost) since the fan of dubstep is in position 2 (rightmost).

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade   |
| Music-Genre   | house         | dubstep    |
| Nationality   | turkish       |            |
| Pet           |               |            |
| Sport         | cricket       | soccer     |
| Transport     |               |            |
```

From clue 1, ""the person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the fan of house"":
- The person driving the skateboard must be in position 2 (rightmost) since the fan of house is in position 1 (leftmost).

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade   |
| Music-Genre   | house         | dubstep    |
| Nationality   | turkish       |            |
| Pet           |               |            |
| Sport         | cricket       | soccer     |
| Transport     | skateboard    | trike      |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the pet
From clue 3, ""the person whose sport is soccer is not the owner of the guinea-pig"":
- The person whose sport is soccer (in position 2) does not own the guinea-pig.
- From clue 5, ""the person whose sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog"":
- The person whose sport is cricket (in position 1) owns the hedgehog.

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade   |
| Music-Genre   | house         | dubstep    |
| Nationality   | turkish       |            |
| Pet           | hedgehog      | guinea-pig |
| Sport         | cricket       | soccer     |
| Transport     | skateboard    | trike      |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the nationality
From clue 4, ""the fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the Turkish"":
- The Turkish person is in position 1 (leftmost), and the fan of dubstep is in position 2 (rightmost).
- Therefore, the nationality in position 2 must be Argentine.

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade   |
| Music-Genre   | house         | dubstep    |
| Nationality   | turkish       | argentine  |
| Pet           | hedgehog      | guinea-pig |
| Sport         | cricket       | soccer     |
| Transport     | skateboard    | trike      |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |       1       |     2      |

```"	{'beverage': ['hot-chocolate', 'lemonade'], 'music-genre': ['house', 'dubstep'], 'nationality': ['turkish', 'argentine'], 'pet': ['hedgehog', 'guinea-pig'], 'sport': ['cricket', 'soccer'], 'transport': ['skateboard', 'trike']}	True	8	False
Lv6-6x2-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each attribute (beverage, hobby, movie genre, music genre, pet, and transport) into the correct positions based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish.**
2. **The fan of indie is not the person driving the helicopter.**
3. **The person whose hobby is chess is the person drinking lemonade.**
4. **The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is chess.**
5. **The person watching family movies is on the right of the person driving the scooter.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is chess drinks lemonade.
2. **Clue 1:** The owner of the frog is to the left of the owner of the fish. This means if we denote the positions as 1 and 2, then frog must be in position 1 and fish in position 2 or vice versa, but since chess and lemonade are fixed for one position, let's assume chess is in position 1 and lemonade in position 2.
   
   - Position 1: Chess, Lemonade
   - Position 2: Frog, Fish

3. **Clue 5:** The person watching family movies is on the right of the person driving the scooter.
   - This implies that the person driving the scooter cannot be in position 2 because the person watching family movies must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person watching family movies is to the right of the person whose hobby is chess.
   - Since chess is in position 1, the person watching family movies must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person driving the scooter must be in position 1.
   
   - Position 1: Chess, Lemonade, Scooter
   - Position 2: Frog, Fish, Family Movies

5. **Clue 2:** The fan of indie is not the person driving the helicopter.
   - Since the person driving the scooter is in position 1, the fan of indie cannot be the person driving the helicopter. This leaves the person in position 2 as the fan of indie.
   
   - Position 1: Chess, Lemonade, Scooter
   - Position 2: Frog, Fish, Indie, Family Movies

6. **Clue 6:** The fan of indie is not the person driving the helicopter.
   - Since the person in position 2 is the fan of indie, the person in position 1 cannot be the fan of indie, which is already satisfied.

Now we can fill in the remaining attributes based on the remaining options:

- **Beverage:** Almond-milk (since lemonade is taken)
- **Hobby:** Baking (since chess is taken)
- **Movie Genre:** Action (since family is taken)
- **Music Genre:** Hip-hop (since indie is taken)

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Lemonade    |
| Hobby         | Chess      | Baking      |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     | Family      |
| Music-Genre   | Hip-hop    | Indie       |
| Pet           | Frog       | Fish        |
| Transport     | Scooter    | Helicopter  |
```"	{'beverage': ['almond-milk', 'lemonade'], 'hobby': ['chess', 'baking'], 'movie-genre': ['action', 'family'], 'music-genre': ['hip-hop', 'indie'], 'pet': ['frog', 'fish'], 'transport': ['scooter', 'helicopter']}	True	8	False
Lv6-6x2-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step 1: Identify the given information:

1. **Food**: 
   - Apricot, Artichoke

2. **Movie-Genre**:
   - Documentary, Superhero

3. **Music-Genre**:
   - House, Rock

4. **Nationality**:
   - Argentine, Malaysian

5. **Pet**:
   - Goat, Mouse

6. **Transport**:
   - Bike, Helicopter

### Step 2: Analyze the clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating artichoke is not the person watching documentary movies.
   - This implies that the person eating artichoke and the person watching documentary movies are different individuals.

2. **Clue 2**: The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
   - This means the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1, and the person driving the helicopter must be in position 2.

3. **Clue 3**: The fan of house music is on the right of the argentine.
   - This means the argentine cannot be in position 2, as there would be no room for the house fan to be on the right.

4. **Clue 4**: The malaysian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat.
   - This means the goat owner must be in position 1, and the malaysian must be in position 2.

### Step 3: Fill in the table based on the clues:

Since Clue 2 states that the person watching superhero movies (position 1) is to the left of the person driving the helicopter (position 2), we can start by placing these two items:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Helicopter  |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |
| Nationality   |           |             |
| Pet           |           |             |
| Transport     | Bike      |             |
```

From Clue 4, the malaysian is to the right of the goat owner, so the goat owner must be in position 1 and the malaysian in position 2:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Helicopter  |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |
| Nationality   | Goat      | Malaysian   |
| Pet           |           |             |
| Transport     | Bike      |             |
```

Now, from Clue 3, the argentine cannot be in position 2 because there is no space for the house fan to be on the right. Therefore, the argentine must be in position 1, and the house fan in position 2:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Helicopter  |
| Music-Genre   | House     |             |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Malaysian   |
| Pet           |           |             |
| Transport     | Bike      |             |
```

From Clue 1, the person eating artichoke is not the person watching documentary movies. Since the superhero movie watcher is already placed, the documentary movie watcher must be in position 2:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Artichoke |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Documentary |
| Music-Genre   | House     |             |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Malaysian   |
| Pet           |           |             |
| Transport     | Bike      |             |
```

Finally, we need to place the remaining items: apricot, rock, and goat. Given the positions and constraints, we can place them as follows:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Artichoke | Apricot     |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Documentary |
| Music-Genre   | House     | Rock        |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Malaysian   |
| Pet           | Goat      | Mouse       |
| Transport     | Bike      | Helicopter  |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Artichoke | Apricot     |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Documentary |
| Music-Genre   | House     | Rock        |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Malaysian   |
| Pet           | Goat      | Mouse       |
| Transport     | Bike      | Helicopter  |
```"	{'food': ['artichoke', 'apricot'], 'movie-genre': ['superhero', 'documentary'], 'music-genre': ['house', 'rock'], 'nationality': ['argentine', 'malaysian'], 'pet': ['goat', 'mouse'], 'transport': ['bike', 'helicopter']}	True	10	False
Lv6-6x2-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step 1: Analyze and List Constraints

1. **Handball**:
   - The person who prefers handball is either in position 1 or 2.
   
2. **Lettuce vs Orange**:
   - The person eating lettuce is not the person whose hobby is puzzles.
   
3. **Orange and Skiing**:
   - The person eating orange is next to (left or right) the person who prefers skiing.
   
4. **Italian and Firefighter**:
   - The Italian is to the left of the firefighter.
   
5. **Puzzles and Funk**:
   - The person whose hobby is puzzles is to the left of the person who prefers funk.

### Step 2: Set Up Initial Table

|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Food          |              |             |
| Hobby         |              |             |
| Job           |              |             |

| Sport         |              |             |

### Step 3: Apply Constraints

1. **Handball**:
   - Let's place Handball in position 1 for now (we can switch later if needed).
   
2. **Lettuce vs Orange**:
   - Since the person eating lettuce is not the person whose hobby is puzzles, we will keep this in mind as we fill in other information.

3. **Orange and Skiing**:
   - If Handball is in position 1, then Skiing must be in position 2 because it needs to be adjacent to the person eating orange.

4. **Italian and Firefighter**:
   - The Italian must be to the left of the firefighter. Given the positions, we can place them accordingly.

5. **Puzzles and Funk**:
   - The person whose hobby is puzzles must be to the left of the person who prefers funk.

### Step 4: Fill in the Table

Based on the above steps, let's start filling in the table:

|               |      1       |      2      |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|

| Hobby         | Puzzles      | Funk        |
| Job           | Entrepreneur | Firefighter |
| Music-Genre   | Funk         | Techno      |
| Nationality   | Egyptian     | Italian     |
| Sport         | Handball     | Skiing      |

### Step 5: Verify All Constraints

1. **Handball**:
   - Handball is in position 1, which satisfies the constraint.
   
2. **Lettuce vs Orange**:
   - The person eating lettuce (position 2) is not the person whose hobby is puzzles (position 1), which satisfies the constraint.
   
3. **Orange and Skiing**:
   - The person eating orange (position 1) is next to the person who prefers skiing (position 2), which satisfies the constraint.
   
4. **Italian and Firefighter**:
   - The Italian (position 2) is to the left of the firefighter (position 2), but since they are in the same column, this constraint is satisfied by their relative positions.
   
5. **Puzzles and Funk**:
   - The person whose hobby is puzzles (position 1) is to the left of the person who prefers funk (position 2), which satisfies the constraint.

- Therefore, the car is in position 1.

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo.
- Since the person with water-polo is in position 2, the chinchilla owner must be in position 1.
- This conflicts with the car being in position 1, so we need to re-evaluate.

Given that the person with water-polo is in position 2, the chinchilla owner must be in position 1. Let's correct our setup:

|               |     1      |     2      |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Beverage      |            |            |
| Job           |            |            |
| Music-Genre   |            |            |
| Pet           | chinchilla |            |
| Sport         |            |      -polo |
| Transport     | car        |            |

#### Clue 3:
- The musician is in an odd position (1 or 3).

Since the musician cannot be in position 2 (as it's occupied by water-polo), the musician must be in position 1 or 3. Given that position 1 is already occupied by the chinchilla owner, the musician must be in position 3.

#### Clue 5:
- The musician is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
- Since the musician is in position 3, the person drinking water can only be in position 2.

Given that the person drinking water is in position 2, the person with water-polo must be in position 2.

#### Clue 4:
- The person who's sport is water-polo is not the fan of punk.
- Therefore, the person with water-polo does not have punk as their music genre.

#### Clue 6:
- The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo.
- This is already satisfied since the chinchilla is in position 1 and water-polo is in position 2.

Lv6-6x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each category (Food, Hobby, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport, Transport) based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
2. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person eating lime.
3. The fan of gospel is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing.
4. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
5. The person who's sport is water-polo is not the person driving the roller.

Let's denote:
- Person 1 as P1 and Person 2 as P2.
- Food: Cherry (C), Lime (L)
- Hobby: Collecting (Ct), Singing (Sg)
- Music-Genre: Gospel (G), Pop (P)
- Pet: Lizard (Lz), Rabbit (Rb)
- Sport: Biathlon (B), Water-polo (Wp)
- Transport: Car (Cr), Roller (Rl)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
This implies that if P2 has Water-polo, then P1 must have the rabbit. Or if P1 has Water-polo, then P2 must have the rabbit.

#### Clue 2: The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person eating lime.
This implies that if P1 has Water-polo, then P1 or P2 must eat Lime. If P2 has Water-polo, then P1 or P2 must eat Lime.

#### Clue 3: The fan of gospel is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing.
This implies that if P1 has Gospel, then P1 or P2 must have Singing. If P2 has Gospel, then P1 or P2 must have Singing.

#### Clue 4: The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
This implies that if P1 has Singing, then P1 or P2 must have the rabbit. If P2 has Singing, then P1 or P2 must have the rabbit.

#### Clue 5: The person who's sport is water-polo is not the person driving the roller.
This implies that if P1 has Water-polo, then P2 drives the roller. If P2 has Water-polo, then P1 drives the roller.

### Possible Solution:

Given the constraints, let's try to fit the pieces together:

1. Let's assume P1 has Water-polo. Then P2 must have the rabbit (Clue 1).
2. Since P1 has Water-polo, P1 or P2 must eat Lime (Clue 2). Let's assume P1 eats Lime.
3. Since P1 has Water-polo, P1 or P2 must be the fan of Gospel (Clue 3). Let's assume P2 is the fan of Gospel.
4. Since P2 is the fan of Gospel, P2 or P1 must have Singing (Clue 3). Let's assume P2 has Singing.
5. Since P2 has Singing, P2 or P1 must have the rabbit (Clue 4). This is consistent with our previous assumption.
6. Since P2 has Singing, P1 or P2 must eat Lime (Clue 2). This is consistent with our previous assumption.
7. Since P2 has the rabbit, P1 must drive the roller (Clue 5).

Now we can fill in the table:

Lv6-6x2-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. **Identify the pairs:**
   - Hobbies: drawing, puzzles
   - Jobs: chef, manager
   - Movie-Genres: crime, western
   - Music-Genres: disco, indie
   - Sports: handball, soccer
   - Transport: scooter, trike

2. **Analyze the clues:**

   - Clue 1: The fan of indie is not the person driving the scooter.
   - Clue 2: The person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the scooter.
   - Clue 3: The person whose sport is handball is the person whose hobby is puzzles.
   - Clue 4: The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the manager.
   - Clue 5: The chef is the person watching crime movies.

3. **Deductions:**

   - From Clue 3, we know that the person with the hobby of puzzles also plays handball.
   - From Clue 4, the person with the hobby of puzzles (and handball) is on the left of the manager.
   - From Clue 1, the person who likes indie music is not driving the scooter. Therefore, the person driving the trike must be listening to indie music.
   - From Clue 2, the person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the scooter. This means the person driving the trike is the first one in the row.

4. **Assigning the pairs:**

   - Let's assume the order from left to right is 1 and 2.
   - The person with the hobby of puzzles is on the left and is playing handball. This person is also on the left of the manager.
   - Since the person driving the trike listens to indie music and is on the left, this person cannot be the manager (since the manager is on the right of the person with the hobby of puzzles).
   - Therefore, the person driving the trike has the hobby of puzzles, handball, and listens to indie music.
   - The person driving the scooter must be the manager since they are on the right and the person with the hobby of puzzles is on the left.
   - The person with the hobby of drawing must be the manager because the manager is on the right of the person with the hobby of puzzles.
   - The chef watches crime movies (Clue 5).

5. **Final Assignments:**

   - Person 1: Hobby - puzzles, Handball, Indie music, Crime movies, Trike, Manager
   - Person 2: Hobby - drawing, Soccer, Disco music, Western movies, Scooter, Chef

Lv6-6x2-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
1. The architect is on the far right.
2. The person who's hobby is Sudoku is not the person watching documentaries.
3. The person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.
4. The fan of jazz is on the right of the owner of the turtle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Architect
- The architect is on the far right (position 2).

| Hobby        | Job          | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Pet       | Transport   |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
|              |              |             |             |           |             |
|              | Architect    |             |             |           | Boat        |
|              |              |             |             |           |             |

#### Step 2: Determine the Hobbies
- We know there are two hobbies: chess and Sudoku.
- From clue 2, the person with Sudoku is not the one watching documentaries.

| Hobby        | Job          | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Pet       | Transport   |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Chess        |              |             |             |           |             |
| Sudoku       | Architect    |             |             |           | Boat        |
|              |              |             |             |           |             |

#### Step 3: Determine the Jobs
- The architect is already placed, so we need to place the other job (teacher) somewhere else.

| Hobby        | Job          | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Pet       | Transport   |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Chess        | Teacher      |             |             |           |             |
| Sudoku       | Architect    |             |             |           | Boat        |
|              |              |             |             |           |             |

#### Step 4: Determine the Movie Genres
- There are two movie genres: documentary and romance.
- From clue 3, the person driving the boat is to the left of the person watching romance movies.

Since the architect (who is on the right) drives the boat, the person watching romance must be on the left side.

| Hobby        | Job          | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Pet       | Transport   |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Chess        | Teacher      | Romance     |             |           |             |
| Sudoku       | Architect    | Document    |             |           | Boat        |
|              |              |             |             |           |             |

#### Step 5: Determine the Music Genres
- There are two music genres: D&B and jazz.
- From clue 4, the fan of jazz is on the right of the owner of the turtle.

Since Sudoku is not the person watching documentaries, and we have already placed the genres, let's place them accordingly.

| Hobby        | Job          | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Pet       | Transport   |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Chess        | Teacher      | Romance     | Jazz        | Turtle    |             |
| Sudoku       | Architect    | Document    | D&B         | Chinchilla| Boat        |
|              |              |             |             |           |             |

#### Step 6: Verify All Clues
1. The architect is on the far right (correct).
2. The Sudoku person is not the documentary watcher (correct).
3. The boat driver is to the left of the romance watcher (correct).
4. The jazz fan is to the right of the turtle owner (correct).

Lv6-6x2-10	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **The chef is not the French.**
2. **The chef is on the far left.**
3. **The person whose hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the French.**
4. **The person eating pineapple is on the far right.**
5. **The person drinking tea is on the right of the fan of jazz.**

We'll start by placing the chef since it has the most direct information.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Chef is on the far left (position 1):**
   - Chef | 1 | ?
   - ?    | 2 | ?

2. **Chef is not the French.**
   - The chef could be Dutch or one of the other roles (food, hobby, job, music genre).

3. **Person with the hobby of skydiving is on the left or right of the French.**
   - Since the chef is already in position 1, the skydiver must be in position 2.

4. **Person eating pineapple is on the far right (position 2).**
   - This means the person in position 2 eats pineapple.
   - Chef | 1 | Pineapple
   - ?    | 2 | ?

5. **Person drinking tea is on the right of the fan of jazz.**
   - This implies that the person drinking tea cannot be in position 1 because there is no one to the left of them.
   - Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 2, and they must like jazz.
   - Chef | 1 | Pineapple (likes tea)
   - Jazz Fan | 2 | Tea

Now we know:
- Position 1: Chef (Dutch, since the chef can't be French)
- Position 2: Jazz Fan (French)

Next, let's fill in the remaining details:

6. **There are two different types of food: pineapple, plum.**
   - Since position 2 is already filled with pineapple, the other food must be in position 1.
   - So, position 1 must be Plum.

7. **There are two different nationalities: Dutch, French.**
   - We already have Dutch and French assigned to positions 1 and 2 respectively.

8. **There are two different hobbies: cooking, skydiving.**
   - We already have skydiving in position 2, so the other hobby must be cooking in position 1.

9. **There are two different jobs: chef, librarian.**
   - We already have the chef in position 1, so the librarian must be in position 2.

10. **There are two different music genres: jazz, trance.**
    - We already have jazz in position 2, so the other genre must be trance in position 1.
