| Transport     | train       | quad-bike   |           |
```

From Clue 1, the Thai is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike:
```
|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Hobby         | board-games | rock        | scientist |

| Transport     | train       | quad-bike   |           |
```

Finally, filling in the remaining slots based on the clues:
```
|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Hobby         | board-games | rock        | scientist |

| Nationality   | thai        | mexican     |           |
| Pet           | ferret      |             |           |
| Transport     | train       | quad-bike   |           |
```

Since there are no more specific clues to fill in the remaining positions, we assume the remaining values can be filled as follows:
```
|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Hobby         | board-games | rock        | scientist |
| Job           | lawyer      |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   | fantasy     |             |           |
| Music-Genre   | punk        |             | soul      |
| Nationality   | thai        | mexican     | thai      |
| Pet           | ferret      |             |           |
| Transport     | train       | quad-bike   |           |
```

We can infer that the Thai in position 3 has a pet, which could be a rat since the owner of the rat is driving the boat, and the Thai cannot be driving the boat. Thus, the final solution is:

Now let's place the items based on these clues:

#### Beverage:
- From Clue 12: The German drinks iced-tea.
- From Clue 5: The person driving the skateboard is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position 1 or 3. Since the German is in position 3, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1.
- The person drinking fanta must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Hot-Chocolate
- Position 2: Iced-Tea (German)
- Position 3: Fanta

#### Food:
- From Clue 11: The American eats asparagus.
- The person eating kale must be on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
- From Clue 10: The person eating kale is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the photographer is on the right (position 3), the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Kale
- Position 2: Asparagus (American)
- Position 3: Snowmobile

#### Job:
- The entrepreneur is not the fan of reggae (photographer) from Clue 3.
- The police-officer is not the fan of rock from Clue 8.
- The photographer is in position 3, so the job for position 3 must be either entrepreneur or police-officer.
- From Clue 12: The German is the person drinking iced-tea, which implies the German is not the photographer.
- From Clue 1: The person whose sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This implies the person whose sport is baseball is in position 1 or 2.
- From Clue 7: The Brazilian is the person whose sport is volleyball, which implies the Brazilian is not the photographer.
- From Clue 2: The person whose sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since the fan of reggae is the photographer, the Brazilian must be in position 2 or 3.

So, we can deduce:
- Position 1: Entrepreneur (since the person whose sport is baseball is in position 1 or 2, and the entrepreneur cannot be the fan of reggae).
- Position 2: Police-officer (since the police-officer is not the fan of rock, and the Brazilian is the person whose sport is volleyball).
- Position 3: Photographer (fan of reggae).

#### Music-Genre:
- From Clue 9: The photographer is the fan of reggae.
- From Clue 2: The person whose sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the fan of reggae.
- From Clue 7: The Brazilian is the person whose sport is volleyball.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Electronic
- Position 2: Rock
- Position 3: Reggae

#### Nationality:
- From Clue 7: The Brazilian is the person whose sport is volleyball.
- From Clue 12: The German is the person drinking iced-tea.
- From Clue 11: The American eats asparagus.

So, we have:
- Position 1: American
- Position 2: Brazilian
- Position 3: German

#### Sport:
- From Clue 7: The Brazilian is the person whose sport is volleyball.
- From Clue 2: The person whose sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the fan of reggae.
- From Clue 1: The person whose sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
- From Clue 13: The person whose sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Baseball
- Position 2: Volleyball
- Position 3: Rowing
