9. The entrepreneur is between the fan of funk and the Spanish.
10. The Chinese is on the left of the electrician.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- The journalist is in an odd position (1 or 3).

#### Clue 2:
- The person drinking juice is in the middle (2).

#### Clue 6:
- The person whose hobby is hiking is on the far right (3).

So, we can start with:
```
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   | J | H |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
```

#### Clue 3:
- The Spanish is on the right of the person whose hobby is Sudoku.
- Since the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 3, the person with Sudoku must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the person drinking juice is in position 2, the person with Sudoku cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the person with Sudoku must be in position 1, and the Spanish must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| S | J |   | H |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
```

#### Clue 4:
- The person whose hobby is Sudoku is on the left or right of the fan of gospel.
- Since the person with Sudoku is in position 1, the fan of gospel must be in position 2 or 3. But since the person drinking juice is in position 2, the fan of gospel must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| S | J |   | G |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
```

#### Clue 6:
- The person whose hobby is hiking is on the far right (3).
- This confirms our previous placement.

#### Clue 7:
- The person watching scientific movies is in an even position (2 or 4).
- Since position 2 is already taken by juice, the scientific movie watcher must be in position 4.

So, we have:
```
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | J |   | G |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
```

#### Clue 5:
- The person watching family movies is not the person drinking lemonade.
- Since the person drinking juice is in position 2, the family movie watcher cannot be in position 2. The only possible positions for the family movie watcher are 1, 3, or 4. Given that 1 is Sudoku and 3 is Gospel, the family movie watcher must be in position 4.

So, we have:
```
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | J |   | G | F |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
```

#### Clue 8:
- The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the fan of hip-hop.
- Since the person with Sudoku is in position 1, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2 or 3. But since the person drinking juice is in position 2, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | J |   | H | F |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
```

#### Clue 9:
- The entrepreneur is between the fan of funk and the Spanish.
- Since the Spanish is in position 3 and the fan of hip-hop is in position 3, the fan of funk must be in position 1, and the entrepreneur must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
| E | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | J | F | H | F |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
```

#### Clue 10:
- The Chinese is on the left of the electrician.
- Since the electrician must be in position 4 (the only remaining position), the Chinese must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
| C | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | J | F | H | F |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
```

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:
- The remaining job is the journalist, which must be in position 1.
- The remaining nationality is the Canadian, which must be in position 2.

So, the final solution is:
```
| C | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| J | S | E | H | F |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
```

\text{Movie-Genre} & & & \text{musical} \\
\text{Pet} & & \text{gold} & \\
\text{Sport} & & & \\
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 5
- The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person eating mango.

Since the person eating grapes is already in position 2, the person eating mango must be in position 3.

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}

\text{Pet} & & \text{gold} & \\
\text{Sport} & & & \\
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 7
- The person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading.

Since the person with the hobby of reading is in position 3, the person with the sport of cycling must be in position 1.

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}

\end{array}
\]

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The person watching adventure movies is not the person who's sport is surfing.

Since the person with the sport of cycling is in position 1, the person watching adventure movies cannot be in position 1. Therefore, it must be either in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 10
- The person who's hobby is reading is not the person watching adventure movies.

So, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 2.

\[

\text{Pet} & \text{hamster} & \text{gold} & \\
\text{Sport} & \text{cycling} & & \\
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 7: Analyze Clue 3

\hline
\text{Food} & \text{hamster} & \text{grapes} & \text{mango} \\

\text{Pet} & \text{hamster} & \text{gold} & \text{soy-milk} \\
\text{Sport} & \text{cycling} & & \\
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 8: Analyze Clue 4
- The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda.

Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 3, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2, and the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1.

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}

\text{Sport} & \text{baseball} & \text{cycling} & \\
\end{array}
\]

#### Step 10: Analyze Clue 8
- The person who's hobby is sudoku is not the person drinking soy-milk.

Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 3, the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 2.

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
\text{Beverage} & \text{mirinda} & \text{coffee} & \text{soy-milk} \\

Lv6-6x3-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of classical music is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 2**: The person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the journalist.
3. **Clue 3**: The fan of r&b is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical music.
4. **Clue 4**: The person watching documentary movies is between the person watching sports movies and the Indonesian.
5. **Clue 5**: The nurse is in an even position (2 or 4).
6. **Clue 6**: The person whose sport is biathlon is in an even position (2 or 4).
7. **Clue 7**: The Indonesian is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is dancing.
8. **Clue 8**: The person whose hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is basketball.
9. **Clue 9**: The Russian is not the person watching sports movies.
10. **Clue 10**: The fan of r&b is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clues 1 and 10
From Clue 1 and Clue 10, we know that the fan of classical music is either in position 1 or 3, and the fan of r&b is either in position 1 or 3. Since these positions overlap, one must be in 1 and the other in 3.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
Since the fan of r&b is to the right of the fan of classical music, if the fan of classical music is in position 1, then the fan of r&b must be in position 3. This means:
- Position 1: Fan of classical music
- Position 3: Fan of r&b

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 5 and Clue 6
From Clue 5 and Clue 6, the nurse and the person whose sport is biathlon are in even positions (2 or 4).

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
From Clue 2, the person watching western movies is to the left of the journalist. From Clue 4, the person watching documentary movies is between the person watching sports movies and the Indonesian. Let's place the Indonesian and the person watching sports movies in relation to each other first.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 7
From Clue 7, the Indonesian is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is dancing. This means the Indonesian cannot be in the middle position (position 2).

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 8
From Clue 8, the person whose hobby is board-games is to the left of the person whose sport is basketball. Given the above placements, let's assume the person with board-games is in position 1 and the person with basketball is in position 3 or 4.

#### Step 7: Final Placement Based on All Clues
Given all the above constraints, let's finalize the positions:

1. **Position 1**: Fan of classical music (from Clue 1 and Clue 10)
2. **Position 2**: Indonesian (since it can't be in position 1 or 3, and from Clue 7)
3. **Position 3**: Fan of r&b (from Clue 3)
4. **Position 4**: Nurse (from Clue 5 and Clue 6)
5. **Position 5**: Person watching sports movies (from Clue 4 and Clue 9)
6. **Position 6**: Person watching western movies (from Clue 2)

Now, filling in the rest based on hobbies, jobs, etc., we get:

Lv6-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and constraints.

### Clues Summary:
1. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the fish.
2. The owner of the rat is not the fan of classical.
3. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the Polish.
4. The Polish is the person driving the helicopter.
5. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
6. The fan of trance is somewhere to the right of the French.
7. The Polish is on the right of the fisherman.
8. The lawyer is on the right of the musician.
9. The person drinking tea is on the right of the owner of the ferret.
10. The fan of rock is the French.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4: The Polish is the person driving the helicopter.
- Polish = Helicopter

#### Clue 7: The Polish is on the right of the fisherman.
- Fisherman must be in position 1 or 2 (since Polish is in position 3).

#### Clue 8: The lawyer is on the right of the musician.
- This means the musician cannot be in position 3, so the musician must be in position 1 or 2.
- If the musician is in position 1, the lawyer must be in position 2.
- If the musician is in position 2, the lawyer must be in position 3 (but Polish is already in position 3, so this is not possible).

So, the musician must be in position 1 and the lawyer in position 2.

#### Clue 4 again: The Polish is the person driving the helicopter.
- Polish = Helicopter
- Fisherman must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the musician is in position 1, the fisherman must be in position 2.

#### Clue 7 again: The Polish is on the right of the fisherman.
- This confirms the fisherman is in position 2 and Polish is in position 3.

#### Clue 5: The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
- Since Polish is driving the helicopter, the jet-ski must be driven by either the lawyer or the fisherman.
- But the fisherman is in position 2, so the jet-ski must be driven by the lawyer.
- Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the fisherman is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.

#### Clue 1: The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the fish.
- The owner of the fish must be in position 2 (fisherman), and the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Almond-milk drinker
- Position 2: Fisherman
- Position 3: Polish (Helicopter)

#### Clue 6: The fan of trance is somewhere to the right of the French.
- The fan of rock is the French, so the French cannot be in position 3 (Polish).
- The fan of trance must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the French is in position 1 or 2, and the fan of trance is to the right of the French, the fan of trance must be in position 3 (Polish).

This conflicts with the Polish being the fan of trance, so let's re-evaluate:

- The French must be in position 2 (since the fan of trance is in position 3 and the fan of rock is the French).
- The fan of trance must then be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Trance fan
- Position 2: French
- Position 3: Polish (Helicopter)

#### Clue 9: The person drinking tea is on the right of the owner of the ferret.
- The owner of the ferret must be in position 1 or 2.
- The person drinking tea must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the French is in position 2, the owner of the ferret must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Ferret owner
- Position 2: French
- Position 3: Tea drinker (Polish, Helicopter)

#### Clue 2: The owner of the rat is not the fan of classical.
- The owner of the rat must be in position 1 or 2.
- The fan of rock is the French, so the owner of the rat cannot be the French.
- The owner of the rat must be in position 1 or 2, but not the French.

Since the French is in position 2, the owner of the rat must be in position 1.

#### Clue 3: The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the Polish.
- The Polish is in position 3, so the owner of the rat must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rat owner (Trance fan)
- Position 2: French
- Position 3: Tea drinker (Polish, Helicopter)

#### Clue 10: The fan of rock is the French.
- The French is in position 2, so the fan of rock is the French.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rat owner (Trance fan)
- Position 2: French (Rock fan)
- Position 3: Tea drinker (Polish, Helicopter)

#### Clue 6: The fan of trance is somewhere to the right of the French.
- The fan of trance must be in position 3 (Polish).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rat owner (Trance fan)
- Position 2: French (Rock fan)
- Position 3: Polish (Tea drinker, Helicopter)

#### Clue 1: The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the fish.
- The owner of the fish must be in position 2 (French), and the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Almond-milk drinker
- Position 2: French (Fish owner, Rock fan)
- Position 3: Polish (Tea drinker, Helicopter)
