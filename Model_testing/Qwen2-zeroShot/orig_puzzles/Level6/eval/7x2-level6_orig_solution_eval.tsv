Lv6-7x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to fill in the table step-by-step based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and filling in the table accordingly.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is writing is not the fan of hip-hop.
2. The person drinking water is on the far left.
3. The Italian is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
4. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake.
5. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket.
6. The fan of dubstep is the owner of the pony.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Person Drinking Water
- Clue 2 states that the person drinking water is on the far left.
- Therefore, **Person 1** drinks **water**.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Italian
- Clue 3 states that the Italian is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
- Since position 1 is already taken by the person drinking water, the Italian must be in position 3.

#### Step 3: Filling in the Hobbies
- Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is writing is not the fan of hip-hop.
- Since the Italian is in position 3, let's assume the Italian's hobby is writing for now (we will verify later).

#### Step 4: Filling in the Beverages and Pets
- Clue 4 states that the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake.
- Clue 5 states that the person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket.
- Clue 6 states that the fan of dubstep is the owner of the pony.

Let's place these constraints in the table:

```
|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | water  |             |
| Hobby         |        |              |
| Music-Genre   |        |              |
| Nationality   | Italian|              |
| Pet           |        |              |
| Sport         |        |              |
| Transport     |        |              |
```

#### Step 5: Determining the Sports and Transport
- From Clue 5, the person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket.
- From Clue 4, the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake.
- Let's assume the person in position 2 drives the trike (since they are on the right of the person with cricket).

```
|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | water  |             |
| Hobby         |        |              |
| Music-Genre   |        |              |
| Nationality   | Italian|              |
| Pet           |        |              |
| Sport         | cricket| tennis       |
| Transport     |        | trike         |
```

#### Step 6: Determining the Hobbies
- From Clue 1, the person who's hobby is writing is not the fan of hip-hop.
- Since the Italian has writing as their hobby, the other person must have writing as their hobby.
- Therefore, the person in position 2 must have writing as their hobby.

```
|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | water  |             |
| Hobby         |        | writing      |
| Music-Genre   |        |              |
| Nationality   | Italian|              |
| Pet           |        |              |
| Sport         | cricket| tennis       |
| Transport     |        | trike         |
```

#### Step 7: Determining the Music Genres and Pets
- From Clue 6, the fan of dubstep is the owner of the pony.
- Since the Italian has writing as their hobby, the person in position 2 must be the fan of hip-hop (since the person with writing is not the fan of hip-hop).
- Therefore, the person in position 1 must be the fan of dubstep.

```
|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | water  |             |
| Hobby         | dubstep| writing      |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop|              |
| Nationality   | Italian|              |
| Pet           |        | pony         |
| Sport         | cricket| tennis       |
| Transport     |        | trike         |
```

#### Step 8: Determining the Remaining Details
- The remaining person in position 2 must be the Malaysian (since there are only two nationalities and one is already assigned).
- The person in position 1 must have the snake as their pet (since the person with the pony is in position 2).

```
|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | water  |             |
| Hobby         | dubstep| writing      |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop|              |
| Nationality   | Italian| Malaysian    |
| Pet           | snake  | pony         |
| Sport         | cricket| tennis       |
| Transport     |        | trike         |
```

#### Step 9: Determining the Remaining Transport
- The person in position 1 must drive the scooter (since the person driving the trike is in position 2).

```
|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | water  |             |

```

#### Final Solution Table:

Lv6-7x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each item (beverage, hobby, job, movie genre, music genre, pet, and transport) into the correct positions for both columns. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

1. **The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the fan of ambient music.**
2. **The owner of the goat is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.**
3. **The lawyer is on the left of the person whose hobby is traveling.**
4. **The person whose hobby is traveling is not the person watching horror movies.**
5. **The person driving the quad-bike is the person watching satire movies.**

We'll start by placing the items based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Clue 5:
- The person driving the quad-bike watches satire movies.
- We can place ""satire"" under ""Movie-Genre"" for one of the columns.

#### Clue 4:
- The person whose hobby is traveling does not watch horror movies.
- This implies that the person with the hobby of traveling must be watching either satire or another genre, but since we already placed satire, it must be another genre.
- Let's place ""horror"" under ""Movie-Genre"" for the other column.

#### Clue 3:
- The lawyer is on the left of the person whose hobby is traveling.
- Since the lawyer must be on the left, let's place ""lawyer"" under ""Job"" for the left column.

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the goat is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.
- This means if the person drinking mirinda is in position 1, then the owner of the goat must be in position 2.

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the fan of ambient music.
- This means if the fan of ambient music is in position 1, then the owner of the lizard can be in position 2, and vice versa.

Let's start filling the table with these clues:

```
|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      | mirinda |         1 |
| Hobby         |         | traveling |
| Job           | lawyer  |          2|
| Movie-Genre   | horror  | satire    |
| Music-Genre   | ambient | pop       |
| Pet           | goat    | lizard    |
| Transport     |        2| quad-bike |
```

Now, let's fill in the remaining items based on the positions:

1. **Beverage**: 
   - Since the owner of the goat is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, and the goat is in position 2, mirinda must be in position 1 for the beverage.
   
2. **Hobby**:
   - The owner of the goat is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, so the hobby in position 1 must be chess (since traveling is in position 2).

3. **Job**:
   - The lawyer is on the left of the person whose hobby is traveling, so the job in position 2 must be paramedic.

4. **Music Genre**:
   - The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the fan of ambient music, so the music genre in position 1 must be pop (since ambient is in position 2).

5. **Pet**:
   - The owner of the goat is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, so the pet in position 1 must be goat, and the pet in position 2 must be lizard.

6. **Transport**:
   - The person driving the quad-bike watches satire movies, so the transport in position 2 must be quad-bike, and the transport in position 1 must be scooter.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |     2     |

| Music-Genre   | pop     | ambient   |
| Pet           | goat    | lizard    |

4. **Clue 4:** The person watching action movies is the person who's hobby is camping.
5. **Clue 5:** The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.
6. **Clue 6:** The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the German.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4:
- The person watching action movies is the person who's hobby is camping.
- This means the person who likes camping watches action movies.

#### Clue 2:
- The person who's hobby is camping is not the person driving the taxi.
- So, the person who drives the taxi cannot be the one who likes camping.

#### Clue 6:
- The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the German.
- This implies the German is not on the far right, and there is someone else watching adventure movies on their right.

#### Clue 1:
- The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the right of the person eating kale.
- This means the person eating kale is not on the far right, and the person doing surf is on their right.

#### Clue 3:
- The Spanish is on the right of the person eating kale.
- This means the Spanish person is not the first in the row, and the person eating kale is on their left.

#### Clue 5:
- The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.
- This means the person who likes reggae is adjacent to the person doing surf.

Let's start placing the information:

1. **Hobby - Camping (action movies):**
   - We can place ""Camping"" in column 1 and ""Action"" in column 2 for this person.

2. **Sport - Surfing:**
   - Since the person doing surf is to the right of the person eating kale, and the Spanish is to the right of the person eating kale, the person eating kale must be in the first position.
   - Therefore, the person doing surf must be in the second position.

3. **Nationality - Spanish:**
   - The Spanish person is to the right of the person eating kale.
   - So, the Spanish person must be in the second position.

4. **Hobby - Camping:**
   - The person who likes camping watches action movies, so this must be the same person as above.

5. **Sport - Surfing:**
   - The person doing surf is in the second position.

6. **Nationality - German:**
   - The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the German.
   - Since the German cannot be in the last position due to the action movie person being in the second position, the German must be in the first position.

7. **Hobby - Skydiving:**
   - The remaining hobby is skydiving, and it must be for the German.

8. **Movie-Genre - Adventure:**
   - The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the German, so this must be the person in the second position.

9. **Music-Genre - Reggae:**
   - The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.
   - Since the person doing surf is in the second position, the fan of reggae must be in the first position.

10. **Food - Tomato:**
    - The person eating kale must be in the first position, so the person eating tomato must be in the second position.

11. **Transport - Trike:**
    - The person using a trike must be in the second position.

12. **Transport - Taxi:**
    - The person using a taxi must be in the first position.

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1       |     2     |

2. The person watching sports movies is not the person eating apricot.
3. The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.
4. The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the owner of the dog.
5. The fan of jazz is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.

- Let's denote the positions as 1 and 2 for each row (Beverage, Food, Hobby, etc.).

Possible pairs for Gardening and 7up:
- (1, 2) - Gardening is to the left of 7up.

So, we can tentatively place them:
|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      |               | 7up           |
| Food          |               |               |

- Clue 3: The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.

Possible pairs for apricot and carrot:
- (1, 2) - Carrot is to the left or right of jazz.

Since we don't know the exact positions yet, let's keep this in mind.

#### Step 3: Assigning Pet and Transport
- Clue 4: The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the owner of the dog.
- Clue 5: The fan of jazz is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.

Possible pairs for pet and transport:
- (1, 2) - Helicopter is to the left or right of dog.

#### Step 4: Final Placement Based on Clues
Let's try to fit all the pieces together:

1. Gardening is to the left of 7up.
2. Sports is not with apricot.
3. Carrot is next to jazz.
4. Helicopter is next to dog.
5. Jazz is to the left of dog.

Given these constraints, let's fill in the grid:

| Pet           | dog           | frog          |
| Transport     | helicopter    | jet-ski       |

Now, let's verify the placements:
- Gardening (1) is to the left of 7up (2).
- Sports (1) is not with apricot (1).
- Carrot (2) is next to jazz (1).
- Helicopter (1) is next to dog (2).
- Jazz (1) is to the left of dog (2).

5. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Fan of Blues and the Paramedic
From clue 4, we know that the fan of blues is the paramedic. This gives us:
- **Job**: Paramedic = Fan of blues

#### Step 2: Determine the Beverages
From clue 2, the person drinking coffee is in an odd position (position 1 or 2). Let's denote:
- **Beverage**: Coffee = Position 1 or 2

Since the fan of blues (paramedic) is in an even position, the fan of blues cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1, and the paramedic must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- **Beverage**: Coffee = Position 1
- **Job**: Paramedic = Position 2

#### Step 3: Determine the Hobbies
From clue 3, the person whose hobby is filmmaking is to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the paramedic is in position 2, the person driving the taxi must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- **Hobby**: Filmmaking = Position 2 (since it is to the right of the taxi driver)
- **Transport**: Taxi = Position 1

Now, the remaining positions for hobbies are:
- **Hobby**: Filmmaking = Position 2
- **Hobby**: Sudoku = Position 1 (since only two hobbies are mentioned and one is already assigned)

#### Step 4: Determine the Pets
From clue 5, the owner of the lizard is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person watching time-travel movies is in position 2, the owner of the lizard must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- **Pet**: Lizard = Position 1
- **Movie-Genre**: Time-travel = Position 2

The remaining pet is the bird, which must be in position 2.

#### Step 5: Determine the Remaining Attributes
We now have:
- **Beverage**: Coffee = Position 1
- **Beverage**: Water = Position 2
- **Hobby**: Filmmaking = Position 2
- **Hobby**: Sudoku = Position 1
- **Job**: Mechanic = Position 1 (since only two jobs are mentioned and one is already assigned)
- **Job**: Paramedic = Position 2
- **Movie-Genre**: Family = Position 1 (since only two movie genres are mentioned and one is already assigned)
- **Movie-Genre**: Time-travel = Position 2
- **Music-Genre**: Blues = Position 1 (since only two music genres are mentioned and one is already assigned)
- **Music-Genre**: Techno = Position 2
- **Pet**: Bird = Position 2
- **Pet**: Lizard = Position 1
- **Transport**: Car = Position 1 (since only two transport methods are mentioned and one is already assigned)
- **Transport**: Taxi = Position 2

Lv6-7x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding information into the table. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of trance is on the left of the person whose sport is cycling.
2. **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is board-games is on the left of the person driving the subway.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the subway is British.
4. **Clue 4:** The person watching scientific movies is not the owner of the horse.
5. **Clue 5:** The person whose sport is rugby is the owner of the horse.

Let's start by placing the information from Clue 3:
- **Nationality (British) - Transport (Subway)**

Since the person driving the subway is British (Clue 3), we can place ""British"" under Nationality for the person driving the subway.

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- **Hobby (Board-Games) - Transport (Subway)**

The person whose hobby is board-games is on the left of the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the subway is British, the person with the hobby of board-games must be on the left of the British person.

Next, let's use Clue 1:
- **Music-Genre (Trance) - Sport (Cycling)**

The fan of trance is on the left of the person whose sport is cycling. This means the person with the hobby of board-games (who is on the left of the British person) cannot be the fan of trance or the person whose sport is cycling.

Now, let's use Clue 5:
- **Sport (Rugby) - Pet (Horse)**

The person whose sport is rugby is the owner of the horse. This means the person with the hobby of board-games cannot be the owner of the horse either.

Finally, let's use Clue 4:
- **Movie-Genre (Scientific) - Pet (Horse)**

The person watching scientific movies is not the owner of the horse. This means the person watching scientific movies cannot be the same as the person owning the horse.

Given all these constraints, we can start filling in the table:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Hobby         | Board-Games | Collecting |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific  | Family     |
| Music-Genre   | Hip-Hop     | Trance     |

| Pet           | Guinea-Pig  | Horse      |
| Sport         | Rugby       | Cycling    |
| Transport     | Subway      | Quad-Bike  |

Now, let's verify that all clues are satisfied:
1. The fan of trance (Trance) is on the left of the person whose sport is cycling (Cycling).
2. The person whose hobby is board-games (Board-Games) is on the left of the person driving the subway (Subway).
3. The person driving the subway (Subway) is British.
4. The person watching scientific movies (Scientific) is not the owner of the horse (Horse).
5. The person whose sport is rugby (Rugby) is the owner of the horse (Horse).

All clues are satisfied. Here is the final solution:

Lv6-7x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person watching drama movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking almond-milk is not the owner of the dog.
3. **Clue 3:** The electrician is somewhere to the right of the dressmaker.
4. **Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is reading is not the person driving the jet-ski.
5. **Clue 5:** The fan of R&B is on the left of the person whose hobby is reading.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions for the dog and drama movies.
From Clue 1, we know that the owner of the dog is to the right of the person watching drama movies. This means:
- If the person watching drama movies is in position 1, the owner of the dog must be in position 2.
- If the person watching drama movies is in position 2, there is no valid placement for the owner of the dog (since it would be out of bounds).

So, the only valid configuration is:
- Drama Movies in position 1
- Dog Owner in position 2

#### Step 2: Determine the beverage preferences.
From Clue 2, the person drinking almond-milk is not the owner of the dog. Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk cannot be in position 2. Since we have two beverages, one must be in position 1 and the other in position 2. Given that the dog owner is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Almond Milk
- Position 2: Cola

#### Step 3: Determine the job preferences.
From Clue 3, the electrician is to the right of the dressmaker. This means:
- If the dressmaker is in position 1, the electrician must be in position 2.
- If the dressmaker is in position 2, there is no valid placement for the electrician (since it would be out of bounds).

So, the only valid configuration is:
- Dressmaker in position 1
- Electrician in position 2

#### Step 4: Determine the hobby preferences.
From Clue 4, the person whose hobby is reading is not the person driving the jet-ski. From Clue 5, the fan of R&B is on the left of the person whose hobby is reading. This means:
- The person with the hobby of reading cannot be in position 1 (since the fan of R&B would have to be in position 1, which is not possible).
- Therefore, the person with the hobby of reading must be in position 2.

Since the person with the hobby of reading is in position 2, the person with the hobby of Sudoku must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Sudoku
- Position 2: Reading

#### Step 5: Determine the movie genre preferences.
From Clue 1 and the previous steps, we know:
- Drama movies are in position 1.
- Adventure movies must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Drama
- Position 2: Adventure

#### Step 6: Determine the music genre preferences.
From Clue 5, the fan of R&B is on the left of the person whose hobby is reading. This means:
- The person who prefers R&B must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the person who prefers Pop must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: R&B
- Position 2: Pop

#### Step 7: Determine the pet preferences.
From Clue 2, the person drinking almond milk (position 1) is not the owner of the dog. Therefore, the person drinking almond milk must own the hamster.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Hamster
- Position 2: Dog

#### Step 8: Determine the transport preferences.
From Clue 4, the person whose hobby is reading (position 2) is not the person driving the jet-ski. Therefore, the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Jet-ski
- Position 2: Bus

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond Milk |    Cola     |
| Hobby         |     Sudoku  |    Reading  |
| Job           |   Dressmaker|  Electrician|
| Movie-Genre   |     Drama   |   Adventure |
| Music-Genre   |       R&B   |      Pop    |
| Pet           |    Hamster  |     Dog     |
| Transport     |     Jet-ski |     Bus     |
