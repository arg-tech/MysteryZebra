   - The person driving the car is to the left of position 5.
   - From clue 8, the person watching action movies is the person driving the jet-ski.

   - The person driving the car (position 4) is the American (clue 21).
   - The person driving the jet-ski (Malaysian) is in position 5 (western movies).
   - The Argentine is in an odd position (1 or 3, but 1 is occupied by the American), so the Argentine is in position 3 (gospel).

5. **Food and Hobbies:**
   - From clue 3, the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is the one eating plum.
   - The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski (Malaysian).
   - Therefore, the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is in position 1 (eating plum).

6. **Remaining Assignments:**
   - The person whose hobby is camping is on the right of the Argentine (position 3).
   - The person whose hobby is camping is between the person eating tomato and the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.
