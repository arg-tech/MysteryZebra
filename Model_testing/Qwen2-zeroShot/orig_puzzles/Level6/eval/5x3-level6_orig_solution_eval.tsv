1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking cola is the Indian.
   - **Beverage** for **Nationality** Indian: Cola

2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the car.
   - Since the Indian (Cola) is on the left, the Indian must be in position 1.

3. **Clue 3**: The person whose sport is volleyball is in the middle.
   - Volleyball is in position 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching romance movies is not the person whose sport is biathlon.
   - This means the person whose sport is biathlon cannot watch romance movies.

5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking hot chocolate is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
   - Since the person driving the ship is in an odd position (Clue 10), and the person drinking hot chocolate is to the left, the person drinking hot chocolate must be in position 1 or 2.

6. **Clue 6**: The Chinese is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the Indian is already in position 1, the Chinese must be in position 3.

7. **Clue 7**: The person whose sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - Since the Indian (Cola) is in position 1, the person with biathlon must be in position 2 or 3. But volleyball is in position 2, so biathlon must be in position 3.

8. **Clue 8**: The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car.
   - Since the person driving the car is in an odd position, and the person watching romance movies is to the left, the person watching romance movies must be in position 1 or 2.

9. **Clue 9**: The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
   - Since the person driving the ship is in an odd position, and the person watching disaster movies is to the left, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 1.

10. **Clue 11**: The person drinking hot chocolate is on the left of the person driving the ship.
    - Since the person driving the ship is in an odd position, and the person drinking hot chocolate is to the left, the person drinking hot chocolate must be in position 1.

Lv6-5x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Mirinda.
2. **Clue 2:** The person whose sport is baseball is between the person drinking Tea and the person watching romance movies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person whose sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is drawing.
4. **Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.
5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the hamster is not the person watching romance movies.
6. **Clue 6:** The person drinking Mirinda is in an odd position (i.e., position 1 or 3).
7. **Clue 7:** The person whose sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is cycling.
8. **Clue 8:** The person whose hobby is drawing is not the person drinking soy-milk.
9. **Clue 9:** The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6:** The person drinking Mirinda is in an odd position (position 1 or 3). Let's assume the person drinking Mirinda is in position 1 for now.
2. **Clue 1:** Since the person drinking Mirinda is in position 1, the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 2 or 3. But since the person watching time-travel movies is to the right of the person drinking Mirinda, they must be in position 3.
3. **Clue 9:** The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony. So, the owner of the pony must be in position 2.
4. **Clue 2:** The person whose sport is baseball is between the person drinking Tea and the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching time-travel movies is in position 3, the person whose sport is baseball cannot be in position 3. The person drinking Tea cannot be in position 3 either because there is no room for the person watching romance movies. Therefore, the person drinking Tea must be in position 2, and the person watching romance movies must be in position 1.
5. **Clue 3:** The person whose sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is drawing. Since the person drinking Mirinda is in position 1, the person whose sport is ice-hockey must be in position 2, and the person whose hobby is drawing must be in position 3.
6. **Clue 7:** The person whose sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is cycling. We already know that the person whose sport is baseball is in position 2. So, the person whose sport is cycling must be in position 3.
7. **Clue 5:** The owner of the hamster is not the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in position 1, the owner of the hamster cannot be in position 1. The only remaining position for the owner of the hamster is position 2.
8. **Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person drinking Mirinda is in position 1, the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in position 1. The person drinking soy-milk can be in position 2 or 3. However, since the person whose sport is baseball is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 3.
9. **Clue 8:** The person whose hobby is drawing is not the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 3, the person whose hobby is drawing must be in position 2.
10. **Assigning remaining items:**
    - The person whose sport is baseball is in position 2.
    - The person whose sport is cycling is in position 3.
    - The person whose hobby is skydiving is in position 2.
    - The person whose hobby is drawing is in position 2.
    - The person whose sport is ice-hockey is in position 2.
    - The person whose sport is baseball is in position 2.
    - The person whose sport is cycling is in position 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The bartender is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the left of the freelancer.
4. **Clue 4:** The fan of country is not the person drinking almond-milk.
5. **Clue 5:** The photographer is on the right of the owner of the frog.

7. **Clue 7:** The freelancer is not the fan of gospel.
8. **Clue 8:** The bartender is on the left of the owner of the hamster.
9. **Clue 9:** The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike.
10. **Clue 10:** The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog.
11. **Clue 12:** The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the trike.

### Initial Setup:
Let's start by setting up the table with placeholders for each category and position.

|               |     1     |      2       |     3      |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Beverage      |           |              |            |
| Job           |           |              |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |              |            |
| Pet           |           |              |            |
| Transport     |           |              |            |

### Applying Clues:

1. **Clue 6:** The fan of gospel is in an even position (positions 2 or 4).

   - Possible positions for the fan of gospel: 2 or 4.

2. **Clue 7:** The freelancer is not the fan of gospel.

   - If the fan of gospel is in position 2, the freelancer cannot be in position 2.
   - If the fan of gospel is in position 4, the freelancer cannot be in position 4.

3. **Clue 10:** The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog.

   - This implies the owner of the frog must be in a position to the left of the owner of the hamster.

4. **Clue 8:** The bartender is on the left of the owner of the hamster.

   - This means the bartender cannot be in position 3.

5. **Clue 2:** The bartender is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway.

   - This means the bartender cannot be in position 3.

6. **Clue 3:** The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the left of the freelancer.

   - This means the person driving the taxi cannot be in position 3.

7. **Clue 9:** The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike.

   - This means the person drinking mirinda cannot be in position 3.

8. **Clue 11:** The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the trike.

   - This means the person drinking milk cannot be in position 1.

### Deduction Process:

From clues 2, 3, 8, 9, and 11, we can deduce that the bartender, taxi driver, and trike driver cannot be in position 3. Therefore, position 3 must be occupied by either the photographer, the freelancer, or the owner of the rabbit.

Since the bartender is on the left of the owner of the hamster, and the owner of the hamster is to the right of the owner of the frog, and the photographer is to the right of the owner of the frog, we can place the owner of the frog in position 1 and the owner of the hamster in position 3.

### Final Placement:

Given these constraints and the remaining clues:

- Position 1: Owner of the frog (clue 5)
- Position 3: Owner of the hamster (clue 10 and 8)

Now, we can place the bartender and the taxi driver in positions 1 and 2:

- Position 1: Bartender (clue 2 and 8)
- Position 2: Taxi Driver (clue 3)

The freelancer must be in position 3 since the taxi driver is to the left of the freelancer (clue 3).

- Position 3: Freelancer

The owner of the rabbit must be in position 2 since the owner of the frog is in position 1 and the owner of the hamster is in position 3.

- Position 2: Owner of the rabbit

Now, we need to place the beverages, music genres, and pets:

- Clue 4: The fan of country is not the person drinking almond-milk.
- Clue 6: The fan of gospel is in position 2.
- Clue 7: The freelancer is not the fan of gospel.
- Clue 5: The photographer is on the right of the owner of the frog.
- Clue 12: The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the trike.

Given the above, we can place:

- Position 2: Fan of gospel (owner of the rabbit)
- Position 3: Freelancer (fan of country)

The person driving the trike must be in position 3 (freelancer), so the person drinking milk must be in position 1 (bartender).

- Position 1: Bartender (drinking milk)
- Position 3: Freelancer (driving trike, fan of country)

The fan of country cannot be the person drinking almond-milk, so the fan of country must be drinking mirinda.

- Position 2: Fan of gospel (drinking almond-milk)

The person drinking mirinda must be in position 1 (bartender).

Finally, the pet placement:

- Position 1: Owner of the frog (pet: hamster)
- Position 2: Owner of the rabbit (pet: hamster)
- Position 3: Owner of the hamster (pet: rabbit)

   - Country (3) -> Lacrosse (3)

10. **Country fan is the person eating pear**:
    - Country (3) -> Pear (3)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 1 and Clue 7**: 
   - Since the superhero fan is to the left of the handball fan, and the handball fan is Pakistani (from Clue 3), the superhero fan must be on the left of Pakistani.
   - Therefore, Superhero (1) and Pakistani (3).

2. **From Clue 3**:
   - Pakistani (1) -> Handball (3)

3. **From Clue 9 and Clue 10**:
   - Country (3) -> Lacrosse (3) and Country (3) -> Pear (3)
   - This means the person eating pear is the country fan and plays lacrosse.

4. **From Clue 6**:
   - Country (3) -> Western (1)

5. **From Clue 5**:
   - The disaster fan is in an odd position. Given that the superhero fan is in position 1, the disaster fan cannot be in position 1. So, the disaster fan must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, Disaster (3)

6. **From Clue 4**:
   - Chinese is in an odd position. Since the disaster fan is in position 3, the Chinese cannot be in position 3. So, Chinese (1)

7. **From Clue 2**:
   - Indian ≠ Funk
   - Since Chinese (1), Pakistani (3), and Country (3), the only remaining option for Indian is position 2.
   - Therefore, Indian (2)

8. **From Clue 8**:
   - Indian ≠ Funk
   - Since Indian (2) and Country (3) -> Funk, the only remaining option for Funk is position 2.
   - Therefore, Funk (2)

6. **Clue 7:** The person who's hobby is chess is the person eating zucchini.
7. **Clue 8:** The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the Turkish.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 7
- The person who's hobby is chess is the person eating zucchini.
- This means the person eating zucchini has chess as their hobby.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 6
- The person with chess as a hobby is on the right of the person eating kale.
- The person with chess as a hobby is also somewhere to the left of the person with reading as a hobby.
- Therefore, the order for hobbies must be: **Kale > Chess > Reading** (or any permutation fitting these conditions).

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
- The Pakistani owns the fish.
- This means the Pakistani cannot own the dog or the guinea-pig.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 3 and Clue 2
- The person watching documentary movies is to the left of the Pakistani.
- The Pakistani is not watching documentary movies.
- Therefore, the Pakistani must be watching either drama or thriller movies.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 5 and Clue 8
- The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the Pakistani.
- The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the Turkish.
- Since the Pakistani is not watching documentary movies, they could be watching drama or thriller movies.
- If the Pakistani is watching thriller movies, then the Turkish must be watching drama movies (since thriller is on the right of the Turkish).

#### Step 6: Determine the Remaining Information
- The person eating kale cannot be the Pakistani because the Pakistani owns the fish.
- The person eating kale must be either Australian or Turkish.
- Since the person with chess as a hobby is the person eating zucchini, and the person with chess is on the right of the person eating kale, the person eating kale must be Australian (because the Pakistani is on the right of the person eating kale and owns the fish).

  ```

- **Clue 10:** The French is on the left or right of the fisherman.
  - This condition is already satisfied by the current arrangement.

- **Determine the remaining positions:**
  - The German must be in position 1 since the French is in position 2.

Lv6-5x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's go through the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's sport is baseball is on the left of the fan house.**
   - Baseball is either in position 1 or 2, and the fan of house is to its right.

2. **The person who's sport is skiing is the person driving the bike.**
   - Skiing is associated with the bike, so the person doing skiing is also the one driving the bike.

3. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the musician.**
   - Skateboarding can be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the musician can be in any position as long as skateboarding is next to them.

4. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the fan indie.**
   - The person driving the trike is in position 3, and the fan of indie is in position 1 or 2.

5. **The musician is on the right of the person drinking water.**
   - Water is in position 1 or 2, and the musician is in position 2 or 3.

6. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is in the middle.**
   - Skateboarding must be in position 2.

7. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is not the fan jazz.**
   - The person doing skateboarding does not like jazz.

8. **The accountant is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.**
   - Soy-milk is in position 1 or 2, and the accountant is in position 1 or 3.

9. **The fan house is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite.**
   - Sprite is in position 1, and house is in position 2 or 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 6, skateboarding is in position 2.
2. From clue 3, the musician cannot be in position 1 (since skateboarding is in position 2). Therefore, the musician must be in position 3.
3. From clue 5, the person drinking water is in position 1 (since the musician is in position 3).
4. From clue 9, the fan house is in position 3 (since sprite is in position 1 and house is to the right of sprite).
5. From clue 4, the person driving the trike is in position 3 (since the fan of indie is in position 1 or 2, and the trike is to the right of indie).
6. From clue 2, the person doing skiing is in position 3 (since they drive the bike).
7. From clue 1, the person doing baseball is in position 1 (since house is in position 3 and baseball is to the left of house).

So far, we have:
```

| Transport     | bike       |               | trike    |
```

8. From clue 8, the accountant is in position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is occupied by baseball, the accountant must be in position 3. This means the person drinking soy-milk is in position 1.
9. From clue 7, the person doing skateboarding (position 2) is not a fan of jazz, so the fan of jazz must be in position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is occupied by sprite, the fan of jazz must be in position 3 (the musician).

Now, we have:

| Sport         | baseball   | skateboarding | skiing   |
| Transport     | bike       | skateboard    | trike    |
```

10. From clue 7, the person doing skateboarding (position 2) is not a fan of jazz, so the fan of indie must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is occupied by soy-milk, the fan of indie must be in position 2.

Final solution:

9. **Clue 9:** The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person eating lime.
10. **Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is chess is the fan of trance.

### Step-by-Step Solution

**Position 1 (Odd Position for Fantasy Movies):**
- Fantasy movies can only be in position 1 or 3.

#### Case 1: Fantasy Movies in Position 1
- **Clue 7:** Fantasy movies are in position 1.
- **Clue 3 & Clue 4:** The person watching fantasy movies is not the person driving the helicopter, so the helicopter driver cannot be in position 1.
- **Clue 6:** The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the car, so the trike cannot be in position 1.

**Position 2 and 3:**
- Let's try placing the remaining items:
- **Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is chess is the fan of trance, so chess cannot be in position 1.
- **Clue 1:** Trance is to the right of garlic. So, garlic cannot be in position 1.
- **Clue 2:** Woodworking is between the person driving the helicopter and the fan of electronic. So, the fan of electronic cannot be in position 1.
- **Clue 8:** The person whose hobby is woodworking is not the person eating garlic, so the person eating garlic cannot have woodworking as a hobby.
- **Clue 9:** The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person eating lime. So, the person eating lime cannot be in position 1.

Thus, we need to place the remaining items (drawing, adventure, spy) in positions 2 and 3, ensuring all conditions are met.

### Final Placement

Let's assume:
- Position 1: Fantasy movies (as it must be in an odd position)
- Position 2: Adventure movies (to avoid conflicts with the helicopter driver)
- Position 3: Spy movies (to satisfy all other conditions)

Now let's fill in the rest:

- **Clue 6:** Trike on the right of the car.
- **Clue 2:** Woodworking between the helicopter and electronic.
- **Clue 10:** Chess (fan of trance) cannot be in position 1.
- **Clue 1:** Trance to the right of garlic.
