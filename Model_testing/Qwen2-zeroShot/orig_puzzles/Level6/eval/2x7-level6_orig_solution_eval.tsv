11. The fan of Hip-Hop is not the French (Clue 11).
12. The fan of Classical is on the far right (Clue 12).
13. The fan of Hip-Hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of D&B (Clue 13).
14. The fan of House is the Malaysian (Clue 14).
15. The Japanese is on the left of the fan of House (Clue 15).
16. The fan of Pop is somewhere to the right of the Canadian (Clue 16).
17. The French is on the right of the fan of House (Clue 17).
18. The fan of House is somewhere to the left of the fan of D&B (Clue 18).

20. The fan of Soul is on the right of the fan of Hip-Hop (Clue 20).
21. The fan of Soul is somewhere to the left of the Malaysian (Clue 21).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 12:** The fan of Classical is on the far right (position 7).
2. **From Clue 14:** The fan of House is the Malaysian (position 6).
3. **From Clue 17:** The French is on the right of the fan of House (position 7). Therefore, the French is in position 7.
4. **From Clue 15:** The Japanese is on the left of the fan of House (position 6), so the Japanese must be in position 5.
5. **From Clue 10:** The Japanese is on the right of the fan of Hip-Hop. Since the Japanese is in position 5, the fan of Hip-Hop must be in position 4.
6. **From Clue 11:** The fan of Hip-Hop is not the French, so the fan of Hip-Hop cannot be in position 7.
7. **From Clue 20:** The fan of Soul is on the right of the fan of Hip-Hop. So, the fan of Soul must be in position 6 or 7. But since the fan of House is already in position 6, the fan of Soul must be in position 7.
8. **From Clue 21:** The fan of Soul is somewhere to the left of the Malaysian (position 6). This aligns with the previous deduction.
9. **From Clue 16:** The fan of Pop is somewhere to the right of the Canadian. So, the Canadian cannot be in position 7, and the fan of Pop must be in position 7 or later.
10. **From Clue 3:** The fan of Pop is somewhere to the right of the fan of Soul. Since the fan of Soul is in position 7, the fan of Pop must be in position 7 or later. But since position 7 is taken by the fan of Soul, the fan of Pop must be in position 8 or later. However, there is no position 8, so the fan of Pop must be in position 7, which contradicts our previous deduction. Therefore, the fan of Pop must be in position 5.
11. **From Clue 9:** The fan of Pop is somewhere to the right of the fan of D&B. Since the fan of Pop is in position 5, the fan of D&B must be in position 4 or earlier.
12. **From Clue 18:** The fan of House is somewhere to the left of the fan of D&B. Since the fan of House is in position 6, the fan of D&B must be in position 5 or earlier.
13. **From Clue 19:** The fan of D&B is on the right of the fan of Trance. So, the fan of Trance must be in position 4 or earlier.
14. **From Clue 8:** The German is on the left or right of the fan of Classical. Since the fan of Classical is in position 7, the German can be in position 6 or 7. But since the Malaysian is in position 6, the German must be in position 7.
15. **From Clue 1:** The German is not the fan of D&B, so the German cannot be in position 5.
16. **From Clue 2:** The Japanese is not the fan of D&B, so the Japanese cannot be in position 5.
17. **From Clue 4:** The fan of House is on the left of the French. Since the fan of House is in position 6 and the French is in position 7, this is consistent.
18. **From Clue 5:** The French is somewhere to the left of the Thai. Since the French is in position 7, the Thai must be in position 8 or later. But there is no position 8, so the Thai must be in position 7, which contradicts our previous deductions. Therefore, the Thai must be in position 6.
19. **From Clue 6:** The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the French. Since the Japanese is in position 5 and the French is in position 7, this is consistent.
20. **From Clue 7:** The Australian is on the left of the Japanese. Since the Australian cannot be in position 5 or 7, the Australian must be in position 4.
21. **From Clue 13:** The fan of Hip-Hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of D&B. Since the fan of Hip-Hop is in position 4 and the fan of D&B must be in position 5 or earlier, this is consistent.

Lv6-2x7-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and constraints.

### Clues Recap:
1. The librarian is on the left or right of the Egyptian.
2. The architect is somewhere to the right of the Japanese.
3. The scientist is not the Japanese.
4. The scientist is not the Polish.
5. The Freelancer is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
6. The Canadian is on the far left or far right.
7. The Polish is on the left of the Accountant.
8. The Freelancer is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
9. The Polish is on the left or right of the Canadian.
10. The Scientist is somewhere to the right of the Japanese.
11. The American is somewhere to the right of the Colombian.
12. The Chinese is on the far right.
13. The Journalist is on the left of the Chinese.
14. The Journalist is on the left or right of the American.
15. The Scientist is on the far left or far right.
16. The Polish is somewhere to the right of the Canadian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 7 (Chinese) is on the far right.**
   - Chinese = 7

2. **Journalist is on the left of the Chinese.**
   - Journalist = 6

3. **The Journalist is on the left or right of the American.**
   - Since the Journalist is already at 6, the American must be at 5 or 6 (but 6 is taken).

4. **The American is somewhere to the right of the Colombian.**
   - The American cannot be at 5 (since it would conflict with the Journalist), so the American must be at 6 (but 6 is taken by the Journalist). Therefore, the American must be at 7, but that conflicts with the Chinese being at 7. Thus, the American must be at 5.
   - American = 5

5. **The Journalist is on the left of the American.**
   - Since the American is at 5, the Journalist must be at 4.

6. **The Freelancer is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).**
   - Since 5 is taken by the American, the Freelancer can only be at 1 or 3.

7. **The Polish is on the left of the Accountant.**
   - The Polish must be on the left of the Accountant.

8. **The Polish is on the left or right of the Canadian.**
   - Since the Canadian is on the far left or far right, the Polish could be at 1 or 7 if the Canadian is at 2, 3, 4, or 6. But since the Freelancer is in an odd position and the Polish is on the left of the Accountant, the Polish cannot be at 7 (because then there would be no room for the Accountant on the right side). So, the Polish is at 1 and the Canadian is at 2.
   - Polish = 1, Canadian = 2

9. **The Freelancer is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).**
   - Since 1 and 5 are taken, the Freelancer must be at 3.

10. **The Freelancer is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).**
    - Freelancer = 3

11. **The Scientist is on the far left or far right.**
    - Since 1 is taken by the Polish and 7 is taken by the Chinese, the Scientist must be at 2 or 6. But the Scientist cannot be at 6 because the Journalist is there. So, the Scientist is at 2.
    - Scientist = 2

12. **The Scientist is not the Japanese.**
    - Japanese cannot be at 2 (where the Scientist is).

13. **The Scientist is somewhere to the right of the Japanese.**
    - The Japanese must be at 1 or 3 (since 2 is taken by the Scientist and 4 is taken by the Freelancer).

14. **The Scientist is on the far left or far right.**
    - The Scientist is at 2, so the Japanese must be at 3.

15. **The Freelancer is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).**
    - Freelancer = 3 (confirmed)

16. **The Polish is somewhere to the right of the Canadian.**
    - Polish = 1, Canadian = 2 (confirmed)

17. **The American is somewhere to the right of the Colombian.**
    - American = 5, Colombian = 4 (confirmed)

18. **The librarian is on the left or right of the Egyptian.**
    - Librarian = 4, Egyptian = 6 (confirmed)

19. **The Architect is somewhere to the right of the Japanese.**
    - Architect = 7 (confirmed)

20. **The Journalist is on the left of the Chinese.**
    - Journalist = 6 (confirmed)

21. **The Freelancer is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).**
    - Freelancer = 3 (confirmed)

22. **The Polish is somewhere to the right of the Canadian.**
    - Polish = 1, Canadian = 2 (confirmed)

Now we need to fill in the remaining jobs:

- Remaining jobs: Accountant, Fisherman, Freelancer, Scientist, Journalist, American, Colombian, Chinese, Egyptian, Architect.
- Remaining positions: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7.

Given the constraints, we can assign the remaining jobs as follows:

- Position 1: Polish (already assigned)
- Position 2: Scientist (already assigned)
- Position 3: Freelancer (already assigned)
- Position 4: Journalist (already assigned)
- Position 5: American (already assigned)
- Position 6: Colombian (already assigned)
- Position 7: Chinese (already assigned)

So, the remaining job for position 1 is the Polish, which is already confirmed. The remaining job for position 3 is the Freelancer, which is already confirmed. The remaining job for position 5 is the American, which is already confirmed. The remaining job for position 6 is the Colombian, which is already confirmed. The remaining job for position 7 is the Chinese, which is already confirmed.

14. **Clue 15:** The person who's sport is snowboarding is between the person who's sport is cycling and the entrepreneur.
15. **Clue 16:** The dancer is on the left of the musician.

### Initial Setup:
We will start by placing the known positions and then fill in the rest based on the clues.

#### Known Positions:
- Position 5: Surfing (Clue 5)
- Positions 1 and 3 must be either electrician or handball (Clue 1 and Clue 2).

#### Placing the Electrician and Handball:
- Since the electrician is in an odd position (1 or 3) and the handball is also in an odd position (1 or 3), one must be at position 1 and the other at position 3. 

#### Placing the Dancer:
- The dancer is in an even position (2, 4, or 6) (Clue 12). Also, the dancer is on the left of the musician (Clue 16).

#### Placing the Entrepreneur:
- The entrepreneur is on the far left or far right (Clue 7). Also, the entrepreneur is to the left of the person who's sport is cycling (Clue 8). Therefore, the entrepreneur must be at position 1.

#### Placing the Person with Snowboarding:
- The person who's sport is snowboarding is between the person who's sport is cycling and the entrepreneur (Clue 14). Since the entrepreneur is at position 1, the snowboarding person must be at position 2.

#### Placing the Person with Cycling:
- The person who's sport is cycling is to the left of the software-developer (Clue 9). Since the snowboarding person is at position 2, the cycling person must be at position 3.

#### Placing the Person with Skateboarding:
- The person who's sport is skateboarding is to the left of the electrician (Clue 11). Since the electrician must be at position 3, the skateboarding person must be at position 2, but we already placed the snowboarding person there. So, the skateboarding person must be at position 4.

#### Placing the Person with Weightlifting:
- The person who's sport is weightlifting is not the software-developer (Clue 10) and must be somewhere to the right of the skateboarding person (Clue 3). Since the skateboarding person is at position 4, the weightlifting person must be at position 6.

#### Placing the Person with Handball:
- The person who's sport is handball is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since position 1 is taken by the entrepreneur and position 3 is taken by the electrician, the handball person must be at position 3, but that's already occupied. Therefore, the handball person must be at position 1.

#### Placing the Person with Dancer:
- The dancer is in an even position (2, 4, or 6) and on the left of the musician (Clue 16). Since position 2 is taken by the snowboarding person and position 4 by the skateboarding person, the dancer must be at position 6 and the musician at position 7.

#### Final Placement:
- Position 1: Entrepreneur (from Clue 7)
- Position 2: Snowboarding
- Position 3: Electrician
- Position 4: Skateboarding
- Position 5: Surfing
- Position 6: Dancer
- Position 7: Musician

Lv6-2x7-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each nationality and sport into the correct positions based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the information and solving step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is in the middle (position 4).
2. **Clue 2:** The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the Brazilian.
3. **Clue 3:** The Japanese is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
4. **Clue 4:** The Brazilian is not the person who's sport is weightlifting.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far right (position 7).
6. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who's sport is basketball is in an even position.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the Colombian.
10. **Clue 10:** The Colombian is somewhere to the left of the Turkish.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who's sport is rowing is between the Turkish and the American.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who's sport is lacrosse is not the American.
13. **Clue 13:** The American is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball.
14. **Clue 14:** The Colombian is not the person who's sport is weightlifting.
15. **Clue 15:** The person who's sport is rowing is not the German.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball.
17. **Clue 17:** The person who's sport is lacrosse is in an odd position.
18. **Clue 18:** The person who's sport is rowing is not the Turkish.
19. **Clue 19:** The person who's sport is snowboarding is not the Russian.
20. **Clue 20:** The Brazilian is on the right of the Japanese.
21. **Clue 21:** The American is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **Weightlifting is in position 4.**
2. **Snowboarding is in position 7.**
3. **Basketball must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6). Since weightlifting is in 4, it can only be in 2 or 6.**
4. **Japanese is to the left of the Brazilian and is also to the left or right of the weightlifter (position 4). So, Japanese cannot be in 4.**
5. **Brazilian is to the right of the Japanese and is not the weightlifter.**

Let's start filling in the table:

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Nationality   |         |          |           |              |          |            |             |
| Sport         |         | Basketball |          | Weightlifting |          |            | Snowboarding |

Since basketball is in an even position and weightlifting is in 4, basketball must be in 2. This means the Japanese is in 1 because they are to the left of the Brazilian and not in 4.

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Nationality   | Japanese | Basketball |          | Weightlifting |          |            | Snowboarding |
| Sport         |         |          |          |              |          |            |             |

Now, the Brazilian must be in 5 or 6 since they are to the right of the Japanese and not in 4. Since the Colombian is to the left of the Turkish, and the Colombian is not the weightlifter, the Colombian must be in 3 or 5. But since the Brazilian is to the right of the Japanese, the Colombian cannot be in 5. Therefore, the Colombian is in 3.

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Nationality   | Japanese | Basketball | Colombian | Weightlifting |          |            | Snowboarding |
| Sport         |         |          |          |              |          |            |             |

The Brazilian must be in 6 because the Colombian is in 3 and the Brazilian is to the right of the Japanese. Now, the Turkish must be in 5 because the Colombian is to the left of the Turkish.

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Nationality   | Japanese | Basketball | Colombian | Weightlifting | Turkish | Brazilian | Snowboarding |
| Sport         |         |          |          |              |          |            |             |

The American must be in 2 or 6, but since the Brazilian is in 6, the American must be in 2. The lacrosse player must be in 1 because they are in an odd position and not the American.

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Nationality   | American | Basketball | Colombian | Weightlifting | Turkish | Brazilian | Snowboarding |
| Sport         | Lacrosse|          |          |              |          |            |             |

The lacrosse player is not the American, so the lacrosse player must be in 1. The rower must be between the Turkish and the American, which means the rower is in 4.

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Nationality   | American | Basketball | Colombian | Rowing       | Turkish | Brazilian | Snowboarding |
| Sport         | Lacrosse|          |          |              |          |            |             |

The remaining sports are golf, parkour, and weightlifting. Parkour is to the left of golf and snowboarding, and lacrosse is not weightlifting, so:

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Nationality   | American | Lacrosse | Colombian | Rowing       | Turkish | Brazilian | Snowboarding |
| Sport         | Golf    | Parkour  |          | Weightlifting|          |            |             |

Finally, the remaining sports are parkour and golf. Parkour is to the left of golf, so:

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Nationality   | American | Lacrosse | Colombian | Weightlifting| Turkish | Brazilian | Snowboarding |
| Sport         | Golf    | Parkour  |          |              |          |            |             |

Thus, the final solution is:
