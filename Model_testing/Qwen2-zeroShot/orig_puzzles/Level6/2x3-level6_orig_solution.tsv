Lv6-2x3-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram.
2. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the person driving the scooter.
3. The person driving the train is not the person drinking sprite.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: Hot-Chocolate and Tram
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person driving the tram.
- This means that if we place ""Hot-Chocolate"" in column 1, ""Tram"" must be in column 3 (the rightmost column).

#### Clue 2: Sprite and Scooter
- The person drinking sprite is to the left of the person driving the scooter.
- This means that if we place ""Sprite"" in column 1 or 2, ""Scooter"" must be in column 2 or 3, respectively.

#### Clue 3: Train and Sprite
- The person driving the train is not the person drinking sprite.
- This means that the person drinking sprite cannot be the one driving the train.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given these constraints, let's try to fit the beverages and transports into the columns while satisfying all the conditions.

1. **Place Hot-Chocolate and Tram**:
   - If Hot-Chocolate is in column 1, Tram must be in column 3.
   - If Hot-Chocolate is in column 2, Tram must be in column 3.

2. **Place Sprite and Scooter**:
   - If Sprite is in column 1, Scooter must be in column 2 or 3.
   - If Sprite is in column 2, Scooter must be in column 3.

3. **Place Train and Sprite**:
   - The person driving the train cannot be the one drinking sprite.

Let's test the possible configurations:

#### Configuration 1:
- **Column 1**: Hot-Chocolate
- **Column 2**: Sprite
- **Column 3**: Tram

This configuration satisfies:
- Clue 1: Hot-Chocolate (Column 1) is to the left of Tram (Column 3).
- Clue 2: Sprite (Column 2) is to the left of Scooter (which would be in Column 3).
- Clue 3: The person driving the train (Tram) is not the person drinking Sprite.

So, this configuration works.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |       1       |   2    |    3    |
| Beverage    | Hot-Chocolate | Juice  | Sprite  |
| Transport   | Tram          | Train  | Scooter |
```

This is the only valid configuration that satisfies all the given clues."
Lv6-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement:

1. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person watching family movies.
2. The person eating corn is not the person watching thriller movies.
3. The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person eating mango.

We can start by placing the movie genres based on clue 1:
- Fantasy (F) must be to the left of Family (Fam).

Next, we use clue 3 to place the person eating mango and the person watching thriller movies:
- The person eating mango must be to the left of the person watching thriller movies.

Let's denote the movie genres as follows:
- F for Fantasy
- Fam for Family
- Thr for Thriller

Now, let's consider the possible positions for the movie genres based on the given clues:
1. Fantasy (F) must be on the left of Family (Fam).
2. Thriller (Thr) must be on the right of Mango (Mg).

This gives us two possible sequences for the movie genres:
1. Fantasy (F) - Family (Fam) - Thriller (Thr)
2. Fantasy (F) - Thriller (Thr) - Family (Fam)

However, clue 3 states that the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person eating mango. This means the second sequence is invalid because it would place the person eating mango to the left of the person watching thriller movies.

Thus, the only valid sequence for the movie genres is:
- Fantasy (F) - Family (Fam) - Thriller (Thr)

Now, we need to assign the foods to the people based on the movie genres and the given clues:
1. The person eating corn is not the one watching thriller movies.
2. The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person eating mango.

Given the sequence of movie genres, we can assign the foods as follows:
- The person eating mango must be to the left of the person watching thriller movies.
- Therefore, the person eating mango cannot be the one watching thriller movies.

Let's assign the foods step-by-step:
- Since the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person eating mango, the person eating mango must be in position 1 or 2.
- The person watching thriller movies must be in position 3.
- The person eating corn cannot be the one watching thriller movies, so they must be in position 1 or 2.

Given these constraints, the only logical assignment is:
- Person 1: Eating Mango (Mg), Watching Fantasy (F)
- Person 2: Eating Lime (Lm), Watching Family (Fam)
- Person 3: Eating Corn (Cr), Watching Thriller (Thr)

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |    1    |   2    |    3     |
| Food          | Mango  | Lime   | Corn    |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy| Family | Thriller|

Lv6-2x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given clues to fill out the table.

### Clues:
1. The person watching epic movies is not the fan of blues.
2. The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching epic movies and the fan of soul.
3. The fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies.
4. The fan of soul is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 4:
- The fan of soul is either in position 1 (far left) or position 3 (far right).

#### Clue 3:
- If the fan of soul is in position 1, then the person watching epic movies must be in position 2 (since they are to the left of the fan of soul).
- If the fan of soul is in position 3, then the person watching epic movies must be in position 2 (since they are to the left of the fan of soul).

#### Clue 2:
- The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching epic movies and the fan of soul.
- This means if the fan of soul is in position 1, the person watching epic movies must be in position 2, and the person watching mystery movies must be in position 3.
- If the fan of soul is in position 3, the person watching epic movies must be in position 2, and the person watching mystery movies must be in position 1.

#### Clue 1:
- The person watching epic movies is not the fan of blues.

### Possible Arrangements:

1. **Fan of Soul in Position 1:**
   - Epic movies in Position 2
   - Mystery movies in Position 3
   - Person in Position 1 cannot be the fan of blues (so it must be the fan of either hip-hop or soul, but since soul is already taken, it must be hip-hop)

2. **Fan of Soul in Position 3:**
   - Epic movies in Position 2
   - Mystery movies in Position 1
   - Person in Position 3 cannot be the fan of blues (so it must be the fan of either hip-hop or soul, but since soul is already taken, it must be hip-hop)

### Final Solution:
Since both scenarios fit all the clues, we need to determine which one fits better with the constraints. Given that the fan of soul is on the far left or far right, let's finalize with the arrangement where the fan of soul is in position 1:

```
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Hip-Hop | Epic    | Mystery  |
| Music-Genre   | Soul    | Blues   | Hip-Hop  |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues:
- The person watching epic movies (Epic) is not the fan of blues.
- The person watching mystery movies (Mystery) is between the person watching epic movies (Epic) and the fan of soul (Soul).
- The fan of soul (Soul) is to the right of the person watching epic movies (Epic).
- The fan of soul (Soul) is on the far left.

```plaintext
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Hip-Hop | Epic    | Mystery  |
| Music-Genre   | Soul    | Blues   | Hip-Hop  |

Lv6-2x3-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The fan of reggae is not the polish.
2. The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the fan of reggae.
3. The Argentine is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The fan of reggae is not the polish.
This means the Polish person cannot be a fan of reggae.

#### Clue 2: The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the fan of reggae.
This means if the fan of reggae is in position 1 or 2, then the fan of dubstep must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 3: The Argentine is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep.
This means if the fan of dubstep is in position 2, then the Argentine must be in position 3. If the fan of dubstep is in position 3, then the Argentine can be in position 3 (but this would conflict with clue 2).

### Possible Arrangements:

Given these clues, let's try to place the fans and nationalities:

1. **Fan of Reggae (R)**
2. **Fan of Dubstep (D)**
3. **Argentine (A)**
4. **Mexican (M)**
5. **Polish (P)**

From Clue 2, if R is in position 1, D must be in position 2 or 3. From Clue 3, A must be in position 3 if D is in position 2. Let's explore these possibilities:

- If R is in position 1:
  - D must be in position 2 (since D is to the right of R).
  - A must be in position 3 (since A is to the right of D).
  - This leaves M and P for positions 4 and 5.

Since the fan of reggae is not Polish (Clue 1), P cannot be in position 1. Therefore, P must be in position 4 or 5.

- If R is in position 2:
  - D must be in position 3 (since D is to the right of R).
  - A must be in position 4 or 5 (since A is to the right of D).
  - This leaves M and P for positions 1 and 2.

Again, since the fan of reggae is not Polish (Clue 1), P cannot be in position 2. Therefore, P must be in position 4 or 5.

### Final Arrangement:

Let's test the arrangement where R is in position 1, D is in position 2, A is in position 3, and see if it fits all the clues:

- **Position 1:** Reggae (R)
- **Position 2:** Dubstep (D)
- **Position 3:** Argentine (A)
- **Position 4:** Mexican (M)
- **Position 5:** Polish (P)

Checking the clues:
1. The fan of reggae (R) is not the Polish (P). ✔️
2. The fan of dubstep (D) is to the right of the fan of reggae (R). ✔️
3. The Argentine (A) is to the right of the fan of dubstep (D). ✔️

All clues are satisfied. Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1    |    2    |     3     |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae  | Dubstep | Argentine |
| Nationality   | Mexican |         | Polish    |

Lv6-2x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and use them step-by-step to determine the correct placements for beverages and foods.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
2. The person drinking 7up is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person eating asparagus.
3. The person drinking 7up is not the person eating banana.
4. The person drinking almond-milk is not the person eating raspberry.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - This means 7up must be in position 1 or 2 (since iced-tea cannot be in position 1).

2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking 7up is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person eating asparagus.
   - This means the order must be: iced-tea -> 7up -> asparagus.

3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking 7up is not the person eating banana.
   - Therefore, the person drinking 7up must be eating either asparagus or raspberry.

4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking almond-milk is not the person eating raspberry.
   - Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be eating either asparagus or banana.

### Analyzing the Order:

From Clue 2, we have the order: iced-tea -> 7up -> asparagus.
- Since 7up is in position 2, iced-tea must be in position 3, and asparagus must be in position 1.

So, the beverage positions are:
- Position 1: iced-tea
- Position 2: 7up
- Position 3: asparagus

### Determining Foods:

From Clue 3, since 7up is in position 2, the person eating asparagus is in position 3.
- Therefore, the person drinking 7up cannot be eating asparagus (as per Clue 2), so they must be eating raspberry.

From Clue 4, the person drinking almond-milk cannot be eating raspberry, so they must be eating banana.

### Final Table:

|            |      1      |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage   | iced-tea    |    7up    |  asparagus|
| Food       | raspberry   |   banana  |  asparagus|

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |      1      |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage   | iced-tea    |    7up    |  asparagus|
| Food       | raspberry   |   banana  |  asparagus|

Lv6-2x3-6	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the correct placement of hobbies and music genres.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the fan punk.
2. The fan punk is the fan punk (redundant information).
3. The person who's hobby is traveling is not the fan disco.
4. The person who's hobby is video-games is between the fan indie and the fan disco.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the fan punk.
   - This means that if someone's hobby is traveling, they must be in position 1 or 2, and the fan punk must be in position 2 or 3.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is traveling is not the fan disco.
   - This means the person with the hobby of traveling cannot be the one who listens to disco.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is video-games is between the fan indie and the fan disco.
   - This means the person with the hobby of video-games must be in the middle (position 2), and the fan indie and the fan disco must be in positions 1 and 3 or 3 and 1 respectively.

Given these clues, let's place the hobbies and music genres:

- Since the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 2, the fan indie and the fan disco must be in positions 1 and 3 or 3 and 1.
- The person with the hobby of traveling must be in position 1 or 2, but since the fan punk cannot be in position 2 (as it would violate Clue 1), the person with the hobby of traveling must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the fan punk must be in position 3.
- The remaining position (2) is for the person with the hobby of video-games.
- Now, we need to assign the music genres such that the person with the hobby of video-games is between the fan indie and the fan disco.

### Possible Assignments:
- Position 1: Traveling (not fan disco)
- Position 2: Video-games
- Position 3: Fan punk

Since the person with the hobby of traveling is not the fan disco, they can be either the fan indie or the fan punk. However, the fan punk is in position 3, so the person with the hobby of traveling must be the fan indie.

Thus, the person with the hobby of video-games must be the fan disco.

### Final Assignment:
- Position 1: Traveling (fan indie)
- Position 2: Video-games (fan disco)
- Position 3: Fan punk

### Music Genres:
- The fan indie (traveling) cannot be the fan disco, so they could be the fan indie or fan punk. Given the positioning, the fan indie is likely the fan indie.
- The fan disco (video-games) could be the fan disco or fan punk. Given the positioning, the fan disco is likely the fan punk.
- The fan punk (traveling) is the only one left, so they must be the fan punk.

### Final Table:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |      3      |
| Hobby         | Traveling | Video-games | Fan punk    |
| Music-Genre   | Fan indie | Fan punk    | Fan disco   |

Lv6-2x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and systematically place the information into the table.

### Clues:
1. The Nigerian is not eating eggplant.
2. The person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the right of the Nigerian.
3. The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the French.

### Initial Setup:

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
|---------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Food          |          |            |             |
| Nationality   |          |            |             |

### Analyzing Clues:

1. **The Nigerian is not eating eggplant**:
   - This means the Nigerian can eat either cauliflower or strawberry.

2. **The person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the right of the Nigerian**:
   - This means if the Nigerian is in position 1, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the Nigerian is in position 2, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 3.
   - If the Nigerian is in position 3, there is no room for someone to be to the right.

3. **The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the French**:
   - This means if the French is in position 1, the strawberry eater must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the French is in position 2, the strawberry eater must be in position 3.
   - If the French is in position 3, there is no room for someone to be to the right.

### Logical Deduction:

- Let's start by placing the French first. We'll try different positions for the French and see if it fits all the clues.

#### Case 1: French in Position 1
- If French is in Position 1, the strawberry eater must be in Position 2 or 3.
- If strawberry is in Position 2, then the only option left for the Nigerian is Position 3 (since the Nigerian cannot be eating eggplant).
- This would make the person in Position 3 the one eating cauliflower, which contradicts clue 2 (the person eating cauliflower must be to the right of the Nigerian).

So, French cannot be in Position 1.

#### Case 2: French in Position 2
- If French is in Position 2, the strawberry eater must be in Position 3.
- The Nigerian cannot be in Position 2 (because the strawberry eater is in Position 3), so the Nigerian must be in Position 1.
- The person eating cauliflower must be in Position 3, as per clue 2 (the person eating cauliflower is to the right of the Nigerian).

This setup fits all the clues:
- The Nigerian is in Position 1, not eating eggplant.
- The person eating cauliflower (Position 3) is to the right of the Nigerian (Position 1).
- The French is in Position 2, and the strawberry eater (Position 3) is to the right of the French.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
|---------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Food          | Strawberry| Cauliflower| Eggplant    |
| Nationality   | Nigerian  | French     | Thai        |
```

Each nationality and food type fits the given clues perfectly."
Lv6-2x3-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the correct beverage and movie genre for each position (1, 2, 3). Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching musical movies is not the person drinking mirinda.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking mirinda is on the far left.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- The person drinking mirinda is on the far left (Position 1).

So, we have:
```
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda |         |          |
| Movie-Genre   |         |         |          |
```

#### Clue 1:
- The person watching musical movies is not the person drinking mirinda.

Since Position 1 is occupied by Mirinda, the person watching musical movies cannot be in Position 1. Therefore, the person watching musical movies must be either in Position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 3:
- The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.

This means the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in Position 1. Since Position 1 is already occupied by Mirinda, the person drinking iced-tea can only be in Position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 4:
- The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.

This means the person drinking sprite cannot be in Position 3. Since Position 3 is the rightmost position, the person drinking sprite can only be in Position 1 or 2.

Given that Position 1 is already occupied by Mirinda, the person drinking sprite must be in Position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda | Sprite  |          |
| Movie-Genre   |         |         |          |
```

#### Determining the Remaining Positions:
- Since the person drinking sprite is in Position 2, the person watching family movies must be in Position 3 (because the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person watching family movies).
- This leaves Position 3 as the only remaining spot for the person watching family movies and the person drinking iced-tea.

Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea must be in Position 3, and the person watching action movies must be in Position 1 (since the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person watching action movies).

So, we have:
```
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda | Sprite  | Iced-tea |
| Movie-Genre   | Action  | Family  | Musical  |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda | Sprite  | Iced-tea |
| Movie-Genre   | Action  | Family  | Musical  |

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.
2. The person who's hobby is singing is not the person watching adventure movies.
3. The person who's hobby is collecting is the person watching romance movies.
4. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person with the hobby of collecting is on the far right (position 3).
   - This means the person in position 3 has the hobby of collecting and is watching romance movies (from Clue 3).

2. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is collecting is watching romance movies.
   - We already know this from Clue 4.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.
   - Since the person with the hobby of collecting is in position 3, the person watching scientific movies must be either in position 1 or 2.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is singing is not the person watching adventure movies.
   - This clue doesn't directly help us place the hobbies yet but will be useful for elimination.

5. **Positioning the remaining hobbies**:
   - Since the person with the hobby of collecting is in position 3 and watching romance movies, the only other positions (1 and 2) can be filled with the remaining hobbies (chess and singing) and movies (adventure and scientific).

Given that the person with the hobby of collecting is in position 3 and watching romance movies, let's place the other two people:

- If the person in position 1 is watching scientific movies, then the person in position 2 must have the hobby of singing and be watching adventure movies (since the person with the hobby of singing cannot watch adventure movies according to Clue 2).

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1     |     2      |     3      |

Lv6-2x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.**
2. **The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is snowboarding.**
3. **The person whose sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade.**
4. **The person drinking coffee is not the person whose sport is cycling.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Soy-Milk and Lemonade
From Clue 1:
- Soy-milk (S) is on the left of lemonade (L).

From Clue 2:
- Soy-milk (S) is to the right of snowboarding (SB).

This means that the sequence must be:
- SB -> S -> L

#### Step 2: Positioning Cycling
From Clue 3:
- Cycling (C) is to the left of lemonade (L).

Given the sequence from Clue 1 and 2, we can place cycling (C) in the middle position:
- SB -> C -> L

#### Step 3: Assigning Beverages and Sports
From Clue 4:
- The person drinking coffee (Co) is not the one doing cycling (C).

Since the sequence is:
- SB -> C -> L

We need to assign the sports and beverages accordingly:
- SB -> C -> L

- From Clue 4, since the person doing cycling is not drinking coffee, the person drinking coffee must be either doing snowboarding or badminton.
- Since the person doing snowboarding is on the left of soy-milk, the person doing snowboarding cannot be drinking coffee.

Thus, the person doing badminton must be drinking coffee.

So, we have:
- SB -> Badminton (Co) -> C -> L

Now, we need to assign the remaining sports and beverages:
- SB -> Badminton (Co) -> C -> L

- The only beverage left for snowboarding is soy-milk.
- The only beverage left for badminton is lemonade.

Thus, we have:
- SB -> Soy-milk (S) -> Badminton (Co) -> Lemonade (L)

Finally, the person doing snowboarding (SB) must be doing snowboarding.

### Final Solution Table:

```
