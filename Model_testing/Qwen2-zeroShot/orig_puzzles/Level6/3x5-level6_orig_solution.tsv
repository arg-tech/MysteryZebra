16. The owner of the bird is on the left of the person eating blueberry.
17. The paramedic is not the owner of the bird.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Owner of Rat (Blueberry)**: From clue 2, we know that the person who owns the rat is eating blueberry.
2. **Owner of Ferret**: From clue 3, the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the paramedic. From clue 1, the owner of the ferret is not the security guard. Let's denote the owner of the ferret as F.
3. **Owner of Bird**: From clue 6, the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the rat is eating blueberry, the owner of the bird must be eating something other than blueberry. Also, from clue 12, the owner of the bird is between the person eating peach and the person eating blueberry. So, the bird owner must be eating peach (since the rat owner eats blueberry).
4. **Owner of Hamster**: From clue 7, the owner of the bird (eating peach) is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hamster. Therefore, the owner of the hamster must be eating something other than peach and blueberry.
5. **Owner of Grapefruit**: From clue 8, the person eating grapefruit is between the person eating orange and the architect. From clue 9, the person eating orange is somewhere to the right of the architect. Therefore, the person eating grapefruit must be between the architect and the person eating orange.
6. **Owner of Orange**: From clue 10, the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the dancer. From clue 11, the architect is somewhere to the right of the dancer. From clue 15, the person eating orange is somewhere to the right of the lawyer. Therefore, the owner of the orange must be the lawyer.
7. **Owner of Peach**: From clue 12, the owner of the bird (eating peach) is between the person eating peach and the person eating blueberry. Therefore, the person eating peach is the owner of the bird.
8. **Owner of Security Guard**: From clue 14, the owner of the bird is not the security guard. Therefore, the security guard must be the person who is not the owner of the bird.
9. **Owner of Paramedic**: From clue 3, the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the paramedic. From clue 13, the person eating grapefruit is on the left of the person eating orange. Therefore, the paramedic must be the person eating orange.
10. **Owner of Architect**: From clue 8, the person eating grapefruit is between the person eating orange (architect) and the architect. Therefore, the architect must be the owner of the grapefruit.
11. **Owner of Lawyer**: From clue 15, the person eating orange (lawyer) is somewhere to the right of the lawyer. Therefore, the lawyer must be the owner of the orange.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 12:** The librarian is the owner of the pony.
   - Position 1: Food - Pony (Librarian)

2. **Clue 13:** The owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat.
   - Since the librarian owns the pony, they must be in an odd position.
   - Therefore, the librarian must be in position 1 or 3 (since 5 would mean the cat is to the left, which contradicts the clue).

3. **Clue 14:** The person eating kale is on the left of the person eating eggplant.
   - This means the person eating eggplant must be in a position to the right of the person eating kale.

4. **Clue 15:** The person eating garlic is somewhere to the left of the person eating eggplant.
   - This means the person eating garlic must be in a position to the left of the person eating eggplant.

5. **Clue 5:** The person eating lemon is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
   - This means the person eating lemon must be adjacent to the owner of the hamster.

Lv6-3x5-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

1. **Hobbies:**
   - Traveling is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies.
   - Gardening is on the far right.
   - Cooking is on the left of the person with the guinea-pig.
   - Gardening is either on the far left or far right (but since it's already on the far right, it must be on the far right).

2. **Movie-Genres:**
   - Horror is not the person who's hobby is cooking.
   - Satire is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies.
   - Romance is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling.
   - Animation and Satire are adjacent.

3. **Pets:**
   - Guinea-pig is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.
   - Hamster is on the left of the fish.
   - Cat is between the guinea-pig and the hamster.
   - Rabbit is owned by the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

Now, let's place these constraints into the table and fill in the blanks:

|               |       1       |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5     |
| Hobby         |               |            |         |           | gardening |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |         |           |           |
| Pet           |               |            |         |           |           |

### Step-by-step placement:

1. **Gardening is on the far right:**
   - \(5\) = gardening

2. **Person with the guinea-pig is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking:**
   - Let's assume \(2\) = guinea-pig, then \(5\) = cooking (since \(5\) is already gardening)

3. **Hamster is on the left of the fish:**
   - Since \(2\) = guinea-pig, \(1\) can't be hamster or fish. Let's assume \(3\) = hamster, then \(4\) = fish.

4. **Cat is between the guinea-pig and the hamster:**
   - So, \(2\) = guinea-pig, \(3\) = hamster, \(1\) = cat.

5. **Rabbit is owned by the person who's hobby is rock-climbing:**
   - The only remaining position for the rabbit is \(1\), so \(1\) = rabbit, and the hobby for \(1\) is rock-climbing.

6. **Owner of the fish (4) is watching musical movies:**
   - So, \(4\) = fish, and the movie genre for \(4\) is musical.

7. **Owner of the guinea-pig (2) is watching horror movies:**
   - So, \(2\) = guinea-pig, and the movie genre for \(2\) is horror.

8. **Owner of the hamster (3) is watching satire movies:**
   - So, \(3\) = hamster, and the movie genre for \(3\) is satire.

9. **Owner of the cat (1) is watching animation movies:**
