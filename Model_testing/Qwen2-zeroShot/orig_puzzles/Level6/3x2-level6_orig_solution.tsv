Lv6-3x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the correct assignment of jobs, movie genres, and pets based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues:
1. The project-manager is not the person watching musical movies.
2. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the ferret.

### Possible Assignments:
- **Jobs:** Project-Manager (PM), Teacher (T)
- **Movie-Genres:** Crime (C), Musical (M)
- **Pets:** Bird (B), Ferret (F)

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 1: The project-manager is not the person watching musical movies.
- This means the person who watches musical movies cannot be the project-manager.

#### Clue 2: The person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the ferret.
- This implies that if one person has the ferret, the person next to them (on the right) must be watching musical movies.

### Possible Arrangements:
Let's consider the possible arrangements for the jobs, movie genres, and pets:

1. **Job 1 (Left):**
   - If Job 1 is the project-manager, then Job 2 must be the teacher.
   - If Job 1 is the teacher, then Job 2 must be the project-manager.

2. **Movie-Genres:**
   - If Job 1 is watching crime, then Job 2 must be watching musical.
   - If Job 1 is watching musical, then Job 2 must be watching crime.

3. **Pets:**
   - If Job 1 has the ferret, then Job 2 must be watching musical.
   - If Job 1 has the bird, then Job 2 can have either pet.

Given these constraints, let's test the scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Job 1 (Left) = Project-Manager, Job 2 (Right) = Teacher
- The project-manager cannot watch musical movies.
- Therefore, the teacher must watch musical movies.
- According to Clue 2, the teacher (right) must be on the right of the ferret owner.
- Thus, the teacher must have the ferret, and the project-manager must have the bird.

This scenario satisfies all the clues:
- Project-Manager (Job 1) does not watch musical movies.
- Teacher (Job 2) watches musical movies and has the ferret.
- The person watching musical movies (Teacher) is on the right of the ferret owner (Teacher).

#### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |
| Movie-Genre   |         Crime   |   Musical  |
| Pet           |          Bird   |    Ferret  |
```

### Final Solution:
```
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |
| Movie-Genre   |         Crime   |   Musical  |
| Pet           |          Bird   |    Ferret  |

Lv6-3x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information into the table step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is baking is not the person eating pumpkin.
2. The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies.

### Table Setup:

|               |    1    |     2      |
|-------------- |-------- |----------- |
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: The person who's hobby is baking is not the person eating pumpkin.
This means that if someone's hobby is baking, they cannot be eating pumpkin. Therefore, the person with hobby 1 (which must be baking) cannot eat pumpkin, and the person with hobby 2 (which must be card-games) can eat pumpkin.

#### Clue 2: The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
This means that the person with hobby 1 (baking) must be in position 1, and the person with hobby 2 (card-games) must be in position 2. This also implies that the person with hobby 1 (baking) must be watching disaster movies.

Given these constraints, we can fill in the table as follows:

1. Since the person with hobby 1 (baking) is in position 1, they must be watching disaster movies.
2. Since the person with hobby 2 (card-games) is in position 2, they must be watching musical movies.
3. Since the person with hobby 1 (baking) is not eating pumpkin, the person with hobby 2 (card-games) must be eating pumpkin.
4. The remaining food, pepper, must be eaten by the person with hobby 1 (baking).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |     2      |
|-------------- |-------- |----------- |
| Food          | Pepper  | Pumpkin    |
| Hobby         | Baking  | Card-Games |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster| Musical    |
```

This satisfies all the given clues."
Lv6-3x2-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the van is not the person drinking water.
2. The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Identify the Beverages and Jobs
We have two beverages (cola, water) and two jobs (journalist, social-worker).

#### Step 2: Identify the Transport Options
We have two transport options (motorbike, van).

#### Step 3: Analyze the Clues
1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the van is not the one drinking water.
2. **Clue 2:** The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.

Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), we can infer that:
- If someone is in position 1, they must be to the left of the person in position 2.
- Therefore, if the social-worker is in position 1, the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

Let's place these in the table initially based on the second clue:

|             |       1       |     2      |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Beverage    | Water         | Cola       |
| Job         | Social-worker | Journalist |
| Transport   | Motorbike     | Van        |

Now, we need to check if this placement satisfies all clues.

#### Step 4: Check Clue 1
- According to our initial placement, the person in position 2 (drinking cola) is using a van.
- This matches Clue 1 because the person driving the van (in position 2) is not drinking water (in position 1).

This placement satisfies both clues. Therefore, the final solution is:

```
|             |       1       |     2      |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Beverage    | Water         | Cola       |
| Job         | Social-worker | Journalist |
| Transport   | Motorbike     | Van        |

Lv6-3x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and systematically deduce the correct assignments for each category (Hobby, Job, Pet).

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is gardening is not the owner of the hamster.
2. The owner of the hamster is on the right of the scientist.

### Initial Setup:

|         |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby   |           |             |
| Job     |           |             |
| Pet     |           |             |

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 1: The person who's hobby is gardening is not the owner of the hamster.
This means that if someone has gardening as their hobby, they cannot own the hamster.

#### Clue 2: The owner of the hamster is on the right of the scientist.
This implies that the person with the hamster as a pet must be in position 2, and the scientist must also be in position 2.

Given this information, we can place the scientist and the hamster in position 2:

|         |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby   |           | Gardening   |
| Job     |           | Scientist   |
| Pet     | Hamster   |             |

Since the owner of the hamster is in position 2, and the scientist is also in position 2, the person in position 1 cannot be the scientist. Therefore, the person in position 1 must be the one with the board-game hobby.

Now, since the person with gardening as a hobby cannot own the hamster, the person in position 1 must own the hamster.

|         |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby   | Board-Games | Gardening   |
| Job     |           | Scientist   |
| Pet     | Hamster   |             |

Since the person in position 1 owns the hamster, the person in position 2 cannot own the hamster. Thus, the person in position 2 must own the mouse.

|         |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby   | Board-Games | Gardening   |
| Job     | Dressmaker  | Scientist   |
| Pet     | Hamster    | Mouse       |

### Final Solution:

```plaintext
#############
| Hobby     | Board-Games | Gardening   |
| Job       | Dressmaker  | Scientist   |
| Pet       | Hamster    | Mouse       |

```

This configuration satisfies all the given clues."
Lv6-3x2-5	"Let's analyze the given conditions and place the information into the table step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1**: The person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is rowing.
2. **Condition 2**: The person eating pomegranate is not the person whose sport is rowing.

Given:
- There are two different types of food: pomegranate and pumpkin.
- There are two different movie genres: horror and superhero.
- There are two different sports: basketball and rowing.

We need to place these elements in the table while satisfying both conditions.

### Initial Setup:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   |             |           |
| Sport         |             |           |
```

### Applying Conditions:

1. **Condition 1**: The person watching horror movies is to the left of the person whose sport is rowing.
    - This means if someone watches horror in position 1, the person with rowing must be in position 2 for that same column.

2. **Condition 2**: The person eating pomegranate is not the person whose sport is rowing.
    - This means if someone eats pomegranate in position 1 or 2, the person with rowing cannot be in the same position.

Let's start placing the elements based on these conditions.

### Step 1: Place Horror and Superhero
Since the horror movie watcher must be to the left of the rowing sporter, we can start by placing them:

- If horror is in position 1, then rowing must be in position 2.
- If horror is in position 2, then rowing must be in position 1.

Let's try placing horror in position 1 and rowing in position 2 (we'll check if this works):

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror      | Superhero |
| Sport         | Rowing      | Basketball|
```

### Step 2: Place Pomegranate and Pumpkin
Now, let's place the foods. We know that the person eating pomegranate cannot be the one doing rowing.

- If rowing is in position 2, the person eating pomegranate cannot be in position 2.
- Therefore, pomegranate must be in position 1, and pumpkin in position 2.

So, we have:

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          | Pomegranate | Pumpkin   |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror      | Superhero |
| Sport         | Rowing      | Basketball|
```

### Verify Conditions:
1. **Condition 1**: The person watching horror movies (position 1) is to the left of the person whose sport is rowing (position 2). This condition is satisfied.
2. **Condition 2**: The person eating pomegranate (position 1) is not the person whose sport is rowing (position 2). This condition is also satisfied.

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          | Pomegranate | Pumpkin   |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror      | Superhero |
| Sport         | Rowing      | Basketball|

Lv6-3x2-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The Brazilian is on the right of the person driving the ship.
2. The fan of funk is not the person driving the trike.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions:**
   - We have two columns (1 and 2) and three rows (Music-Genre, Nationality, Transport).

2. **Clue 1 Analysis:**
   - The Brazilian is on the right of the person driving the ship.
   - This means if the person driving the ship is in position 1, then the Brazilian must be in position 2.
   - If the person driving the ship is in position 2, then the Brazilian cannot be in position 1 (since they would be next to each other, but we need to fit all conditions).

3. **Clue 2 Analysis:**
   - The fan of funk is not the person driving the trike.
   - This means if someone is a fan of funk, they cannot be driving the trike.

4. **Possible Assignments:**

#### Let's assume the person driving the ship is in position 1:
- If the person driving the ship is in position 1, then the Brazilian must be in position 2.

#### Now let's consider the fans of music-genre:
- The fans of funk and indie can be assigned to either position 1 or 2 in the music genre column.

#### Let's try assigning the fans:
- Assume the person in position 1 is a fan of funk.
- Then the person in position 2 must be a fan of indie (since there are only two genres and one of them must be in each position).

#### Now, let's assign the nationalities:
- Since the Brazilian is in position 2, the Nigerian must be in position 1.

#### Finally, let's assign the transports:
- The person driving the ship (position 1) cannot be a fan of funk (Clue 2).
- Therefore, the person driving the ship must be a fan of indie.
- The person in position 2 (Brazilian) must be driving the trike.

So, the final arrangement should be:

|               |    1     |     2     |
| Music-Genre   |  Indie   |  Funk     |
| Nationality   |  Nigerian|  Brazilian|
| Transport     |  Ship    |  Trike    |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Music-Genre   |  Indie   |  Funk     |
| Nationality   |  Nigerian|  Brazilian|
| Transport     |  Ship    |  Trike    |

Lv6-3x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the given information into the provided table and ensure all conditions are met.

Let's start by summarizing the given information:

1. There are two types of food: broccoli and lemon.
2. There are two nationalities: Australian and Polish.
3. There are two means of transport: jet-ski and scooter.
4. The person driving the scooter is not the person eating broccoli.
5. The person driving the scooter is to the left of the Australian.

Given these constraints, let's construct the table step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions for the nationalities and transport:**
   - Since the person driving the scooter must be to the left of the Australian, the scooter cannot be in position 2 (since there is no position to the left of it). Therefore, the scooter must be in position 1.
   - This leaves the jet-ski in position 2.

2. **Determine the nationality of the person using the scooter:**
   - The person using the scooter cannot be the one eating broccoli (from condition 4).
   - Therefore, the person using the scooter must be eating lemon.

3. **Determine the nationality of the person using the jet-ski:**
   - The person using the jet-ski must be the Australian (from condition 5).

Now we can fill in the table:

|               |    1    |     2      |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Food          | Lemon   | Broccoli   |
| Nationality   | Polish  | Australian |
| Transport     | Scooter| Jet-ski    |

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:
- The person driving the scooter (position 1) is eating lemon (not broccoli).
- The person driving the scooter (position 1) is to the left of the Australian (position 2).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |     2      |

Lv6-3x2-8	"Let's break down the given clues and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking iced-tea is not the fan of rock.
2. The fan of rock is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is lacrosse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: 
- If the person drinking iced-tea is not the fan of rock, then the fan of rock must be drinking cola (since there are only two beverages: cola and iced-tea).

#### Clue 2: 
- The fan of rock is to the left of the person whose sport is lacrosse. This means the fan of rock cannot be in the rightmost column (column 2) if the person with lacrosse is in the rightmost column (column 2). Therefore, the fan of rock must be in column 1, and the person with lacrosse must be in column 2.

Given these deductions, we can fill in the table as follows:

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |   Cola   |   Iced-tea |

Lv6-3x2-9	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

We have:
- Beverages: Fanta, Water
- Foods: Avocado, Zucchini
- Transport: Motorbike, Roller

Given clues:
1. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the person drinking water.
2. The person eating zucchini is not the person driving the roller.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Beverage, Food, Transport
- Position 2: Beverage, Food, Transport

From clue 1, we know that the person eating zucchini must be in position 2 because the person drinking water must be in position 1 (since the person eating zucchini is to the right of the person drinking water).

From clue 2, since the person eating zucchini cannot be the one driving the roller, the person driving the roller must be in position 1.

So, we can deduce:
- Position 1: Beverage, Food, Transport = Water, ___, Roller
- Position 2: Beverage, Food, Transport = Fanta, Zucchini, ____

Now, we need to determine what goes in the remaining slots for each position:

Since the only beverage left for position 1 is Water and it's already used there, the remaining beverage for position 2 must be Fanta.

For the foods, we have Avocado and Zucchini. Since Zucchini is in position 2, Avocado must be in position 1.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Beverage, Food, Transport = Water, Avocado, Roller
- Position 2: Beverage, Food, Transport = Fanta, Zucchini, ____

The only transport left for position 2 is Motorbike.

So, the final solution is:

```
|             |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage    | Water   | Fanta     |

Lv6-3x2-10	"Let's break down the puzzle and solve it step by step.

### Given Information:
1. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: r&b, rock.
2. 2 different pets are kept: rabbit, snake.
3. 2 different types of sport are preferred: climbing, cricket.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the rabbit is not the fan of r&b.
2. The person who prefers cricket is to the right of the owner of the rabbit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the possible combinations for music-genres, pets, and sports.
Since there are only two rows and three categories (music-genre, pet, sport), each category must be assigned to one row.

#### Step 2: Use clue 1.
- The owner of the rabbit does not like r&b.
- Therefore, the owner of the rabbit can either like rock or not have any preference (but we will assume they have a preference).

#### Step 3: Use clue 2.
- The person who prefers cricket is to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
- This means the owner of the rabbit cannot be in the second column because there is no ""right"" column.

### Possible Assignments:
Let's denote:
- Row 1: \( R_1 \)
- Row 2: \( R_2 \)

#### Possibility 1:
- \( R_1 \) has the rabbit.
- \( R_2 \) has the other pet (snake).
- \( R_1 \)'s music genre is rock (since the rabbit owner doesn't like r&b).
- \( R_2 \)'s music genre is r&b.
- Since the owner of the rabbit is in the first column, the person who prefers cricket must be in the second column (because the cricket preference is to the right of the rabbit owner).

This gives us:
- \( R_1 \): Rabbit, Rock, ?
- \( R_2 \): Snake, r&b, Cricket

We need to assign the remaining sport (climbing) to the first column of \( R_2 \):
- \( R_1 \): Rabbit, Rock, Climbing
- \( R_2 \): Snake, r&b, Cricket

This satisfies all the clues.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   |    Rock  |    r&b  |
| Pet           |    Rabbit|    Snake|
| Sport         |    Climbing| Cricket|
