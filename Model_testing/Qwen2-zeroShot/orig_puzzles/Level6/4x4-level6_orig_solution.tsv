Lv6-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis

1. **Clue 7:** The fan disco is the person drinking cola.
2. **Clue 8:** The person drinking cola is between the Italian and the person eating apple.
3. **Clue 13:** The person drinking milk is the fan house.

From Clue 13, we can place the fan house (drinking milk) in either position 1 or 3 (since it must be in an odd position).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Clue 7:** Fan disco (drinking cola) is in one of the positions.
2. **Clue 8:** The person drinking cola (fan disco) is between the Italian and the person eating apple.
3. **Clue 13:** The person drinking milk (fan house) is in position 1 or 3.

Let's try placing the fan house (milk) in position 1:
- Position 1: Milk (fan house)
- Position 2: Not milk (fan house), so it could be any other beverage.

Since the person drinking cola (fan disco) is between the Italian and the person eating apple, let's place these accordingly.

### Trying Position 1 for Milk (fan house)

- Position 1: Milk (fan house)
- Position 2: Not milk (fan house)
- Position 3: Not milk (fan house)
- Position 4: Not milk (fan house)

Now, let's use Clue 7:
- Position 1: Milk (fan house)
- Position 2: Not milk (fan house)
- Position 3: Fan disco (drinking cola)
- Position 4: Not fan disco (drinking cola)

Using Clue 8:
- The person drinking cola (fan disco) is between the Italian and the person eating apple.
- Therefore, the Italian and the person eating apple must be in positions 2 and 4.

Let's try:
- Position 2: Italian
- Position 4: Person eating apple

Using Clue 1:
- The fan house is on the left of the person eating asparagus.
- Since position 1 is the fan house, the person eating asparagus must be in position 2 or 3.
- But position 2 is already occupied by the Italian, so the person eating asparagus must be in position 3.

Using Clue 3:
- The person drinking cola is not the Egyptian.
- So, the Egyptian must be in position 4 (the only remaining position for the Egyptian).

Using Clue 4:
- The fan hip-hop is on the left or right of the fan funk.
- Since the fan disco (drinking cola) is in position 3, the fan funk and fan hip-hop must be in positions 2 and 4 or 1 and 2.

Using Clue 5:
- The person eating corn is somewhere to the right of the fan house.
- Since the fan house is in position 1, the person eating corn must be in position 3 or 4.
- But position 3 is already taken by the person eating asparagus, so the person eating corn must be in position 4.

Using Clue 6:
- The person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta.
- Since position 4 is occupied by the Egyptian (eating corn), the person drinking fanta must be in position 1 or 2.
- But position 1 is the fan house, so the person drinking fanta must be in position 2.
- The person eating strawberry must be in position 3 (asparagus).

Using Clue 9:
- The Colombian is on the left of the fan hip-hop.
- Since the person eating asparagus is in position 3, the Colombian must be in position 2.
- The fan hip-hop must be in position 4.

Using Clue 10:
- The Japanese is not the person eating asparagus.
- So, the Japanese must be in position 1 or 3.
- But position 1 is the fan house, so the Japanese must be in position 3.

### Final Table

- From clue 4, the person with the sport ""weightlifting"" is in an even position (2 or 4).
- From clue 8, the person with the hobby ""cricket"" (traveling) is in an odd position, so it must be position 1.
- Therefore, the person with the sport ""weightlifting"" must be in position 2 or 4.

#### Step 2: Determine the Fan of Soul

2. **Turkish in Odd Position**
   - From Clue 8, the Turkish is in Position 1 or 3.
   
3. **Fanta and Ship Positioning**
   - From Clue 10, the person drinking Fanta is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - From Clue 6, the person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Fanta.
   - From Clue 5, the person drinking water is to the left of the person driving the ship.
   - Therefore, the person drinking Fanta must be in Position 3, and the person driving the ship must be in Position 4 (since Position 4 is Chinese).

4. **Bike and Ship Positioning**
   - From Clue 11, the person driving the ship is to the right of the person driving the bike.
   - Since the person driving the ship is in Position 4, the person driving the bike must be in Position 3 (but this conflicts with Fanta). Therefore, the person driving the bike must be in Position 2, and the person driving the ship must be in Position 4.

5. **Goldfish and Pony Ownership**
   - From Clue 14, the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
   - From Clue 1, the owner of the goldfish is not the Turkish, so the owner of the goldfish must be either Chinese, Colombian, or Indonesian.
   - From Clue 12, the Indonesian is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - Therefore, the owner of the goldfish must be the Colombian (since the Indonesian cannot be in Position 1 or 2 due to Clue 12).

6. **Guinea-Pig and Rabbit Ownership**
   - From Clue 2, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
   - From Clue 12, the Indonesian is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - Therefore, the owner of the guinea-pig must be the Indonesian, and the owner of the rabbit must be the Chinese.

7. **Soy-Milk and Fanta Positioning**
   - From Clue 7, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking Fanta.

8. **Water and Bike Ownership**
   - From Clue 5, the person drinking water is to the left of the person driving the ship.
   - From Clue 13, the person driving the bike is not the Chinese.
   - Therefore, the person drinking water must be the Colombian, and the person driving the bike must be the Indonesian.

1. **Clue 3**: The person drinking cola is on the far left.
   - Beverage (1) = Cola

2. **Clue 1**: The person eating strawberry is on the far left or far right.
   - Food (1) or Food (4) = Strawberry

3. **Clue 9**: The person eating lime is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
   - Since cola is on the far left, the person eating lime must be in position 2 and the person drinking fanta must be in position 3 or 4.

4. **Clue 2**: The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway.
   - If the person drinking fanta is in position 3 or 4, then the person driving the subway must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since cola is in position 1, the person driving the subway cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person drinking fanta must be in position 3 or 4, and the person driving the subway is in position 2.

5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.
   - This means the person drinking lemonade cannot be in positions 1 or 4, so they must be in position 2 or 3.

   - Therefore, the person drinking fanta must be in position 4.

6. **Clue 6**: The turkish is between the person drinking fanta and the brazilian.
   - Since the person drinking fanta is in position 4, the turkish must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, the brazilian must be in position 2.

7. **Clue 7**: The person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
   - Since cola is in position 1, the person driving the airplane must be in position 2, but we already determined that the person driving the subway is in position 2, which is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate.
   - Re-evaluating, the person driving the airplane must be in position 4, and the person drinking cola is in position 1.

8. **Clue 8**: The person driving the scooter is between the person driving the airplane and the dutch.
   - Since the person driving the airplane is in position 4, and the person driving the scooter is in position 3 or 2, and the dutch must be in position 1 or 4.
   - Since the person drinking fanta is in position 4, the dutch must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the person driving the scooter must be in position 2.

9. **Clue 9**: The person eating lime is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
   - Since the person drinking fanta is in position 4, the person eating lime must be in position 2.

10. **Clue 10**: The person eating radish is not the brazilian.
    - Since the brazilian is in position 2, the person eating radish must be in position 1 or 4.
    - Since cola is in position 1, the person eating radish must be in position 4.

11. **Clue 4**: The german is not the person eating strawberry.
    - Since the person eating strawberry is in position 1 or 4, and the person eating radish is in position 4, the person eating strawberry must be in position 1.
    - Therefore, the german must be in position 3.

- **Baseball (far left)**: Position 1
- **Soccer**: Somewhere to the left of the owner of the goldfish, but not the same as the owner of the dog (clue 10).

Since the owner of the dog cannot be the person with soccer, and the person with soccer must be to the left of the owner of the goldfish, let's consider possible placements for soccer and the goldfish.

### Placing Sports:
- Baseball: Position 1
- Soccer: Position 3 (since it must be to the left of the goldfish and not the same as the dog)

Now, let's place the other sports:
- Lacrosse: To the left of the fan techno (clue 7), so it can only be in Position 2.
- Techno: In Position 4 (since lacrosse is to its left).

### Placing Pets:
- Dog: Owned by the scientist (clue 3) and is to the left of the doctor (clue 4).
- Hedgehog: The owner of the dog (scientist) is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog (clue 2). Since the scientist is on the left, the hedgehog can be in Position 2 or 4.

### Placing Jobs:
- Librarian: To the right of the fan country (clue 1).
- Mechanic: The fan soul (clue 8).
- Doctor: To the right of the owner of the dog (clue 4).

### Final Placement:
1. Baseball: Position 1
2. Lacrosse: Position 2
3. Soccer: Position 3
4. Techno: Position 4

Based on the above constraints, let's place the remaining elements:

- **Dog**: Scientist (clue 3)
- **Hedgehog**: Can be in Position 2 or 4. Given the placement of the dog, it must be in Position 4.
- **Goat**: Can be in Position 1 or 3. Given the placement of the hedgehog, it must be in Position 1.
- **Goldfish**: Must be in Position 4 (right of soccer).

- **Librarian**: To the right of the fan country (clue 1), so it must be in Position 2.
- **Mechanic**: The fan soul (clue 8), so it must be in Position 3.
- **Doctor**: To the right of the owner of the dog (clue 4), so it must be in Position 4.
