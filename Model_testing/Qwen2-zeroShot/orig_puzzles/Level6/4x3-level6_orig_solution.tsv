Lv6-4x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Clues:
1. The person eating asparagus is the person driving the car.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the person driving the jet-ski.
3. The person eating grapefruit is the person driving the roller.
4. The person whose sport is volleyball is not the person eating asparagus.
5. The person eating lemon is between the person whose sport is cricket and the person whose sport is volleyball.
6. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta.
7. The person whose sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is badminton.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- Asparagus -> Car

#### Clue 2:
- Hot-chocolate -> Jet-ski

#### Clue 3:
- Grapefruit -> Roller

#### Clue 4:
- Volleyball -> Not Asparagus

Since Asparagus is associated with Car, Volleyball cannot be associated with Asparagus. Therefore, Volleyball must be associated with either Grapefruit or Lemon.

#### Clue 5:
- Lemon is between Cricket and Volleyball.

This means that if Volleyball is associated with Grapefruit, then Cricket must be associated with Lemon, and Volleyball is associated with Grapefruit. If Volleyball is associated with Lemon, then Cricket must be associated with Grapefruit, and Volleyball is associated with Lemon.

Let's consider both scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: Volleyball -> Grapefruit**
   - Cricket -> Lemon
   - Volleyball -> Grapefruit (Clue 3)
   - Asparagus -> Car (Clue 1)

2. **Scenario 2: Volleyball -> Lemon**
   - Cricket -> Grapefruit
   - Volleyball -> Lemon (Clue 3)
   - Asparagus -> Car (Clue 1)

#### Clue 6:
- 7up -> Left of Fanta

#### Clue 7:
- Cricket -> Left of Badminton

Given these clues, let's try Scenario 1 first:

1. **Scenario 1:**
   - Asparagus -> Car
   - Hot-chocolate -> Jet-ski
   - Grapefruit -> Roller
   - Volleyball -> Grapefruit (Contradicts as it should be between Cricket and Volleyball)

Since Scenario 1 leads to a contradiction, let's try Scenario 2:

2. **Scenario 2:**
   - Asparagus -> Car
   - Hot-chocolate -> Jet-ski
   - Grapefruit -> Roller
   - Volleyball -> Lemon
   - Cricket -> Grapefruit
   - Lemon is between Cricket and Volleyball (Correct)

Now, we need to place 7up and Fanta:

- 7up -> Left of Fanta
- Cricket -> Left of Badminton

Since Cricket is on position 2 and Volleyball is on position 3, the order for sports must be Cricket, Volleyball, and Badminton. This fits with the clues.

Thus, the final placements are:

- Beverage: 7up, Fanta, Hot-chocolate
- Food: Asparagus, Grapefruit, Lemon
- Sport: Cricket, Volleyball, Badminton
- Transport: Car, Jet-ski, Roller

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |     1     |       2       |     3      |

Lv6-4x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the Spanish ##3**
   - This means the Spanish person is in position 3, and the person driving the motorbike is either in position 1 or 2.

2. **The person eating onion is somewhere to the left of the person eating cauliflower ##5**
   - This means the onion eater must be positioned before the cauliflower eater.

3. **The doctor is not the American ##6**
   - The doctor cannot be the American.

4. **The doctor is somewhere to the right of the dressmaker ##5**
   - The doctor must be to the right of the dressmaker.

5. **The Japanese is the person eating cauliflower ##5**
   - The Japanese person eats cauliflower.

6. **The doctor is not the person driving the skateboard ##6**
   - The doctor does not drive the skateboard.

7. **The Japanese is between the person driving the skateboard and the Spanish ##2**
   - The Japanese (who eats cauliflower) is in position 2, with the skateboard driver to the left and the Spanish to the right.

8. **The American is not the person eating onion ##6**
   - The American does not eat onion.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Spanish and Motorbike Driver:**
   - From clue 7, the Japanese is in position 2.
   - Therefore, the Spanish must be in position 3 (since the Japanese is between the skateboard driver and the Spanish).
   - So, the Spanish is in position 3.
   - The motorbike driver can only be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since the Japanese is in position 2, the motorbike driver must be in position 1.

2. **Positioning the Cauliflower Eater:**
   - From clue 5, the Japanese (position 2) eats cauliflower.

3. **Positioning the Onions and Cauliflowers:**
   - From clue 2, the onion eater must be to the left of the cauliflower eater.
   - The only positions available for the onion eater are 1 or 2, but position 2 is taken by the Japanese.
   - Therefore, the onion eater must be in position 1.
   - Since position 1 is occupied by the motorbike driver, the onion eater cannot be the motorbike driver.
   - Thus, the onion eater must be the American (since the American cannot eat onion and the motorbike driver is already placed).

4. **Positioning the Doctor and Dressmaker:**
   - From clue 3, the doctor is not the American.
   - From clue 4, the doctor is to the right of the dressmaker.
   - From clue 6, the doctor is not the skateboard driver.
   - From clue 7, the Japanese (position 2) is between the skateboard driver and the Spanish (position 3).
   - Therefore, the skateboard driver must be in position 1 (already taken by the motorbike driver), so the skateboard driver must be in position 2 (Japanese).
   - The doctor must be in position 3 (Spanish) or 4 (right of the dressmaker).
   - Since the Spanish is in position 3, the doctor must be in position 4.
   - The dressmaker must be in position 2.

5. **Final Verification:**
   - The American (onion eater) is in position 1.
   - The Japanese (cauliflower eater) is in position 2.
   - The Spanish (not the doctor) is in position 3.
   - The doctor is in position 4.

### Final Table:
```
|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Food          |   Onion    |   Cauliflower |   #        |
| Job           |   American |   Dressmaker |   Doctor   |
| Nationality   |   American |   Japanese  |   Spanish  |
| Transport     |   Motorbike|   Skateboard |   Car      |
```

This configuration satisfies all the given clues."
Lv6-4x3-3	"Let's break down the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of punk is somewhere to the right of the scientist.
2. **Clue 2:** The fan of country is between the owner of the frog and the fan of electronic.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the security guard.
4. **Clue 4:** The fan of country is somewhere to the left of the security guard.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is writing is not the fan of country.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing.
7. **Clue 7:** The mechanic is on the left or right of the security guard.
8. **Clue 8:** The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the security guard.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 4
From Clue 1, the scientist is to the left of the punk fan.
From Clue 4, the country fan is to the left of the security guard.

This means the scientist cannot be in position 3 (since the punk fan must be to the right of the scientist), and the country fan must be in positions 1 or 2, with the security guard being in position 3.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the security guard. So, the security guard cannot have rock-climbing as a hobby.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 6
The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. This implies that the person with fishing cannot be in position 3, and rock-climbing must be to the right of fishing.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 7 and Clue 8
The mechanic is on the left or right of the security guard, and the owner of the chinchilla is also on the left or right of the security guard. Since the security guard is in position 3, the mechanic and the chinchilla owner can be in positions 1 or 2.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 2
The fan of country is between the owner of the frog and the fan of electronic. This means the order could be:
- Fan of country, owner of frog, fan of electronic
- Fan of electronic, owner of frog, fan of country

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 5
The person who's hobby is writing is not the fan of country. So, if the fan of country is in position 1 or 2, the writer cannot be in those positions.

### Filling in the Table:

1. Let's assume the security guard is in position 3. Then:
    - Scientist must be in position 1 or 2 (since punk fan is to the right).
    - Country fan must be in position 1 or 2 (since security guard is in position 3).

2. If the security guard is in position 3, then:
    - The scientist must be in position 2 (since punk fan must be to the right of the scientist).
    - The punk fan must be in position 3 (since scientist is in position 2).

3. Now, the country fan must be in position 1 (since the security guard is in position 3 and the country fan is to the left of the security guard).

4. The electronic fan must be in position 2 (since the country fan is in position 1 and the electronic fan is to the right of the country fan).

5. Since the mechanic is on the left or right of the security guard, the mechanic can be in position 1 or 2. The chinchilla owner can also be in position 1 or 2.

6. The person with rock-climbing cannot be the security guard, so it must be in position 3 (already assigned to the security guard).

7. The person with writing cannot be the country fan, so the writing person must be in position 1 or 2.

8. The person with fishing must be to the left of the person with rock-climbing.

### Final Solution:

|               |     1      |       2       |       3        |
| Hobby         | Writing    | Fishing       | Rock-climbing  |

Lv6-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The musician is between the Canadian and the fan of hip-hop.
2. The French is on the left of the Mexican.
3. The fan of house is the French.
4. The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the French.
5. The musician is not the person who's hobby is puzzles.
6. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
7. The bartender is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Musician's Position
From clue 1, we know that the musician is between the Canadian and the fan of hip-hop. This means the musician cannot be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2: Determine the French and Mexican Positions
From clue 2, the French is on the left of the Mexican. This means the French cannot be in position 3, and the Mexican cannot be in position 1.

#### Step 3: Determine the Fan of House
From clue 3, the fan of house is the French. Therefore, the French must have the hobby ""house.""

#### Step 4: Determine the Fan of Hip-Hop
From clue 4, the fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the French. Since the French is in position 2 (as the only remaining position for the French), the fan of hip-hop must be in position 3.

#### Step 5: Determine the Musician's Position
Since the musician is between the Canadian and the fan of hip-hop, and the fan of hip-hop is in position 3, the musician must be in position 2. But from clue 1, this contradicts the fact that the musician should be between the Canadian and the fan of hip-hop. Therefore, the musician must be in position 1, and the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2.

#### Step 6: Determine the Remaining Positions
From clue 2, the French must be in position 1 (leftmost) and the Mexican must be in position 3 (rightmost).

#### Step 7: Determine the Hobbies and Jobs
From clue 5, the musician is not the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, the musician could have either gardening or reading as a hobby.

From clue 6, the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. And from clue 7, the bartender is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading.

Given the positions:
- Position 1: French (house)
- Position 2: Musician (hip-hop)
- Position 3: Mexican

We need to assign the remaining hobbies and jobs:
- Position 1: French (house) - must be the fan of house.
- Position 2: Musician (hip-hop) - must be the fan of hip-hop.
- Position 3: Mexican - must be the fan of classical or reading.

Since the fan of house is the French, the Mexican must have either gardening or reading as a hobby. Given the bartender is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading, the Mexican cannot have reading as a hobby because the Mexican is in the rightmost position. Therefore, the Mexican must have gardening as a hobby.

This leaves:
- Position 1: French (house) - job could be any but not musician.
- Position 2: Musician (hip-hop) - job must be musician.
- Position 3: Mexican (gardening) - job could be any but not bartender.

Finally, the Canadian must have reading as a hobby and be the bartender since the Mexican has gardening and the musician has hip-hop.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Hobby         | reading   |  puzzles |  house    |
| Job           | bartender |  musician|  pilot    |
| Music-Genre   | classical |  hip-hop |  house    |
| Nationality   |  french   |  mexican |  canadian |
```

This satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv6-4x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step by step.

Let's start with the clues:

1. **The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the lawyer**.
2. **The person eating spinach is between the videographer and the fan of techno**.
3. **The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person eating spinach**.
4. **The fan of dubstep is not the person eating apple**.
5. **The person eating apple is on the left or right of the lawyer**.
6. **The fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the videographer**.

We will use these clues to fill in the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the lawyer.
This means the chinchilla owner cannot be in position 3 (the rightmost).

#### Clue 2: The person eating spinach is between the videographer and the fan of techno.
This implies that the person eating spinach must be in position 2, with the videographer and the fan of techno on either side.

#### Clue 3: The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person eating spinach.
Since the person eating spinach is in position 2, the owner of the horse can be in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 4: The fan of dubstep is not the person eating apple.
This means the fan of dubstep cannot be the one eating apple.

#### Clue 5: The person eating apple is on the left or right of the lawyer.
This means the person eating apple can be in position 1 or 3, but not in position 2.

#### Clue 6: The fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the videographer.
This means the fan of blues cannot be in position 1, and the videographer must be in position 1 or 2.

### Applying the Clues:

1. From Clue 2, the person eating spinach is in position 2. So, the videographer and the fan of techno must be in positions 1 and 3.
2. From Clue 3, the owner of the horse can be in position 1 or 3. Since the person eating spinach is in position 2, the owner of the horse cannot be in position 2.
3. From Clue 5, the person eating apple can be in position 1 or 3, but not in position 2.
4. From Clue 6, the fan of blues must be to the right of the videographer. So, the videographer cannot be in position 3.
5. From Clue 4, the fan of dubstep cannot be the person eating apple.

### Placing the Information:

- Position 2: Spinach eater (videographer and techno fan are in positions 1 and 3)
- Position 1: Videographer (since the fan of blues must be to the right of the videographer, the fan of blues cannot be in position 1)
- Position 3: Techno fan (since the videographer is in position 1 and the fan of blues must be to the right)

Now, we know:
- Position 2: Spinach eater (can be either videographer or techno fan)
- Position 1: Videographer
- Position 3: Techno fan

Since the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the spinach eater, and the person eating apple is on the left or right of the lawyer, we can deduce:
- Position 1: Videographer (not the spinach eater, so it must be the owner of the horse)
- Position 2: Spinach eater (must be the techno fan)
- Position 3: Techno fan (not the spinach eater, so it must be the owner of the horse)

Thus, the remaining positions for the spinach eater, videographer, and techno fan are correctly placed. We now need to determine the food, job, music genre, and pet.

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1       |    2    |      3       |
| Food          |   Horse      | Spinach |   Goat      |
| Job           |  Entrepreneur|  Lawyer |  Videographer|
| Music-Genre   |   Dubstep    |  Blues  |   Techno    |
| Pet           |  Chinchilla  | Goat    |   Horse     |
```

Lv6-4x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding elements into the table. Let's break down the clues step by step:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's sport is biathlon is the person eating garlic.**
   - This tells us that Biathlon is in column 3 and Garlic is in column 3.

2. **The fan country is the person driving the motorbike.**
   - This tells us that Country is in row Music-Genre, Motorbike is in row Transport, and they are in the same position (either both in column 1 or column 2).

3. **The person driving the van is not the person who's sport is baseball.**
   - This tells us that Van is not in the same column as Baseball.

4. **The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the left of the person driving the van.**
   - Rugby must be to the left of Van, meaning Rugby cannot be in column 3.

5. **The person who's sport is baseball is on the far right.**
   - This tells us that Baseball is in column 3.

6. **The fan soul is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby.**
   - Soul must be to the right of Rugby, so Rugby cannot be in column 3 (as Baseball is in column 3), and Soul must be in column 2 or 3.

7. **The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the fan soul.**
   - Motorbike must be to the right of Soul, so Soul must be in column 1 or 2, and Motorbike must be in column 2 or 3.

8. **The person eating corn is somewhere to the left of the person driving the van.**
   - Corn must be to the left of Van, so Van must be in column 2 or 3, and Corn must be in column 1 or 2.

### Placing Elements:

- From clue 1, Biathlon is in column 3, and Garlic is in column 3.
- From clue 5, Baseball is in column 3.
- From clue 4, Rugby must be to the left of Van, and Baseball is in column 3, so Rugby cannot be in column 3. Therefore, Rugby must be in column 1 or 2.
- From clue 6, Soul must be to the right of Rugby, so if Rugby is in column 1, Soul must be in column 2. If Rugby is in column 2, Soul must be in column 3.
- From clue 7, Motorbike must be to the right of Soul. If Soul is in column 2, Motorbike must be in column 3. If Soul is in column 3, Motorbike must be in column 3 (which is not possible since Van is also in column 3).
- From clue 8, Corn must be to the left of Van, so if Van is in column 2, Corn must be in column 1. If Van is in column 3, Corn must be in column 1 or 2.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements step-by-step:

1. **Biathlon** is in column 3 (clue 1).
2. **Baseball** is in column 3 (clue 5).

Lv6-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the tram is the person eating apple.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating apple is on the far left or far right.
3. **Clue 3:** The fan of reggae is the person eating apple.
4. **Clue 4:** The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the person eating potato.
5. **Clue 5:** The fan of house is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla.
6. **Clue 6:** The fan of d&b is in the middle.
7. **Clue 7:** The fan of d&b is not the person driving the ship.
8. **Clue 8:** The person eating apple is on the left or right of the person eating banana.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**From Clue 1 and Clue 2:**
- The person eating apple must be in position 1 or 3.
- Since the person driving the tram (Clue 1) is also the person eating apple, the person eating apple must be in position 1.

**From Clue 3:**
- The fan of reggae is the person eating apple, so the person in position 1 is eating apple and is a fan of reggae.

**From Clue 6:**
- The fan of d&b is in the middle, so the person in position 2 is a fan of d&b.

**From Clue 7:**
- The fan of d&b is not the person driving the ship, so the person driving the ship cannot be in position 2.

**From Clue 4:**
- The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the person eating potato. Since the person eating apple is in position 1, the person eating potato must be in position 2 or 3.

**From Clue 8:**
- The person eating apple (position 1) is on the left or right of the person eating banana. This means the person eating banana can only be in position 2 or 3.

### Combining all clues:
- Position 1: Apple, Reggae
- Position 2: D&b
- Position 3: Must be either Potato or Banana
- Position 4: Must be the remaining one from Potato or Banana

Since the owner of the turtle is to the right of the person eating potato (Clue 4), and the person eating apple is on the left or right of the person eating banana (Clue 8):

- If the person eating potato is in position 3, then the person eating banana must be in position 4.
- Therefore, the person eating potato must be in position 3, and the person eating banana must be in position 4.

### Final Table:
```

### From Clue 5:
- The fan of house is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla.
- Since the fan of house cannot be in position 2 (d&b), it must be in position 1 or 4.
- Given that position 1 is already occupied by the fan of reggae and position 4 is occupied by the fan of banana, the fan of house must be in position 3.

### Final Adjustments:
- The owner of the chinchilla must be in position 2 since the fan of house is in position 3.

### Final Table:
```
|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |   4    |

```

### From Clue 7:
- The fan of d&b is not the person driving the ship, so the person driving the ship must be in position 2.

### Final Table:

Lv6-4x3-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Summary:
1. The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies.
2. The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person driving the boat.
3. The person who's sport is climbing is not the person watching fantasy movies.
4. The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat.
5. The fan of funk is the person watching fantasy movies.
6. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues.
7. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The fan of funk is the person watching fantasy movies.
   - Fantasy Movies: Funk

2. **Clue 7**: The person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
   - Fantasy Movies: Funk (from Clue 5)
   - Family Movies: Blues or Country (since it must be to the left of Funk)

3. **Clue 6**: The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues.
   - Since Blues is to the left of Funk and Family Movies is to the right of Blues, Family Movies must be Country.
   - Family Movies: Country
   - Fantasy Movies: Funk

4. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is climbing is not the person watching fantasy movies.
   - Fantasy Movies: Funk
   - Therefore, the person with sport climbing cannot watch Funk. They must watch either Documentary or Family (Country).

5. **Clue 1**: The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies.
   - Let’s assume the person watching documentary movies is in position 1, then the taxi driver must be in position 2 or 3.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat.
   - Cricket must be in position 1, and Boat must be in position 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person driving the boat.
   - Golf can be in position 1 or 3, but not in the same position as Boat.

### Possible Arrangements:
- If Cricket is in position 1 and Boat is in position 2, then Golf must be in position 3.
- If Cricket is in position 1 and Boat is in position 3, then Golf must be in position 2.

### Final Arrangement:
Let's test the arrangement where Cricket is in position 1, Boat is in position 2, and Golf is in position 3.

- Position 1: Cricket
- Position 2: Boat
- Position 3: Golf

Since the person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies, and we have two remaining positions for Documentary and Family, let's place them accordingly:

- Position 1: Cricket
- Position 2: Boat
- Position 3: Golf
- Position 4: Taxi

Now, let's place Documentary and Family:

- Since Family is to the right of Blues and to the left of Funk, and Blues must be to the left of Family, Blues must be in position 1 (Cricket), Family in position 2 (Boat), and Documentary in position 4 (Taxi).

- Therefore:
  - Position 1: Cricket (Sport: Cricket)
  - Position 2: Boat (Transport: Boat)
  - Position 3: Golf (Sport: Golf)
  - Position 4: Taxi (Transport: Taxi)

And the genres:
- Position 1: Cricket (Sport: Cricket) -> Documentary Movies
- Position 2: Boat (Transport: Boat) -> Family Movies
- Position 3: Golf (Sport: Golf) -> Fantasy Movies (Funk)
- Position 4: Taxi (Transport: Taxi) -> (no genre mentioned, but it fits the right position for taxi)

### Final Solution Table:

|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |    4    |

Lv6-4x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the correct cells of the table. Let's go through the clues one by one.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The Italian is not the fan of rock.**
   - The Italian cannot be the fan of rock.

2. **The Italian is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies.**
   - The Italian can be either in position 1 or 3 (left or right) relative to the person watching comedy movies.

3. **The person watching martial-arts movies is not the owner of the mouse.**
   - The person who watches martial-arts movies cannot own the mouse.

4. **The person watching adventure movies is between the owner of the cat and the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - This means that if we label the positions as 1, 2, and 3, the sequence for these three must fit this condition.

5. **The Argentine is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep.**
   - The Argentine can be either in position 1 or 3 relative to the fan of dubstep.

6. **The Argentine is somewhere to the right of the fan of punk.**
   - The Argentine must be in position 2 or 3 relative to the fan of punk.

7. **The person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies.**
   - The person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 1 or 2 relative to the person watching comedy movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 7:**
   - Martial-arts < Comedy.
   - Possible sequences: Martial-arts, Comedy or Martial-arts, Comedy, _.

2. **From Clue 4:**
   - Adventure is between Cat and Martial-arts.
   - Possible sequences: Cat, Adventure, Martial-arts or Cat, Martial-arts, Adventure.

3. **From Clue 3:**
   - Martial-arts is not the mouse owner.
   - If Martial-arts is in position 1, then Adventure must be in position 2 and Comedy in position 3. Or if Martial-arts is in position 2, then Adventure must be in position 1 and Comedy in position 3.

4. **From Clue 1:**
   - Italian is not rock.
   - Since there are only three genres, Italian can be either dubstep or punk.

5. **From Clue 2:**
   - Italian is on the left or right of the comedy watcher.
   - If Comedy is in position 3, then Italian can be in position 1 or 2.

6. **From Clue 5:**
   - Argentine is on the left or right of the dubstep fan.
   - Argentine is also to the right of the punk fan.

7. **From Clue 6:**
   - Argentine is to the right of the punk fan.
   - Argentine can be in position 2 or 3.

### Putting it Together:

Let's assume:
- Martial-arts is in position 1.
- Comedy is in position 3.
- Adventure is in position 2.

This fits Clue 4 perfectly.

Now, let's assign the other clues:
- Italian can be in position 1 or 2 (Clue 2).
- Italian cannot be rock (Clue 1).

If Italian is in position 1:
- Italian is not rock.
- Argentine is to the right of the punk fan and to the left or right of the dubstep fan.
- Argentine can be in position 2 or 3.

Since Argentine is to the right of the punk fan, and Argentine cannot be in position 1, Argentine must be in position 3.

If Argentine is in position 3, then the punk fan must be in position 1 (since Argentine is to the right of the punk fan), and the dubstep fan must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Punk
- Position 2: Dubstep
- Position 3: Argentine

Now, we fill in the genres:
- Position 1: Punk
- Position 2: Dubstep
- Position 3: Argentine

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1       |     2     |     3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts | Adventure | Comedy    |
| Music-Genre   | Punk         | Dubstep   | Argentine |
| Nationality   | Egyptian     | Italian   | Argentine |
| Pet           | Mouse        | Guinea-pig| Cat       |

7. **Clue 7:** The person whose sport is ice-hockey is in an even position.
8. **Clue 8:** The person eating banana is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 8:** The person eating banana is on the far right (Position 3).
   - So, Food in Position 3 = Banana.

2. **Clue 2:** The person whose sport is rowing is the person watching drama movies.
   - So, Movie-Genre for Position 2 = Drama.
   - And Sport for Position 2 = Rowing.

3. **Clue 6:** The person whose sport is rowing is somewhere to the left of the person eating nectarine.
   - Since Position 2 is already occupied by rowing, the person eating nectarine must be in Position 1 or 3. But since Position 3 is already occupied by banana, the only possible position for nectarine is Position 1.
   - So, Food in Position 1 = Nectarine.

4. **Clue 7:** The person whose sport is ice-hockey is in an even position.
   - Since Position 1 and 3 are already occupied, the only even position left is Position 2.
   - But Position 2 is already occupied by rowing, so the only remaining even position is Position 4.
   - So, Sport in Position 4 = Ice-Hockey.

5. **Clue 3:** The person whose sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person eating zucchini.
   - Since Position 4 is already occupied by ice-hockey, the person eating zucchini must be in Position 1 or 2. But Position 1 is already occupied by nectarine, so the person eating zucchini must be in Position 2.
   - So, Food in Position 2 = Zucchini.

6. **Clue 1:** The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies.
   - Since Position 2 is already occupied by zucchini, the person watching horror movies must be in Position 1.
   - So, Movie-Genre in Position 1 = Horror.

7. **Clue 4:** The person driving the skateboard is not the person watching horror movies.
   - Since Position 1 is already occupied by horror, the person driving the skateboard cannot be in Position 1.
   - The person driving the airplane must be in Position 3 or 4. But Position 3 is already occupied by banana, so the person driving the airplane must be in Position 4.
   - So, Transport in Position 4 = Airplane.

8. **Clue 5:** The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - Since Position 4 is already occupied by airplane, the person driving the skateboard must be in Position 1 or 2.
   - But Position 1 is already occupied by horror, so the person driving the skateboard must be in Position 2.
   - So, Transport in Position 2 = Skateboard.

9. **Clue 6:** The person whose sport is rowing is somewhere to the left of the person eating nectarine.
   - Since Position 2 is already occupied by rowing and Position 1 is already occupied by nectarine, this condition is satisfied.
