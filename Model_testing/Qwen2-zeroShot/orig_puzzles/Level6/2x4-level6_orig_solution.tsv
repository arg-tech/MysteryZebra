Lv6-2x4-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Baseball is somewhere to the left of Handball**:
   - Baseball < Handball

2. **Lemonade is not Baseball**:
   - Lemonade ≠ Baseball

3. **Baseball is on the right of Volleyball**:
   - Volleyball < Baseball

4. **Mirinda is on the right of Handball**:
   - Handball < Mirinda

5. **Juice is on the right of Baseball**:
   - Baseball < Juice

6. **Baseball is not Mirinda**:
   - Baseball ≠ Mirinda

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Baseball < Handball** and **Volleyball < Baseball**:
   - This means Volleyball must be to the left of Baseball.
   - Therefore, the order is: Volleyball < Baseball < Handball.

2. **Handball < Mirinda**:
   - Mirinda must be on the right of Handball.
   - Combining with the previous order: Volleyball < Baseball < Handball < Mirinda.

3. **Baseball < Juice**:
   - Juice must be on the right of Baseball.
   - Combining with the previous order: Volleyball < Baseball < Handball < Mirinda < Juice.

4. **Lemonade is not Baseball** and **Baseball is not Mirinda**:
   - Baseball cannot be 1 or 4 (since it needs to fit into the Volleyball < Baseball < Handball < Mirinda < Juice order).
   - Therefore, Baseball can only be in position 2 or 3.

5. **Lemonade is not Baseball**:
   - If Baseball is in position 2, then Lemonade can be in position 1 or 3.
   - If Baseball is in position 3, then Lemonade can be in position 1 or 2.

Given the constraints, let's try placing Baseball in position 2:

- **Position 1**: Lemonade
- **Position 2**: Baseball
- **Position 3**: Volleyball
- **Position 4**: Handball
- **Position 5**: Mirinda
- **Position 6**: Juice

Now, let's verify the conditions:
1. Baseball is to the left of Handball (2 < 4) - True.
2. Lemonade is not Baseball - True.
3. Baseball is to the right of Volleyball (3 > 2) - True.
4. Mirinda is to the right of Handball (5 > 4) - True.
5. Juice is to the right of Baseball (6 > 2) - True.
6. Baseball is not Mirinda - True.

All conditions are satisfied with this arrangement.

7. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
8. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating artichoke is on the far right (Position 4).
   - Beverage: _, _, _, Sprite/Mirinda
   - Food: _, _, Lettuce, Artichoke

2. **Clue 6:** The person eating artichoke is on the right of the person eating lettuce.
   - This means the person eating lettuce must be in position 3.
   - Beverage: _, _, Lettuce, _
   - Food: _, _, Lettuce, Artichoke

3. **Clue 2 & 8:** The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda, and the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - This implies that the order of drinks from left to right could be: Iced-tea, Mirinda, Milk, Sprite or Iced-tea, Mirinda, Sprite, Milk.
   - But we know from Clue 7 that the person drinking sprite is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea, so the order must be Iced-tea, Mirinda, Milk, Sprite.
   - Beverage: Iced-tea, Mirinda, Milk, Sprite
   - Food: _, _, Lettuce, Artichoke

4. **Clue 3 & 5:** The person eating onion is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite, and the person eating onion is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
   - This means the person eating onion must be in position 1 or 2, and the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2 or 3.

Lv6-2x4-3	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking water is not the coach.
2. The doctor is not the person drinking sprite.
3. The electrician is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
4. The doctor is the person drinking fanta.
5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the doctor.
6. The person drinking fanta is in an odd position.
7. The coach is on the far left or far right.
8. The electrician is somewhere to the left of the police-officer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 6: The person drinking fanta is in an odd position.
- This means the person drinking fanta is either in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 4: The doctor is the person drinking fanta.
- Therefore, the doctor must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 7: The coach is on the far left or far right.
- This means the coach can only be in position 1 or 4.

#### Clue 5: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the doctor.
- Since the doctor (fanta) is in position 1 or 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2 if the doctor is in position 3, or in position 1 if the doctor is in position 3. However, since the coach cannot be in position 2 (far left), the doctor must be in position 3.

So, we now know:
- Doctor (fanta) is in position 3.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2 because it is to the left of the doctor.

#### Clue 1: The person drinking water is not the coach.
- Since the coach is on the far left or far right, and the person drinking water cannot be the coach, the person drinking water must be in position 2 or 4.

#### Clue 2: The doctor is not the person drinking sprite.
- Since the doctor drinks fanta, the person drinking sprite cannot be the doctor. Therefore, the person drinking sprite must be in position 1 or 4.

#### Clue 3: The electrician is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2, so the electrician must be in position 1 or 4.

#### Clue 8: The electrician is somewhere to the left of the police-officer.
- If the electrician is in position 1, the police-officer must be in position 3 or 4. But since the doctor is in position 3, the police-officer must be in position 4.

So, the electrician must be in position 1, and the police-officer must be in position 4.

Now, let's fill in the positions:
- Position 1: Electrician (sprite)
- Position 2: Person drinking hot-chocolate
- Position 3: Doctor (fanta)
- Position 4: Police-officer (water)

Since the coach cannot be in position 2 (hot-chocolate), and the coach must be on the far left or far right, the coach must be in position 1 (since the electrician is there).

Final solution:

```
|            |      1      |       2        |   3    |   4    |
| Beverage   |  Sprite     |  Hot-Chocolate |  Fanta |  Water |
| Job        |  Coach      |                |  Doctor|  Police-Officer |

Lv6-2x4-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the snake.
2. The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
3. The person driving the trike is not the owner of the guinea-pig.
4. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
5. The person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway.
6. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Snake and Hedgehog
From clue 1, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the snake. This means the owners of these pets must be in one of the following positions:
- (1, Snake), (2, Hedgehog)
- (1, Hedgehog), (2, Snake)

#### Step 2: Positioning the Guinea-Pig and Quad-Bike Driver
From clue 2, the owner of the guinea-pig is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. This gives us:
- If the guinea-pig is at position 1, the quad-bike driver must be at position 2 or 3 or 4.
- If the guinea-pig is at position 2, the quad-bike driver must be at position 3 or 4.
- If the guinea-pig is at position 3, the quad-bike driver must be at position 4.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Trike Driver
From clue 3, the person driving the trike is not the owner of the guinea-pig. From clue 4, the person driving the trike is to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This means:
- If the guinea-pig is at position 1, the trike driver must be at position 3 or 4.
- If the guinea-pig is at position 2, the trike driver must be at position 4.
- If the guinea-pig is at position 3, the trike driver cannot be at any position as it would violate clue 4.

From clue 6, the owner of the snake is to the left of the person driving the trike. This further restricts the positions.

#### Step 4: Positioning the Train and Subway Drivers
From clue 5, the person driving the train is to the right of the person driving the subway. This means:
- If the subway is driven by someone at position 1, the train must be driven by someone at position 2, 3, or 4.
- If the subway is driven by someone at position 2, the train must be driven by someone at position 3 or 4.
- If the subway is driven by someone at position 3, the train must be driven by someone at position 4.

### Final Arrangement:

Given all the constraints, let's try the arrangement:
- Owner of the guinea-pig at position 1 (to satisfy clue 2 and 6).
- Owner of the hedgehog at position 2 (to satisfy clue 1).
- Owner of the snake at position 3 (to satisfy clue 6).
- Owner of the trike at position 4 (to satisfy clue 4 and 3).

For transport:
- Person driving the subway at position 1 (to satisfy clue 5).
- Person driving the train at position 2 (to satisfy clue 5).
- Person driving the quad-bike at position 3 (to satisfy clue 2).
- Person driving the trike at position 4 (to satisfy clue 4).

### Final Table:

```
|             |     1      |    2     |     3     |    4     |
| Pet         | Guinea-pig | Hedgehog | Snake     | Trike    |
| Transport   | Subway     | Train    | Quad-bike | Trike    |
```

Lv6-2x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze and place each item step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking fanta is not the person driving the snowmobile.
5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the bike is not the person drinking 7up.
6. **Clue 6:** The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
7. **Clue 7:** The person driving the car is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7:** The person driving the car is on the far left or far right. This means either Car is in position 1 or 4.
2. **Clue 2 & 3:** Since milk is to the left of both car and boat, milk cannot be in position 4. If milk is in position 1, then car and boat must be in positions 2 and 3 (in any order). However, if milk is in position 2, then car and boat must be in positions 3 and 4 (in any order).
3. **Clue 1:** 7up is to the left of milk. This restricts the possible positions for 7up and milk.
4. **Clue 6:** Iced-tea is to the left of fanta. This also restricts the possible positions for iced-tea and fanta.
5. **Clue 4 & 5:** Fanta is not driven by the snowmobile driver, and 7up is not driven by the bike rider.

### Placing the Items:

- Let's start with the car. It can only be in position 1 or 4.
- Assume car is in position 1 (we will check if it leads to a valid solution).

#### Case 1: Car in Position 1

- **Position 1:** Car
- **Position 4:** Boat (since milk must be to the left of boat)
- **Position 2:** 7up (since milk is to the left of 7up)
- **Position 3:** Milk

This arrangement satisfies Clues 2, 3, and 1. Now we need to place the remaining items (fanta and iced-tea) and ensure they fit the other clues.

- **Clue 6:** Iced-tea is to the left of fanta. So, iced-tea must be in position 2 and fanta in position 3, but we already have 7up in position 2 and milk in position 3, which doesn't work.

So, let's try another case where car is in position 4.

#### Case 2: Car in Position 4

- **Position 1:** Bike (since 7up is to the left of milk and milk is to the left of car)
- **Position 2:** 7up
- **Position 3:** Milk
- **Position 4:** Car

This arrangement satisfies Clues 1, 2, and 3. Now we need to place the remaining items (fanta and iced-tea) and ensure they fit the other clues.

- **Clue 6:** Iced-tea is to the left of fanta. So, iced-tea must be in position 1 and fanta in position 2, but we already have bike in position 1, which doesn't work.

Let's try one more arrangement:

#### Case 3: Car in Position 4 and Boat in Position 3

- **Position 1:** Bike (since 7up is to the left of milk and milk is to the left of boat)
- **Position 2:** 7up
- **Position 3:** Boat
- **Position 4:** Car

This arrangement satisfies Clues 1, 2, and 3. Now we need to place the remaining items (fanta and iced-tea) and ensure they fit the other clues.

- **Clue 6:** Iced-tea is to the left of fanta. So, iced-tea must be in position 1 and fanta in position 2, but we already have bike in position 1, which doesn't work.

Finally, let's try:

#### Final Arrangement:

- **Position 1:** Iced-tea
- **Position 2:** 7up
- **Position 3:** Milk
- **Position 4:** Car

This satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 1: 7up is to the left of milk.
- Clue 2: Milk is to the left of car.
- Clue 3: Milk is to the left of boat (though boat is not placed, it fits the clue).
- Clue 4: Fanta is not the driver of the snowmobile.
- Clue 5: 7up is not driven by the bike rider.
- Clue 6: Iced-tea is to the left of fanta.
- Clue 7: Car is on the far right.

|             |     1      |  2   |    3     |   4   |
| Beverage    | Iced-tea   | 7up  |  Milk    |       |

Lv6-2x4-6	"Let's break down the puzzle and solve it step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. The Australian is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
2. The person watching thriller movies is not the Colombian.
3. The Australian is on the far right.
4. The Colombian is somewhere to the right of the Polish.
5. The person watching spy movies is the person watching spy movies (redundant information).
6. The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the Australian.
7. The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
8. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the Polish.
9. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the Polish (redundant information).

### Deductions:
- From point 3, we know that the Australian is in position 4.
- From point 1, since the Australian is on the right of the person watching disaster movies, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 3.
- From point 6, the person watching spy movies is in position 1 or 2 (since they are to the left of the Australian).
- From point 7, the person watching spy movies is also to the left of the person watching disaster movies, so they must be in position 1 or 2.
- From point 4, the Colombian is to the right of the Polish. Since the Australian is in position 4, the only possible positions for the Polish and Colombian are positions 1, 2, and 3.
- From point 8, the person watching mystery movies is to the left of the Polish. This means the Polish cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 3 or 4. But since the Australian is in position 4, the Polish must be in position 3, which contradicts the earlier deduction that the person watching disaster movies is in position 3. Therefore, the Polish must be in position 2, and the Colombian in position 3.

### Final Positions:
- Position 1: Spy movies
- Position 2: Polish nationality
- Position 3: Colombian nationality
- Position 4: Disaster movies

### Movie-Genre and Nationality Assignment:
- Position 1 (Spy): Spy
- Position 2 (Polish): Polish
- Position 3 (Colombian): Mystery
- Position 4 (Disaster): Disaster

5. The fan of gospel is on the far left.
6. The person watching spy movies is the fan of country.
7. The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of country.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The fan of gospel is on the far left.
   - This means the first column must be gospel.

2. **Clue 2**: The fan of gospel is not the person watching spy movies.
   - Since the fan of gospel is on the far left, the person in column 1 cannot be watching spy movies.

3. **Clue 6**: The person watching spy movies is the fan of country.
   - So, the fan of country is somewhere to the right of the fan of gospel (since the fan of gospel is on the far left).

4. **Clue 4**: The fan of country is on the left or right of the fan of reggae.
   - Since the fan of country is to the right of the fan of gospel, and there are only four columns, the fan of reggae can be in column 2, 3, or 4.

5. **Clue 7**: The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of country.
   - The fan of country is to the right of the fan of gospel, so the fan of zombie movies must be in column 1, 2, or 3.

6. **Clue 3**: The person watching documentary movies is the fan of d&b.
   - The fan of d&b must be in column 3 since it is the person watching documentary movies.

7. **Clue 1**: The fan of gospel is on the left or right of the fan of country.
   - Since the fan of gospel is on the far left, the fan of country must be in column 2, 3, or 4.

Lv6-2x4-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the information in the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The coach is on the left of the journalist.**
   - This means the coach cannot be in position 4, and the journalist cannot be in position 1.
   
2. **The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the photographer.**
   - This means the social-worker cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and the photographer cannot be in position 1.
   
3. **The social-worker is on the right of the journalist.**
   - This means the journalist cannot be in position 4, and the social-worker must be in a position to the right of the journalist.
   
4. **The journalist is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.**
   - This means the journalist can be in position 1 or 2 (left of the milk drinker) or in position 3 or 4 (right of the milk drinker).
   
5. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the journalist.**
   - This means the soy-milk drinker can be in position 1, 2, or 3 if the journalist is in position 2, 3, or 4 respectively.
   
6. **The coach is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.**
   - This means the coach can be in any position as long as the 7up drinker is either to the left or right of the coach.
   
7. **The person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.**
   - This means the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in position 4, and the tea drinker must be in a position to the right of the soy-milk drinker.
   
8. **The person drinking milk is not the social-worker.**
   - This means the social-worker cannot be in position 2 if the journalist is in position 1, and the social-worker cannot be in position 3 if the journalist is in position 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's start placing the clues into the table:

1. **Coach is on the left of the journalist:**
   - Possible pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)

2. **Social-worker is somewhere to the left of the photographer:**
   - Possible pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)

3. **Social-worker is on the right of the journalist:**
   - Possible pairs: (1,2), (2,3)

4. **Journalist is on the left or right of the person drinking milk:**
   - Possible pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)

5. **Person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the journalist:**
   - Possible pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)

6. **Coach is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up:**
   - Possible pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)

7. **Person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk:**
   - Possible pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)

8. **Person drinking milk is not the social-worker:**
   - If the social-worker is in position 2, the journalist cannot be in position 1.
   - If the social-worker is in position 3, the journalist cannot be in position 2.

Considering all these constraints, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- The journalist must be in position 2 because it allows for the coach to be in position 1 and the social-worker to be in position 3.
- The coach must be in position 1.
- The social-worker must be in position 3.
- The photographer must be in position 4.
- The person drinking milk must be in position 1 (since the journalist is in position 2 and the social-worker is in position 3).

Now, let's assign the beverages:

- The person drinking 7up must be in position 4 (since the coach is in position 1 and the journalist is in position 2).
- The person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2 (since the journalist is in position 2 and the social-worker is in position 3).
- The person drinking tea must be in position 4 (since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 2 and the person drinking tea is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk).

Lv6-2x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and place the information step-by-step into the table.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The bartender is in an odd position (1 or 3).
2. The person driving the helicopter is not the teacher.
3. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the lawyer.
4. The person driving the subway is in an even position (2 or 4).
5. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the skateboard.
6. The person driving the subway is the lawyer.
7. The bartender is not the person driving the subway.
8. The fisherman is somewhere to the right of the teacher.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of the Lawyer
From clue 6, the lawyer drives the subway. From clue 4, the lawyer must be in an even position (2 or 4). Therefore, the lawyer is in position 2 or 4.

#### Step 2: Position of the Bartender
From clue 1, the bartender is in an odd position (1 or 3).

#### Step 3: Position of the Teacher
From clue 8, the fisherman is somewhere to the right of the teacher. This means the teacher cannot be in position 4 because there is no position to the right of it. So, the teacher can only be in position 1, 2, or 3.

#### Step 4: Position of the Person Driving the Subway
From clue 4 and clue 6, the lawyer (who drives the subway) is in position 2 or 4. Since the bartender is in an odd position (clue 1), the lawyer must be in position 4 (the only even position available for the lawyer).

#### Step 5: Position of the Person Driving the Skateboard
From clue 5, the person driving the subway (lawyer) is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since the lawyer is in position 4, the person driving the skateboard must be in position 3.

#### Step 6: Position of the Person Driving the Airplane
From clue 3, the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in position 4, the airplane must be driven by someone in position 3. But we already know that position 3 is occupied by the skateboard driver. Thus, the airplane must be driven by the teacher, who must be in position 1.

#### Step 7: Position of the Person Driving the Helicopter
From clue 2, the person driving the helicopter is not the teacher. From clue 7, the bartender is not the person driving the subway (lawyer). We have positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and we've placed the lawyer (subway driver) in position 4, the teacher in position 1, and the skateboard driver in position 3. Therefore, the only remaining job is the fisherman, who must be in position 2, and the only remaining transport is the helicopter.

### Final Table:

Lv6-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person who's sport is golf is not the owner of the ferret.**
2. **The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the fish.**
3. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person who's sport is weightlifting.** (This is redundant and can be ignored.)
4. **The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.**
5. **The owner of the hedgehog is not the person who's sport is weightlifting.**
6. **The person who's sport is surfing is not the owner of the fish.**
7. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is in an even position.**
8. **The owner of the hedgehog is the person who's sport is golf.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Weightlifter
From clue 7, the weightlifter must be in an even position:
- Weightlifter is in position 2 or 4.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Golf Player
From clue 8, the golfer is the owner of the hedgehog.
- The golfer must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

Since the weightlifter is in an even position (2 or 4), the golfer cannot be in position 2 or 4, so the golfer must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Rabbit Owner
From clue 2, the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the fish.
- If the rabbit owner is in position 1, the fish owner must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- If the rabbit owner is in position 2, the fish owner must be in position 3 or 4.
- If the rabbit owner is in position 3, the fish owner must be in position 4.

#### Step 4: Positioning the Weightlifter
From clue 4, the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
- If the weightlifter is in position 2, the rabbit owner must be in position 3 or 4.
- If the weightlifter is in position 4, the rabbit owner must be in position 3.

#### Step 5: Combining Clues
Let's combine these clues to find consistent positions:

- If the weightlifter is in position 2, the rabbit owner must be in position 3 (since the rabbit owner is on the right of the weightlifter).
- This means the fish owner must be in position 4 (since the rabbit owner is on the left of the fish owner).

So, the weightlifter is in position 2, the rabbit owner is in position 3, and the fish owner is in position 4.

- The golfer (owner of the hedgehog) must be in position 1 (the only odd position left).

Now, let's fill in the sports based on the remaining constraints:

- The weightlifter is in position 2 (even), so the sport is weightlifting.
- The golfer (position 1) must have golf as the sport (clue 8).
- The owner of the rabbit (position 3) must have a sport that is not weightlifting or golf.
- The owner of the fish (position 4) must have a sport that is not weightlifting or golf.

From clue 6, the person who's sport is surfing is not the owner of the fish, so the owner of the fish must have either swimming or golf (but we already know golf is for the golfer). So, the owner of the fish has swimming.

That leaves:
- The owner of the rabbit must have surfing.

Finally, the only sport left for the owner of the hedgehog (position 1) is golf, which is already taken by the golfer.

So, the sports are:
- Position 1 (golfer): Golf (hedgehog)
- Position 2 (weightlifter): Weightlifting
- Position 3 (rabbit owner): Surfing
- Position 4 (fish owner): Swimming

### Final Solution Table:

|         |    1     |       2       |    3    |    4     |
| Pet     | Hedgehog |             Rabbit | Fish   |         |
| Sport   |   Golf   | Weightlifting  | Surfing |   Swimming  |
