Lv6-3x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the food, music genre, and nationality in the correct positions based on the given clues. Let's break down each clue step-by-step:

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **the person eating pepper is in an even position**
   - This means the person eating pepper is either in position 2 or 4.

2. **the person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the british**
   - This means the British person cannot be in position 3 (since there is no position 4), so they must be in position 1. The person eating kale must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **the russian is the fan d&b**
   - This means the Russian person is associated with d&b.

4. **the fan disco is on the far left**
   - This means the person who is a fan of disco is in position 1.

5. **the french is not the fan techno**
   - This means the French person is not in position 1, and they are not the fan of techno.

6. **the fan d&b is on the right of the fan techno**
   - Since the Russian is the fan of d&b, the Russian must be on the right of the person who is the fan of techno.

Let's start placing the information step-by-step:

1. **Position 1:**
   - From clue 4, the fan of disco is in position 1.
   - From clue 5, the French is not the fan of techno, so the French person can't be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the British person must be in position 1 because they are to the left of the person eating kale (clue 2).

2. **Position 2:**
   - From clue 1, the person eating pepper is in an even position, so it can be in position 2.
   - From clue 2, the person eating kale must be to the right of the British (who is in position 1), so the kale eater must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Since position 2 is occupied by the person eating pepper, the person eating kale must be in position 3.

3. **Position 3:**
   - From clue 2, the person eating kale is in position 3.
   - From clue 5, the French is not the fan of techno, so the French person must be in position 3 (since they can't be in position 1).
   - Therefore, the Russian must be in position 2 (since the Russian is the fan of d&b, and the d&b fan must be on the right of the techno fan).

4. **Final placements:**
   - Position 1: British, Disco fan
   - Position 2: Russian, d&b fan
   - Position 3: French, Techno fan

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1    |    2    |    3    |
| Food          | Pepper | Kale    | Plum    |
| Music-Genre   | Disco  | d&b     | Techno  |
| Nationality   | British| Russian | French  |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv6-3x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step-by-step.

Let's start with the given clues:

1. The owner of the rat is not the Dutch.
2. The person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball.
3. The person who's sport is basketball is not the British.
4. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog.
5. The owner of the goldfish is on the far left.
6. The British is on the right of the Polish.
7. The owner of the frog is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5:
- The owner of the goldfish is on the far left (position 1).

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Nationality   |  Polish  |            |          |
| Pet           | Goldfish |            |          |
| Sport         |          |            |          |
```

#### Clue 6:
- The British is on the right of the Polish.
- Since Polish is at position 1, British must be at position 3.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Nationality   |  Polish  |            | British  |
| Pet           | Goldfish |            |          |
| Sport         |          |            |          |
```

#### Clue 7:
- The owner of the frog is in an even position (positions 2 or 3).
- Since the British is already at position 3, the owner of the frog must be at position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Nationality   |  Polish  | Dutch      | British  |
| Pet           | Goldfish | Frog       |          |
| Sport         |          |            |          |
```

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the rat is not the Dutch.
- Therefore, the Dutch cannot have the rat.

So, the rat must be with either the British or the Polish. But since the British is not the owner of the rat (Clue 3), the Polish must have the rat.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Nationality   |  Polish  | Dutch      | British  |
| Pet           | Goldfish | Frog       | Rat      |
| Sport         |          |            |          |
```

#### Clue 3:
- The person who's sport is basketball is not the British.
- Therefore, the British does not play basketball.

#### Clue 2:
- The person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball.
- Since the British is not playing basketball, the Dutch or Polish must be playing basketball.
- Given that the British is on the right of the Polish (Clue 6), the Polish cannot play basketball (since the British would then be next to him).

Therefore, the Dutch must play basketball.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Nationality   |  Polish  | Dutch      | British  |
| Pet           | Goldfish | Frog       | Rat      |
| Sport         | Basketball| Baseball  | Swimming |
```

#### Clue 4:
- The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog.
- We already know that the Dutch plays baseball and owns the frog, so this condition is satisfied.

Finally, we can confirm the arrangement based on all the clues:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Nationality   |  Polish  | Dutch      | British  |
| Pet           | Goldfish | Frog       | Rat      |
| Sport         | Basketball| Baseball  | Swimming |

Lv6-3x3-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The videographer is on the right of the fan of blues.
2. The fan of dubstep is not the videographer.
3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the firefighter and the bartender.
4. The bartender is somewhere to the left of the firefighter.
5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the videographer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The videographer (V) is on the right of the fan of blues (B).
- Possible positions for B and V: (B, V) or (B, _, V).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The fan of dubstep (D) is not the videographer.
- So, D cannot be in the same position as V.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The person who's sport is weightlifting (W) is between the firefighter (F) and the bartender (Bt).
- Possible positions for F, W, and Bt: (F, W, Bt) or (Bt, W, F).

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The bartender (Bt) is somewhere to the left of the firefighter (F).
- This confirms that F must be to the right of Bt.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
- The person who's sport is snowboarding (Sb) is somewhere to the right of the videographer (V).
- Possible positions for Sb and V: (V, Sb) or (_, V, Sb).

### Combining Clues:
1. From Clue 3, we know F, W, and Bt must be in the order (F, W, Bt) or (Bt, W, F).
2. From Clue 4, F must be to the right of Bt, so the only possible order is (F, W, Bt).
3. From Clue 1, V must be to the right of B (or possibly in the middle if there's another person in between). Since V is also to the right of B, we can place B and V in the remaining slots.
4. From Clue 5, Sb must be to the right of V, which means Sb must be in the last slot.

### Final Placement:
Given the constraints, the only logical placement is:
- F (Firefighter) in position 1
- W (Weightlifting) in position 2
- Bt (Bartender) in position 3
- B (Blues Fan) in position 1 (since V must be to the right of B)
- V (Videographer) in position 2
- D (Dubstep Fan) in position 3 (since D cannot be V)

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1     |       2       |      3       |
| Job           | Firefighter | Bartender    | Videographer |
| Music-Genre   | Blues       | Dubstep      | Punk         |
| Sport         | Weightlifting | Climbing   | Snowboarding |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |       2       |      3       |

Lv6-3x3-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and use the given clues to fill in the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage.
2. The lawyer is somewhere to the right of the librarian.
3. The person eating cabbage is the fan of r&b.
4. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the librarian.
5. The lawyer is not the person eating cauliflower.
6. The librarian is somewhere to the right of the social-worker.
7. The lawyer is not the fan of blues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the person eating cabbage
From clue 3, the person eating cabbage is the fan of r&b. This means we can place ""cabbage"" under the ""Food"" column for one of the people and ""r&b"" under the ""Music-Genre"" column for the same person.

#### Step 2: Determine the person who is the fan of blues
From clue 1 and clue 4, the fan of blues is on either side of the person eating cabbage. Since the person eating cabbage is the fan of r&b, the fan of blues must be either to the left or right of this person. Let's denote the person eating cabbage as Person A (who is the fan of r&b).

Now, let's consider the positions:
- If Person A is in position 1, then the fan of blues could be in position 2 or 3.
- If Person A is in position 2, then the fan of blues could be in position 1 or 3.
- If Person A is in position 3, then the fan of blues could be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 3: Determine the person who is the lawyer
From clue 2, the lawyer is to the right of the librarian. From clue 6, the librarian is to the right of the social-worker. This means the order must be Social-Worker -> Librarian -> Lawyer.

From clue 5, the lawyer is not the person eating cauliflower. Also, from clue 7, the lawyer is not the fan of blues. Therefore, the lawyer cannot be the person in position 1 (since if they were, the librarian would have to be in position 2, which would make the lawyer in position 3, but the lawyer cannot be the fan of blues).

So, the lawyer must be in position 3, and the librarian must be in position 2. This leaves the social-worker in position 1.

#### Step 4: Assign the remaining foods and music genres
Since the lawyer is in position 3, and the lawyer is not the fan of blues, the fan of blues must be in position 1 or 2. We already know the person in position 1 is the social-worker, so the fan of blues must be in position 2 (the librarian). This means the person in position 1 (social-worker) is not the fan of blues.

Since the person in position 1 (social-worker) is not the fan of blues, and the person in position 3 (lawyer) is not the fan of blues, the person in position 2 (librarian) must be the fan of blues.

This leaves the person in position 1 (social-worker) to be the fan of dubstep, and the person in position 3 (lawyer) to be the fan of r&b (which we already know from clue 3).

Finally, the person in position 1 (social-worker) must be eating cauliflower (since they are not eating cabbage or cauliflower, and the only remaining food is cauliflower).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |       1       |     2     |     3      |
| Food          | cauliflower   | watermelon| cabbage    |
| Job           | social-worker | librarian | lawyer    |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep       | blues     | r&b       |

Lv6-3x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each person according to the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
2. **Clue 2**: The project-manager is not the fan of gospel.
3. **Clue 3**: The fan of gospel is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the videographer.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who's hobby is reading is not the project-manager.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left. This means:
   - Position 1: Board-games

2. **Clue 3**: The fan of gospel is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. This means:
   - Rock-climbing is in an odd position (since it must be either 1 or 3).

3. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position. Since the board-games person is already in position 1, rock-climbing must be in position 3.

4. **Clue 1**: The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since rock-climbing is in position 3, the fan of folk must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the videographer. Since rock-climbing is in position 3, reading and videographer can only be in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the fan of folk is in position 2, reading must be in position 1 and videographer in position 2 (or vice versa, but since folk is in position 2, reading cannot be in position 2).

6. **Clue 6**: The person who's hobby is reading is not the project-manager. Therefore, the project-manager must be the videographer.

7. **Clue 2**: The project-manager is not the fan of gospel. Since the project-manager is the videographer and the fan of gospel is the rock-climber, the videographer is not the fan of gospel.

8. **Clue 3**: Revisited, the fan of gospel is the rock-climber, which is confirmed.

9. **Hobby Assignments**:
   - Position 1: Board-games
   - Position 2: Reading
   - Position 3: Rock-climbing

10. **Job Assignments**:
    - Since the project-manager is the videographer and the person with reading as a hobby is not the project-manager, the project-manager must be the videographer.
    - The remaining job for the board-games person is the bartender, and the reading person is the project-manager.

11. **Music-Genre Assignments**:
    - The fan of folk is in position 2, so the fan of folk must be the person with reading as a hobby.
    - The fan of gospel is in position 3, so the fan of gospel must be the rock-climber.
    - The remaining genre for the board-games person is rock.

Lv6-3x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of food, pet, and transport for each position (1, 2, 3).

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating onion is on the left of the person eating grapefruit.
2. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion.
3. The person driving the ship is not the person eating lime.
4. The owner of the pony is in the middle.
5. The person driving the ship is not the owner of the pony.
6. The owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Pony Owner
- Clue 4 states that the owner of the pony is in the middle.
- Therefore, the owner of the pony must be in position 2.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Chinchilla Owner
- Clue 6 states that the owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
- Since the owner of the pony is in position 2, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 3.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Jet-Ski Driver
- Clue 2 states that the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion.
- Since the jet-ski driver cannot be in position 3 (as the owner of the chinchilla is there), they must be in position 1 or 2.
- However, since the owner of the pony is in position 2, the jet-ski driver must be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Positioning the Ship Driver
- Clue 5 states that the person driving the ship is not the owner of the pony.
- Since the owner of the pony is in position 2, the ship driver cannot be in position 2.
- Clue 3 states that the person driving the ship is not the person eating lime.
- Therefore, the ship driver must be in position 3, as positions 1 and 2 are already occupied.

#### Step 5: Determining the Foods
- Clue 1 states that the person eating onion is on the left of the person eating grapefruit.
- Since the jet-ski driver (position 1) is not eating onion (as the jet-ski driver is to the left of the person eating onion), the person eating onion must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the person eating grapefruit must be in position 3.

#### Step 6: Assigning the Remaining Foods
- Since the person eating onion is in position 2, and the person eating grapefruit is in position 3, the only remaining food (lime) must be in position 1.

#### Step 7: Assigning the Pets
- The owner of the pony is in position 2, so the pet must be the pony.
- The owner of the chinchilla is in position 3, so the pet must be the chinchilla.
- Therefore, the pet in position 1 must be the goat.

#### Step 8: Confirming the Transport
- The jet-ski driver is in position 1, so the transport must be the jet-ski.
- The ship driver is in position 3, so the transport must be the ship.
- Therefore, the transport in position 2 must be the helicopter.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |    1    |     2      |     3      |
| Food        |   Lime  |  Onion     | Grapefruit |

Lv6-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position.
2. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the librarian.
3. The coach is on the right of the pilot.
4. The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
5. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
6. The owner of the rabbit is not the person who's sport is swimming.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The person who's sport is swimming must be in position 1 or 3 (odd positions).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the librarian.
- This means the librarian cannot be in position 3 if the goldfish owner is in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The coach is on the right of the pilot.
- This means the pilot cannot be in position 3 if the coach is in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
- If the goldfish owner is in position 1, the rat owner can be in position 2 or 3.
- If the goldfish owner is in position 2, the rat owner can be in position 3.
- If the goldfish owner is in position 3, there is no valid position for the rat owner.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
- The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
- This means the person with skateboarding cannot be in position 3 if the rabbit owner is in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
- The owner of the rabbit is not the person who's sport is swimming.
- Since swimming is in an odd position, the rabbit owner cannot be in that position.

### Possible Arrangements Based on Clues:

Let's start by placing the sports and see how the rest fit.

1. **Swimming in Position 1:**
   - Coach must be in Position 3 (since he is to the right of the pilot).
   - Librarian cannot be in Position 3 (owner of goldfish is to the right).
   - Goldfish owner must be in Position 2 (right of the librarian).
   - Rat owner must be in Position 3 (left or right of goldfish owner).
   - Rabbit owner must be in Position 2 (to the right of skateboarding) and not in Position 1 (swimming).

   This leads to a contradiction because the rabbit owner would be in Position 2, but the librarian is already there. Therefore, swimming cannot be in Position 1.

2. **Swimming in Position 3:**
   - Coach must be in Position 2 (right of the pilot).
   - Librarian cannot be in Position 2 (owner of goldfish is to the right).
   - Goldfish owner must be in Position 1 (right of the librarian).
   - Rat owner must be in Position 2 (left or right of goldfish owner).
   - Rabbit owner must be in Position 2 (to the right of skateboarding) and not in Position 3 (swimming).

   This also leads to a contradiction because the rabbit owner would be in Position 2, but the coach is already there. Therefore, swimming cannot be in Position 3.

Given these contradictions, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions. Let's try another approach:

### Final Solution:
- **Swimming in Position 2:**
  - Coach must be in Position 3 (right of the pilot).
  - Librarian cannot be in Position 3 (owner of goldfish is to the right).
  - Goldfish owner must be in Position 1 (right of the librarian).
  - Rat owner must be in Position 3 (left or right of goldfish owner).
  - Rabbit owner must be in Position 3 (to the right of skateboarding) and not in Position 2 (swimming).

This configuration fits all the clues:
- Swimming is in Position 2.
- The coach is in Position 3.
- The librarian is in Position 1 (goldfish owner).
- The rat owner is in Position 3.
- The rabbit owner is in Position 3 (skateboarding).

### Final Table:
```
|         |     1     |       2       |   3    |
| Job     | librarian | coach         | pilot  |
| Pet     | goldfish  | rabbit        | rat    |
| Sport   | skateboarding | swimming | tennis |

### Clues:
1. The person driving the motorbike is on the far left or far right.
2. The person eating pear is not the person driving the quad-bike.
3. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike.
4. The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person drinking water.
5. The person eating onion is not the person drinking cola.
6. The person eating onion is not the person drinking fanta.
7. The person eating onion is the person eating onion (redundant information).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- The person driving the motorbike is on the far left or far right.

This means we have two possibilities:
1. Motorbike is in position 1 and Quad-bike is in position 3.
2. Motorbike is in position 3 and Quad-bike is in position 1.

#### Clue 4:
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person drinking water.

This means:
- If the motorbike is in position 1, the quad-bike must be in position 3, and the person drinking water cannot be in position 3 (since the quad-bike is there).
- If the motorbike is in position 3, the quad-bike must be in position 1, and the person drinking water cannot be in position 1.

So, if the motorbike is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 2 or 3. But since the quad-bike is in position 3, the person drinking water must be in position 2.

If the motorbike is in position 3, the person drinking water must be in position 1 or 2. But since the quad-bike is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 2.

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- Motorbike in position 1.
- Quad-bike in position 3.
- Water in position 2.

#### Clue 3:
- The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike.

Since the motorbike is in position 1, the cola drinker must be in position 1 or 2.

But since position 1 is occupied by the motorbike, the cola drinker must be in position 2.

So, the cola drinker is in position 2, which is also where the water drinker is. This seems inconsistent, so let's re-evaluate.

Given the correct interpretation, the cola drinker must be in position 1, and the water drinker in position 2.

#### Re-evaluating Clues:
- The cola drinker is in position 1.
- The water drinker is in position 2.
- The motorbike is in position 1, so the quad-bike must be in position 3.

#### Clue 2:
- The person eating pear is not the person driving the quad-bike.

Since the quad-bike is in position 3, the pear eater cannot be in position 3.

#### Clue 5 & 6:
- The person eating onion is not the person drinking cola.
- The person eating onion is not the person drinking fanta.

Since the cola drinker is in position 1, the onion eater cannot be in position 1.
Since the fanta drinker is not specified yet, we need to place the remaining drinks.

#### Final Placement:
- Position 1: Motorbike (cola drinker)
- Position 2: Water drinker
- Position 3: Quad-bike (fanta drinker)

Now, the remaining food items:
- Banana
- Onion
- Pear

Since the pear eater is not the fanta drinker (position 3) and not the cola drinker (position 1), the pear eater must be in position 2.

- Position 2: Pear eater (water drinker)
- Position 3: Fanta drinker (quad-bike)

Finally, the onion eater must be in position 1, as it is the only remaining position and satisfies all conditions.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |   1   |     2     |     3     |
| Beverage    | Motorbike (Cola) | Water | Quad-bike (Fanta) |
| Food        | Onion | Pear |         |
| Transport   | Motorbike | Quad-bike |         |

Lv6-3x3-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Person with Baking as a Hobby does not watch Adventure Movies**:
   - This means the person with Baking cannot be in row 2 (Adventure).

2. **Person Watching Action Movies is in an Even Position**:
   - This means the person watching Action can only be in position 2 or 4.

3. **Person with Board-Games as a Hobby is Somewhere to the Right of the Owner of the Hamster**:
   - If the owner of the Hamster is in position 1, then the person with Board-Games must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the owner of the Hamster is in position 2, then the person with Board-Games must be in position 3.
   - If the owner of the Hamster is in position 3, then there is no valid position for the person with Board-Games.

4. **Person with Baking as a Hobby is Not the Owner of the Ferret**:
   - This means the person with Baking cannot have the Ferret.

5. **Person Watching Disaster Movies is Not the Owner of the Hamster**:
   - This means the person watching Disaster cannot have the Hamster.

6. **Owner of the Ferret is in an Even Position**:
   - This means the owner of the Ferret can only be in position 2 or 4.

### Filling the Table:

#### Position 1:
- Since the owner of the Ferret is in an even position (2 or 4), the person in position 1 cannot have the Ferret.
- The person in position 1 can either have Baking or Board-Games.

#### Position 2:
- The person in position 2 can either have Baking or Board-Games (from clue 3).
- The person in position 2 can also watch Action (clue 2).

#### Position 3:
- The person in position 3 can have Baking, Board-Games, or Card-Games.
- The person in position 3 can watch Adventure or Disaster (since position 1 and 2 are already taken by other genres).

### Deductions:
- From clue 1, if the person with Baking is not watching Adventure, they can watch Action or Disaster.
- From clue 4, the person with Baking cannot have the Ferret.
- From clue 5, the person watching Disaster cannot have the Hamster.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         | Board-Games|            | Baking   |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     | Adventure   | Disaster |
| Pet           | Hamster    | Ferret      | Mouse    |
```

### Explanation:
- Position 1: Board-Games (to satisfy clue 3 that the owner of the Hamster is to the left of the person with Board-Games)
- Position 2: Action (to satisfy clue 2)
- Position 3: Baking (satisfies all conditions)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |      2      |    3     |

Lv6-3x3-10	"Let's break down the clues and logically deduce the correct arrangement:

### Clues:
1. The videographer is somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon.
2. The person eating zucchini is not the videographer.
3. The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.
4. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the videographer.
5. The doctor is not the person eating zucchini.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 1: The videographer is somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon.
This means the person eating watermelon cannot be in position 3 (the rightmost position).

#### Clue 2: The person eating zucchini is not the videographer.
This means the videographer can't be the one eating zucchini.

#### Clue 3: The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.
This means the person watching crime movies must be in position 1 or 2, and the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 4: The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the videographer.
This means the person watching adventure movies must be in position 1 or 2, and the videographer must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 5: The doctor is not the person eating zucchini.
This means the doctor is either eating cucumber or watermelon.

### Arranging the Information:

1. **Doctor**: Not eating zucchini, so the doctor could be eating cucumber or watermelon.
2. **Videographer**: Not eating zucchini, and must be somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon.
3. **Crime vs Mystery**: Crime must be on the left of Mystery.
4. **Adventure vs Videographer**: Adventure must be on the left of the videographer.

Given these constraints, let's start with possible positions for each role:

- **Doctor** cannot be the videographer or eating zucchini.
- **Videographer** must be somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon.
- **Crime vs Mystery**: These must be adjacent with crime on the left.
- **Adventure vs Videographer**: Adventure must be on the left of the videographer.

Let's test possible configurations:

1. **Person 1 (left)**: Could be eating cucumber, watching adventure, or being the doctor.
2. **Person 2 (middle)**: Could be eating watermelon or zucchini, watching crime or mystery, or being the videographer.
3. **Person 3 (right)**: Could be eating zucchini, watching mystery, or being the videographer.

Given the constraints:
- If the doctor is in position 1, they can't be the videographer and must eat cucumber or watermelon.
- If the doctor is in position 2, they can't be the videographer and must eat cucumber or zucchini.
- If the doctor is in position 3, they can't be the videographer and must eat zucchini.

Let's assume:
- **Person 1**: Doctor (since the doctor can't be the videographer)
- **Person 2**: Eating watermelon (to satisfy clue 1)
- **Person 3**: Videographer (to satisfy clue 1 and clue 2)

Now we need to fit the movie genres:
- Since the doctor is in position 1, they can't watch any movie genre.
- Person 2 (eating watermelon) can watch crime or adventure.
- Person 3 (videographer) can watch mystery.

Since crime must be on the left of mystery, and adventure must be on the left of the videographer:
- Person 2 (eating watermelon) must watch crime.
- Person 3 (videographer) must watch mystery.
- Person 1 (doctor) can watch adventure (since it fits all constraints).

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1      |      2       |     3     |
| Food          | Cucumber  | Watermelon  | Zucchini  |
| Job           | Doctor    | Architect   | Videographer |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Crime       | Mystery   |
```"
