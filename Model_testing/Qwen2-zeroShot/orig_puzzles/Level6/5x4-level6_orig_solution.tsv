Lv6-5x4-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each item into its corresponding category while adhering to all the given constraints. Let's go through the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The owner of the goldfish is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 7**: The owner of the goat is in an even position.
3. **Clue 11**: The person eating eggplant is in an odd position.
4. **Clue 16**: The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret.

From Clue 3, the owner of the goldfish must be in either position 1 or 4.

From Clue 7, the owner of the goat must be in positions 2 or 4 (since they are in an even position).

From Clue 11, the person eating eggplant must be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since they are in an odd position).

From Clue 16, the person driving the jet-ski must be to the right of the owner of the ferret, so if the owner of the ferret is in position 1, the jet-ski driver must be in position 2, 3, or 4; if the owner of the ferret is in position 2, the jet-ski driver must be in position 3 or 4; and if the owner of the ferret is in position 3, the jet-ski driver must be in position 4.

Let's start with some initial placements based on these clues:

- **Owner of the goldfish**: Position 1 or 4.
- **Owner of the goat**: Position 2 or 4.
- **Person eating eggplant**: Position 1, 3, or 5.
- **Person driving the jet-ski**: To the right of the owner of the ferret.

### Initial Placements:

1. **Owner of the goldfish**:
   - If in position 1, then the owner of the goat must be in position 2 (even position).
   - If in position 4, then the owner of the goat can be in position 2 or 4, but since the owner of the goat cannot be in position 4, it must be in position 2.

2. **Owner of the goat**:
   - If in position 2, then the owner of the goldfish must be in position 1.

3. **Person eating eggplant**:
   - Since the owner of the goldfish is in position 1, the person eating eggplant must be in position 3 or 5 (odd positions).

4. **Person driving the jet-ski**:
   - If the owner of the ferret is in position 1, the jet-ski driver must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - If the owner of the ferret is in position 2, the jet-ski driver must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the owner of the ferret is in position 3, the jet-ski driver must be in position 4.

### Detailed Filling:

- **Owner of the goldfish**: Position 1.
- **Owner of the goat**: Position 2.
- **Person eating eggplant**: Position 3 or 5 (but not 1, as that is occupied by the goldfish owner).
- **Person driving the jet-ski**: Must be to the right of the owner of the ferret, which means if the owner of the ferret is in position 1, the jet-ski driver must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Given these constraints, let's assume the following:

- **Owner of the goldfish**: Position 1.
- **Owner of the goat**: Position 2.
- **Person eating eggplant**: Position 3.
- **Person driving the jet-ski**: Position 4 (since the owner of the ferret must be in position 1 for the jet-ski driver to be in position 4).

Now, let's fill in the remaining categories based on the remaining clues:

- **Clue 6**: The person eating pomegranate is between the person eating papaya and the person driving the boat.
- **Clue 10**: The person watching comedy movies is the fan pop.

- **Clue 15**: The owner of the lizard is between the fan electronic and the person watching sports movies.
- **Clue 17**: The person eating pomegranate is on the left of the owner of the lizard.

Based on these, we can place:

- **Person eating pomegranate**: Position 2 (between the person eating papaya and the person driving the boat).
- **Person driving the boat**: Position 3 (left of the person eating pomegranate).
- **Person eating papaya**: Position 1 (left of the person eating pomegranate).

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |    3     |      4      |

- **American**: Not next to the police-officer (Clue 11)

#### Deductions from Clues:

```

### Step 2: Placing the Sport of Sailing
Clue 8 tells us that the person who's sport is sailing is the fan of d&b. Since the fan of d&b is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit, the sport of sailing must be in position 4 (the only position left for the fan of d&b):
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |
| Food          |         |             |                    |        |
| Job           |         |             |                    |        |
| Music-Genre   | r&b     |             |                    | sailing|
| Pet           |         |             |                    |        |
| Sport         |         |             |                    |        |
```

### Step 3: Placing the Fan of Electronic
Clue 9 tells us that the software-developer is the fan of electronic. We know the software-developer must be on the left or right of the doctor (clue 7). Also, the fan of electronic is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog (clue 12).

Let's assume the software-developer is in position 2 (we will adjust later if needed):
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |
| Food          |         |             |                    |        |
| Job           |         | software-dev|                    |        |
| Music-Genre   | r&b     | electronic  |                    | sailing|
| Pet           |         |             |                    |        |
| Sport         |         |             |                    |        |
```

### Step 4: Placing the Sport of Lacrosse
Clue 10 tells us that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. The sport of lacrosse cannot be in position 1 (r&b), 4 (sailing), or 2 (electronic). It also needs to be on the right of the sport of cricket. Let's place cricket in position 3:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |
| Food          |         |             |                    |        |
| Job           |         | software-dev| cricket            |        |
| Music-Genre   | r&b     | electronic  |                    | sailing|
| Pet           |         |             |                    |        |
| Sport         |         |             | lacrosse           |        |
```

### Step 5: Placing the Sport of Cricket
Cricket must be in position 3 as we just placed it there.

### Step 6: Placing the Fan of D&B
Since the fan of d&b is already in position 4 (sailing), we need to find another position for the fan of d&b. Given the placement of the software-developer, the fan of d&b must be in position 2:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |
| Food          |         |             |                    |        |
| Job           |         | software-dev| cricket            |        |
| Music-Genre   | r&b     | d&b         |                    | sailing|
| Pet           |         |             |                    |        |
| Sport         |         |             | lacrosse           |        |
```

### Step 7: Placing the Owner of the Rabbit
Clue 2 tells us that the fan of d&b is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. The owner of the rabbit must be in position 1 or 3. Since the fan of d&b is in position 2, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 3:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |
| Food          |         |             | rabbit             |        |
| Job           |         | software-dev| cricket            |        |
| Music-Genre   | r&b     | d&b         |                    | sailing|
| Pet           |         |             |                    |        |
| Sport         |         |             | lacrosse           |        |
```

### Step 8: Placing the Owner of the Hedgehog
Clue 3 tells us that the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. The owner of the hedgehog must be in position 4:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |
| Food          |         |             | rabbit             | hedgehog|

| Pet           |         |             |                    |        |
| Sport         |         |             | lacrosse           |        |
```

### Step 9: Placing the Owner of the Goat
Clue 13 tells us that the owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the dog. The owner of the goat must be in position 1, and the owner of the dog must be in position 2:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |

| Pet           |         |             |                    |        |
| Sport         |         |             | lacrosse           |        |
```

### Step 10: Placing the Person Eating Orange
Clue 5 tells us that the person eating orange is not the fan of r&b, so the person eating orange cannot be in position 1. Clue 10 tells us that the person eating orange is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. The person eating orange must be in position 2:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |

| Sport         |         |             | lacrosse           |        |
```

### Step 11: Placing the Person Eating Apricot
Clue 14 tells us that the person eating apricot is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. The person eating apricot must be in position 3:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |

| Sport         |         |             | lacrosse           |        |
```

### Step 12: Placing the Person Eating Radish
Clue 4 tells us that the person eating radish is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat. The person eating radish must be in position 4:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |

| Sport         |         |             | lacrosse           |        |
```

### Step 13: Placing the Writer and Doctor
Clue 17 tells us that the writer is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing. The writer must be in position 1, and the doctor must be in position 2:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |

| Sport         |         |             | lacrosse           |        |
```

### Step 14: Placing the Remaining Jobs
The remaining jobs are firefighter and software-developer. The software-developer is already in position 2, so the firefighter must be in position 1:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |

17. The security-guard is the French.
18. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the fan of gospel.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 7**: The person driving the bus is on the far left.
   - **Position 1**: Bus

2. **From Clue 11**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left.
   - **Position 1**: Volleyball

3. **From Clue 16**: The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the left of the paramedic.
   - Since Position 1 is already occupied by Volleyball, the paramedic cannot be in Position 1.
   - Paramedic must be in Position 4.

4. **From Clue 1**: The paramedic is driving the train.
   - **Position 4**: Train

5. **From Clue 15**: The person driving the train is not the fisherman.
   - Therefore, the fisherman cannot be in Position 4.

6. **From Clue 9**: The fisherman is the American.
   - **Position 2**: American (Fisherman)

7. **From Clue 12**: The fisherman is on the right of the British.
   - Since Position 2 is already occupied by the American (Fisherman), the British must be in Position 1.
   - This contradicts Position 1 being occupied by Volleyball, so let's re-evaluate.

8. **Re-evaluating Clue 9 and 12**:
   - If the fisherman is the American, then the British must be on the left of the American.
   - Since Position 1 is Volleyball, the British must be in Position 3.

9. **From Clue 10**: The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the fisherman.
   - Since Position 2 is the American (Fisherman), the person with cycling must be in Position 4 (Train) or Position 3 (British).
   - But Position 4 is the paramedic, so it must be in Position 3 (British).

10. **From Clue 13**: The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person driving the bus.
    - Position 1 is Bus.
    - The person driving the car can be in Position 2, 3, or 4.
    - Since Position 3 is British (Cycling) and Position 4 is Paramedic (Train), the car must be in Position 2 (American).

11. **From Clue 14**: The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the train.
    - Position 4 is Train.
    - The person driving the jet-ski can be in Position 1 (Bus) or Position 3 (British).
    - But Position 1 is Bus, so the jet-ski must be in Position 3 (British).

12. **From Clue 17**: The security-guard is the French.
    - The only remaining nationality is French, and the only position left is Position 3 (British).
    - Therefore, the British must be the Security-Guard.

13. **From Clue 4**: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the American.
    - Position 2 is American (Fisherman).
    - The person with skateboarding must be in Position 3 (British) or Position 4 (Paramedic).
    - But Position 3 is British (Security-Guard), so the skateboarding must be in Position 4 (Paramedic).

14. **From Clue 6**: The fan of techno is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
    - Position 4 is Paramedic (Skateboarding).
    - The fan of techno can be in Position 1 (Bus) or Position 2 (American).
    - Since Position 1 is Bus, the fan of techno must be in Position 2 (American).

15. **From Clue 5**: The person driving the jet-ski is not the fan of techno.
    - Position 2 is American (Fan of Techno).
    - The person driving the jet-ski must be in Position 3 (British) or Position 4 (Paramedic).
    - But Position 3 is British (Security-Guard), so the jet-ski must be in Position 4 (Paramedic).

16. **From Clue 8**: The person driving the car is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
    - Position 1 is Volleyball.
    - The person driving the car must be in Position 2, 3, or 4.
    - Since Position 2 is American (Fisherman) and Position 3 is British (Security-Guard), the car must be in Position 4 (Paramedic).

17. **From Clue 18**: The person who's sport is skateboarding is the fan of gospel.
    - Position 4 is Paramedic (Skateboarding).
    - The fan of gospel must be in Position 4 (Paramedic).

Now, let's place the sports:

- **Rowing** must be in Position 4 (since Car driver is right of Rowing).
- **Woodworking** must be in Position 3 (since Rowing is right of Woodworking).
- **Baking** must be in Position 2 (since Rowing is right of Baking).

So, the sports are:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: Baking
- Position 3: Woodworking
- Position 4: Rowing

Now, let's place the foods:

- **Radish** is eaten by Egyptian (Position 2).
- **Pomegranate** is eaten by someone with Rock-climbing (Position 3).
- **Lime** is adjacent to someone with Parkour.
- **Grapes** is not driven by Airplane (Position 1 or 2).

Given the above, the foods are:
- Position 1: Grapes (not Airplane)
- Position 2: Radish (Egyptian)
- Position 3: Pomegranate (Rock-climbing)
- Position 4: ?

Finally, let's place the hobbies and transportation:

- **Hobby**: Rock-climbing is Pomegranate (Position 3).
- **Hobby**: Baking is in Position 2.
- **Hobby**: Woodworking is in Position 3.
- **Hobby**: Rowing is in Position 4.

- **Transportation**: Car driver is right of Rowing (Position 4), so it must be in Position 3.
- **Airplane** must be in Position 1 (not driven by Chinese or Grapes).

So, the final solution is:

Lv6-5x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the correct positions for each category (Beverage, Food, Job, Movie-Genre, Nationality) in the table.

Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clue Breakdown:
1. The videographer is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
2. The person drinking water is on the far left or far right.
3. The person eating peas is between the person watching mystery movies and the police-officer.
4. The person watching musical movies is between the person watching zombie movies and the person watching mystery movies.
5. The person watching zombie movies is in an even position.
6. The Brazilian is in an even position.
7. The Brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee.
8. The police-officer is not the person eating pear.
9. The person eating corn is the French.
10. The police-officer is the person drinking sprite.
11. The analyst is the person drinking water.
12. The German is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies.
13. The security guard is somewhere to the right of the person eating corn.
14. The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person watching mystery movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11**: The analyst is the person drinking water. So, Analyst -> Water.
2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking water is on the far left or far right. Since the Analyst is drinking water, Analyst must be in position 1 or 4. Let's assume Analyst is in position 1 (we can check later if it doesn't work).
3. **Clue 10**: The police-officer is the person drinking sprite. So, Police-Officer -> Sprite.
4. **Clue 8**: The police-officer is not the person eating pear. Therefore, the person eating pear cannot be the Police-Officer.
5. **Clue 9**: The person eating corn is the French. So, French -> Corn.
6. **Clue 13**: The security guard is somewhere to the right of the person eating corn. Since Corn is in position 2 (as French), Security Guard must be in position 3 or 4.
7. **Clue 7**: The Brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since Analyst is in position 1 (drinking water), the Brazilian must be in position 3 or 4.
8. **Clue 6**: The Brazilian is in an even position. Therefore, the Brazilian must be in position 2 or 4.
9. **Clue 14**: The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person watching mystery movies. This means the person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 4.
10. **Clue 12**: The German is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies. This means the person watching musical movies cannot be in position 1.
11. **Clue 4**: The person watching musical movies is between the person watching zombie movies and the person watching mystery movies. This implies that the order of these three movies must be either Zombie -> Musical -> Mystery or Mystery -> Musical -> Zombie.
12. **Clue 5**: The person watching zombie movies is in an even position. So, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2 or 4.
13. **Clue 3**: The person eating peas is between the person watching mystery movies and the police-officer. Since Police-Officer is in position 4 (drinking sprite), the person eating peas must be in position 3.
14. **Clue 1**: The videographer is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since Analyst is in position 1 (drinking water), the person drinking 7up must be in position 2 or 3, and the videographer must be in position 3 or 4.

Given all these constraints, let's assign positions:

- Position 1: Analyst (Water)
- Position 2: Person Drinking 7up (videographer to the right)
- Position 3: Person Eating Peas (between mystery and Police-Officer)
- Position 4: Police-Officer (Sprite)

Now, let's fill in the remaining categories:

- **Position 2**: The person drinking 7up must be to the left of the videographer. Since the Analyst is in position 1, the person drinking 7up could be in position 2, and the videographer in position 3.
- **Position 3**: The person eating peas must be between the person watching mystery and the police-officer. The person watching mystery movies must be in position 1 or 3 (but Analyst is in position 1, so it must be position 3). Thus, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2, and the person watching musical movies in position 4.
- **Position 4**: The police-officer is already assigned as Sprite.
- **Position 2**: The person drinking 7up must be to the left of the videographer. The person watching zombie movies is in position 2, and the person watching musical movies is in position 4.
- **Position 3**: The person eating peas is in position 3.
- **Position 4**: The police-officer is in position 4 (Sprite).

Finally, we need to assign the remaining categories (Food, Nationality):

- **French -> Corn** (position 2)
- **German -> Security Guard** (position 3)
- **Brazilian -> Analyst** (position 1)
- **Indonesian -> Videographer** (position 3)
- **Remaining**: The Analyst is the person drinking water, so the remaining nationality must be the German (Security Guard).

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |
