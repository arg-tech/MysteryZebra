1. **Clue 6**: The person drinking lemonade is the owner of the bird.
   - This means the bird owner drinks lemonade.

2. **Clue 2**: The Australian is on the left of the owner of the bird.
   - Since the bird owner is on the right, the Australian must be in position 1.

### Final Table Construction:

Let's start filling in based on these deductions:

|               |      1      |     2     |     3     |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Beverage      |             |           |           |
| Food          |             |           |           |

| Movie-Genre   |             |           |           |
| Nationality   | Australian  | Malaysian | British   |
| Pet           | Bird        |           | Hedgehog  |

From Clue 6:
- Position 1 (Australian) drinks lemonade and owns the bird.

From Clue 4:
- Position 2 (Malaysian) is between the person drinking juice and the owner of the hedgehog.

From Clue 5:
- The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.

From Clue 3:
- The person eating peach is to the left of the person watching mystery movies.

From Clue 9:
- The person watching drama movies is to the right of the person with the hobby of writing.

From Clue 7:
- The person with the hobby of writing is not the British.

From Clue 1:
- The person watching documentary movies is not the person who's hobby is traveling.

Based on these, we can deduce:

- The Australian (position 1) drinks lemonade and owns the bird.
- The Malaysian (position 2) watches mystery movies, so the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 3.
- The British (position 3) has the hobby of writing.
- The person with the hobby of traveling must be in position 1 or 2, but since the Australian does not travel, it must be the Malaysian (position 2).
- The person watching documentary movies is in position 3 (British).

So, the table looks like this:

|               |      1      |     2     |     3     |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|

Lv7-6x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Car Driver:**
   - The person driving the car is the Japanese.
   - Therefore, Car -> Japanese.

3. **Reggae Fan:**
   - The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies.
   - Let's denote the person watching musical movies as Musical.

4. **Car Driver Position:**
   - The person driving the car (Japanese) is on the left of the person whose hobby is video-games.
   - Therefore, Car (Japanese) -> 1st position.
   - Video-Games -> Lemonade -> 2nd or 3rd position.

5. **Fishing Hobbyist:**
   - The person whose hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the fan of reggae.
   - Since the fan of reggae is near the person watching musical movies, we need to place these positions correctly.

6. **Time-Travel Movies:**
   - The person watching time-travel movies is between the person watching spy movies and the person drinking water.
   - Let's denote the person watching spy movies as Spy and the person drinking water as Water.

7. **Water Drinkers:**
   - The person drinking water is on the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
   - Therefore, Water -> 1st or 2nd position.
   - Puzzles -> 2nd or 3rd position.

8. **Trike Driver:**
   - The person driving the trike is in the middle.
   - Therefore, Trike -> 2nd position.

9. **Quad-Bike Driver:**
   - The person driving the quad-bike is to the right of the German.
   - Therefore, Quad-Bike -> 3rd position.
   - German -> 1st or 2nd position.

10. **Rock Fans:**
    - The fan of rock is to the left of the German.
    - Therefore, Rock -> 1st or 2nd position.
    - German -> 2nd or 3rd position.

11. **Dubstep Fans:**
    - The fan of dubstep is not the person watching time-travel movies.
    - Therefore, Dubstep -> 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position, but not Time-Travel.

### Final Placement:

1. **Car (Japanese):**
   - 1st position.
   
2. **Trike (Middle):**
   - 2nd position.

3. **Quad-Bike (Right of German):**
   - 3rd position.

Given these constraints, let's assign the remaining details:

- **Lemonade (Video-Games):**
  - 2nd position (since it's to the right of the car driver).

- **Water (Puzzles):**
  - 1st position (since it's to the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles).

- **Spy (Time-Travel):**
  - 3rd position (since it's to the right of the person drinking water and the person watching time-travel is in the middle).

- **Reggae (Musical):**
  - 1st or 2nd position (reggae is next to musical).
  - Since water is 1st and reggae is not 1st, reggae must be 2nd.
  - Therefore, Musical -> 3rd position.

- **Dubstep (not Time-Travel):**
  - 1st or 3rd position.
  - Since water is 1st and reggae is 2nd, dubstep must be 3rd.

- **German (Right of Rock):**
  - 3rd position (since the fan of rock is to the left of the German).

- **Rock (Dubstep):**
  - 1st position.

8. The Colombian is the mechanic.
9. The person eating papaya is somewhere to the right of the person watching drama movies.
10. The owner of the bird is on the right of the mechanic.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Position of the Person Watching Western Movies
- Clue 7 states that the person watching western movies is on the far left or far right.
- Clue 1 states that this person is on the right of the Colombian.
- Since the Colombian is the mechanic (Clue 8), the person watching western movies must be on the far right.

So, the western movie watcher is in position 3.

#### Step 2: Determine the Colombian’s Position
- The person watching western movies (position 3) is on the right of the Colombian.
- Therefore, the Colombian must be in position 1.

#### Step 3: Determine the Person Eating Pear
- Clue 2 states that the person eating pear is not the person watching western movies.
- Since the western movie watcher is in position 3, the person eating pear cannot be in position 3.
- Clue 6 states that the librarian is on the right of the person eating pear.
- Therefore, the person eating pear must be in position 1 (the Colombian) or position 2.
- Since the Colombian is in position 1, the person eating pear must be in position 2.

So, the person eating pear is in position 2.

#### Step 4: Determine the Chinese’s Position
- Clue 3 states that the Chinese is the person drinking lemonade.
- Since the western movie watcher is in position 3, and the person eating pear is in position 2, the Chinese must be in position 1 (the Colombian).

So, the Chinese is in position 1.

#### Step 5: Determine the Mechanic’s Position
- Clue 8 states that the Colombian is the mechanic.
- So, the mechanic is in position 1.

#### Step 6: Determine the Person Watching Drama Movies
- Clue 5 states that the person watching drama movies is in an even position (2nd).
- So, the person watching drama movies is in position 2.

Since the person eating pear is in position 2, the person watching drama movies must be the person eating pear.

#### Step 7: Determine the Person Drinking Lemonade
- Clue 3 states that the Chinese is the person drinking lemonade.
- Since the Chinese is in position 1, the person drinking lemonade is in position 1.

#### Step 8: Determine the Person Drinking Cola
- Clue 4 states that the owner of the rat is somewhere between the owner of the bird and the person drinking cola.
- The person drinking lemonade is in position 1, so the person drinking cola must be in position 3 (the western movie watcher) or position 2 (the person eating pear and watching drama).
- Since the western movie watcher is in position 3, the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

So, the person drinking cola is in position 2.

#### Step 9: Determine the Owner of the Rat
- The person drinking cola is in position 2.
- The owner of the rat is somewhere between the owner of the bird and the person drinking cola.
- The person drinking lemonade is in position 1, so the owner of the bird must be in position 3 (the western movie watcher).
- Therefore, the owner of the rat is in position 1.

So, the owner of the rat is in position 1.

#### Step 10: Determine the Remaining Positions
- The person eating apple must be in position 3 since positions 1, 2, and 3 are already filled.
- The person drinking almond milk must be in position 1 since the Chinese drinks lemonade.
- The person drinking cola is in position 2.
- The person eating papaya must be in position 3 since the person watching drama movies is in position 2 and the person drinking cola is in position 2.

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| cola        | lemonade  |

### Step 1: Analyze the positions and constraints:

1. The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies.
2. The person eating pomegranate is not the owner of the goldfish.
3. The person eating mango is on the right of the person whose sport is basketball.
4. The person watching spy movies is in an odd position.
5. The chef is in an odd position.
6. The person whose sport is swimming is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
7. The pilot is on the left or right of the person eating pomegranate.
8. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere between the person eating grapes and the owner of the horse.
9. The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the fan of gospel.
10. The pilot is somewhere to the left of the fan of gospel.
11. The person watching disaster movies is in an even position.
12. The owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the fan of metal.

### Step 2: Determine the possible positions for the person watching spy movies and the person watching western movies:
- Spy movies must be in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Western movies must be in an even position (2).

### Step 3: Determine the possible positions for the person eating pomegranate and the person watching spy movies:
- Spy movies are in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Pomegranate cannot be with goldfish.
- Spy movies are to the left of western movies, so if spy movies are in position 1, western movies must be in position 2.

### Step 4: Determine the possible positions for the person eating mango and the sport of basketball:
- Mango is on the right of basketball.
- If basketball is in position 1, mango must be in position 2 or 3.
- If basketball is in position 2, mango must be in position 3.
- If basketball is in position 3, mango must be in position 1 (but this would conflict with Spy movies being in position 1).

### Step 5: Determine the positions for the chef and the pilot:
- Chef is in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Pilot can be anywhere but must be to the left of the fan of gospel.
- Pilot is also on the left or right of the person eating pomegranate.

### Step 6: Determine the positions for the sports and movies:
- Swimming is to the left of disaster movies.
- Disaster movies are in an even position (2 or 4), so swimming must be in position 1 or 3.

### Step 7: Determine the positions for the pets and music genres:
- Rabbit is between grapes and horse.
- Goldfish is to the left of gospel fans.
- Pomegranate is to the left or right of gospel fans.

### Final Solution:

- So, the manager cannot be in column 1.
- From clue 5, the manager is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is collecting.
- Since the manager cannot be in column 1, it must be in column 2 or 3.

#### Step 5: Identify the Collecting Hobby

#### Step 7: Determine the Journalist and Soy-Milk
- Since the filmmaker is in column 2, the journalist must be in column 3.
- Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk is in column 1.

```

#### Step 8: Determine the Almond Milk
- From clue 9, the person drinking almond-milk is not the manager.
- Since the manager is in column 2 or 3, the person drinking almond-milk must be in column 1.

```
|               |      1      |      2      |      3      |

- The person whose hobby is collecting is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies (clue 7).

Since the person watching time-travel movies is in column 1, the person whose hobby is collecting is in column 2.

- The person drinking almond-milk is not the manager (clue 9).

Therefore, the manager must be in column 3.

- The scientist is the fan of r&b (clue 3).
