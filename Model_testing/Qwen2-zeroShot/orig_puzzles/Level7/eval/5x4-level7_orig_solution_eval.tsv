Lv7-5x4-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Organize Clues and Deductions

1. **Clue 7:** The person eating carrot is the person who's hobby is puzzles.
2. **Clue 11:** The person who's hobby is gardening is on the far right (position 4).

So, we can place:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      |          |            | gardening  |
```

3. **Clue 17:** The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere between the person watching thriller movies and the person who's hobby is gardening.
   - This means the person with hobby ""reading"" must be in position 2 or 3.
   
4. **Clue 15:** The person who's hobby is board-games is not the person watching zombie movies.
5. **Clue 12:** The person who's sport is handball is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing.
6. **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is handball is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing.
7. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is handball.
8. **Clue 10:** The person who's sport is rugby is not the person driving the train.
9. **Clue 8:** The person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person eating cucumber.
10. **Clue 1:** The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skiing.
11. **Clue 3:** The person watching horror movies is somewhere between the person driving the van and the person watching thriller movies.
12. **Clue 4:** The person eating lime is on the right of the person eating strawberry.
13. **Clue 13:** The person eating lime is on the left or right of the person eating strawberry.
14. **Clue 14:** The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
15. **Clue 16:** The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching zombie movies.
16. **Clue 6:** The person watching thriller movies is not the person driving the motorbike.
17. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
18. **Clue 18:** The person watching horror movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating carrot.

### Step 2: Place Known Values

From Clue 7 and Clue 11, we know:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      |          |            | gardening  |
| Sport         |              |          |            |            |
| Transport     |              |          |            |            |
```

From Clue 17, since the person with hobby ""reading"" must be between the person watching thriller movies and the person with hobby ""gardening"", and the person with hobby ""gardening"" is in position 4, the person with hobby ""reading"" must be in position 2 or 3. Let's assume for now that it is in position 2:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | reading  |            | gardening  |
| Sport         |              |          |            |            |
| Transport     |              |          |            |            |
```

From Clue 15, the person with hobby ""board-games"" cannot be the one watching zombie movies, so let's place ""board-games"" in position 3:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | reading  | board-games| gardening  |
| Sport         |              |          |            |            |
| Transport     |              |          |            |            |
```

From Clue 18, the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person eating carrot, so let's place ""horror"" in position 3 or 4. Since ""board-games"" is already in position 3, ""horror"" must be in position 4:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | reading  | board-games| gardening  |
| Sport         |              |          |            |            |
| Transport     |              |          |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |              |          | horror     |            |
```

From Clue 1, the person eating strawberry is to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since ""skiing"" is in position 3, the person eating strawberry must be in position 4:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | reading  | board-games| gardening  |
| Sport         |              |          | skiing     |            |
| Transport     |              |          |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |              |          | horror     | strawberry |
```

From Clue 4, the person eating lime is to the right of the person eating strawberry. Since ""strawberry"" is in position 4, ""lime"" must be in position 3:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | reading  | board-games| gardening  |
| Sport         |              |          | skiing     |            |

| Movie-Genre   |              |          | horror     |            |
```

From Clue 10, the person who's sport is handball is to the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Since ""skiing"" is in position 3, ""handball"" must be in position 1:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | reading  | board-games| gardening  |
| Sport         | handball     |          | skiing     |            |

| Movie-Genre   |              |          | horror     |            |
```

From Clue 5, the person who's sport is rugby is to the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since ""handball"" is in position 1, ""rugby"" must be in position 2:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | reading  | board-games| gardening  |
| Sport         | handball     | rugby    | skiing     |            |
| Transport     |              |          | lime       | strawberry |
| Movie-Genre   |              |          | horror     |            |
```

From Clue 12, the person driving the train is to the right of the person eating cucumber. Since ""cucumber"" is not yet placed, let's place ""cucumber"" in position 2:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |

| Movie-Genre   |              |          | horror     |            |
```

From Clue 8, the person driving the train is to the right of the person eating cucumber. Since ""cucumber"" is in position 2, the person driving the train must be in position 3:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | reading  | board-games| gardening  |
| Sport         | handball     | rugby    | skiing     |            |
| Transport     |              | cucumber | train      | strawberry |
| Movie-Genre   |              |          | horror     |            |
```

From Clue 16, the person driving the jet-ski is to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since ""zombie"" is not yet placed, let's place ""zombie"" in position 4:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |

| Movie-Genre   |              |          | horror     | zombie     |
```

From Clue 14, the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since ""reading"" is in position 2 and ""water-polo"" is not yet placed, let's place ""water-polo"" in position 3:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |

```

From Clue 13, the person eating lime is to the left or right of the person eating strawberry. Since ""lime"" is in position 3 and ""strawberry"" is in position 4, this condition is satisfied.

From Clue 6, the person watching thriller movies is not the person driving the motorbike. Since ""thriller"" is not yet placed, let's place ""thriller"" in position 1:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |     4      |

| Movie-Genre   | thriller     |          | horror     | zombie     |
```

From Clue 19, the person who's sport is rugby is not the person driving the train. Since ""rugby"" is in position 2 and ""train"" is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

Lv7-5x4-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Step 1: Analyze Clues and Fill in Known Information

1. **Clue 1:** The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice.
2. **Clue 2:** The fan of soul is the person who's hobby is traveling.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

6. **Clue 6:** The fan of reggae is not the person drinking fanta.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the fan of soul.
8. **Clue 8:** The fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere between the person driving the ship and the fan of rock.
10. **Clue 10:** The owner of the fish is somewhere between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person who's hobby is woodworking.

12. **Clue 13:** The fan of metal is on the right of the person drinking milk.
14. **Clue 14:** The fan of metal is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway.
15. **Clue 15:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
16. **Clue 16:** The owner of the rat is the person drinking hot-chocolate.

From these clues, we can start filling in some information:

|               |      1      |    2    |     3     |       4       |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Beverage      |             |         |           |               |
| Hobby         |             |         |           |               |
| Music-Genre   |             |         |           |               |
| Pet           |             |         | gold      |               |
| Transport     |             |         |           |               |

### Step 2: Deduce from Known Information

- From **Clue 16**, the owner of the rat (who is also the person drinking hot-chocolate) must be in position 1.
- From **Clue 5**, the owner of the goldfish must be in position 3 since the owner of the rat is in position 1.
- From **Clue 15**, the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in position 2 because the person drinking fanta (position 4) is to the right of the person with the hobby of woodworking.

Now let's place the known values:

|               |      1      |    2    |     3     |       4       |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate|         | goldfish  |               |
| Hobby         | woodworking |         |           |               |
| Music-Genre   |             |         |           |               |
| Pet           |             |         | gold      |               |
| Transport     |             |         |           |               |

### Step 3: Continue with Remaining Clues

- From **Clue 1**, the person drinking juice must be in position 4 since the owner of the rat (hot-chocolate) is in position 1.
- From **Clue 7**, the person with the hobby of puzzles must be in position 1 or 2 (since the fan of soul is traveling and puzzles is to the left).
- From **Clue 2**, the fan of soul must be in position 4 (traveling).
- From **Clue 8**, the person drinking fanta must be in position 3 (since soul is in position 4).

Now we have:

|               |      1      |    2    |     3     |       4       |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate|         | goldfish  | fanta        |
| Hobby         | woodworking | puzzles |           | traveling    |
| Music-Genre   |             |         |           |               |
| Pet           |             |         | gold      |               |
| Transport     |             |         |           |               |

- From **Clue 10**, the owner of the fish must be in position 2 since it is between the person with the hobby of traveling (4) and woodworking (2).

Now we have:

|               |      1      |    2    |     3     |       4       |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate|         | goldfish  | fanta        |
| Hobby         | woodworking | puzzles |           | traveling    |
| Music-Genre   |             |         |           |               |
| Pet           |             | fish    | gold      |               |
| Transport     |             |         |           |               |

- From **Clue 11**, the person drinking hot-chocolate (1) is to the right of the owner of the fish (2), which is consistent.
- From **Clue 4**, the person driving the subway (left of ship) and **Clue 14**, the fan of metal is to the left of the person driving the subway.

Since the person driving the subway is to the right of the person driving the boat and to the left of the ship, the only possible arrangement is:

- Boat (1)
- Subway (2)
- Ship (3)

Now we have:

|               |      1      |    2    |     3     |       4       |

| Pet           |             | fish    | gold      |               |
| Transport     | boat        | subway  | ship      |               |

- From **Clue 6**, the fan of reggae cannot be fanta, so reggae must be in position 2.
- From **Clue 12**, the fan of metal is on the right of the person drinking milk, so milk must be in position 3.
- From **Clue 13**, the person drinking milk is the person drinking milk (position 3).

Now we have:

|               |      1      |    2    |     3     |       4       |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate| milk    | goldfish  | fanta        |
| Hobby         | woodworking | puzzles |           | traveling    |
| Music-Genre   | metal       | reggae  | rock      | soul         |
| Pet           |             | fish    | gold      |               |
| Transport     | boat        | subway  | ship      |               |

- From **Clue 9**, the person who's hobby is traveling is between the person driving the ship and the fan of rock, which is consistent.

| Transport     |            |           |              |         |

#### Step 2:
From clue 2, the Egyptian is driving the jet-ski.

|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |

| Transport     | Jet-ski    |           |              |         |

#### Step 3:
From clue 11, the person watching martial-arts movies (position 4) is on the left or right of the German. Since position 4 is occupied by the German, the German must be in position 4.

| Transport     | Jet-ski    |           |              |         |

#### Step 4:
From clue 13, the Pakistani is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski (Egyptian). Since the Egyptian is in position 1, the Pakistani can only be in positions 2 or 3.

#### Step 5:
From clue 10, the Pakistani is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the snowmobile. Since the Pakistani is in either position 2 or 3, the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in position 1 or 4.

#### Step 6:
From clue 6, the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person driving the boat. Therefore, the person drinking mirinda cannot be in position 4.

#### Step 7:
From clue 3, the person driving the boat is not the person watching martial-arts movies (German). Thus, the person driving the boat must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

#### Step 8:
From clue 1, the person watching martial-arts movies (German) is between the person drinking fanta and the person drinking water. Since German is in position 4, the person drinking fanta and the person drinking water must be in positions 1 and 3.

#### Step 9:
From clue 9, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking water. This means the person drinking almond-milk can be in positions 1 or 3 if the person drinking water is in position 4.

From clue 5, the person eating eggplant is on the left of the Egyptian. Therefore, the person eating eggplant must be in position 1 or 2.

```

#### Step 2: Place Crime and Broccoli

```
|               |      1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |

| Transport     | Van         |          |          |            |
```

#### Step 3: Place Crime and Epic
Crime is between Superhero and Kale.

```
|               |      1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |
| Food          | Broccoli    |          |          |            |

```

#### Step 4: Place Surfing and d&b
Surfing is between Biathlon and Lacrosse, and d&b is to the left of Trike.

```

| Transport     | Van         |          |          |            |
```

Since d&b is to the left of Trike, d&b can be at position 2, and Trike can be at position 3 or 4.

#### Step 5: Place d&b and Trike
Since d&b is to the left of Trike, and d&b cannot be at position 1, d&b is at position 2, and Trike is at position 3.

```
|               |      1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |

```

#### Step 7: Place Electronic
Electronic cannot be at position 1 or 2, and it cannot be Grapes. Since Electronic is not Grapes, it can be at position 4.

```
|               |      1      |    2     |    3     |     4      |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the person watching sports movies
From Clue 2 and Clue 8:
- The person watching sports movies is either at position 1 or 4.
- The person who's sport is volleyball is the person watching sports movies.

Thus, the person at position 4 is the one who plays volleyball and watches sports movies.

#### Step 2: Identify the person drinking iced-tea
From Clue 1 and Clue 4:
- The person drinking iced-tea is the fan of punk and also the person watching superhero movies.
- Therefore, the person at position 1 drinks iced-tea and is the fan of punk and watches superhero movies.

#### Step 3: Identify the person who's hobby is photography
From Clue 6:
- The person who's hobby is photography is on the far right (position 4).

Since the person at position 4 is already identified as the one who plays volleyball and watches sports movies, the person with photography is the same person, which contradicts the previous steps. Let's re-evaluate:

- Since the person at position 4 is the one who plays volleyball and watches sports movies, the person with photography must be at position 3.

#### Step 4: Identify the person drinking cola
From Clue 10:
- The person drinking cola is the one who watches scientific movies.

From Clue 7:
- The person drinking 7up is to the left of the person watching scientific movies.

Thus, the person at position 3 drinks cola and watches scientific movies.

#### Step 5: Identify the person drinking 7up
From Clue 7:
- The person drinking 7up is to the left of the person drinking cola (position 3).

Thus, the person at position 2 drinks 7up.

#### Step 6: Identify the person drinking water
The only remaining beverage is water for the person at position 1.

#### Step 7: Identify the person who's hobby is singing
From Clue 5:
- The person who's hobby is singing is not the person drinking cola (position 3).

Since the person at position 1 drinks iced-tea, the person at position 3 drinks cola, and the person at position 4 plays volleyball, the person at position 2 drinks 7up, the person at position 1 must be the one who's hobby is singing.

#### Step 8: Identify the person who's sport is ice-hockey
From Clue 11:
- The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person watching sports movies (position 4) and the person drinking iced-tea (position 1).

Thus, the person at position 3 plays ice-hockey.

#### Step 9: Identify the person who's hobby is chess
From Clue 13:
- The person who's hobby is chess is to the right of the person watching sports movies (position 4).

Thus, the person at position 2 has the hobby of chess.

#### Step 10: Identify the person who's hobby is dancing
From Clue 3:
- The fan of trance is between the fan of punk (position 1) and the person who's hobby is dancing.

Thus, the person at position 2 has the hobby of dancing.

#### Step 11: Identify the person who's hobby is photography
From Clue 6:
- The person who's hobby is photography is on the far right (position 4).

Thus, the person at position 4 has the hobby of photography.

#### Step 12: Identify the person who's fan of metal
From Clue 12:
- The person watching thriller movies is to the right of the fan of metal.

Thus, the person at position 1 is the fan of metal.

#### Step 13: Identify the person who's fan of trance
From Clue 3:
- The fan of trance is between the fan of punk (position 1) and the person who's hobby is dancing (position 2).

Thus, the person at position 3 is the fan of trance.

#### Step 14: Identify the person who's fan of punk
From Clue 1:
- The person drinking iced-tea (position 1) is the fan of punk.

Thus, the person at position 1 is the fan of punk.
