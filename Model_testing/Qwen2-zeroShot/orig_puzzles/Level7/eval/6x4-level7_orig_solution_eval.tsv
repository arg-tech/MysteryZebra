3. The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
4. The Australian is on the far left.
5. The person whose hobby is fishing is not the architect.
6. The accountant is on the right of the Canadian.
7. The person whose hobby is baking is the Canadian.

12. The Egyptian is not the person whose hobby is fishing.
13. The videographer is between the entrepreneur and the person driving the motorbike.
14. The person driving the car is on the far left.
15. The person whose hobby is chess is on the far left.
16. The person whose hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat.
17. The person whose hobby is baking is between the fan of r&b and the owner of the hedgehog.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The Australian is on the far left.
2. **Clue 15**: The person whose hobby is chess is on the far left (same as the Australian).
3. **Clue 14**: The person driving the car is on the far left (same as the Australian).

So, the Australian is in position 1, with chess and driving the car.

|               |      1       |      2       |     3      |     4     |
| Hobby         | Chess        |              |            |           |
| Job           | Accountant   |              |            |           |
| Music-Genre   | Funk         |              |            |           |
| Nationality   | Australian   |              |            |           |
| Pet           | Bird         |              |            |           |
| Transport     | Car          |              |            |           |

4. **Clue 1**: The owner of the bird is not the fan of trance.
5. **Clue 10**: The Egyptian is the owner of the pony.
6. **Clue 12**: The Egyptian is not the person whose hobby is fishing.

Since the Egyptian is the owner of the pony, they cannot be in position 1 (Australian) or 2 (since it would contradict clue 12). Thus, the Egyptian must be in position 3 or 4.

7. **Clue 13**: The videographer is between the entrepreneur and the person driving the motorbike.
8. **Clue 11**: The owner of the goat is the person driving the motorbike.
9. **Clue 16**: The person whose hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat.
10. **Clue 17**: The person whose hobby is baking is between the fan of r&b and the owner of the hedgehog.

Let's place the owner of the goat first, then the motorbike driver, and the videographer.

If the owner of the goat is in position 4, then the motorbike driver is in position 3 (clue 11).

|               |      1       |      2       |     3      |     4     |

| Music-Genre   | Funk         |              | Reggae     |           |
| Nationality   | Australian   |              | Egyptian   |           |
| Pet           | Bird         |              | Pony       |           |
| Transport     | Car          |              | Motorbike  | Goat      |

11. **Clue 7**: The person whose hobby is baking is the Canadian.
12. **Clue 2**: The person whose hobby is drawing is not the Mexican.
13. **Clue 3**: The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
14. **Clue 9**: The person whose hobby is fishing is on the left of the person whose hobby is drawing.
15. **Clue 5**: The person whose hobby is fishing is not the architect.
16. **Clue 6**: The accountant is on the right of the Canadian.

Since the Canadian is in position 3 (hobby is baking), the Mexican cannot be in position 2 (clue 3). The Mexican must be in position 4 (clue 3).

| Transport     | Car          | Motorbike    | Motorbike  | Goat      |

17. **Clue 8**: The person driving the boat is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the Australian.

The person driving the boat is in position 2 (clue 8).

|               |      1       |      2       |     3      |     4     |

| Transport     | Car          | Boat         | Motorbike  | Goat      |

Now, filling in the remaining details:

- The accountant is on the right of the Canadian (clue 6).
- The person whose hobby is fishing is not the architect (clue 5).

Since the accountant is in position 2, the job must be entrepreneur (clue 6).

|               |      1       |      2       |     3      |     4     |

- The person whose hobby is fishing is not the architect.
- The person driving the car is on the far left (clue 14).

Thus, the final solution is:

16. The person whose hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.

We will now place the items in the table based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 14:** The person whose sport is surfing is on the far left or far right.
   - Let's assume Surfing is on position 1 (far left).

2. **Clue 10:** The fan of electronic is between the person whose hobby is baking and the person drinking almond milk.
   - Since Surfing is at 1, the fan of electronic cannot be at 1. Let's assume Electronic is at 2 for now.

3. **Clue 11:** The fan of reggae is between the fan of electronic and the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.
   - If Electronic is at 2, Reggae must be at 3 (since Rock-climbing can only be at 4).

4. **Clue 13:** The fan of electronic is between the fan of ambient and the person whose hobby is puzzles.
   - This confirms that Electronic is at 2, Ambient is at 1, and Puzzles is at 4.

5. **Clue 12:** The person driving the airplane is not the person whose sport is skiing.
   - Let's assume Airplane is at 2 (consistent with Electronic being at 2).

6. **Clue 3:** The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person drinking cola.
   - Motorbike cannot be at 4 (since Electronic is at 2), so let's assume Motorbike is at 3, and Cola is at 4.

7. **Clue 15:** The person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
   - Ship must be at 4 (consistent with Cola being at 4).

8. **Clue 7:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person eating strawberry.
   - Puzzles is at 4, so Strawberry must be at 5.

9. **Clue 5:** The person drinking mirinda is the person eating strawberry.
   - Mirinda must be at 5.

10. **Clue 4:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine.
    - Puzzles is at 4, so Nectarine must be at 3.

11. **Clue 6:** The person whose sport is baseball is on the left or right of the fan of electronic.
    - Baseball cannot be at 2 (Electronic), so it must be at 1 or 4. Let's assume Baseball is at 1.

12. **Clue 9:** The person whose sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the left of the person eating apple.
    - Skateboarding cannot be at 4 (Apple), so it must be at 1, 2, or 3. Since Baseball is at 1, Skateboarding must be at 2 or 3. But Electronic is at 2, so Skateboarding must be at 3.

13. **Clue 8:** The person driving the quad-bike is not the person whose hobby is dancing.
    - Quad-bike must be at 1 (Baseball), and Dancing cannot be at 1, so Dancing must be at 2 or 4. Since Electronic is at 2, Dancing must be at 4.

14. **Clue 2:** The person whose sport is baseball is not the person eating apple.
    - Baseball is at 1, so Apple cannot be at 1. Apple must be at 3 (Nectarine is at 3).
