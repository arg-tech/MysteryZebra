Lv7-2x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The owner of the rat is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the owner of the ferret.**
   - This means the order could be: Drama, Rat, Ferret or Ferret, Rat, Drama.

2. **The owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret.**
   - This means if the ferret is in position 1, the bird must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the ferret is in position 2, the bird must be in position 3.
   - If the ferret is in position 3, there is no room for the bird (since it must be to the right).

3. **The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret.**
   - This means if the ferret is in position 1, the mystery must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the ferret is in position 2, the mystery must be in position 3.
   - If the ferret is in position 3, there is no room for the mystery (since it must be to the right).

### Possible Arrangements:
Given these clues, we can start with the possible positions for the ferret:

#### Case 1: Ferret in Position 1
- The bird must be in position 2 or 3.
- The mystery must be in position 2 or 3.
- But since the bird and mystery cannot both be in positions 2 or 3 (as they must be to the right of the ferret), this case is invalid.

#### Case 2: Ferret in Position 2
- The bird must be in position 3.
- The mystery must be in position 3 (since it is to the right of the ferret).
- This leaves drama in position 1.
- The rat must be between drama and the ferret, which fits as drama, rat, ferret.

#### Case 3: Ferret in Position 3
- There is no room for the bird (as it must be to the right of the ferret) and the mystery (as it must also be to the right of the ferret).
- This case is invalid.

Thus, the only valid arrangement is:
- Position 1: Drama
- Position 2: Rat
- Position 3: Ferret
- Position 3: Bird
- Position 3: Mystery

Lv7-2x3-2	"Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step by step.

### Given Information:
1. There are three different music genres: **country**, **electronic**, and **reggae**.
2. There are three different means of transport: **subway**, **tram**, and **van**.
3. The person driving the subway is in an odd position (position 1).
4. The fan of country is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the person driving the tram.
5. The person driving the subway is on the far right (position 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Person Driving the Subway
From point 3, we know the person driving the subway is in position 3. So, the table now looks like this:

|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   |            |         | **subway** |
| Transport     |            |         | **driving** |

#### Step 2: Positioning the Fan of Country
From point 4, the fan of country is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the person driving the tram. Since the person driving the subway is in position 3, the person driving the tram must be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the fan of country cannot be in position 1 (since it would not be between the fan of reggae and the person driving the tram). Hence, the fan of country must be in position 2.

Now, let's place the fan of country in position 2 and see where the fan of reggae and the person driving the tram can go.

|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   |            | **country** | **subway** |
| Transport     |            |         | **driving** |

#### Step 3: Determining the Remaining Positions
Since the person driving the tram cannot be in position 2 (as the fan of country is there), the person driving the tram must be in position 1. This leaves position 2 for the fan of reggae.

So, the table now looks like this:

|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | **reggae** | **country** | **subway** |
| Transport     | **driving** |         | **subway** |

Finally, the only genre left is **electronic**, which must be in position 1.

|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | **electronic** | **country** | **subway** |
| Transport     | **driving** |         | **subway** |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | electronic | country | subway |

Lv7-2x3-3	"Let's break down the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

### Clue Breakdown:
1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the subway is somewhere between the person drinking coffee and the person driving the roller.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.

### Initial Setup:
We have three positions (1, 2, 3) for both beverages and transport modes.

|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Beverage    | Coffee | Mirinda | Water  |
| Transport   |        |         |        |

### Applying Clue 1:
- The person driving the subway is between the person drinking coffee and the person driving the roller.
- This means the subway driver cannot be in position 1 or 3; it must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the subway driver is in position 2.

### Applying Clue 2:
- The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
- This means the train driver must be in position 1 or 2, and the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since we already know the subway driver is in position 2, the train driver must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3.

### Positioning the Remaining Elements:
- Now, we have:
  - Train driver in position 1.
  - Subway driver in position 2.
  - Person drinking mirinda in position 3.

- The remaining beverage (water) must be in position 1, and the remaining transport mode (roller) must be in position 3.

### Final Table:
|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Beverage    | Water  | Mirinda | Coffee |
| Transport   | Train  | Subway  | Roller |

### Final Solution:
```
|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Beverage    | Water  | Mirinda | Coffee |

Lv7-2x3-4	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to solve this logic puzzle.

### Clues Recap:
1. The project-manager is somewhere between the person watching time-travel movies and the scientist.
2. The person watching comedy movies is not the project-manager.
3. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching comedy movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The project-manager is somewhere between the person watching time-travel movies and the scientist.
This means that if we list the people in order from left to right (1, 2, 3), the project-manager must be in the middle position. So, the project-manager can only be in position 2.

#### Clue 2: The person watching comedy movies is not the project-manager.
Since the project-manager is in position 2, the person watching comedy movies cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the person watching comedy movies must be either in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 3: The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching comedy movies.
If the person watching comedy movies is in position 1, then the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the project-manager is in position 2, the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 3.

If the person watching comedy movies is in position 3, then the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 2, but this would contradict clue 1 because the project-manager must be in position 2. Therefore, the person watching comedy movies must be in position 1, and the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- Position 1: Comedy
- Position 2: Project-Manager
- Position 3: Time-Travel

Now, let's assign the jobs to these positions based on the constraints:

- Since the project-manager is in position 2, the job for position 2 must be project-manager.
- The remaining jobs (scientist and teacher) must be assigned to positions 1 and 3.
- Since the person watching comedy movies is in position 1, the job for position 1 must be either scientist or teacher.
- Since the person watching time-travel movies is in position 3, the job for position 3 must be either scientist or teacher.

To satisfy all conditions, let's assign the jobs:
- Position 1: Scientist (since the project-manager is in position 2 and the scientist cannot be in position 2)
- Position 2: Project-Manager
- Position 3: Teacher

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv7-2x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the correct pairing of music genres with transportation methods based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere between the person driving the skateboard and the fan of hip-hop.
   - This means the order could be: Skateboard -> Quad-bike -> Hip-hop or Hip-hop -> Quad-bike -> Skateboard.

2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the fan of salsa.
   - This means the order could be: Salsa -> Motorbike or Salsa -> Motorbike -> Other.

3. **Clue 3:** The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.
   - From Clue 1, we already know the hip-hop fan must be next to the quad-bike driver, so this clue doesn't provide new information but confirms the order from Clue 1.

Now, let's combine these clues to find the correct order:

- From Clue 1, we have two possible orders for the quad-bike:
  1. Skateboard -> Quad-bike -> Hip-hop
  2. Hip-hop -> Quad-bike -> Skateboard

- From Clue 2, we know that the motorbike must be to the right of the fan of salsa. This limits the possible positions of the motorbike.

Let's test each possibility:

### Testing Possibility 1: Skateboard -> Quad-bike -> Hip-hop
- If this is true, then the remaining person (who is not skateboard, quad-bike, or hip-hop) must be the fan of salsa.
- Since the motorbike must be to the right of the fan of salsa, the only position left for the motorbike is position 3.
- This gives us: Salsa -> Motorbike -> Disco (since the remaining genre is disco).

So, the order would be:
- Position 1: Salsa
- Position 2: Skateboard
- Position 3: Motorbike (Hip-hop)

This fits all the clues:
- The quad-bike is between the skateboard and hip-hop.
- The motorbike is to the right of the salsa fan.
- The hip-hop fan is next to the quad-bike.

### Testing Possibility 2: Hip-hop -> Quad-bike -> Skateboard
- If this is true, then the remaining person (who is not hip-hop, quad-bike, or skateboard) must be the fan of salsa.
- Since the motorbike must be to the right of the fan of salsa, the only position left for the motorbike is position 3.
- This gives us: Salsa -> Motorbike -> Disco (since the remaining genre is disco).

However, this does not fit Clue 1 because the quad-bike is not between the skateboard and hip-hop.

Therefore, the correct solution is:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3     |
| Music-Genre   | Disco      | Skateboard| Hip-hop   |
| Transport     | Salsa      |           | Motorbike |
```

Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3     |
| Music-Genre   | Disco      | Skateboard| Hip-hop   |
| Transport     | Salsa      |           | Motorbike |

Lv7-2x3-6	"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. **The Colombian is on the left or right of the Japanese.**
2. **The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the Colombian.**
3. **The fan of jazz is on the right of the Pakistani.**
4. **The fan of jazz is somewhere between the Pakistani and the fan of blues.**

From clue 1 and 2, we can deduce that the Japanese must be to the left of the Colombian. Therefore, the possible positions for the Japanese and Colombian are:
- Japanese (1), Colombian (2)
- Japanese (1), Colombian (3)

From clue 3 and 4, we know that the fan of jazz is on the right of the Pakistani and is also between the Pakistani and the fan of blues. This means the sequence must be:
- Pakistani, Fan of Jazz, Fan of Blues

Given these constraints, let's test the possible configurations:

### Configuration 1: Japanese (1), Colombian (2)
- The only way to fit the sequence Pakistani, Fan of Jazz, Fan of Blues is if:
  - Position 1: Japanese
  - Position 2: Colombian
  - Position 3: Fan of Jazz (since it must be on the right of the Pakistani and between the Pakistani and the fan of blues)

This configuration does not work because there is no place for the Pakistani and the fan of blues.

### Configuration 2: Japanese (1), Colombian (3)
- The only way to fit the sequence Pakistani, Fan of Jazz, Fan of Blues is if:
  - Position 1: Japanese
  - Position 2: Fan of Jazz
  - Position 3: Fan of Blues (Pakistani must be in position 2 since it needs to be on the left of the Fan of Jazz and to the left of the Fan of Blues)

This configuration works perfectly. So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Japanese
- Position 2: Pakistani
- Position 3: Fan of Jazz
- Position 4: Fan of Blues

Now, let's fill in the nationality and music genre information:

|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Music-Genre   | Jazz     | Blues   | Reggae   |
| Nationality   | Japanese | Pakistani | Colombian |

Thus, the final solution table is:

|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Music-Genre   | Jazz     | Blues   | Reggae   |

### Clues:
1. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere between the owner of the goat and the person who's sport is badminton.
3. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the rat.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1 & 2:
From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce that the order must be:
- Badminton (leftmost), Skateboarding (middle), Basketball (rightmost).

So, the sports are arranged as:
```
| Sport    | Badminton | Skateboarding | Basketball |
```

#### Clue 3:
From Clue 3, we know the pets are arranged as:
- Rat (leftmost), Goldfish (middle), Goat (rightmost).

So, the pets are arranged as:
```
| Pet      | Rat      | Goldfish     | Goat       |
```

### Combining Both Arrangements:
Now, we need to place the sports and pets together in a way that satisfies all the conditions.

Since the sports are arranged as:
```
| Sport    | Badminton | Skateboarding | Basketball |
```

And the pets are arranged as:
```
| Pet      | Rat       | Goldfish     | Goat       |
```

We can now combine them:
```
| Pet      | Rat       | Goldfish     | Goat       |
| Sport    | Badminton | Skateboarding | Basketball |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues:
1. Skateboarding is on the right of Badminton.
2. Skateboarding is between the owner of the goat and the person who's sport is badminton.
3. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the rat.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the doctor**.
2. **The person watching mystery movies is somewhere between the person watching western movies and the electrician**.
3. **The person watching sports movies is on the right of the doctor**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions for each job and movie genre based on the given clues**:

   - Let's denote the positions as follows:
     - Position 1: Leftmost
     - Position 2: Middle
     - Position 3: Rightmost

2. **Clue 1**: The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the doctor.
   - This means the doctor cannot be in position 2 (middle), because the person watching western movies would then be either in position 1 or 3, which would place the doctor between them, violating the clue.

3. **Clue 2**: The person watching mystery movies is somewhere between the person watching western movies and the electrician.
   - This implies that the person watching western movies must be either in position 1 or 3, and the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 3**: The person watching sports movies is on the right of the doctor.
   - Since the doctor cannot be in position 2 (middle), and the person watching sports movies must be to the right of the doctor, the doctor must be in position 1 or 3.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints:
- If the doctor is in position 1, the person watching sports movies would be in position 3, and the person watching western movies would be in position 2.
- If the doctor is in position 3, the person watching sports movies would be in position 2, and the person watching western movies would be in position 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Doctor in Position 1
- Position 1: Doctor
- Position 2: Mystery (must be between Western and Electrician)
- Position 3: Sports (right of Doctor)

This does not satisfy Clue 2 since there is no one between the person watching western movies and the electrician.

#### Scenario 2: Doctor in Position 3
- Position 1: Western (left of Doctor)
- Position 2: Mystery (between Western and Electrician)
- Position 3: Sports (right of Doctor)

This satisfies all the clues:
- The person watching western movies is on the left of the doctor.
- The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching western movies and the electrician.
- The person watching sports movies is on the right of the doctor.

Lv7-2x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and use them to fill out the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The teacher is not the person who's hobby is writing.
2. The manager is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
3. The doctor is somewhere between the manager and the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The teacher is not the person who's hobby is writing.
This means the teacher either has chess or filmmaking as their hobby.

#### Clue 2: The manager is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
This means if someone has writing as their hobby, the manager must be in the third position (Job 3).

#### Clue 3: The doctor is somewhere between the manager and the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
This means the doctor cannot be in the first or last position if the person with the filmmaking hobby is in the second or third position, respectively.

### Let's start filling the table based on these clues:

1. **Hobby 1:**
   - If the teacher has chess or filmmaking, the manager must be in position 3 (Job 3).
   - If the manager is in position 3, the doctor must be between the manager and the person with the filmmaking hobby.

2. **Hobby 2:**
   - This position can only be filled with the remaining hobby that is not in position 1.

3. **Hobby 3:**
   - This must be the remaining hobby.

Given these constraints, let's try a possible arrangement:

- Assume the person with the hobby of writing is in position 1 (Hobby 1).
- Then the manager must be in position 3 (Job 3) according to clue 2.
- The doctor must be in position 2 (Job 2) because it must be between the manager and the person with the filmmaking hobby.

Now, let's assign the jobs and hobbies accordingly:

1. **Hobby 1: Writing**
2. **Hobby 2: Chess**
3. **Hobby 3: Filmmaking**

1. **Job 1: Teacher**
2. **Job 2: Doctor**
3. **Job 3: Manager**

### Final Table:
```
|         |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Writing    | Chess   | Filmmaking |
| Job     | Teacher    | Doctor  | Manager   |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues:
- The teacher does not have writing as a hobby.
- The manager is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
- The doctor is between the manager and the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given conditions:**
   - The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
   - The person who's sport is tennis is the person drinking milk.
   - The person drinking sprite is somewhere between the person drinking milk and the person who's sport is skiing.

2. **Assign sports and beverages based on the conditions:**
   - From condition 2, the person who drinks milk does tennis.
   - From condition 3, the person who drinks sprite is between the person who drinks milk (tennis) and the person who does skiing.

Let's denote:
- \( C \): Coffee
- \( M \): Milk
- \( S \): Sprite

- \( B \): Badminton
- \( T \): Tennis
- \( S_ \): Skiing

### Deductions:
1. **Condition 2:** The person who drinks milk does tennis.
   - Therefore, the person drinking milk is doing tennis.

2. **Condition 3:** The person drinking sprite is between the person drinking milk (tennis) and the person doing skiing.
   - This means the person drinking sprite cannot be at position 1 because there would be no one to its left.
   - Therefore, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **Condition 1:** The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
   - This means the person drinking coffee must be in position 3 if the person drinking sprite is in position 2.
   - If the person drinking sprite is in position 3, then the person drinking coffee must be in position 1.

### Final Arrangement:
- Position 1: Coffee
