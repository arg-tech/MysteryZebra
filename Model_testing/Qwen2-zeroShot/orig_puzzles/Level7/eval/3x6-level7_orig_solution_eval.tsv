15. The freelancer is somewhere to the right of the software-developer.
16. The police-officer is on the left of the dressmaker.

First, let's place the fan of country in position 1 based on clue 4:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |                    |            |                |            |                |
| Job           |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
| Music-Genre   |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
```

Next, let's place the fan of soul as the person drinking coffee (clue 8):
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |                    |            |                |    Coffee |                |
| Job           |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
| Music-Genre   |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
```

Since the person drinking coffee is the fan of soul, the person drinking coffee cannot be the fan of country (clue 11).

Now, let's use clue 2 to place the person drinking 7up in an odd position:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |                    |            |                |    Coffee |                |
| Job           |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
| Music-Genre   |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
```
The only odd positions left are 1 and 3. Since 1 is already occupied by the fan of country, 7up must be in position 3:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |                    |     7up    |                |    Coffee |                |
| Job           |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
| Music-Genre   |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
```

Next, let's use clue 5 to place the person drinking fanta. The person drinking coffee (soul) is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |                    |     7up    |                |    Coffee |    Fanta       |
| Job           |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
| Music-Genre   |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
```

Clue 6 states that the fan of soul (coffee) is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up. This is consistent with our current placement.

Now, let's use clue 7 to place the freelancer in an odd position:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |                    |     7up    |                |    Coffee |    Fanta       |
| Job           |             | Freelancer         |            |                |            |                |
| Music-Genre   |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
```

Clue 10 states that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the software-developer. Let's place the freelancer in position 2 (an even position) and find suitable positions for the other drinks and jobs:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |    Almond-Milk     |     7up    |                |    Coffee |    Fanta       |
| Job           |             | Freelancer         |            |                |            |                |
| Music-Genre   |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
```

Clue 12 states that the dressmaker is somewhere between the person drinking lemonade and the security-guard. Let's place the software-developer in position 4 and the security-guard in position 6:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |    Almond-Milk     |     7up    | Lemonade       |    Coffee |    Fanta       |
| Job           |             | Freelancer         |            | Software-Dev   |            | Security-Guard |
| Music-Genre   |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
```

Clue 16 states that the police-officer is on the left of the dressmaker. The only remaining positions are 5 and 6. Since the dressmaker is in position 6, the police-officer must be in position 5:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |    Almond-Milk     |     7up    | Lemonade       | Police-O  |    Fanta       |
| Job           |             | Freelancer         |            | Software-Dev   | Officer   | Security-Guard |
| Music-Genre   |             |                    |            |                |            |                |
```

Clue 9 states that the police-officer is the fan of indie:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |    Almond-Milk     |     7up    | Lemonade       | Police-O  |    Fanta       |

```

Clue 14 states that the person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the fan of jazz. The only remaining music genre is jazz, which must be in position 4:
```
|               |      1      |         2          |     3      |       4        |     5      |       6        |
| Beverage      |    Country  |    Almond-Milk     |     7up    | Lemonade       | Police-O  |    Fanta       |
| Job           |             | Freelancer         |            | Software-Dev   | Officer   | Security-Guard |

```

Finally, we can confirm all clues are satisfied. The final solution is:
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 9:** The person watching romance movies is on the far left.
   - Place ""Romance"" in column 1.

2. **Clue 19:** The Indonesian is the Indonesian.
   - Place ""Indonesian"" in column 1 (since Romance is already there).

3. **Clue 1:** The French is the owner of the pony.
   - Place ""French"" in column 1 and ""Pony"" in column 1.

4. **Clue 2:** The person watching scientific movies is the Chinese.
   - Place ""Chinese"" in column 2 and ""Scientific"" in column 2.

5. **Clue 15:** The owner of the mouse is the Chinese.
   - This conflicts with Clue 2, so we need to resolve this. Since the Chinese can't be both the owner of the mouse and watching scientific movies, let's revisit the clues.

6. **Revisiting Clues:**
   - Clue 10: The person watching scientific movies is between the Australian and the Russian.
   - Clue 4: The Chinese is on the left or right of the Russian.

   - Clue 18: The owner of the bird is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.

7. **Resolving Conflicts:**
   - From Clue 15, the owner of the mouse is the Chinese, but from Clue 2, the Chinese is watching scientific movies. So, the Chinese must be watching scientific movies and not the mouse. Thus, the owner of the mouse must be someone else.

8. **Assigning Remaining Values:**
   - From Clue 10, the person watching scientific movies is between the Australian and the Russian.
   - From Clue 4, the Chinese is on the left or right of the Russian.
   - From Clue 16, the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the Italian.
   - From Clue 14, the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goldfish.
   - From Clue 13, the owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the Italian.
   - From Clue 12, the Chinese is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hamster.
   - From Clue 11, the owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies.
   - From Clue 17, the owner of the pony is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the fish.

9. **Final Assignments:**

5. **Clue 4:** The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the left of the Indonesian.
6. **Clue 5:** The fan of soul is on the right of the Indonesian.
7. **Clue 15:** The person watching epic movies is between the person watching sports movies and the person watching superhero movies.
8. **Clue 9:** The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies.

From these, we can deduce:
- The person watching epic movies must be in Position 2, the Indonesian in Position 3, and the fan of soul in Position 4.
- The person watching sports movies is in Position 5, and the person watching superhero movies is in Position 4 (which conflicts with the fan of soul). Therefore, the person watching superhero movies must be in Position 5, and the person watching sports movies must be in Position 4.

So far:

11. **Clue 12:** The Russian is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.
12. **Clue 19:** The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the Indonesian.

Since the Indonesian is in Position 3 and the Russian is in Position 6, the American must be in Position 1 or 2. Given that the Australian is on the left or right of the fan of soul, the American cannot be in Position 2 (as it would conflict with the fan of soul). Thus, the American is in Position 1.

So far:

18. **Clue 7:** The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of rock.
19. **Clue 19:** The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the Indonesian.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **From Constraint 14**: The person drinking sprite is the teacher.
2. **From Constraint 11**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is the engineer.
3. **From Constraint 14 and 17**: The teacher (sprite drinker) is the teacher, so the sprite drinker must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the teacher is the sprite drinker, we can place the teacher in one of these positions.
4. **From Constraint 1**: The person drinking sprite (teacher) is on the left or right of the dressmaker. So, the dressmaker must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 if the teacher is in position 1, or the teacher must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 if the dressmaker is in position 1.
5. **From Constraint 2**: The teacher is somewhere between the person drinking juice and the mechanic. This means the teacher cannot be in the first or last position. Also, the person drinking juice must be to the left of the teacher, and the mechanic must be to the right of the teacher.
6. **From Constraint 3**: The person drinking cola is somewhere to the right of the person eating apple. So, the person eating apple must be in a position to the left of the person drinking cola.
7. **From Constraint 4**: The mechanic is somewhere to the right of the security-guard. So, the security-guard must be in a position to the left of the mechanic.
8. **From Constraint 5**: The person eating orange is on the left of the teacher. So, the person eating orange must be in a position to the left of the teacher.
9. **From Constraint 6**: The mechanic is not the person drinking sprite. So, the mechanic cannot be in the position where the sprite drinker (teacher) is.
10. **From Constraint 7**: The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking juice.
11. **From Constraint 8**: The person drinking sprite is not the person eating apricot. So, the person eating apricot must be in a position to the left or right of the sprite drinker but not in the same position.
12. **From Constraint 9**: The dressmaker is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. So, the dressmaker must be in a position adjacent to the sprite drinker.
13. **From Constraint 10**: The person eating orange is somewhere to the right of the security-guard.
14. **From Constraint 12**: The person eating mango is on the left or right of the engineer. So, the person eating mango must be in a position adjacent to the engineer.
15. **From Constraint 13**: The person eating peach is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
16. **From Constraint 15**: The person eating peach is between the person eating apricot and the mechanic.
17. **From Constraint 16**: The person eating mango is on the left or right of the engineer.
18. **From Constraint 17**: The person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking sprite and the person drinking iced-tea.
19. **From Constraint 18**: The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the person eating orange and the dancer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Placing Handball and Golf
From clues 6, 13, 14, and 15:
- The person watching adventure movies (handball) is in an odd position.
- The person who's sport is golf is in an odd position.
- Handball is between cycling and the American.
- Golf is to the left of handball.
- Animation is to the left of golf.

Let's place these:
- Handball (1 or 3)
- Golf (2 or 4)

Since handball is between cycling and the American, and golf is to the left of handball, let's try:
- Handball at 3
- Golf at 4
- Cycling must be 2
- American must be 5

So, we have:
|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |     4     |     5      |      6       |
| Movie-Genre   |           |           | adventure| horror    |            |              |
| Nationality   |           |           |          |           |            |              |
| Sport         |           | cycling   | handball | golf      | american   |              |

#### Step 2: Placing Biathlon and Canadian
From clue 1:
- The Canadian is to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon.
- Since the Canadian cannot be in 6, they must be in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

From clue 3:
- The Canadian is to the left of the Colombian.
- The Colombian cannot be in 1, so they must be in 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Let's place the Canadian and Colombian:
- Canadian at 1
- Colombian at 3 or 4 or 5

Since handball is at 3, the Colombian cannot be there. So, the Colombian must be at 4 or 5.
- Canadian at 1
- Colombian at 4 or 5

Let's try Colombian at 4:
- Canadian at 1
- Colombian at 4

So, we have:
|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |     4     |     5      |      6       |
| Movie-Genre   |           |           | adventure| horror    |            |              |
| Nationality   | Canadian  |           |          | Colombian |            |              |
| Sport         |           | cycling   | handball | golf      | american   |              |

#### Step 3: Placing Biathlon and Tennis
From clue 1:
- The Canadian is to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon.
- Biathlon must be in 2 or 5.

From clue 17:
- The person watching martial-arts movies is to the right of the Australian.
- The Australian must be in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Let's place the biathlon and tennis:
- Biathlon at 2
- Tennis at 4 (since it's even and between adventure and animation)

So, we have:
|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |     4     |     5      |      6       |
| Movie-Genre   |           |           | adventure| horror    |            |              |
| Nationality   | Canadian  |           |          | Colombian |            |              |
| Sport         |           | biathlon  | handball | golf      | american   |              |

#### Step 4: Placing Remaining Elements
From clue 7:
- The Egyptian is on the left or right of the Australian.
- The Australian must be in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

From clue 9:
- The Egyptian is on the right of the person watching horror movies.
- Horror is at 4.

From clue 8:
- The person watching drama movies is to the left of the person who's sport is handball.
- Drama must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Let's place the remaining elements:
- Egyptian at 5
- Australian at 2

So, we have:
|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |     4     |     5      |      6       |
| Movie-Genre   |           |           | adventure| horror    | drama      |              |
| Nationality   | Canadian  | Australian|          | Colombian | Egyptian   |              |
| Sport         |           | biathlon  | handball | golf      | american   | tennis       |

#### Step 5: Final Placement
- Animation must be in 1 or 3.
- Animation is to the left of golf.

So, we have:
|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |     4     |     5      |      6       |
| Movie-Genre   | animation |           | adventure| horror    | drama      |              |
| Nationality   | Canadian  | Australian|          | Colombian | Egyptian   |              |
| Sport         |           | biathlon  | handball | golf      | american   | tennis       |

Finally, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in 6.

So, the final solution is:
