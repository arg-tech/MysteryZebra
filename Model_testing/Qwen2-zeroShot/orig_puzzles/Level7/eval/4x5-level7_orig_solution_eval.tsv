### Analyzing and Arranging:

1. **Positioning Polish:**
   - Polish is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the Polish is on the right of the person eating cucumber, and Polish can't be in position 1 (far left), Polish must be in position 5 (far right).

2. **Positioning Cucumber:**
   - The person eating cucumber is on the left of the Polish.
   - If Polish is in position 5, cucumber must be in position 4.

3. **Positioning Kiwi and Garlic:**
   - Kiwi is to the left of Garlic.
   - From Clue 20, the person watching scientific movies is between the person eating kiwi and the Teacher.
   - From Clue 18, the Pakistani is on the right of the person eating potato.
   - The German is watching disaster movies (Clue 13).

4. **Positioning Disaster Movies:**
   - The German is watching disaster movies.
   - From Clue 2, the person watching disaster movies is not eating kiwi.
   - Therefore, the German cannot be eating kiwi.

5. **Positioning Lawyer:**
   - The Lawyer is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
   - The Lawyer is between the person eating garlic and the person eating cucumber.
   - Since cucumber is in position 4, garlic must be in position 3, and the Lawyer must be in position 2.

6. **Positioning Teacher:**
   - The Teacher is to the left of the Polish (position 5).
   - Since Polish is in position 5, the Teacher must be in position 4.
   - This means the person eating cucumber is the Teacher.

7. **Positioning Engineer:**
   - The Engineer is on the left of the Indonesian.
   - Since the Engineer is not in position 5 (Polish) or 4 (Teacher), the Engineer must be in position 1.
   - The Indonesian must be in position 2 (Lawyer), which conflicts with the Engineer being in position 1. Thus, the Engineer must be in position 3, and the Indonesian must be in position 4 (Teacher).

8. **Positioning Electrician:**
   - The Electrician is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies.
   - The person watching thriller movies cannot be in position 1 (Engineer) or 2 (Lawyer).
   - Therefore, the Electrician must be in position 1, and the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3 (Garlic).

9. **Final Positioning:**
   - The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the Electrician.
   - The person watching comedy movies must be in position 1, and the Electrician must be in position 2.

   - Since the Nigerian is in position 5, the Spanish must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the Spanish were in position 3, then the person watching time-travel would be in position 4, but there's no time-travel genre listed, so the Spanish must be in position 4.

9. **Clue 8:** The fan of D&B is on the right of the person watching family movies.
   - The fan of D&B is in position 3, so the person watching family movies must be in position 1 or 2.

    - Position 4: D&B, Skateboarding

11. **Clue 3:** The fan of indie is somewhere between the person watching musical movies and the fan of D&B.
    - The fan of D&B is in position 3, so the fan of indie must be in position 2 or 4.
    - But position 2 is already taken by the Polish, so the fan of indie must be in position 4.
    - Position 4: Indie

12. **Clue 9:** The person watching musical movies is not the person who's sport is badminton.
    - The person who's sport is skateboarding is in position 4, so the person watching musical movies cannot be in position 4.
    - The person watching musical movies must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

6. **Clue 7**: The egyptian is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the ferret.
   - This means the egyptian cannot be in position 2 (cat owner), so the egyptian must be in position 1 or 3.

   - From clue 4, the person driving the bike is on the left of the bird owner, so the bird owner must be in position 3 or 2.
   - Therefore, the person driving the scooter or skateboard must be in position 2 (since the bird owner cannot be in position 2).
