Lv7-2x4-1	"Let's analyze the given conditions step by step to determine the final arrangement:

1. **Condition 1:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is between the person drinking cola and the person who's hobby is gardening.
2. **Condition 2:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
3. **Condition 3:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the person drinking cola.
4. **Condition 4:** The person who's hobby is gardening is in an even position (2 or 4).
5. **Condition 5:** The person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
6. **Condition 6:** The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Step 1:** Identify the positions for the person with gardening as a hobby.
- From Condition 4, the person with gardening as a hobby must be in position 2 or 4.

**Step 2:** Determine the position for the person drinking hot-chocolate.
- From Condition 1, the person drinking hot-chocolate is between the person drinking cola and the person who's hobby is gardening.
- From Condition 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate is between the person drinking tea and the person drinking cola.
- From Condition 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games.

Considering these conditions together:
- If the person with gardening is in position 2, then the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1 (since it has to be between the person drinking cola and the person with gardening).
- This means the person with gardening is in position 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, and the person drinking cola must be in position 3 (to satisfy condition 1).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Hot-chocolate
- Position 2: Gardening
- Position 3: Cola

**Step 3:** Determine the position for the person with board-games as a hobby.
- From Condition 6, the person with gardening (position 2) is to the left of the person with board-games.
- Therefore, the person with board-games must be in position 4.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Hot-chocolate
- Position 2: Gardening
- Position 3: Cola
- Position 4: Board-games

**Step 4:** Determine the positions for the remaining beverages and hobbies.
- From Condition 5, the person drinking tea is on the right of the person with hiking.
- Since position 4 is already taken by board-games, the only remaining position for hiking is position 3.
- Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 1, but since position 1 is already taken by hot-chocolate, the only remaining beverage for position 3 is mirinda.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Hot-chocolate
- Position 2: Gardening
- Position 3: Mirinda
- Position 4: Board-games

Finally, the person with hiking as a hobby must be in position 2, which is already taken by gardening. This indicates a need to re-evaluate the positions for tea and hiking.

Revisiting the conditions:
- The person drinking tea is on the right of the person with hiking.
- The only possible position for hiking is position 1, making the person drinking tea in position 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Tea
- Position 2: Gardening
- Position 3: Hot-chocolate
- Position 4: Board-games

And the person drinking mirinda is in position 3.

Lv7-2x4-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the owner of the hedgehog.
2. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.
3. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
4. The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the snake.
5. The person who's sport is volleyball is between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person who's sport is rowing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3
- From Clue 1: Volleyball (V) is between Skateboarding (Sb) and Hedgehog (H).
- From Clue 3: Volleyball (V) is between Volleyball (V) and Snake (Sn).

This implies:
- V is between Sb and H.
- V is between V and Sn.

Since V cannot be between itself, it means:
- V must be between Sb and H, and also between V and Sn.
- Therefore, V must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
- From Clue 2: Snake (Sn) is to the left of Dog (Dg).
- From Clue 4: Goat (Gt) is to the left of Snake (Sn).

This implies:
- Gt < Sn < Dg.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 5
- From Clue 5: Volleyball (V) is between Skateboarding (Sb) and Rowing (Rw).

This implies:
- Sb < V < Rw.

Combining this with Clue 1 and Clue 3:
- Since V must be between Sb and H, and also between V and Sn, V must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since V is between Sb and Rw, and considering the positions, V must be in position 2.

So we have:
- V in position 2.
- Sb before V.
- Rw after V.

#### Step 4: Determine Positions
Given V is in position 2:
- Sb must be in position 1.
- Rw must be in position 3.
- H must be in position 4.

Now, considering Clue 2 and Clue 4:
- Gt < Sn < Dg.
- Since Gt must be to the left of Sn, and Sn must be to the left of Dg, Gt must be in position 1 and Sn in position 2, but since V is in position 2, Gt must be in position 1 and Sn in position 3.

So we have:
- Gt in position 1.
- Sn in position 3.
- Dg in position 4.

Lv7-2x4-3	"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the fan of indie.**
   - This means if someone likes indie, the person who likes comedy must be to their right.

2. **The fan of indie is somewhere between the fan of dubstep and the fan of classical.**
   - This means the order could be: dubstep -> indie -> classical or classical -> indie -> dubstep.

3. **The fan of house is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.**
   - This means if someone likes house, the person who likes scientific must be to their right.

4. **The fan of classical is somewhere between the fan of indie and the person watching crime movies.**
   - This means the order could be: indie -> classical -> crime or crime -> classical -> indie.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's start with clue 2:
- The fan of indie is between the fan of dubstep and the fan of classical.
- Possible orders: dubstep -> indie -> classical or classical -> indie -> dubstep.

Next, consider clue 4:
- The fan of classical is between the fan of indie and the person watching crime movies.
- Possible orders: indie -> classical -> crime or crime -> classical -> indie.

Combining clues 2 and 4, we can see that the only consistent order is:
- **indie -> classical -> crime**

Now, let's use clue 1:
- The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the fan of indie.
- Since indie is already placed, comedy must be on its right.

Finally, using clue 3:
- The fan of house is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.
- This means scientific must be on the right of house.

Putting it all together, we have:
- House -> (some genre) -> Comedy
- Indie -> Classical -> Crime
- Scientific (must be on the right of some genre)

Given the positions and the constraints, the only logical placement for the remaining genres is:
- House -> Scientific -> Comedy

So, the final arrangement is:
- House: 1
- Scientific: 2
- Comedy: 3
- Crime: 4

Lv7-2x4-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left or far right.
2. The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's hobby is writing.
3. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person who's sport is volleyball.
4. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.
5. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person who's sport is volleyball.
   - This means that the volleyball enthusiast has woodworking as their hobby.

2. **Clue 1 & 4**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left or far right, and the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.
   - Since volleyball is on the far left or far right, and skateboarding is to the left of volleyball, the only possible positions for volleyball are:
     - Position 1 (far left)
     - Position 4 (far right)

3. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.
   - If volleyball is in position 4, skateboarding must be in position 3.
   - If volleyball is in position 1, skateboarding must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's hobby is writing.
   - This means that if we place golf and writing, the collector must be between them.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.
   - This means that the traveler must be in a position to the left of the climber.

### Possible Arrangements:

#### Case 1: Volleyball in Position 1
- Skateboarding must be in Position 2.
- The remaining positions are 3 and 4.
- Golf and writing need to be placed such that the collector is between them.
- Traveler must be on the left of the climber.

This arrangement does not work because it leaves no room for placing all the activities without violating the conditions.

#### Case 2: Volleyball in Position 4
- Skateboarding must be in Position 3.
- Positions 1, 2, and 3 need to accommodate golf, writing, and collecting with the collector being between golf and writing.
- Traveler must be on the left of the climber.

Let's try to fit the activities:

- Position 1: Traveling (must be on the left of the climber)
- Position 2: Collecting (must be between golf and writing)
- Position 3: Skateboarding
- Position 4: Volleyball (woodworking)

Given these constraints, let's place golf and writing in positions 1 and 3 (since traveling is in position 1 and collecting must be between golf and writing):

- Position 1: Traveling
- Position 2: Collecting
- Position 3: Golf
- Position 4: Volleyball (woodworking)

Now, we need to place writing and the climber:

- Position 1 (Traveling) is already taken.
- Position 2 (Collecting) is already taken.
- Position 3 (Golf) is already taken.
- Position 4 (Volleyball) is woodworking.

The only positions left are 2 and 3 for writing and the climber. Since traveling is in position 1, the climber must be in position 3 (golf is there), so writing must be in position 2.

- Position 1: Traveling
- Position 2: Writing
- Position 3: Golf
- Position 4: Volleyball (woodworking)

Finally, we need to place the remaining activity (skateboarding) in position 3, but since golf is already there, this placement is incorrect.

Thus, the correct placement should be:

- Position 1: Traveling
- Position 2: Collecting
- Position 3: Skateboarding
- Position 4: Volleyball (woodworking)

And the final arrangement should be:

|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |      4      |
| Hobby   | Traveling | Collecting | Skating      | Woodworking |
| Sport   | Climbing  | Golf       | Skateboarding | Volleyball  |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |      4      |

Lv7-2x4-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The German is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading.
2. **Clue 2:** The American is somewhere to the left of the Brazilian.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
4. **Clue 4:** The German is somewhere between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is drawing.
5. **Clue 5:** The German is on the left of the Chinese.
6. **Clue 6:** The Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the German.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's hobby is reading is on the far left or far right.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

From Clues 7 and 8, we can deduce that the person with the hobby of reading must be either in position 1 (far left) or position 4 (far right). Let's consider both cases:

### Case 1: Reading is in Position 1
- **Position 1:** Reading
- **Position 2:** ? (This must be the German from Clue 1 and Clue 4)
- **Position 3:** ? (This must be the Chinese from Clue 5)
- **Position 4:** ?

From Clue 2, the American must be to the left of the Brazilian, so:
- **Position 2:** German
- **Position 3:** Chinese
- **Position 4:** American (left of Brazilian)

From Clue 6, the Brazilian must be to the right of the German, which fits here:
- **Position 4:** American
- **Position 5:** Brazilian

Now, we need to place the hobbies:
- From Clue 3, the person with the hobby of drawing must be to the right of the person with the hobby of rock-climbing. Since the German is already in Position 2, and the Chinese is in Position 3, the only positions left for these hobbies are 4 and 5. But since the American is in Position 4 and the Brazilian is in Position 5, this placement doesn't work.

### Case 2: Reading is in Position 4
- **Position 1:** ?
- **Position 2:** ?
- **Position 3:** ?
- **Position 4:** Reading

From Clue 1, the German must be to the left of the person with the hobby of reading:
- **Position 2:** German
- **Position 3:** ?

From Clue 4, the German must be between the person with the hobby of reading and the person with the hobby of drawing:
- **Position 3:** Drawing

From Clue 5, the German must be to the left of the Chinese:
- **Position 1:** Chinese

From Clue 2, the American must be to the left of the Brazilian:
- **Position 2:** German
- **Position 1:** Chinese
- **Position 3:** Drawing
- **Position 4:** Reading

From Clue 6, the Brazilian must be to the right of the German:
- **Position 2:** German
- **Position 1:** Chinese
- **Position 3:** Drawing
- **Position 4:** Reading
- **Position 5:** Brazilian

Finally, from Clue 3, the person with the hobby of rock-climbing must be to the left of the person with the hobby of drawing:
- **Position 1:** Chinese
- **Position 2:** German
- **Position 3:** Drawing
- **Position 4:** Reading
- **Position 5:** Brazilian

Since there are no more positions left, the only remaining hobby is video-games, which must be assigned to the American:
- **Position 1:** Chinese
- **Position 2:** German
- **Position 3:** Drawing
- **Position 4:** Reading
- **Position 5:** Brazilian
- **Hobby 1:** Video-games
- **Hobby 2:** Rock-climbing

Thus, the final solution is:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the Indonesian.**
2. **The Indonesian is the person drinking sprite.**
3. **The Dutch is on the right of the person drinking 7up.**
4. **The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.**
5. **The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the Nigerian.**
6. **The Nigerian is somewhere between the American and the Dutch.**
7. **The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2:** The Indonesian drinks Sprite.
   - Position 2 (Indonesian) -> Sprite

2. **Clue 1 & 7:** The person drinking Mirinda is on the left of the Indonesian, and the Indonesian is to the right of the person drinking Mirinda.
   - Position 1 -> Mirinda
   - Position 2 -> Indonesian
   - Position 3 -> Sprite

3. **Clue 4:** The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking Mirinda.
   - Since Mirinda is in position 1, the person drinking 7up must be in position 3.
   - Position 3 -> 7up
   - Position 4 -> Sprite

4. **Clue 3:** The Dutch is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
   - The person drinking 7up is in position 3, so the Dutch must be in position 4.
   - Position 4 -> Dutch

5. **Clue 6:** The Nigerian is between the American and the Dutch.
   - The Dutch is in position 4, so the Nigerian must be in position 3, but since position 3 is already taken by the person drinking 7up, the Nigerian must be in position 2, and the American must be in position 1.
   - Position 1 -> Nigerian
   - Position 2 -> American

6. **Clue 5:** The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the Nigerian.
   - Since the Nigerian is in position 1, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2 or 3.
   - However, position 2 is occupied by the American, so the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3.
   - Position 3 -> Almond-milk

Lv7-2x4-7	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the correct seating arrangement for the food and nationalities.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The Argentine is on the far left.**
   - This means the Argentine is in position 1.
   
2. **The person eating grapefruit is on the left of the Chinese.**
   - This means if someone is eating grapefruit, they must be to the left of the Chinese.

3. **The person eating pepper is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the person eating pepper is either in position 1 or position 4.

4. **The Spanish is somewhere between the person eating cherry and the person eating orange.**
   - This means the Spanish is not at the ends (positions 1 or 4) but somewhere in between positions 2 or 3.

5. **The Nigerian is somewhere to the left of the person eating orange.**
   - This means the Nigerian cannot be in the same position as or to the right of the person eating orange.

6. **The Spanish is on the left or right of the Nigerian.**
   - This means the Spanish is adjacent to the Nigerian (either immediately to the left or right).

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Place the Argentine
- The Argentine is in position 1.

#### Step 2: Determine the Pepper Position
- The person eating pepper must be in position 1 or 4.
- Since the Argentine is in position 1, the person eating pepper must be in position 4.

#### Step 3: Place the Spanish
- The Spanish is between the person eating cherry and the person eating orange.
- The Spanish cannot be in positions 1 or 4, so they must be in positions 2 or 3.
- The Spanish is also adjacent to the Nigerian, so we need to place the Nigerian such that this condition holds true.

#### Step 4: Place the Nigerian
- The Nigerian is to the left of the person eating orange.
- Since the Spanish is adjacent to the Nigerian, and the Spanish is between the cherry and orange, let's consider the possible placements:
  - If the Spanish is in position 2, the Nigerian could be in position 1 (not possible since the Argentine is there).
  - If the Spanish is in position 3, the Nigerian could be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Spanish in position 3
- Nigerian in position 2

#### Step 5: Place the Remaining Foods
- The person eating grapefruit must be to the left of the Chinese.
- The remaining positions are 1 (Argentine), 2 (Nigerian), 3 (Spanish), and 4 (Pepper).
- Since the Nigerian is in position 2, the grapefruit must be in position 1 (left of the Chinese) and the Chinese in position 3 (right of the grapefruit).
- This leaves the orange in position 4 (since it must be to the right of the Spanish).

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv7-2x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the nationalities and pets accordingly. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The Argentine is not the owner of the rabbit.
2. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
3. The Spanish is the owner of the horse.
4. The Colombian is somewhere between the Spanish and the American.
5. The Argentine is on the left of the American.
6. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the horse.
7. The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the dog.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Spanish
From clue 3, we know that the Spanish owns the horse. Therefore, the Spanish must be in one of the positions 1 or 2 (since the owner of the horse cannot be on the far right).

#### Step 2: Determine the Position of the Argentine
From clue 5, the Argentine is on the left of the American. This means the Argentine can only be in position 1, and the American can only be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Determine the Position of the Rabbit Owner
From clue 6, the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the dog. Also, from clue 2, the owner of the horse (Spanish) is either on the left or right of the rabbit owner. From clue 6, the owner of the rabbit must be on the left of the owner of the dog, so the rabbit owner cannot be in position 4.

#### Step 4: Determine the Position of the Colombian
From clue 4, the Colombian is between the Spanish and the American. Since the Spanish is in position 1 or 2 and the American is in position 2 or 3, the only possible position for the Colombian is position 3.

#### Step 5: Assign Remaining Pets and Nationalities
Given the positions and constraints:
- If the Spanish is in position 1, then the American must be in position 2, and the Colombian in position 3. This leaves position 4 for the Argentine.
- The Argentine cannot own the rabbit (clue 1), so the rabbit must be owned by someone else.
- The rabbit owner must be on the right of the horse owner (Spanish), and on the left of the dog owner.
- The only positions left for the rabbit and dog owners are 2 and 3, but since the Colombian is in position 3, the rabbit must be in position 2 and the dog in position 3.

Thus, we have:
- Position 1: Spanish (owns the horse)
- Position 2: Argentine (owns the rabbit)
- Position 3: Colombian (owns the dog)
- Position 4: American (owns the hamster)

Lv7-2x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step-by-step and place the information into the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The engineer is not the fan of classical.
2. The scientist is on the right of the engineer.
3. The fan of classical is on the left or right of the engineer.
4. The engineer is on the right of the fan of techno.
5. The scientist is somewhere between the fan of techno and the police-officer.
6. The fan of pop is somewhere to the right of the fan of r&b.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Engineer and Classical
- The engineer cannot be a fan of classical.
- The fan of classical must be either to the left or right of the engineer.

#### Step 2: Scientist Position
- The scientist is on the right of the engineer.
- This means the engineer must be in position 1 or 2, because if the engineer were in position 3 or 4, there would not be enough space for the scientist.

#### Step 3: Engineer and Techno
- The engineer is on the right of the fan of techno.
- If the engineer is in position 1, the fan of techno must be in position 2 (but then there's no room for the scientist).
- Therefore, the engineer must be in position 2, and the fan of techno must be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Scientist and Police-Officer
- The scientist is somewhere between the fan of techno and the police-officer.
- Since the engineer is in position 2 and the fan of techno is in position 1, the scientist must be in position 3 and the police-officer must be in position 4.

#### Step 5: Pop and R&B
- The fan of pop is to the right of the fan of r&b.
- Given the positions, the only remaining options are positions 3 and 4. Since the scientist is in position 3, the police-officer must be in position 4.
- Therefore, the fan of r&b must be in position 3 and the fan of pop must be in position 4.

#### Step 6: Engineer and Classical Revisited
- The engineer is in position 2, and the fan of techno is in position 1.
- The engineer cannot be a fan of classical, so the classical fan must be in position 3 (the scientist) or position 4 (the police-officer).
- Since the scientist is in position 3, the police-officer must be in position 4, making the police-officer the fan of classical.

#### Final Assignment:
- Position 1: Fan of techno (Engineer)
- Position 2: Scientist
- Position 3: Police-officer (Classical fan)
- Position 4: Security guard (Pop fan)

### Final Table:

```
|               |       1        |    2     |     3     |       4        |
| Job           | Engineer       | Scientist| Police-officer| Security guard|
| Music-Genre   | Techno         |          | Classical   | Pop            |
```

This is the final solution based on the given clues."	{'job': ['engineer', 'scientist', 'police-officer', 'security guard'], 'music-genre': ['techno', '', 'classical', 'pop']}	True	3	False
Lv7-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching western movies is somewhere between the person watching family movies and the owner of the snake.**
   - This means the order is: Family -> Western -> Snake or Snake -> Western -> Family.

2. **The person watching satire movies is not the owner of the rat.**
   - So, the owner of the rat cannot be watching satire movies.

3. **The owner of the mouse is not the person watching thriller movies.**
   - So, the owner of the mouse cannot be watching thriller movies.

4. **The person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake.**
   - This means the order is: Snake -> Thriller or Thriller -> Snake.

5. **The person watching family movies is the owner of the dog.**
   - So, the person in column 1 is watching family movies and owns the dog.

6. **The person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog.**
   - This means the person in column 4 is watching western movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 5, the person in column 1 (Family) owns the dog.
2. From clue 6, the person in column 4 (Western) is to the right of the owner of the dog, so the person in column 4 must be watching western movies.
3. From clue 1, the person watching western movies (column 4) is between the person watching family movies (column 1) and the owner of the snake. This fits since column 1 is family and column 4 is western.
4. From clue 4, the person watching thriller movies is to the right of the owner of the snake. Since the only possible position for the owner of the snake is column 2 or 3, and the person in column 4 is already watching western, the person in column 3 must be watching thriller movies.
5. From clue 2, the person watching satire movies is not the owner of the rat. So, the owner of the rat cannot be in column 3 (thriller).
6. From clue 3, the owner of the mouse is not the person watching thriller movies. Since the person in column 3 is watching thriller, the owner of the mouse cannot be in column 3.
7. The only remaining positions for the pet owners are:
   - Column 2: The owner of the snake.
   - Column 3: The person watching thriller movies.
   - Column 4: The person watching western movies.

Since the owner of the rat cannot be in column 3 (thriller), and the owner of the mouse cannot be in column 3 (thriller), the only logical placement left is:
- Column 2: The owner of the snake.
- Column 3: The person watching thriller movies.
- Column 4: The person watching western movies.

So, we have:
- Column 1: Family (dog)
- Column 2: Snake
- Column 3: Thriller
- Column 4: Western
