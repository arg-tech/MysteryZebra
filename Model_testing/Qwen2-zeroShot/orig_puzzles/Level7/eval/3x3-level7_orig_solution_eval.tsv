Lv7-3x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue step-by-step:

1. **The Indian is the fan of Gospel.**
   - This means the nationality column for ""Indian"" corresponds with ""Gospel"" in the music genre column.

2. **The person eating Tomato is somewhere between the person eating Kiwi and the Australian.**
   - This means if we place the food items (Tomato, Kiwi, Apricot) and the nationalities (Australian, Dutch, Indian), the Australian must be in one of the positions where Tomato is between Kiwi and the Australian.

3. **The Australian is somewhere to the left of the fan of Gospel.**
   - Since the Indian is the fan of Gospel, the Australian must be to the left of the Indian.

4. **The Dutch is the fan of Electronic.**
   - This means the nationality column for ""Dutch"" corresponds with ""Electronic"" in the music genre column.

5. **The fan of Electronic is somewhere to the right of the fan of Gospel.**
   - Since the Indian is the fan of Gospel and the Dutch is the fan of Electronic, the Dutch must be to the right of the Indian.

Let's use these clues to fill in the table:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 4:**
   - The Indian (Nationality) -> Gospel (Music Genre)
   - Dutch (Nationality) -> Electronic (Music Genre)

2. **Clue 2 and Clue 3:**
   - The Australian is to the left of the Indian.
   - The person eating Tomato is between the person eating Kiwi and the Australian.

Given the above information, we can deduce:
- The Australian cannot be in position 3 because the Indian would then not fit in position 2 or 3.
- Therefore, the Australian must be in position 1.

Since the Australian is in position 1, and the person eating Tomato is between the person eating Kiwi and the Australian, the only way to satisfy this is:
- Position 1: Australian
- Position 2: Kiwi
- Position 3: Tomato

Since the Indian must be to the right of the Australian, the Indian must be in position 3.

Finally, since the Dutch is to the right of the Indian, the Dutch must be in position 2.

### Final Table

Lv7-3x3-2	"Let's break down the clues step by step to find the solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of house is the person driving the scooter.
2. **Clue 2:** The fan of soul is on the far left.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking sprite is on the left of the fan of electronic.
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the subway is the person driving the subway (redundant, but confirms that the person driving the subway is in one of the seats).
5. **Clue 5:** The fan of electronic is somewhere between the person driving the helicopter and the person drinking lemonade.

Let's denote:
- Row 1 as Beverage
- Row 2 as Music-Genre
- Row 3 as Transport

From Clue 2, we know the person on the far left is the fan of soul:
- Music-Genre in column 1 = Soul

From Clue 1, the fan of house is the person driving the scooter:
- Music-Genre in column 3 = House
- Transport in column 3 = Scooter

Since the person drinking sprite must be on the left of the fan of electronic (Clue 3), and the fan of electronic is between the person driving the helicopter and the person drinking lemonade (Clue 5), let's consider the positions for each.

Since the fan of soul is in column 1 (Clue 2):
- Music-Genre in column 1 = Soul

This leaves columns 2 and 3 for the remaining genres:
- Music-Genre in column 2 = Electronic
- Music-Genre in column 3 = House

So, the beverage in column 3 must be sprite because it is to the left of the fan of electronic:
- Beverage in column 3 = Sprite

Now, the fan of electronic is between the person driving the helicopter and the person drinking lemonade (Clue 5). Since the fan of electronic cannot be in column 3 (House), it must be in column 2:
- Music-Genre in column 2 = Electronic
- Beverage in column 2 = Lemonade

This leaves column 1 for the fan of house and the person driving the helicopter:
- Music-Genre in column 1 = Soul
- Beverage in column 1 = Coffee
- Transport in column 1 = Helicopter

Finally, the person drinking sprite must be in column 2:
- Beverage in column 2 = Sprite

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage      | Coffee     | Lemonade   | Sprite   |

Lv7-3x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies.**
   - This means if someone watches romance, that person must be to the left of someone who watches satire.
   
2. **The colombian is in an odd position.**
   - This means the colombian can only be in position 1 or 3.
   
3. **The indian is on the far right.**
   - The indian must be in position 3.
   
4. **The person drinking milk is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching superhero movies.**
   - This means the person drinking milk must be in the middle position (position 2) because it has to be between two other positions.
   
5. **The person drinking coffee is on the left of the german.**
   - This means the person drinking coffee cannot be in position 3, and the german must be to the right of the person drinking coffee.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 3:**
   - From clue 3, the Indian is in position 3.
   - So, we have:
     ```
     |               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
     | Beverage      |           |        |   Indian  |
     | Movie-Genre   |           |        |   Indian  |
     | Nationality   |           |        |   Indian  |
     ```

2. **Position 2:**
   - From clue 4, the person drinking milk is in position 2.
   - So, we have:
     ```
     |               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
     | Beverage      |           |   Milk |   Indian  |
     | Movie-Genre   |           |        |   Indian  |
     | Nationality   |           |        |   Indian  |
     ```

3. **Position 1:**
   - From clue 1, the person watching romance movies is to the left of the person watching satire movies.
   - From clue 5, the person drinking coffee is on the left of the German.
   - Since the Indian is in position 3, the person watching romance movies and the person watching satire movies must be in positions 1 and 2 respectively, but since position 2 is occupied by milk, the person watching romance movies must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1.
   - So, we have:
     ```
     |               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
     | Beverage      | Coffee   |   Milk |   Indian  |
     | Movie-Genre   | Romance  |        |   Indian  |
     | Nationality   | Colombian|        |   Indian  |
     ```

4. **Determine the remaining details:**
   - The German must be in position 2 because the person drinking coffee (in position 1) is on the left of the German.
   - The person watching satire movies must be in position 2 because the person watching romance movies is in position 1.
   - The person watching superhero movies must be in position 3 (which is already occupied by the Indian).
   - The remaining beverage for position 2 is Fanta.

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage      | Coffee   |   Fanta |   Indian  |

Lv7-3x3-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the three different beverages, jobs, and music genres into the correct cells based on the given clues. Let's break down each clue and deduce the positions step-by-step.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the fan of electronic.**
   - This means if someone likes juice, they must be in a column to the left of the column where someone likes electronic music.

2. **The fan of rock is on the far right.**
   - This means the person who likes rock music must be in column 3.

3. **The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the designer.**
   - This means if someone drinks mirinda, they must be in a column to the left of the column where the designer works.

4. **The scientist is somewhere between the fan of rock and the fan of d&b.**
   - This means the scientist must be in the middle column (column 2) because the fan of rock is in column 3 and the fan of d&b is somewhere to the left of the scientist.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Place the fan of rock in column 3.**
   - Rock | | |
   
2. **Since the scientist is between the fan of rock and the fan of d&b, the scientist must be in column 2.**
   - | Scientist | | Rock |
   
3. **Determine the position of the fan of d&b.**
   - Since the scientist is in column 2 and the fan of rock is in column 3, the fan of d&b must be in column 1.
   - D&b | Scientist | Rock |
   
4. **Use the clue about the person drinking juice being to the left of the fan of electronic.**
   - Since the fan of rock is in column 3, the fan of electronic cannot be in column 3. The only remaining columns for the fan of electronic are column 1 or column 2.
   - If the fan of electronic were in column 1, then the person drinking juice would have to be in column 2, but that would mean the scientist would be to the right of the person drinking juice, which is not possible since the scientist is in column 2.
   - Therefore, the fan of electronic must be in column 2, and the person drinking juice must be in column 1.
   - Juice | Electronic | Rock |
   
5. **Determine the beverage for the designer.**
   - The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the designer. Since the person drinking juice is in column 1, the person drinking mirinda must be in column 2, and the designer must be in column 3.
   - Mirinda | Electronic | Rock |
   
6. **Assign the jobs based on the positions.**
   - The scientist is in column 2, so the designer must be in column 3, leaving the job for the person in column 1 as the librarian.
   - Librarian | Electronic | Scientist | Rock |

Lv7-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The person driving the train is on the left of the person driving the ship.
2. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the fan of house.
3. The person driving the ship is between the person driving the train and the person driving the van.
4. The fan of disco is somewhere between the fan of house and the owner of the goldfish.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- Train (left) < Ship (right)

#### Clue 3:
- Train < Ship < Van

Combining Clues 1 and 3:
- Train (left) < Ship (middle) < Van (right)

So, the order for transport is:
- **1st position**: Train
- **2nd position**: Ship
- **3rd position**: Van

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the fan of house.

Given the order from Clue 3, the fan of house must be in the 1st or 2nd position, and the owner of the guinea-pig must be in the 2nd or 3rd position. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is to the right of the fan of house, it must be:
- Fan of house: 1st position
- Owner of the guinea-pig: 2nd or 3rd position

Since the 2nd position is occupied by the Ship, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in the 3rd position.

So, the positions for transport and pets are:
- **1st position**: Train
- **2nd position**: Ship
- **3rd position**: Van
- **Owner of the guinea-pig**: 3rd position

#### Clue 4:
- The fan of disco is somewhere between the fan of house and the owner of the goldfish.

From Clue 3, we know:
- Fan of house: 1st position
- Owner of the guinea-pig: 3rd position

Therefore, the fan of disco must be in the 2nd position (Ship).

So, the positions for music genres are:
- **1st position**: Train
- **2nd position**: Disco
- **3rd position**: Van

Finally, the owner of the goldfish must be in the 1st position (Train), as the only remaining genre is house.

Lv7-3x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The librarian is somewhere to the left of the software-developer.**
2. **The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.**
3. **The Japanese is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.**
4. **The librarian is somewhere between the Turkish and the Japanese.**
5. **The librarian is somewhere between the musician and the person drinking juice.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: Librarian is to the left of Software-Developer
This means that if the librarian is in position 1, the software-developer cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if the librarian is in position 2, the software-developer cannot be in position 1 or 2. If the librarian is in position 3, the software-developer can only be in position 3 (but this would violate Clue 4).

So, the librarian must be in position 1, and the software-developer must be in position 3.

|               |    1     |     2      |         3          |

#### Clue 2: Person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person drinking water
This means that the person drinking water cannot be in position 3, as the person drinking iced-tea must be to the right of them.

|               |    1     |     2      |         3          |

| Nationality   | Australian| Japanese  | Turkish            |

#### Clue 3: The Japanese is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea
This confirms our previous placement since the Japanese is in position 3, which is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea in position 3.

#### Clue 4: The librarian is between the Turkish and the Japanese
Since the Japanese is in position 3, the Turkish must be in position 1, and the librarian (who is already in position 1) is between them.

#### Clue 5: The librarian is between the musician and the person drinking juice
Since the librarian is in position 1, the musician must be in position 2, and the person drinking juice must be in position 2.

### Final Table:

Lv7-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The police-officer is somewhere to the right of the doctor.**
2. **The doctor is on the right of the entrepreneur.**
3. **The person driving the bus is on the far right.**
4. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is the person driving the trike.**
5. **The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right.**
6. **The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.**
7. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere between the person driving the bus and the person driving the bike.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the people.
- From clue 3, the person driving the bus is on the far right (position 3).
- From clue 1, the police-officer is somewhere to the right of the doctor.
- From clue 2, the doctor is on the right of the entrepreneur.

So, the possible order for the people is:
- Entrepreneur (position 1)
- Doctor (position 2)
- Police-officer (position 3)

#### Step 2: Determine the beverages.
- From clue 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person driving the trike.
- From clue 5, the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right.
- From clue 6, the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.

Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right, and from clue 6, it must be on the far right (position 3). Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea is the police-officer.

This leaves:
- Entrepreneur (position 1) drinks water (since iced-tea is at position 3 and hot-chocolate is in between).
- Doctor (position 2) drinks hot-chocolate (since it is the only one left).

So, we have:
- Entrepreneur (position 1) drinks water.
- Doctor (position 2) drinks hot-chocolate.
- Police-officer (position 3) drinks iced-tea.

#### Step 3: Determine the transport modes.
- From clue 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate (Doctor) drives the trike.
- The person drinking iced-tea (Police-officer) drives the bus (from clue 3).
- The remaining person (Entrepreneur) must drive the bike.

So, we have:
- Entrepreneur (position 1) drinks water and drives the bike.
- Doctor (position 2) drinks hot-chocolate and drives the trike.
- Police-officer (position 3) drinks iced-tea and drives the bus.

Lv7-3x3-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **The owner of the snake is the person driving the airplane.**
   - So, the Dutch person (since the person driving the airplane is the Dutch) owns the snake.

2. **The person driving the airplane is the Dutch.**
   - Therefore, the Dutch person drives the airplane and owns the snake.

3. **The person driving the train is somewhere between the British and the person driving the airplane.**
   - Since the Dutch person drives the airplane, the person who drives the train must be either British or Polish.
   - The person driving the train is not the Dutch, so it must be either British or Polish.

4. **The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the person driving the motorbike.**
   - This means that the person who owns the rabbit comes after the person who drives the motorbike in the sequence.

5. **The Polish is between the person driving the airplane and the owner of the bird.**
   - The Dutch person (airplane driver) is not Polish, so the Polish person must be between the Dutch and the owner of the bird.
   - This means the Polish person cannot drive the airplane, so they must drive the motorbike or the train.
   - If the Polish person drives the motorbike, then the British person must drive the train (since the Dutch drives the airplane and the Polish is between the Dutch and the bird owner).

6. **Putting these pieces together:**
   - The Dutch drives the airplane and owns the snake.
   - The Polish drives the motorbike.
   - The British drives the train.
   - The Polish is between the Dutch and the bird owner, so the bird owner must be the British.

Now let's fill in the table based on this information:

Lv7-3x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly.

Let's start with the given clues:

1. The person drinking milk is in an odd position.
2. The person whose sport is ice-hockey is somewhere between the person driving the scooter and the person whose sport is golf.
3. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike.
4. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.

We can summarize the clues as follows:
- Clue 1: The person drinking milk is in position 1 or 3.
- Clue 2: Ice-hockey is between scooter and golf.
- Clue 3: Almond-milk is to the right of the bike.
- Clue 4: Juice is to the left of ice-hockey.

Let's start filling the table based on these clues:

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: Milk is in position 1 or 3.
2. **Clue 2**: Ice-hockey is between scooter and golf. This means the order must be either:
   - Scooter, Ice-hockey, Golf
   - Golf, Ice-hockey, Scooter

3. **Clue 3**: Almond-milk is to the right of the bike. So, if someone is drinking almond-milk, they cannot be in position 1. This implies that the person drinking almond-milk could be in positions 2 or 3.

4. **Clue 4**: Juice is to the left of ice-hockey. This means that juice cannot be in the last position where ice-hockey would be.

### Initial Placement:

- Let's assume the person drinking milk is in position 1 (we will check for position 3 later).

| Beverage    | 1     | 2         | 3         |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Sport       |       |           |           |
| Transport   | Milk  |           |           |

Now, let's place the sports and transport according to Clue 2 and Clue 4.

### Placing Sports and Transport:

- If ice-hockey is between scooter and golf, and juice is to the left of ice-hockey, we have two possible sequences:
  - Scooter, Ice-hockey, Golf
  - Golf, Ice-hockey, Scooter

Since juice is to the left of ice-hockey, the sequence must be:
- Scooter, Ice-hockey, Golf

So, we can place them as:
- Scooter in position 1 (since milk is in position 1)
- Ice-hockey in position 2
- Golf in position 3

| Beverage    | 1     | 2         | 3         |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Sport       |       | Ice-hockey|           |
| Transport   | Milk  | Scooter   |           |

Now, we need to place the remaining beverage (juice) and the remaining transport (bike and jet-ski).

- Almond-milk must be to the right of the bike, so it can only be in position 3 (since position 2 is occupied by ice-hockey).
- Juice must be to the left of ice-hockey, so it must be in position 1.

Finally, we place the remaining transport:
- The person driving the bike must be in position 2 (since almond-milk is in position 3 and juice is in position 1).

| Beverage    | 1     | 2         | 3         |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Sport       | Juice | Ice-hockey| Golf      |
| Transport   | Milk  | Bike      | Jet-ski   |

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv7-3x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
   - This means the order could be: Drama-Thriller or Thriller-Drama.

2. **Clue 2**: The Russian is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the Australian.
   - This means the order involving the Russian must be: Soy-milk-Russian-Australian or Australian-Russian-Soy-milk.

3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching western movies.
   - This means the order involving milk and western movies must be: Western-Milk.

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching thriller movies is the Russian.
   - So, the Russian is watching thriller movies.

5. **Clue 5**: The Australian is on the right of the person watching thriller movies.
   - Since the Russian is watching thriller movies, the Australian must be on the right of the Russian.

### Putting it Together:

From Clue 4, we know:
- The Russian is watching thriller movies.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The Australian is on the right of the Russian (who is watching thriller).

So, the order for the columns must be:
1. Russian (Thriller)
2. Someone else
3. Australian

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching western movies.
- Therefore, the order involving milk and western movies must be: Western-Milk.

Given the Russian is in the middle (Clue 2), the order must fit with Clue 3 as well. Let's place these elements:

- If the Russian is in column 2, then the Australian must be in column 3.
- The person drinking milk must be in column 3 since they are to the right of the person watching western movies.

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:

- Since the Russian is watching thriller, the Australian is watching drama (to fit Clue 1).
- The only beverage left for the first column is soy-milk, which must be between the Russian and the Australian (Clue 2).

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | milk     | cola       |
| Movie-Genre   | drama    | thriller | western    |
| Nationality   | turkish  | russian  | australian |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | milk     | cola       |
| Movie-Genre   | drama    | thriller | western    |
| Nationality   | turkish  | russian  | australian |
