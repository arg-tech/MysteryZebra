14. The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the fan of reggae.
15. The fan of soul is the owner of the hedgehog.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 13 (Owner of the Cat = Fan of Blues)
- **Cat** -> **Blues**

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 15 (Fan of Soul = Owner of Hedgehog)
- **Soul** -> **Hedgehog**

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 8 (Owner of Rabbit in Odd Position)
- Possible positions for Rabbit: 1, 3, 5

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 11 (Owner of Rabbit is to the Right of Owner of Cat)
- Since the owner of the cat is in position 1 (from clue 13), the owner of the rabbit must be in position 3, 5, or 6.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 12 (Owner of Rabbit is to the Left of Owner of Hedgehog)
- Since the owner of the hedgehog is in an even position (from clue 15), the owner of the rabbit cannot be in position 6. Therefore, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 3 or 5.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 9 (Fan of Blues is Between Owner of Rabbit and Fan of R&B)
- If the owner of the rabbit is in position 3, then the fan of blues must be in position 2 (since the owner of the rabbit is in an odd position). This means the fan of r&b must be in position 4.

#### Step 7: Analyze Clue 14 (Owner of Guinea-Pig is to the Left of Fan of Reggae)
- Since the owner of the hedgehog is in an even position, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in an odd position (position 1 or 3).

#### Step 8: Analyze Clue 5 (Owner of Mouse is to the Left of Owner of Guinea-Pig)
- If the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3, then the owner of the mouse must be in position 1.

#### Step 9: Analyze Clue 7 (Owner of Mouse is Not Fan of Dubstep)
- Since the owner of the mouse is in position 1, the owner of the mouse cannot be the fan of dubstep.

#### Step 10: Analyze Clue 6 (Owner of Goldfish is to the Right of Owner of Guinea-Pig)
- If the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3, then the owner of the goldfish must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

#### Step 11: Analyze Clue 2 (Fan of Soul is to the Left of Fan of Dubstep)
- If the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3, the fan of soul must be in position 1 or 2. Since the owner of the mouse is in position 1, the fan of soul must be in position 2.

#### Step 12: Analyze Clue 4 (Fan of R&B is to the Left of Fan of Dubstep)
- The fan of r&b must be in position 1 or 2. Since the fan of soul is in position 2, the fan of r&b must be in position 1.

#### Step 13: Analyze Clue 10 (Owner of Guinea-Pig is to the Left or Right of Owner of Hedgehog)
- Since the owner of the hedgehog is in an even position, and the owner of the guinea-pig is in an odd position, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 3.

#### Final Positions:
- **1**: Owner of the mouse (not fan of dubstep)
- **2**: Fan of soul (owner of the hedgehog)
- **3**: Owner of the guinea-pig
- **4**: Fan of r&b
- **5**: Owner of the goldfish

Lv7-2x6-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

1. **Beverages:** cola, hot-chocolate, lemonade, soy-milk, tea, water
2. **Sports:** baseball, basketball, lacrosse, parkour, surfing, swimming

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Constraint 7:** The person who's sport is basketball is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Basketball

2. **Constraint 4 & 5:** The person who's sport is basketball is not the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking cola is not the person who's sport is baseball.
   - Since position 1 is basketball, the person drinking cola cannot be in position 1.

3. **Constraint 12 & 13:** The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person drinking cola.
   - Let's denote the position of cola as \(C\), and the position of baseball as \(B\). So, \(C < B\) and \(B \) can be either 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

4. **Constraint 2:** The person drinking cola is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
   - So, \(C = 2, 4,\) or \(6\).

5. **Constraint 11:** The person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
   - So, the position for swimming must be 1, 3, or 5.

6. **Constraint 6 & 10:** The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.
   - Let's denote the position of parkour as \(P\) and the position of baseball as \(B\). So, \(P < B\) and \(P > 5\).

7. **Constraint 3 & 9:** The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
   - So, the positions for lemonade and hot-chocolate must be consecutive and in ascending order, and the same for tea and water.

8. **Constraint 8:** The person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - So, if the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position \(H\), then baseball can be in position \(H-1\) or \(H+1\).

9. **Constraint 14:** The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - So, if the person drinking tea is in position \(T\) and the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position \(H\), then surfing must be in position \(T+1\).

10. **Constraint 1:** The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
    - So, if lemonade is in position \(L\), then hot-chocolate must be in position \(L+1\).

11. **Constraint 10 & 14:** The person who's sport is surfing is between the person drinking tea and the person drinking hot-chocolate.
    - This further constrains the positions of tea, hot-chocolate, and surfing.

Now, let's place these pieces together:

- Position 1: Basketball
- Positions 2 and 4: Cola (since it's an even position and must be to the left of baseball)
- Positions 3 and 5: Swimming (must be in an odd position)
- Positions 6: Hot-Chocolate (since it's on the right of lemonade and there are no other constraints that force it elsewhere)

Given the constraints:
- Cola (2) and Baseball (4) must be in positions 2 and 4.
- Swimming (3) and Parkour (5) must be in positions 3 and 5.
- Hot-Chocolate (6) and Tea/Water must be in positions 1, 3, or 5, but since Hot-Chocolate is in 6, Tea and Water must be in 3 and 5.

Since Swimming is in 3, and Parkour is to the right of Swimming, Parkour must be in 5.
- Therefore, Hot-Chocolate must be in 6.
- Tea must be in 3, and Water must be in 5.

Let's finalize the arrangement:

1. Basketball
2. Cola
3. Tea
4. Baseball
5. Swimming
6. Hot-Chocolate

Now, we need to assign sports to the remaining beverages:

- Lacrosse (left of baseball) must be in position 2.
- Surfing (between tea and hot-chocolate) must be in position 4.
- Parkour (left of baseball) must be in position 3.
- Remaining sports (lacrosse and parkour) fit perfectly.

So, the final solution is:

- The person watching fantasy movies is the person drinking lemonade.
- So, Lemonade (Beverage) -> Fantasy (Movie-Genre).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 8
- The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies.
- Since fantasy movies are lemonade, the person drinking almond-milk must be on the right of lemonade.
- So, Lemonade (Beverage) -> Fantasy (Movie-Genre).
- Almond-milk (Beverage) -> Crime (Movie-Genre), because crime movies are to the left of the person drinking 7up.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
- The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.
- So, Mirinda (Beverage) -> 7up (Beverage), with some other beverage in between.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 6
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is between the person drinking water and the person drinking mirinda.
- So, Water (Beverage) -> Hot-chocolate (Beverage) -> Mirinda (Beverage).

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 11

- The person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies.
- So, Western (Beverage) -> Drama (Beverage).

#### Step 8: Analyze Clue 2
- The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
- Since 7up is on the far right, the person watching western movies must be on the far left.
- So, Western (Beverage) -> Drama (Beverage).

#### Step 9: Analyze Clue 10
- The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.
- So, Lemonade (Beverage) -> Horror (Beverage).

#### Step 10: Analyze Clue 9
- The person watching crime movies is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking lemonade.
- Since lemonade is fantasy, the person drinking crime must be on the right of hot-chocolate and left of fantasy.
- So, Hot-chocolate (Beverage) -> Crime (Beverage) -> Fantasy (Beverage).

#### Step 11: Analyze Clue 5
- The person watching drama movies is not the person drinking mirinda.
- So, Drama (Beverage) -> Western (Beverage).

#### Step 12: Analyze Clue 3
- The person watching drama movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda.
- So, Drama (Beverage) -> Western (Beverage).

#### Step 13: Finalize the Order
- Water (Beverage) -> Hot-chocolate (Beverage) -> Mirinda (Beverage) -> 7up (Beverage)
- Lemonade (Beverage) -> Fantasy (Beverage) -> Crime (Beverage) -> Horror (Beverage)
- Western (Beverage) -> Drama (Beverage)

- Since D is to the right of M and GR is between P and D, and GR is also to the right of L, we can start placing the food and jobs:

1. Lettuce (L) - since it must be before GR.
2. Grapefruit (GR) - between P and D.
3. Zucchini (Z) - after B and G.
4. Watermelon (W) - after Z.
5. Banana (B) - before E.
6. Garlic (G) - before Z.

Since D is to the right of M, and D is to the left of GR, which is to the right of P, we get:

- P (Paramedic) - before D.
- D (Doctor) - before GR.
- GR (Grapefruit) - between P and D.
- M (Musician) - before D.
- E (Engineer) - after B.

Now, let's fit everything into the table:

|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |     4     |    5     |     6      |

Lv7-2x6-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically apply each clue to determine the job and mode of transport for each person. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **The project-manager is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car (clue 1)**
2. **The engineer is not the person driving the quad-bike (clue 2)**
3. **The designer is the person driving the ship (clue 3)**
4. **The videographer is not the person driving the quad-bike (clue 4)**
5. **The engineer is somewhere to the right of the lawyer (clue 5)**
6. **The lawyer is on the left of the videographer (clue 6)**
7. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the engineer (clue 7)**
8. **The project-manager is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter (clue 8)**
9. **The person driving the trike is in an even position (clue 9)**
10. **The security-guard is in an odd position (clue 10)**
11. **The videographer is somewhere to the left of the person driving the scooter (clue 11)**
12. **The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the car (clue 12)**
13. **The project-manager is on the left or right of the designer (clue 13)**
14. **The person driving the trike is somewhere between the project-manager and the videographer (clue 14)**

Let's start placing what we know:

- **Designer**: Driving the ship (clue 3)
- **Person driving the motorbike** is on the left of the person driving the car (clue 12)
- **Person driving the trike** is in an even position (clue 9), so it must be either 2 or 4.
- **Security-guard** is in an odd position (clue 10), so it must be either 1, 3, or 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1**: Security-guard (odd position)
2. **Position 2**: Person driving the trike (even position)
3. **Position 3**: Designer (driving the ship)
4. **Position 4**: Person driving the trike (even position)
5. **Position 5**: Person driving the motorbike (left of the car)
6. **Position 6**: Person driving the car

From the clues:
- **Engineer is not the person driving the quad-bike (clue 2)**
- **Engineer is somewhere to the right of the lawyer (clue 5)**
- **Lawyer is on the left of the videographer (clue 6)**
- **Person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the engineer (clue 7)**

- Position 3: Designer (driving the ship)
- Position 4: Trike
- Position 5: Engineer (right of the lawyer, and right of the person driving the quad-bike)
- Position 6: Car (left of the motorbike)

Now we can fill in the jobs based on the remaining clues:

- **Project-manager** must be in position 2 or 4 (between videographer and trike).
- **Lawyer** must be in position 1 (left of videographer).
- **Engineer** must be in position 5 (right of the lawyer).

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|             |     1     |      2       |       3        |    4     |        5        |    6     |
| Job         | Security-guard | Lawyer | Designer | Videographer | Engineer | Car     |

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."	{'job': ['security-guard', 'lawyer', 'designer', 'videographer', 'engineer', 'car'], 'transport': ['', 'ship', '', '', 'motorbike', '']}	True	0	False
Lv7-2x6-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding food and movie genre in the correct positions.

Let's start by listing the clues and solving them step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating zucchini is the person watching scientific movies.
   - Zucchini -> Scientific

2. **Clue 2**: The person watching sports movies is the person eating cauliflower.
   - Cauliflower -> Sports

3. **Clue 3**: The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the left of the person eating nectarine.
   - Artichoke -> Before Nectarine

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
   - Scientific -> Before Disaster

5. **Clue 5**: The person watching sports movies is in an even position.
   - Sports -> Even position (2 or 4 or 6)

6. **Clue 6**: The person eating cauliflower is somewhere between the person watching animation movies and the person eating tomato.
   - Cauliflower -> Between Animation and Tomato

7. **Clue 7**: The person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating watermelon.
   - Nectarine -> Before Watermelon

8. **Clue 8**: The person watching epic movies is somewhere between the person watching sports movies and the person eating watermelon.
   - Epic -> Between Sports and Watermelon

9. **Clue 9**: The person eating watermelon is the person watching animation movies.
   - Watermelon -> Animation

10. **Clue 10**: The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
    - Nectarine -> After Disaster

11. **Clue 11**: The person eating watermelon is on the right of the person eating nectarine.
    - Watermelon -> After Nectarine

Now, let's use these clues to fill in the table:

1. From Clue 1, Zucchini -> Scientific.
2. From Clue 2, Cauliflower -> Sports.
3. From Clue 9, Watermelon -> Animation.
4. From Clue 10, Nectarine -> After Disaster.
5. From Clue 11, Watermelon -> After Nectarine (since Watermelon -> Animation, Nectarine must be before Watermelon).

Given that Nectarine is after Disaster and before Watermelon, and Watermelon is in the last position, we can place:
- Disaster -> Before Nectarine
- Nectarine -> Before Watermelon (last position)
- Watermelon -> Last position (6th)

Since Sports is in an even position (2, 4, or 6), and it's also between Animation and another movie, and given that Watermelon is in the last position, Sports must be in position 2.

From Clue 6, Cauliflower is between Animation and Tomato, and since Watermelon is Animation, Cauliflower must be before Tomato. Given that Cauliflower -> Sports, it must be in position 2.

Since Disaster is before Nectarine, and Nectarine is before Watermelon, Disaster must be in position 1.

From Clue 3, Artichoke is before Nectarine, so Artichoke must be in position 3.

From Clue 8, Epic is between Sports and Watermelon, and since Sports is in position 2 and Watermelon is in position 6, Epic must be in position 5.

Finally, the only remaining food is Tomato, which must be in position 4.

Here's the final solution:

```

Lv7-2x6-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 13**: The person driving the trike is on the far right.
   - Trike is in position 6.

2. **Clue 12**: The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person eating mango.
   - Since the person eating mango is not on the far right (due to Clue 13), and the person driving the trike is on the far right, the person eating mango can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - Also, the person driving the bus must be either to the left or right of the person eating mango.

3. **Clue 14**: The person eating artichoke is somewhere between the person eating avocado and the person eating mango.
   - This means the order for these three foods must be: avocado, artichoke, mango or mango, artichoke, avocado.
   - Also, the person eating mango cannot be in position 1 because then there would be no room for both avocado and artichoke between them.

4. **Clue 6**: The person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
   - So, if the person eating mango is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
   - So, if the person driving the quad-bike is in position 2, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1; if the person driving the quad-bike is in position 3, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1 or 2, etc.

6. **Clue 2**: The person driving the quad-bike is not the person eating artichoke.
   - Therefore, the person eating artichoke must be in one of the remaining positions (not the same as the person driving the quad-bike).

7. **Clue 7**: The person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the person eating pepper.
   - So, if the person eating pineapple is in position 1, 2, or 3, the person eating pepper must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 4**: The person eating avocado is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car.
   - If the person driving the car is in position 1, the person eating avocado must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

9. **Clue 11**: The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the trike.
   - Since the trike is in position 6, the person driving the car must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. **Clue 8**: The person driving the motorbike is not the person eating avocado.
    - So, the person eating avocado must be in one of the remaining positions (not the same as the person driving the motorbike).

11. **Clue 10**: The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike.
    - So, if the person driving the motorbike is in position 2, the person driving the bus must be in position 1; if the person driving the motorbike is in position 3, the person driving the bus must be in position 1 or 2, etc.

12. **Clue 9**: The person eating artichoke is on the left or right of the person eating avocado.
    - This confirms our previous deductions about the relative positions of avocado and artichoke.

13. **Clue 15**: The person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the person eating mango.
    - This further narrows down the possible positions for pineapple and mango.

### Final Deduction:

From the above clues, we can deduce:
- Position 6: Trike (from Clue 13)
- Position 5: Bus (from Clue 10, since the bus must be to the left of the motorbike)
- Position 4: Motorbike (from Clue 5, since it must be to the left of the quad-bike)
- Position 3: Quad-bike (from Clue 6, since the person eating mango must be to the left of the quad-bike)
- Position 2: Car (from Clue 11, since it must be to the left of the trike)

Now, let's place the foods and transports based on the remaining clues:
- Position 1: Artichoke (from Clue 14, since it must be between avocado and mango, and not in the last position)
- Position 2: Car (from Clue 11, confirmed)
- Position 3: Quad-bike (from Clue 6, confirmed)
- Position 4: Motorbike (from Clue 5, confirmed)
- Position 5: Bus (from Clue 10, confirmed)
- Position 6: Trike (from Clue 13, confirmed)

Now we need to assign the foods and transports:
- Position 1: Artichoke (from Clue 9, since it must be between avocado and mango, and not in the last position)
- Position 2: Car (from Clue 11, confirmed)
- Position 3: Quad-bike (from Clue 6, confirmed)
- Position 4: Motorbike (from Clue 5, confirmed)
- Position 5: Bus (from Clue 10, confirmed)
- Position 6: Trike (from Clue 13, confirmed)

So, the final solution is:

Lv7-2x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the nationalities and pets accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The owner of the pony is not the Colombian**.
2. **The owner of the guinea-pig is in an odd position (1 or 3)**.
3. **The French is on the far right (position 6)**.
4. **The owner of the hedgehog is not the Egyptian**.
5. **The owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the Colombian**.
6. **The owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the snake**.
7. **The owner of the snake is on the right of the Russian**.
8. **The owner of the cat is somewhere between the Indonesian and the owner of the snake**.
9. **The Egyptian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog**.
10. **The owner of the snake is somewhere between the German and the owner of the hedgehog**.
11. **The Indonesian is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the cat**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the French
From clue 3, the French must be in position 6.

|               |    1     |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5      |   6    |
| Nationality   |          |           |        |            |            | French |
| Pet           |          |           |        |            |            |        |

#### Step 2: Positioning the Guinea-Pig
From clue 2, the owner of the guinea-pig is in an odd position (1 or 3).

#### Step 3: Positioning the Snake
From clue 7, the owner of the snake is on the right of the Russian.
From clue 10, the owner of the snake is between the German and the owner of the hedgehog.
From clue 6, the owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the snake.
From clue 8, the owner of the cat is between the Indonesian and the owner of the snake.

This means the snake cannot be in position 1 (since it would be impossible for the owner of the snake to be between the Indonesian and the owner of the snake). Therefore, the snake must be in position 4 or 5.

Let's assume the snake is in position 4:
- The owner of the snake is in position 4.
- The owner of the cat must be in position 5 (since the cat is to the right of the snake).
- The Indonesian must be in position 3 (since the Indonesian is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the cat).

|               |    1     |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5      |   6    |
| Nationality   |          |           | Indonesian |            | French    | Russian |
| Pet           |          |           | Guinea-pig | Snake     | Cat       |        |

Now, the Russian is in position 6, so the snake can only be in position 4. This fits with clue 7 and 10.

#### Step 4: Positioning the Hedgehog and German
From clue 10, the owner of the snake is between the German and the owner of the hedgehog.
From clue 6, the owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the snake.
This means the German must be in position 3, and the hedgehog in position 5.

|               |    1     |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5      |   6    |
| Nationality   |          |           | German  | Snake     | Hedgehog  | Russian |
| Pet           |          |           | Guinea-pig | Snake     | Cat       |        |

#### Step 5: Positioning the Frog and Egyptian
From clue 9, the Egyptian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog.
From clue 5, the owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the Colombian.
From clue 1, the owner of the pony is not the Colombian.
From clue 8, the owner of the cat is between the Indonesian and the owner of the snake.

This leaves positions 1 and 2 for the Colombian and Egyptian. Since the Colombian cannot be in position 6 (where the French is), and the Egyptian cannot be in position 5 (where the cat is):

- The Colombian must be in position 1.
- The Egyptian must be in position 2.

|               |    1     |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5      |   6    |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Egyptian  | German  | Snake     | Hedgehog  | Russian |
| Pet           |          |           | Guinea-pig | Snake     | Cat       |        |

#### Step 6: Positioning the Pony and Cat
From clue 1, the owner of the pony is not the Colombian.
From clue 5, the owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the Colombian.
From clue 6, the owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the snake.
From clue 8, the owner of the cat is between the Indonesian and the owner of the snake.

This leaves the pony for position 1, and the cat for position 5.

|               |    1     |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5      |   6    |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Egyptian  | German  | Snake     | Cat       | Russian |
| Pet           | Pony      |           | Guinea-pig | Snake     | Cat       |        |

Finally, the only pet left for position 2 is the frog.

|               |    1     |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5      |   6    |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Egyptian  | German  | Snake     | Cat       | Russian |
| Pet           | Pony      | Frog      | Guinea-pig | Snake     | Cat       |        |

### Final Solution:
