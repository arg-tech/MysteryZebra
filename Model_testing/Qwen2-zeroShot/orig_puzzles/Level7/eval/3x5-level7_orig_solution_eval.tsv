Lv7-3x5-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The Argentine is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Argentine

2. **Clue 5**: The person driving the boat is on the far right.
   - Position 5: Boat

3. **Clue 6**: The person driving the snowmobile is in an odd position.
   - Possible positions for snowmobile: 1, 3, 5 (but 1 and 5 are already occupied, so position 3)

4. **Clue 11**: The Russian is the fan of ambient.
   - Russian: Ambient

5. **Clue 3**: The fan of ambient is not the Polish.
   - Since the Russian is the fan of ambient, the Polish cannot be in position 3.

6. **Clue 2**: The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard.
   - Since the Russian is in position 3 and the fan of ambient is not the Polish, the fan of ambient must be in position 1 or 5. But since position 1 is the Argentine and position 5 is the boat, the only possible position for the fan of ambient is 5. This contradicts clue 5 where the snowmobile is in position 3. Therefore, the fan of ambient must be in position 2.

7. **Clue 11**: The Russian is the fan of ambient.
   - So, the Russian is in position 2 and the fan of ambient is also in position 2. This is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate. Let’s assume the fan of ambient is in position 4.

8. **Clue 6**: The person driving the snowmobile is in position 3.
   - Position 3: Snowmobile

9. **Clue 13**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the fan of R&B.
   - Since the snowmobile is in position 3, the fan of R&B must be in position 2 or 1. But position 2 is already the fan of ambient, so the fan of R&B must be in position 1.

10. **Clue 10**: The fan of blues is on the left of the Polish.
    - Since the fan of R&B is in position 1, the fan of blues must be in position 2 (since position 2 is the fan of ambient, the only left position available).

11. **Clue 12**: The person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the Mexican.
    - Since the fan of blues is in position 2, the skateboard can be in position 3 or 5 (but 3 is snowmobile, so it must be in position 5).

12. **Clue 4**: The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the Polish.
    - The only remaining position for the Mexican is 4 (since 2 is the fan of ambient, 3 is snowmobile, 5 is skateboarding, and 1 is R&B).

13. **Clue 7**: The person driving the roller is somewhere between the Argentine and the fan of soul.
    - The Argentine is in position 1 and the fan of soul is in position 4, so the roller must be in position 3.

14. **Clue 8**: The fan of soul is on the left or right of the Mexican.
    - The fan of soul is in position 4 and the Mexican is in position 4, so this condition is satisfied.

15. **Clue 9**: The fan of soul is somewhere to the left of the Russian.
    - The fan of soul is in position 4 and the Russian is in position 2, so this condition is satisfied.

Lv7-3x5-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the far left.
2. **Clue 13**: The police-officer is the person eating watermelon.
3. **Clue 11**: The person eating watermelon is in an odd position (so, position 1).
4. **Clue 14**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left or far right. Since the weightlifter is already on the far left, the person with volleyball must be in position 5.

Now we can place these:
- Position 1: Weightlifter, eating watermelon
- Position 5: Volleyball

Next, let's use Clue 1:
- **Clue 1**: The person whose sport is volleyball is not the person eating grapefruit. So, the person in position 5 (volleyball) is not eating grapefruit.

Using Clue 6:
- **Clue 6**: The police-officer is somewhere to the left of the person eating cucumber. Since the police-officer is eating watermelon (position 1), the person eating cucumber must be in position 2 or 3 or 4.

Using Clue 12:
- **Clue 12**: The freelancer is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the police-officer is in position 1, the freelancer cannot be in position 1.

Using Clue 7:
- **Clue 7**: The dancer is somewhere between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person who's sport is cricket. The bartender is skating (Clue 9).

So, the bartender is in position 5 (skateboarding). Since the volleyball person (position 5) is not eating grapefruit, the bartender (skateboarding) cannot be eating grapefruit. Thus, the bartender must be eating pear (since the pear person is to the right of the watermelon person, and the bartender is the only one left for this position).

Using Clue 8:
- **Clue 8**: The person eating potato is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the bartender is in position 5 (skateboarding), the potato person must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Given that the pear person (bartender) is in position 5, the potato person must be in position 2 or 3.

Using Clue 7 again:
- **Clue 7**: The dancer is somewhere between the person who's sport is skateboarding (bar) and the person who's sport is cricket. Since the bartender is in position 5 (skateboarding), the cricket person must be in position 1 or 2 (but position 1 is occupied by the police-officer, so it must be position 2).

Thus, the cricket person is in position 2, and the potato person is in position 3.

Using Clue 10:
- **Clue 10**: The person eating pear is on the right of the person eating watermelon. The pear person (bartender) is in position 5, so the watermelon person (police-officer) must be in position 4.

Using Clue 2:
- **Clue 2**: The person whose sport is golf is somewhere between the person eating grapefruit and the person eating pear. Since the bartender is in position 5 (pear), the golf person must be in position 3 or 4. But the police-officer is in position 4, so the golf person must be in position 3.

Thus, the grapefruit person is in position 2 (cricket), and the golf person is in position 3.

Finally, using Clue 12:
- **Clue 12**: The freelancer is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the golf person is in position 3, the freelancer must be in position 2 or 1. But the police-officer is in position 1, so the freelancer must be in position 2.

So, the positions are:
- Position 1: Police-officer, eating watermelon, sport: weightlifting
- Position 2: Freelancer, eating grapefruit, sport: cricket
- Position 3: Golf, eating pear, sport: police-officer
- Position 4: Bartender, eating potato, sport: skateboarding
- Position 5: Volleyball, eating cucumber, sport: software-developer

10. The person who's sport is badminton is not the person drinking hot-chocolate.
11. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding.

### Step 2: Deduce from the conditions

From condition 3 and 6:
- Snowboarding (S) < Rock (R)
- Snowboarding (S) > Rock (R)

This implies that snowboarding must be in position 2 or 3, and rock in position 4 or 5.

From condition 2:
- Snowboarding (S) < Cricket (C)

Combining with the above, we get:
- S must be in position 2, C in position 4 or 5.

From condition 11:
- Iced-tea (I) < Skateboarding (Sk)

From condition 8:
- Blues (B) is between Water (W) and Badminton (Ba).

From condition 9:
- Funk (F) > Cricket (C)

From condition 4:
- Funk (F) > Rock (R)

From condition 10:
- Badminton (Ba) ≠ Hot-chocolate (Hc)

### Step 3: Place the elements

1. From condition 3, 6, and 11:
   - S (Snowboarding) must be in position 2.
   - R (Rock) must be in position 4.
   - Sk (Skateboarding) must be in position 5.

2. From condition 1 and 7:
   - I (Iced-tea) must be in position 1 or 3.
   - F (Funk) must be in position 3 or 4.

Since S (2) and R (4), F must be in position 3:
   - F (Funk) in position 3.
   - I (Iced-tea) in position 1.

3. From condition 8 and 9:
   - B (Blues) must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Since F (Funk) is in position 3, B (Blues) must be in position 2.

4. From condition 10:
   - Ba (Badminton) cannot be Hc (Hot-chocolate).
   - Since B (Blues) is in position 2, Ba (Badminton) must be in position 5.
   - Hc (Hot-chocolate) must be in position 4.

5. From condition 5:
   - Coffee (Co) must be in position 1 or 3.
   - Since I (Iced-tea) is in position 1, Co (Coffee) must be in position 3.

6. From condition 4:
   - Trance (Tr) must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Since Hc (Hot-chocolate) is in position 4, Tr (Trance) must be in position 5.

Lv7-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Analyze and Place Clues

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating avocado is somewhere to the left of the Italian.
2. **Clue 2**: The British is on the right of the Indonesian.
3. **Clue 3**: The French is not the person eating avocado.
4. **Clue 4**: The owner of the goat is between the owner of the cat and the French.
5. **Clue 5**: The owner of the pony is on the far left or far right.
6. **Clue 6**: The owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the cat.
7. **Clue 7**: The French is somewhere between the owner of the goat and the person eating lime.
8. **Clue 8**: The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian.
9. **Clue 9**: The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating avocado.
10. **Clue 10**: The person eating watermelon is not the owner of the cat.
11. **Clue 11**: The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the person eating papaya.
12. **Clue 12**: The Indonesian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat.
13. **Clue 13**: The person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating lime.
14. **Clue 14**: The Indonesian is on the left of the person eating watermelon.

### Step 2: Deduce the Order

From **Clue 5**, we know the owner of the pony is either in position 1 or 5.

From **Clue 2**, the British must be to the right of the Indonesian.

From **Clue 13** and **Clue 14**, we can place the person eating papaya and lime:
- The person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating lime.
- The Indonesian is on the left of the person eating watermelon.

This implies:
- Papaya is before Lime.
- Indonesian is before Watermelon.

From **Clue 9**, the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating avocado.

From **Clue 1**, the person eating avocado is to the left of the Italian.

From **Clue 4**, the French is between the cat and the goat.

From **Clue 6**, the goat is to the right of the cat.

From **Clue 7**, the French is between the goat and the person eating lime.

From **Clue 8**, the rat is to the right of the Indonesian.

From **Clue 10**, the person eating watermelon is not the owner of the cat.

### Step 3: Place the Nationalities and Pets

Based on the above deductions, let's start placing:

1. Since the British is to the right of the Indonesian, and the Indonesian is to the left of the person eating watermelon, the Indonesian cannot be in position 5 (since it would mean the British is also in position 5, which is impossible).

2. The person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating lime, and the Indonesian is on the left of the person eating watermelon. This means:
   - Position 1: Indonesian
   - Position 2: British (since it's to the right of the Indonesian)
   - Position 3: Person eating papaya
   - Position 4: Person eating lime
   - Position 5: Person eating watermelon (since it's to the right of the Indonesian)

3. From **Clue 5**, the owner of the pony is either in position 1 or 5. Since the Indonesian is in position 1, the pony must be in position 5.

4. From **Clue 10**, the person eating watermelon is not the owner of the cat, so the cat must be in one of the other positions.

5. From **Clue 6**, the goat is to the right of the cat, so the cat cannot be in position 5 (where the goat would be). Therefore, the cat is in position 2, and the goat is in position 3.

6. From **Clue 3**, the French is not the person eating avocado, so the French must be in position 4.

7. From **Clue 7**, the French is between the goat and the person eating lime, so the person eating lime must be in position 4, making the French in position 3.

8. From **Clue 9**, the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating avocado, and the person eating avocado is to the left of the Italian. Therefore, the person eating pineapple must be in position 1, and the person eating avocado must be in position 2.

9. From **Clue 8**, the owner of the rat is to the right of the Indonesian, so the rat must be in position 5.

10. **The journalist is the Turkish**.
11. **The Turkish is on the left of the Malaysian**.
12. **The dancer is on the left of the videographer**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 3 is for Lemonade**: From clue 2, we know that the person drinking lemonade is in position 3.
   
   |               |     1     |      2       |    3     |     4      |     5     |

2. **Turkish is the Journalist and on the left of the Malaysian**: From clue 10 and 11, we know that the Turkish (Journalist) must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, but since position 3 is taken by lemonade, the Turkish can only be in positions 1 or 2. The Malaysian must be to the right of the Turkish. So, let's place the Turkish first.

   - If Turkish is in position 1, then Malaysian must be in position 2 or 4 or 5.
   - If Turkish is in position 2, then Malaysian must be in position 3 or 4 or 5, but position 3 is already taken by lemonade, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

3. **Indonesian is between Lemonade and Juice**: From clue 6, the Indonesian must be in a position between position 3 (Lemonade) and the position of Juice. Since the Indonesian cannot be in position 3, they must be in positions 1 or 2 if Turkish is in position 1, or in positions 2 or 4 if Turkish is in position 2.

4. **Fanta is to the right of the Dancer and to the left of the Turkish**: From clue 4 and 5, Fanta must be in a position to the right of the Dancer and to the left of the Turkish. This means the Dancer must be to the left of Fanta and Fanta must be to the left of the Turkish.

5. **Mirinda is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5)**: From clue 7, Mirinda can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

6. **British is the Engineer and between Videographer and Tea**: From clue 8 and 9, the British (Engineer) must be between the Videographer and the person drinking Tea.

### Final Placement:

- **Turkish (Journalist) in position 1**: This makes Malaysian in position 2.
- **Indonesian in position 2**: This fits with clue 6.
- **Lemonade in position 3**.
- **Dancer in position 4**: This fits with clue 4 and 5.
- **Fanta in position 5**: This fits with clue 4 and 5.
- **British (Engineer) in position 3**: This fits with clue 8 and 9.
- **Videographer in position 2**: This fits with clue 9.

4. **Clue 11:** The owner of the dog is on the right of the teacher.
   - Teacher -> Lacrosse (left of Dog owner)
   - Dog -> Position 3 (since it must be on the right of Lacrosse, which is in position 1 or 2)

5. **Clue 12:** The owner of the goat is on the far right.
   - Goat -> Position 5

6. **Clue 4:** The freelancer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis.

   - Freelancer -> Position 1 or 4

7. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
   - Tennis -> Position 2
   - Biathlon -> Position 3 (but we already know Tennis is in position 2, so this must be wrong placement for now)

8. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
   - Water-polo -> Position 1 or 2 (since Baseball is in position 4 or 5)

9. **Clue 6:** The owner of the hamster is in an even position.
   - Hamster -> Position 2 or 4

10. **Clue 7:** The teacher is somewhere between the person who's sport is biathlon and the police-officer.
    - Teacher (Lacrosse) -> Between Biathlon and Police-officer

11. **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the police-officer.
    - Lacrosse -> Teacher (Police-officer is in position 1, so Teacher can only be in position 2 or 3)
    - Teacher -> Position 3 (since Police-officer is in position 1)

12. **Clue 10:** The owner of the guinea-pig is not the person who's sport is lacrosse.
    - Guinea-pig -> Position 4 (since Lacrosse is in position 3 and Freelancer must be in position 1 or 4, and Freelancer is not Lacrosse)

13. **Clue 13:** The paramedic is not the owner of the hamster.
    - Paramedic -> Position 5 (since Hamster is in position 4 and Goat is in position 5)
    - Freelancer -> Position 1 (since Freelancer is on the left or right of Tennis, and Tennis is in position 2, so Freelancer must be in position 1)

14. **Final Adjustments:**
    - Biathlon -> Position 2 (since it's to the right of Tennis and Freelancer is in position 1)
    - Water-polo -> Position 4 (since Freelancer is in position 1 and Guinea-pig is in position 4, and Freelancer cannot be Water-polo)
    - Paramedic -> Position 5 (since Goat is in position 5 and Hamster is in position 4)
    - Police-officer -> Position 1 (since Teacher is in position 3 and Police-officer is between Biathlon and Teacher)
    - Freelancer -> Position 4 (since Freelancer is on the left or right of Tennis, and Tennis is in position 2, and Freelancer is not Water-polo)

15. The dutch is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading.

### Step-by-step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify positions for Hiking and Reading
- From clue 2, the person with the hobby of hiking is on the far left or far right.
- From clue 8, the person with the hobby of reading is in an even position (2 or 4).
- From clue 12, the person with the hobby of hiking is to the right of the person with the hobby of fishing.
- From clue 13, the person with the hobby of hiking is to the right of the fan of electronic.

Given these constraints, let's place the hiking person in position 5 (the far right) and the reading person in position 4.

#### Step 2: Place Fishing and Electronic
- Since hiking is in position 5, fishing must be in position 1 (since hiking is to the right of fishing).
- The fan of electronic cannot be in position 1 or 5. It can be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Determine Indie and Trance
- From clue 3, the fan of indie is the person with the hobby of fishing.
- From clue 1, the fan of trance is not the polish.

Since fishing is in position 1 and the fan of indie is also in position 1, we need to determine the remaining positions for trance and other nationalities.

#### Step 4: Place Polish and Dutch
- The colombian is between the fan of electronic and the polish (clue 4).
- The colombian is to the right of the person with the hobby of reading (clue 10).
- The colombian cannot be in position 4 (reading), so it must be in position 3.

Since the colombian is in position 3, the polish must be to the left of the colombian. Therefore, the polish is in position 2.

#### Step 5: Place Skydiving and Magic-Tricks
- The pakistani is on the right of the person with the hobby of skydiving (clue 5).
- The pakistani cannot be in position 5 (hiking). So, skydiving must be in position 4 and the pakistani in position 5.

Since reading is in position 4, this confirms skydiving is in position 4.

#### Step 6: Place Brazilian and Pop
- The brazilian is between the person with the hobby of hiking and the fan of indie (clue 6).
- The brazilian cannot be in position 1 (hiking) or 4 (reading). So, the brazilian is in position 3.

Since the brazilian is in position 3, the fan of indie (fishing) is in position 1, and the colombian is in position 3, the only position left for the fan of pop is position 2.

#### Step 7: Finalize the Table
- The person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 1 since the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 5, fishing is in position 1, and the person with the hobby of reading is in position 4.

### Placing Information in the Table:

Let's start by placing the Polish with puzzles and the person with camping on the left side since the australian is on the left of the person with camping.

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          |            |           |              |         |          |
| Hobby         |            |           |              |         |          |
| Nationality   |            |           |              |         |          |
```

Since the Polish is near the person with fishing and puzzles, let's place the Polish in position 5:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          |            |           |              |         |          |
| Hobby         |            |           |              |         | puzzles  |
| Nationality   |            |           |              |         | polish   |
```

Now, the person with camping must be in position 2 or 3, and the australian must be to the left of it:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          |            |           |              |         |          |
| Hobby         |            | camping   |              |         | puzzles  |
| Nationality   | australian |           |              |         | polish   |
```

The person with magic-tricks must be to the right of the Italian, and since the Italian is not the person with orange, the Italian must be in position 1 or 2. Since the person with puzzles is Polish, the Italian cannot be in position 5, so the Italian must be in position 1:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          |            |           |              |         |          |
| Hobby         |            | camping   |              |         | puzzles  |
| Nationality   | italian    |           |              |         | polish   |
```

The person with magic-tricks must be to the right of the Italian, so they must be in position 3:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          |            |           |              |         |          |
| Hobby         |            | camping   | magic-tricks |         | puzzles  |
| Nationality   | italian    |           |              |         | polish   |
```

The person with puzzles is Polish, so the Polish person must be in position 5:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          |            |           |              |         |          |
| Hobby         |            | camping   | magic-tricks |         | puzzles  |
| Nationality   | italian    |           |              |         | polish   |
```

The person with fishing must be near puzzles (position 4):

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          |            |           |              |         |          |
| Hobby         |            | camping   | magic-tricks | fishing | puzzles  |
| Nationality   | italian    |           |              |         | polish   |
```

The person with reading must be near cranberry, and the person with cranberry must be near the person with reading:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          | kiwi      |           | cranberry    | reading | pepper   |

| Nationality   | italian   | polish    |             |         |          |
```

Finally, the person with orange must be in position 1 or 5, but since the person with orange is not the Canadian and is between the person with camping and the person with puzzles, the only remaining option is:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          | orange    | kiwi      | cranberry    | reading | pepper   |
| Hobby         | camping   | magic-tricks | puzzles    | fishing |          |
| Nationality   | italian   | polish    |             |         |          |
```

Since the person with orange is not the Canadian, the Canadian must be in position 2:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          | orange    | kiwi      | cranberry    | reading | pepper   |
| Hobby         | camping   | magic-tricks | puzzles    | fishing |          |
| Nationality   | italian   | canadian  |             |         | polish   |
```

Finally, the person with reading must be the German:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |
| Food          | orange    | kiwi      | cranberry    | reading | pepper   |

| Nationality   | italian   | canadian  | german       |         | polish   |
```

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |    4    |    5     |

1. **Spanish (S) is the fan of jazz (J)**, so S -> 3 (since it must be to the right of Ame).
2. **Chinese (C) is on the right of the Argentine (A)**, so A -> 1 and C -> 5.
3. **Trance (T) cannot be the Chinese (C)**, so T -> 4.
4. **Ambient (Ame) must be to the left of the Spanish (S)**, so Ame -> 2.
5. **Salsa (Sa) must be to the left of skateboarding (Sk)**, so Sa -> 1 and Sk -> 4 (but Sk is already T, so Sa -> 2 and Sk -> 4).
6. **Snowboarding (Sn) must be to the right of the Italian (I)**, so I -> 2 and Sn -> 4 (but Sk is already T, so I -> 1 and Sn -> 4).
7. **Handball (Hb) must be between the Spanish (S) and skateboarding (Sk)**, so Hb -> 4.
8. **Cricket (Cr) must be to the right of skateboarding (Sk)**, so Cr -> 5.

Thus, the final solution is:
