Lv7-2x5-1	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to solve this puzzle:

1. **The person watching adventure movies is in an odd position (1 or 3 or 5).**
2. **The person watching action movies is somewhere between the person watching scientific movies and the security-guard.**
3. **The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the project-manager.**
4. **The engineer is on the far left or far right.**
5. **The person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching documentary movies.**
6. **The person watching scientific movies is somewhere between the freelancer and the project-manager.**
7. **The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the security-guard.**
8. **The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.**

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1:
- The person watching adventure movies is in position 1, 3, or 5.

#### Clue 4:
- The engineer is on the far left (position 1) or far right (position 5).

#### Clue 2:
- The person watching action movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the security-guard.
- This means the order must be: scientific -> action -> security-guard or security-guard -> action -> scientific.

#### Clue 6:
- The person watching scientific movies is between the freelancer and the project-manager.
- This means the order must be: freelancer -> scientific -> project-manager or project-manager -> scientific -> freelancer.

#### Clue 7:
- The person watching family movies is to the right of the security-guard.
- This means the security-guard cannot be in position 5 (since there would be no right position for family).

#### Clue 8:
- The person watching documentary movies is to the right of the person watching action movies.
- This means the order must be: action -> documentary or action -> documentary -> other.

#### Clue 3:
- The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the project-manager.
- If the project-manager is in position 3, then adventure can only be in position 1 or 5.

#### Clue 5:
- The person watching family movies is to the left of the person watching documentary movies.
- This means the order must be: family -> documentary or family -> documentary -> other.

### Possible Configurations:

1. **Position 1 (Far Left): Engineer**
2. **Position 3 (Project-Manager):**
3. **Position 5 (Far Right): Freelancer**

Given these positions, let's assign the remaining jobs and genres:

- **Position 1 (Engineer)**: This leaves positions 2, 4 for the remaining jobs.
- **Position 3 (Project-Manager)**: This leaves positions 2, 4, 5 for the remaining jobs.
- **Position 5 (Freelancer)**: This leaves positions 2, 4 for the remaining jobs.

Now, let's fit the movie genres:

1. **Adventure** (odd position):
    - Position 1: Engineer (can't watch adventure)
    - Position 3: Project-Manager (can watch adventure)
    - Position 5: Freelancer (can't watch adventure)

So, **Position 3 (Project-Manager)** watches **adventure**.

2. **Action**:
    - Between Scientific and Security-Guard.
    - Position 4 (Freelancer): can't watch action.
    - Position 2 (can watch action).

So, **Position 2 (Freelancer)** watches **action**.

3. **Scientific**:
    - Between Freelancer and Project-Manager.
    - Position 2: Freelancer (watches action).
    - Position 3: Project-Manager (watches adventure).

So, **Position 4 (Security-Guard)** watches **scientific**.

4. **Family**:
    - To the right of Security-Guard.
    - Position 4 (Security-Guard): watches scientific.
    - Position 5 (Freelancer): watches scientific (can't be family).

So, **Position 2 (Freelancer)** watches **family**.

5. **Documentary**:
    - To the right of Action.
    - Position 2 (Freelancer): watches action.
    - Position 4 (Security-Guard): watches scientific.

So, **Position 4 (Security-Guard)** watches **documentary**.

6. **Videographer**:
    - Remaining job.
    - Position 1 (Engineer): watches scientific.

Lv7-2x5-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Summary:
1. The person eating nectarine is somewhere to the left of the person eating plum.
2. The person eating radish is between the person eating eggplant and the person driving the train.
3. The person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway.
4. The person driving the trike is on the far right.
5. The person eating eggplant is somewhere to the left of the person eating radish.
6. The person driving the jet-ski is on the far left or far right.
7. The person eating radish is somewhere between the person eating plum and the person driving the roller.
8. The person eating blueberry is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place Blueberry and Jet-Ski
From clue 8, the person eating blueberry is on the far left.
From clue 6, the person driving the jet-ski is on the far left or far right. Since the blueberry is already on the far left, the jet-ski must be on the far right.
```
| Blueberry |     1     |    2     |   3    |     4     | Jet-ski |
```

#### Step 2: Place Plum and Nectarine
From clue 1, the person eating nectarine is somewhere to the left of the person eating plum. This means nectarine cannot be in position 5 (since plum must be to its right).

#### Step 3: Place Radish, Eggplant, and Train
From clue 2, the person eating radish is between the person eating eggplant and the person driving the train.
From clue 4, the person driving the trike is on the far right, which we already placed as Jet-ski.
From clue 5, the person eating eggplant is somewhere to the left of the person eating radish.

Since the jet-ski is in position 5, the trike cannot be there, and the person driving the trike is on the far right. This leaves positions 3 and 4 for the train and the person driving it.

Given that the person eating radish is between the person eating eggplant and the person driving the train, and the person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway, let's place them accordingly.

#### Step 4: Determine Subway and Roller
From clue 3, the person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway. This means the subway must be in position 2 or 3, and the train must be in position 3 or 4.

From clue 7, the person eating radish is somewhere between the person eating plum and the person driving the roller. Given the positions of the train and subway, the roller must be in position 2 or 4.

Since the person eating radish is between the person eating eggplant and the person driving the train, and the person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway, we can deduce:
- If the subway is in position 2, then the train must be in position 3, and the roller must be in position 4.
- If the subway is in position 3, then the train must be in position 4, and the roller must be in position 2.

Given that the person eating radish is between the person eating eggplant and the person driving the train, and the person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway, we need to fit all these pieces together.

Let's assume:
- Subway is in position 2.
- Train is in position 3.
- Roller is in position 4.

This means:
- The person eating radish must be in position 1 or 2.
- The person eating eggplant must be in position 1 or 2, but not in the same position as the person eating radish.
- The person driving the train is in position 3.

Given that the person eating radish is between the person eating eggplant and the person driving the train, and the person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway, we can place:
- Eggplant in position 1.
- Radish in position 2.
- Train in position 3.
- Roller in position 4.

#### Final Placement:
```
| Blueberry | Eggplant | Radish   | Plum    | Nectarine | Jet-ski |
```

Now we need to assign the foods and transportation modes:
- From clue 1, the person eating nectarine is somewhere to the left of the person eating plum. This means nectarine cannot be in position 5 (since plum must be to its right).
- From clue 2, the person eating radish is between the person eating eggplant and the person driving the train. This means radish is in position 2.
- From clue 5, the person eating eggplant is somewhere to the left of the person eating radish. This means eggplant is in position 1.
- From clue 7, the person eating radish is somewhere between the person eating plum and the person driving the roller. This means plum is in position 3.
- From clue 3, the person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway. This means the subway is in position 2.
- From clue 4, the person driving the trike is on the far right, which we already placed as Jet-ski.

Thus, the final solution is:
```
| Blueberry | Eggplant | Radish   | Plum    | Nectarine | Jet-ski |
| Transport | Subway   | Roller   | Train   | Trike     |        |
```"	{'blueberry': ['eggplant', 'radish', 'plum', 'nectarine', 'jet-ski'], 'transport': ['subway', 'roller', 'train', 'trike', '']}	False	0	False
Lv7-2x5-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct food and nationality in their respective positions. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The Pakistani is on the left of the person eating avocado.**
   - This means the Pakistani cannot be in position 5 (since there's no one to their right), and the person eating avocado must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

2. **The person eating lettuce is somewhere to the left of the Malaysian.**
   - This means the Malaysian cannot be in position 1 (since there's no one to their left).

3. **The British is somewhere between the Japanese and the Pakistani.**
   - This means the Japanese and the British cannot be next to each other, and the British must be between them.

4. **The person eating lettuce is somewhere to the left of the Pakistani.**
   - Combining this with clue 1, the person eating lettuce must be in position 1, and the Pakistani must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The person eating avocado is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the person eating avocado must be in position 1 or 5.

6. **The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple.**
   - This means the Malaysian and the person eating pineapple must be adjacent.

7. **The British is somewhere to the right of the Malaysian.**
   - This means the Malaysian cannot be in position 5 (since there's no one to their right).

8. **The Japanese is on the left of the person eating pumpkin.**
   - This means the person eating pumpkin must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 5:** The person eating avocado must be in position 1 or 5.
2. **From Clue 1 and Clue 4:** Since the person eating lettuce is to the left of the Pakistani and the Pakistani is to the left of the person eating avocado, the person eating avocado must be in position 5 (since it can't be in position 1 if the person eating lettuce is to the left of the Pakistani).
3. **From Clue 4:** The person eating lettuce must be in position 1.
4. **From Clue 1:** The Pakistani must be in position 2.
5. **From Clue 2:** The Malaysian cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 3 or 4.
6. **From Clue 7:** The British is to the right of the Malaysian, so the British cannot be in position 1 or 2.
7. **From Clue 3:** The British is between the Japanese and the Pakistani, and since the British cannot be in position 1 or 2, the only possible positions for the British are 3 or 4.
8. **From Clue 6:** The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple. Since the Malaysian is in position 3 or 4, the person eating pineapple must be in position 4 or 3 respectively.
9. **From Clue 8:** The Japanese is on the left of the person eating pumpkin, so the person eating pumpkin must be in position 3 or 4.

Let's summarize:
- Position 1: Lettuce
- Position 2: Pakistani
- Position 3: Malaysian
- Position 4: Pineapple
- Position 5: Avocado

Now, let's determine the nationalities:
- Since the British is between the Japanese and the Pakistani, and the British cannot be in position 1 or 2, the British must be in position 4.
- The remaining nationalities (Japanese and Polish) must fit the remaining slots:
  - The Japanese must be in position 3 because the British is to the right of the Japanese.
  - The Polish must be in position 5.

So, the final arrangement is:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |    5    |

Lv7-2x5-4	"Let's break down the clues step by step to solve this puzzle:

1. **The person driving the roller is somewhere between the Spanish and the Japanese.**
2. **The Egyptian is on the far right.**
3. **The person driving the helicopter is somewhere between the Egyptian and the Japanese.**
4. **The person driving the tram is on the far left.**
5. **The Canadian is on the left of the Japanese.**
6. **The person driving the bike is on the far left or far right.**
7. **The Spanish is on the left or right of the person driving the bike.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Place the Tram on the Far Left**
- The tram is driven by someone who is on the far left.
- This leaves positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 for the other transports.

**Step 2: Place the Egyptian on the Far Right**
- The Egyptian is on position 5.
- This leaves positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the other nationalities.

**Step 3: Determine the Roller Position**
- The person driving the roller is between the Spanish and the Japanese.
- Since the Egyptian is on the far right (position 5), the roller cannot be in position 4.
- The roller must be in either position 2 or 3.

**Step 4: Determine the Helicopter Position**
- The person driving the helicopter is between the Egyptian and the Japanese.
- Since the Egyptian is on the far right (position 5), the helicopter must be in position 4.

**Step 5: Determine the Bike Position**
- The person driving the bike is on the far left or far right.
- Since the tram is on the far left (position 1), the bike must be on the far right (position 5).
- But the Egyptian is already on the far right (position 5), so the bike must be on the far left (position 1).

**Step 6: Determine the Spanish Position**
- The Spanish is on the left or right of the person driving the bike.
- Since the bike is on the far left (position 1), the Spanish can only be in position 2 or 3.

**Step 7: Determine the Roller and Japanese Positions**
- The person driving the roller is between the Spanish and the Japanese.
- If the Spanish is in position 2, then the Japanese must be in position 3 (since the roller must be in position 3).
- If the Spanish is in position 3, then the Japanese must be in position 2 (but this would place the roller in an invalid position as it needs to be between the Spanish and Japanese).

Thus, the Spanish must be in position 2 and the Japanese in position 3, with the roller in position 3.

**Step 8: Determine the Canadian Position**
- The Canadian is on the left of the Japanese.
- Since the Japanese is in position 3, the Canadian must be in position 2 (but we already have the Spanish there). So, the Canadian must be in position 1.

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1     |    2     |   3    |     4      |    5     |
| Nationality   |  Canadian |  Spanish |  Japanese |  Helicopter |  Egyptian |
| Transport     |  Tram    |  Bike    |  Roller  |  Helicopter |  Helicopter |
```

This setup satisfies all the given conditions."	{'nationality': ['canadian', 'spanish', 'japanese', 'helicopter', 'egyptian'], 'transport': ['tram', 'bike', 'roller', 'helicopter', 'helicopter']}	True	5	False

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the owner of the hamster.**
2. **The owner of the bird is on the left or right of the person watching action movies.**
3. **The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.**
4. **The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.**
5. **The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies.**
6. **The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the owner of the bird.**
7. **The owner of the bird is somewhere between the person watching action movies and the owner of the rabbit.**
8. **The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person watching animation movies.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4 (Person watching action movies) is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.**
   - Let's denote the positions as:
     - Action: A
     - Mystery: M
     - A is to the left of M.

2. **Clue 3 (Person watching zombie movies) is on the left of the person watching action movies.**
   - Z is to the left of A.
   - So, the order is: Z -> A -> M.

3. **Clue 1 (Mystery is on the left of the owner of the hamster).**
   - Since M is third, the hamster owner must be in position 4 or 5.
   - So, the order so far is: Z -> A -> M -> _ -> _ (Hamster owner).

4. **Clue 8 (Owner of the hamster is on the left of the person watching animation movies).**
   - The hamster owner cannot be in position 5 because then there would be no room for the animation movie owner.
   - So, the hamster owner is in position 4, and the animation movie owner is in position 5.
   - Now we have: Z -> A -> M -> Hamster -> Animation.

5. **Clue 2 (Owner of the bird is on the left or right of the person watching action movies).**
   - The bird owner can only be in position 2 or 3.
   - But from Clue 7 (Bird owner is between action and rabbit), the bird owner must be in position 2 and the rabbit owner in position 3.
   - So, the order now is: Z -> Bird -> Action -> Mystery -> Hamster -> Animation.

6. **Clue 5 (Scientific movies are to the left of animation movies).**
   - Scientific movies must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since the bird owner is in position 2, the scientific movies must be in position 1.
   - So, the final order is: Scientific -> Bird -> Action -> Mystery -> Hamster -> Animation.

7. **Clue 6 (Owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the owner of the bird).**
   - The bird owner is in position 2, so the lizard owner must be in position 1 or 3.
   - But position 1 is already taken by scientific movies.
   - So, the lizard owner must be in position 3.
   - The rabbit owner is in position 4 (as per Clue 7).

8. **Assigning the genres to the movies:**
   - Position 1: Scientific
   - Position 2: Bird
   - Position 3: Action
   - Position 4: Mystery
   - Position 5: Hamster
   - Position 6: Animation

9. **Assigning the pets:**
   - Position 1: Scientific -> Rabbit (from Clue 7)
   - Position 2: Bird -> Lizard (from Clue 6)
   - Position 3: Action -> Hamster (from Clue 1 and Clue 4)
   - Position 4: Mystery -> Rat (remaining pet)
   - Position 5: Hamster -> Bird (from Clue 3 and Clue 1)
   - Position 6: Animation -> Lizard (remaining pet)

Lv7-2x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the movie genres and pets in the correct order. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching superhero movies is somewhere between the owner of the dog and the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - This means that the sequence must be: (Dog) -> (Superhero) -> (Martial-Arts) or (Martial-Arts) -> (Superhero) -> (Dog).

2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog.
   - This means that if the dog is in position 1, the hamster cannot be in position 1. If the dog is in position 2, the hamster cannot be in positions 1 or 2, etc.

3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the person watching satire movies.
   - This means that the satire movie cannot be in the last position (position 5), and the rabbit must be in a position to the right of the satire movie.

4. **Clue 4:** The person watching adventure movies is somewhere between the owner of the rabbit and the person watching zombie movies.
   - This means that the sequence must be: (Rabbit) -> (Adventure) -> (Zombie) or (Zombie) -> (Adventure) -> (Rabbit).

5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the hamster.
   - This means that if the goldfish is in position 1, the hamster cannot be in position 1. If the goldfish is in position 2, the hamster cannot be in positions 1 or 2, etc.

6. **Clue 6:** The person watching satire movies is somewhere between the owner of the goldfish and the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - This means that the sequence must be: (Goldfish) -> (Satire) -> (Martial-Arts) or (Martial-Arts) -> (Satire) -> (Goldfish).

7. **Clue 7:** The owner of the rabbit is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - This means that the rabbit can be before or after the martial-arts movie.

8. **Clue 8:** The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies.
   - This means that the sequence must be: (Superhero) -> (Martial-Arts) or (Martial-Arts) -> (Superhero).

9. **Clue 9:** The person watching satire movies is in an odd position.
   - This means that the satire movie must be in either position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, let's start placing the elements based on these clues:

- From Clue 9, the satire movie is in position 1, 3, or 5.
- From Clue 6, the satire movie is between the goldfish and the martial-arts movie.
- From Clue 5, the goldfish is on the left of the hamster.
- From Clue 1, the superhero movie is between the dog and the martial-arts movie.
- From Clue 2, the hamster is to the right of the dog.
- From Clue 4, the adventure movie is between the rabbit and the zombie movie.
- From Clue 7, the rabbit is next to the martial-arts movie.
- From Clue 8, the martial-arts movie is next to the superhero movie.

Let's try to fit these clues together:

- If the satire movie is in position 1, then the goldfish must be in position 2, and the martial-arts movie must be in position 3 (since it has to be to the right of the goldfish).
- The superhero movie must be in position 4 (between the dog and the martial-arts movie).
- The rabbit must be in position 5 (since the adventure movie is between the rabbit and the zombie movie, and the rabbit must be next to the martial-arts movie).

So, the sequence for movies is:
- Position 1: Satire
- Position 2: Goldfish
- Position 3: Martial-Arts
- Position 4: Superhero
- Position 5: Rabbit

Now, we need to place the pets:

- The hamster is to the right of the dog (Clue 2).
- The rabbit is to the right of the satire movie (Clue 3).

Given the sequence, the only way to satisfy all conditions is:
- Dog in position 2
- Hamster in position 4
- Rabbit in position 5

   ```

2. **Clue 6**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the frog.

   Since the owner of the frog is the same as the person drinking hot-chocolate, and the owner of the rabbit drinks juice (clue 7), we can place these:

   ```

3. **Clue 2**: The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the owner of the rabbit.
   
   Since the owner of the frog is in position 2 and the owner of the rabbit drinks juice (in position 5), the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3:

   ```
   | Mirinda | Hot-Chocolate | Almond-Milk |       | Juice |
   |         | Frog          |             |       |       |
   ```

4. **Clue 1**: The owner of the rabbit is not the person drinking mirinda, which is already true from clue 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person drinking juice.

   Since the person drinking juice is in position 5, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 4:

   ```
   | Mirinda | Hot-Chocolate | Almond-Milk | Hedgehog | Juice |
   |         | Frog          |             |          |       |
   ```

6. **Clue 5**: The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the cat.

   Since positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are filled, the only remaining positions are 1 and 3 for the owners of the dog and cat. Given that the owner of the dog must be to the left of the owner of the cat, the owner of the dog must be in position 1 and the owner of the cat in position 3:

   ```
   | Dog     | Hot-Chocolate | Almond-Milk | Hedgehog | Juice |
   |         | Frog          |             |          |       |
   ```

7. **Clue 7**: The owner of the rabbit is the person drinking juice.

   This is already satisfied as per our previous placement.

8. **Clue 8**: The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.

   We have already placed the owner of the hedgehog in position 4, and the owner of the frog in position 2, so this is satisfied.

9. **Clue 9**: The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice.

   We have already placed the person drinking almond-milk in position 3 and the person drinking juice in position 5, so this is satisfied.

10. **Clue 10**: The person drinking juice is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog.

    We have already placed the person drinking juice in position 5 and the owner of the hedgehog in position 4, so this is satisfied.

11. **Clue 11**: The owner of the dog is in an odd position.

    We have already placed the owner of the dog in position 1, which is an odd position, so this is satisfied.

### Final Solution:

```
| Dog     | Hot-Chocolate | Almond-Milk | Hedgehog | Juice |
|         | Frog          |             |          |       |
```

So the final solution table is:

```
| Dog     | Hot-Chocolate | Almond-Milk | Hedgehog | Juice |
|         | Frog          |             |          |       |

Lv7-2x5-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and systematically place the information into the table.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat.
2. The owner of the dog is the person drinking tea.
3. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
4. The owner of the horse is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the owner of the turtle.
5. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person drinking milk.
6. The owner of the hamster is not the person drinking almond-milk.
7. The person drinking almond-milk is the owner of the turtle.
8. The person drinking sprite is on the far right.
9. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the owner of the horse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7**: The person drinking almond-milk is the owner of the turtle. This means that the turtle is owned by the person who drinks almond-milk.

2. **Clue 9**: The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the turtle is also the one drinking almond-milk, the owner of the horse must be to the right of the owner of the turtle.

3. **Clue 1**: The person drinking almond-milk (who is the owner of the turtle) is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat. So, the owner of the rat must be to the right of the owner of the turtle.

4. **Clue 2**: The owner of the dog is the person drinking tea. This means the person drinking tea owns the dog.

5. **Clue 3**: The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1 or 2 (because they own the turtle), the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The owner of the horse is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the owner of the turtle. Since the owner of the turtle is to the left of the owner of the horse, and the owner of the tea is to the left of the owner of the horse, the owner of the horse must be in position 3 or 4.

7. **Clue 5**: The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since the owner of the turtle is in position 1 or 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 6**: The owner of the hamster is not the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1 or 2, the owner of the hamster cannot be there. This means the owner of the hamster must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

9. **Clue 8**: The person drinking sprite is on the far right. This means the person drinking sprite is in position 5.

### Final Placement:

- Position 1: Almond-milk (owner of the turtle)
- Position 2: Lemonade (must be to the right of almond-milk, so it can't be in position 1)
- Position 3: Horse (between tea and turtle)
- Position 4: Dog (owner of the dog, who drinks tea)
- Position 5: Sprite (far right)

Given the constraints:
- Owner of the turtle (drinks almond-milk) is in position 1.
- Owner of the horse is in position 3.
- Owner of the dog (drinks tea) is in position 4.
- Owner of the turtle is to the left of the owner of the horse.
- The person drinking lemonade is in position 2 (to the right of almond-milk).
- The person drinking milk must be in position 5 (right of turtle).
- The owner of the hamster is in position 3 (between tea and turtle).

Lv7-2x5-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who's hobby is chess is on the far right (position 5).
2. The person eating tomato is between the person eating strawberry and the person who's hobby is hiking.
3. The person eating garlic is not the person who's hobby is hiking.
4. The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
5. The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
6. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person eating tomato.
7. The person eating strawberry is somewhere between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is chess.
8. The person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish.
9. The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion.

First, let's place the person with the hobby of chess in position 5:
```
|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |   5    |
| Food    |         |        |         |            |        |
| Hobby   |         |        |         |            | Chess  |
```

Next, we need to place the other hobbies:
- Hiking must be before chess, so it can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Collecting must be after hiking, so it can be in positions 4 or 5.
- Reading must be before strawberry, which must be between strawberry and hiking.

Since strawberry is between tomato and hiking, and strawberry is also between reading and chess, we can deduce that the order for these three must be:
```
|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |   5    |
| Food    |         |        |         |            |        |
| Hobby   |         | Reading| Strawberry| Collecting | Chess  |
```

Now, we know:
- Hiking must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Since hiking is before strawberry, hiking must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since collecting is after hiking, if hiking is in position 1, collecting must be in position 3 or 4.
- If hiking is in position 2, then collecting must be in position 4.

Let's test both scenarios:
1. **Hiking in position 1**:
   - Then, collecting must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If collecting is in position 3, then the only remaining position for puzzles is 2, and onion must be in 4.
   - This would mean strawberry is between tomato and hiking, which fits.
   - So, the arrangement could be:
     ```
     |         |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |   5    |
     | Food    | Tomato  | Puzzles| Strawberry| Onion     | Garlic |
     | Hobby   | Hiking  | Reading| Strawberry| Collecting | Chess  |
     ```

2. **Hiking in position 2**:
   - Then, collecting must be in position 4.
   - This would mean the only remaining positions are 1 for puzzles and 3 for onion, but this conflicts with the requirement that strawberry is between tomato and hiking.

So, the only valid scenario is:
```
|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |   5    |
| Food    | Tomato  | Puzzles| Strawberry| Onion     | Garlic |
| Hobby   | Hiking  | Reading| Strawberry| Collecting | Chess  |
```

Now, we assign the foods to each position based on the remaining clues:
- Garlic cannot be hiking, so it must be in position 4 (onion) or 5 (garlic).
- Since onion is in position 4, garlic must be in position 5.
- The remaining food, radish, must be in position 1.

Final solution:
```
|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |   5    |
| Food    | Radish  | Puzzles| Strawberry| Onion     | Garlic |
| Hobby   | Hiking  | Reading| Strawberry| Collecting | Chess  |

Lv7-2x5-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is badminton is the person drinking 7up.
   - This means that at position 1 (leftmost), we have 7up for beverage and badminton for sport.

2. **Clue 10**: The person who's sport is tennis is drinking soy-milk.
   - This means that at position 5 (rightmost), we have soy-milk for beverage and tennis for sport.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is tennis is on the far left or far right.
   - Since we already placed tennis at position 5, this clue is satisfied.

4. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking coffee.
   - Since soy-milk is at position 5, and the person drinking coffee must be between lacrosse and soy-milk, the only possible positions for coffee and lacrosse are 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is badminton is the person who's sport is badminton.
   - This clue doesn't provide new information but confirms the previous placement.

6. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - This means iced-tea cannot be at positions 1 or 5, and water-polo can be at either 1, 2, 3, or 4.

7. **Clue 6**: The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
   - This means the person drinking almond-milk must be next to the person with lacrosse.

8. **Clue 7**: The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - Since soy-milk is at position 5, almond-milk must be at position 4.

9. **Clue 2**: The person drinking almond-milk is not the person who's sport is water-polo.
   - So, the person drinking almond-milk (position 4) cannot have water-polo as their sport.

10. **Clue 9**: The person who's sport is baseball is not the person drinking coffee.
    - So, the person drinking coffee cannot have baseball as their sport.

Now let's place everything:
- Position 1: 7up (badminton)
- Position 2: (to be determined)
- Position 3: (to be determined)
- Position 4: almond-milk (lacrosse)
- Position 5: soy-milk (tennis)

Since iced-tea must be between lacrosse and water-polo, and water-polo cannot be at position 5 (tennis), it must be at position 2 or 3. Let's try placing iced-tea at position 3 and water-polo at position 2:
- Position 1: 7up (badminton)
- Position 2: iced-tea (water-polo)
- Position 3: (coffee)
- Position 4: almond-milk (lacrosse)
- Position 5: soy-milk (tennis)

This satisfies all the conditions:
- The person drinking almond-milk (position 4) is next to the person with lacrosse.
- The person drinking almond-milk (position 4) is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (position 5).
- The person drinking iced-tea (position 2) is on the left of the person drinking water-polo (position 2).

Finally, the remaining beverage and sport must fit:
- Position 3: coffee (baseball)

So the final solution is:

```
|            |    1     |      2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage   |  7up     |  iced-tea   |  coffee  | almond-milk| soy-milk  |
| Sport      | badminton| water-polo  | baseball | lacrosse   | tennis    |
