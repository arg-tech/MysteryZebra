### Step 2: Deduction Process

1. **Positioning the Person Watching Thriller Movies**
   - From clue 10, the person watching thriller movies is in position 4.
   
2. **Positioning the Person Driving the Trike**
   - Clue 1 suggests that the person driving the trike is between volleyball and cycling. Since volleyball is to the right of cycling, the person driving the trike must be in position 3.
   - Clue 11 confirms this, as the person driving the trike is between the fan of gospel and the person driving the motorbike. Given that the person watching thriller movies is in position 4, the person driving the trike cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 3.
   - Clue 13 states that the person driving the tram is to the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the person driving the trike is in position 3, the person driving the tram must be in position 1, and the person watching crime movies must be in position 2.

3. **Positioning the Person Watching Spy Movies**
   - Clue 2 states that the person watching spy movies is to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person driving the trike is in position 3, the person watching spy movies must be in position 5.
   - Clue 23 confirms this, as the person driving the trike is to the left of the person watching spy movies.

4. **Positioning the Fan of Gospel**
   - Clue 8 states that the fan of gospel is the person watching family movies.
   - Clue 9 states that the fan of gospel is to the left of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching spy movies is in position 5, the fan of gospel must be in position 2.
   - Clue 11 confirms this, as the person driving the trike is between the fan of gospel and the person driving the motorbike. Given that the person driving the trike is in position 3, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 4, which is already taken by the person watching thriller movies.

5. **Positioning the Fan of Jazz and Rock**
   - Clue 7 states that the fan of rock is between the person driving the airplane and the fan of jazz. Since the person driving the tram is in position 1, the person driving the airplane must be in position 2, and the fan of jazz must be in position 3.
   - Clue 12 confirms this, as the fan of rock is next to the person who's sport is climbing.
   - Clue 17 confirms this, as the fan of rock is to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.

6. **Positioning the Fan of Folk and Musical Movies**
   - Clue 15 states that the fan of folk is to the right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in position 3, the fan of folk must be in position 4, which is already taken by the person watching thriller movies.
   - Clue 16 states that the fan of folk is to the right of the person watching musical movies. Since the fan of folk is in position 5, the person watching musical movies must be in position 6.
   - Clue 18 states that the person who's sport is volleyball is to the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in position 1, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 2.
   - Clue 19 confirms this, as the person who's sport is sailing is to the left or right of the person driving the tram. Given that the person driving the tram is in position 1, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 3, which is already taken by the person driving the trike.

Lv7-4x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Clue 9 & Clue 12**: The person driving the van is the owner of the cat.
2. **Clue 21 & Clue 22**: The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
3. **Clue 19**: The person who's sport is parkour is on the far left (Position 1).
4. **Clue 26**: The person who's sport is biathlon is in an even position (Position 2, 4, or 6).
5. **Clue 23**: The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person driving the train.

From these clues, we can start placing some items:
- Position 1: Parkour
- Position 2, 4, or 6: Biathlon (since it must be on the left of the train)

### Placing the Train

Since the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person driving the train, the train must be in Position 4 or 6 if biathlon is in Position 2. However, since the person driving the van is the owner of the cat (Clue 9), and the van is in Position 6 (Clue 12), the train cannot be in Position 6 because the van is already there. Therefore, biathlon must be in Position 2, and the train in Position 4.

### Placing the Van

- Position 6: Van (owner of the cat)
- Position 2: Biathlon

### Placing the Turtle and Horse

- Clue 21 & Clue 22: The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
- Clue 20: The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
- Clue 25: The person who's sport is soccer is on the far right (Position 6).

Since the van is in Position 6, the person who's sport is soccer must be in Position 6. This means the owner of the turtle cannot be in Position 6, so the owner of the turtle must be in Position 3 or 5.

### Placing the Turtle and Horse

- Position 3 or 5: Turtle
- Position 3 or 5: Horse

Given that the owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the owner of the horse, and considering the positions, the only way to fit both is:
- Position 3: Horse
- Position 5: Turtle

### Placing the Ferret

- Clue 20: The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
- Since biathlon is in Position 2, the owner of the ferret must be in Position 4, 5, or 6.
- Position 6 is taken by the van, so the owner of the ferret must be in Position 4 or 5.
- Position 4 is taken by the train, so the owner of the ferret must be in Position 5.
- Therefore, the owner of the ferret is in Position 5.

### Placing the Cat

- Position 6: Van (owner of the cat)
- Position 5: Ferret
- Position 3: Horse
- Position 1: Parkour
- Position 2: Biathlon
- Position 4: Train

### Placing the Sports and Movies

- Clue 15: The person who's sport is golf is the person watching disaster movies.
- Clue 16: The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies.
- Clue 17: The person driving the scooter is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
- Clue 24: The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is golf.
- Clue 27: The person who's sport is soccer is on the far right (Position 6).
- Clue 11: The person driving the scooter is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
- Clue 10: The person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.
- Clue 5: The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour.
- Clue 7: The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the owner of the cat.
- Clue 8: The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the person driving the scooter.
- Clue 4: The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf.
- Clue 14: The person who's sport is soccer is the person driving the helicopter.
- Clue 28: The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person driving the train.

Based on all these clues, we can deduce:
- Position 6: Van (cat)
- Position 5: Ferret
- Position 3: Horse
- Position 1: Parkour
- Position 2: Biathlon
- Position 4: Train
- Position 6: Soccer (Helicopter)

Now, let's fill in the remaining sports and movies:
- Position 2: Biathlon (golf, disaster)
- Position 4: Train (snowboarding, sports)
- Position 5: Ferret (superhero, mystery)
- Position 3: Horse (soccer, romance)
- Position 1: Parkour (horror, mystery)
