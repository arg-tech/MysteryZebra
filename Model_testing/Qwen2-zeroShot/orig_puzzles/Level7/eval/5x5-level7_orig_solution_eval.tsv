- The Mexican must be in position 4 or 5. Since the designer is in position 4, the Mexican must be in position 5.
- The Nigerian is in position 5, but since the Nigerian cannot be the police-officer, this is consistent.
- The person with the hobby of chess must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the Argentine (designer) is in position 4, the person with the hobby of chess cannot be in position 4.
- The owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the owner of the turtle must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the Mexican is in position 5, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the owner of the turtle must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- The fan of punk is in an odd position, so it must be in position 1 or 3. Since the owner of the hamster must be to the right of the fan of punk, the fan of punk must be in position 1, and the owner of the hamster must be in position 2.
- The person with the hobby of gardening must be in position 3, and the accountant must be in position 1.
- The person with the hobby of baking must be in position 5, which is already occupied by the police-officer. Therefore, the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 4, which is already occupied by the designer. This means the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 3, and the person with the hobby of gardening must be in position 4.
- The person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 1, and the person with the hobby of chess must be in position 3.
