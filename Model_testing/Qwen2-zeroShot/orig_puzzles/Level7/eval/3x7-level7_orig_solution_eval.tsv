### Step 2: Assign Sports and Pets

From (9), we know:
- The owner of the snake is the person who's sport is soccer.
- Since (8) states that the person who's sport is soccer is on the far left or far right, and (9) tells us it's the owner of the snake, we can place the snake at either 1 or 7.

From (2), (15), and (16):
- The owner of the hamster watches action movies and is the person who's sport is surfing.
- The owner of the hamster is somewhere between the person watching crime movies and the owner of the turtle.
- The owner of the hedgehog watches romance movies.

From (23):
- The owner of the fish is on the right of the owner of the mouse.

From (12):
- The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish.

From (6):
- The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person watching western movies.

From (4):
- The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.

- The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.

### Step 3: Place Sports and Pets

Given the constraints, let's start placing the sports and pets:

1. Snake (soccer) at position 1 (since it's the far left).
2. Hedgehog (romance) at position 2.
3. Hamster (surfing) at position 3.
4. Turtle (crime) at position 4.
5. Fish (not next to the owner of the hamster, so position 5).
6. Guinea-pig (not western, so position 6).
7. Mouse (position 7, since the owner of the fish is on its right).

Now, let's assign movies:

1. Snake (soccer) - Spy (from (5))
2. Hedgehog (romance) - Romance
3. Hamster (surfing) - Action (from (2))
4. Turtle (crime) - Mystery (from (4))
5. Fish - Not western (from (11)), so it must be either action, crime, mystery, or zombie. Given (21), it cannot be crime, so it must be zombie.
6. Guinea-pig - Western (from (11))
7. Mouse - Sailing (from (25))

- From Clue 19: The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the person eating papaya. Possible positions for the person eating papaya are 1, 3, 5, or 7.
- From Clue 23: The photographer is somewhere to the left of the person driving the helicopter. Possible positions for the person driving the helicopter are 3, 5, or 7.
- From Clue 15: The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the musician. Possible positions for the musician are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
- From Clue 14: The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the musician. Possible positions for the person eating pepper are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
- From Clue 21: The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person eating pepper. Possible positions for the person eating pepper are 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

### Final Solution

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Clue 2**: The person drinking milk is the owner of the lizard.
2. **Clue 8**: The person who's hobby is fishing is the person drinking milk.
3. **Clue 15**: The person drinking milk is the owner of the lizard.
4. **Clue 19**: The owner of the lizard is the person who's hobby is fishing.
5. **Clue 20**: The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
   - Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1, and the person drinking milk (lizard owner) must be in position 2.
6. **Clue 14**: The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing (milk drinker).
   - Since the person drinking milk is in position 2, the person drinking fanta must be in position 3 or higher.
7. **Clue 17**: The person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog.
   - The person drinking milk (fishing) is in position 2, so the owner of the dog must be in position 1 or 2, but since the coffee drinker is in position 1, the owner of the dog must be in position 2 (which conflicts with the milk drinker). This implies the dog owner is in position 3.
8. **Clue 4**: The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.
   - The owner of the dog is in position 3, so the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is coffee, and position 2 is milk, so the mirinda drinker must be in position 1.
9. **Clue 18**: The owner of the horse is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard.
   - The owner of the lizard (milk drinker) is in position 2, so the owner of the horse must be in position 3 or higher. Given the dog owner is in position 3, the horse owner must be in position 4 or higher.
10. **Clue 3**: The person drinking 7up is in an odd position (4).
    - The person drinking 7up must be in position 3 or 5. But position 3 is already taken by the dog owner, so the 7up drinker must be in position 5.
11. **Clue 9**: The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling.
    - The 7up drinker is in position 5, so the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 6 or 7.
12. **Clue 10**: The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
    - If the traveling person is in position 6, the rat owner must be in position 5 or 7. But the 7up drinker is in position 5, so the rat owner must be in position 7.
13. **Clue 11**: The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
    - The rat owner is in position 7, so the traveling person must be in position 6.
14. **Clue 6**: The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the owner of the rabbit.
    - The person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 7 (traveling), so the owner of the rabbit must be in position 5.
15. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person drinking water.
    - The water drinker must be in position 7.
16. **Clue 13**: The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
    - The 7up drinker is in position 5, and the water drinker is in position 7, which satisfies this clue.
17. **Clue 22**: The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
    - The 7up drinker is in position 5, and the fanta drinker must be in position 4.
18. **Clue 12**: The person who's hobby is baking is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the owner of the pony.
    - The person who's hobby is fishing is in position 2, and the pony owner must be in position 4.
19. **Clue 16**: The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
    - The rat owner is in position 7, so the skydiving person must be in position 5 or 6. But the 7up drinker is in position 5, so the skydiving person must be in position 6.
20. **Clue 24**: The person who's hobby is camping is in an odd position (4).
    - The camping person must be in position 4.
21. **Clue 23**: The person who's hobby is camping is somewhere between the owner of the horse and the person who's hobby is board-games.
    - The camping person is in position 4, and the board-games person is in position 4, which means the horse owner must be in position 3.
