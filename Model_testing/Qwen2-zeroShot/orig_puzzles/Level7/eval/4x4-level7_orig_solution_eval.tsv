### Clues Summary:
1. The Colombian is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
2. The owner of the horse is on the right of the fan of trance.
3. The fan of blues is on the far left or far right.
4. The owner of the rabbit is the Russian.
5. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train.
6. The Colombian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
7. The owner of the dog is on the far left.
8. The person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the Russian.
9. The fan of jazz is on the left or right of the Spanish.
10. The owner of the rabbit is between the person driving the bike and the fan of blues.
11. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the horse.
12. The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram.
13. The person driving the tram is the owner of the rabbit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Owner of the dog on the far left** (Clue 7):
   - Position 1: Dog

2. **Fan of blues on the far left or far right** (Clue 3):
   - Since position 1 is occupied by the dog, the fan of blues must be in position 4.

3. **Owner of the rabbit is the Russian** (Clue 4):
   - Position 4: Russian

4. **Owner of the rabbit is between the person driving the bike and the fan of blues** (Clue 10):
   - Since position 4 is the Russian and position 1 is the dog, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 2 or 3. But since the fan of blues is in position 4, the owner of the rabbit cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 3.

5. **Owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the horse** (Clue 11):
   - If the owner of the rabbit is in position 3, the owner of the horse must be in position 2.

6. **The Colombian is on the left or right of the owner of the horse** (Clue 1):
   - Since the owner of the horse is in position 2, the Colombian can only be in position 1 or 3. But position 3 is taken by the Russian, so the Colombian must be in position 1.

7. **The owner of the horse is on the right of the fan of trance** (Clue 2):
   - Since the owner of the horse is in position 2, the fan of trance must be in position 1, but position 1 is taken by the Colombian. This indicates an error in our assumption, so we need to re-evaluate.

8. **Person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train** (Clue 5):
   - We need to place these two positions correctly.

9. **Person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the Russian** (Clue 8):
   - Since the Russian is in position 4, the person driving the train must be in position 2 or 3. But the owner of the horse is in position 2, so the person driving the train must be in position 3.

10. **Person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train** (Clue 5):
    - Since the person driving the train is in position 3, the person driving the bike must be in position 1.

11. **Turkish is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram** (Clue 12):
    - The person driving the tram is the owner of the rabbit, who is the Russian. So the Turkish must be in position 4.

12. **Fan of jazz is on the left or right of the Spanish** (Clue 9):
    - The Spanish must be in position 2 (since the owner of the horse is in position 2), and the fan of jazz can be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is the Colombian, so the fan of jazz must be in position 3.

10. **The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.**
11. **The designer is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
12. **The Russian is the owner of the horse.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the designer (Polish) and the Russian (owner of the horse):
- Designer = Polish
- Russian = Horse

|               |       1       |     2     |    3     |        4        |
| Job           |               |           |          |                 |
| Movie-Genre   |               |           |          |                 |
| Nationality   | Polish        |           |          |                 |
| Pet           |               |           |          | Horse           |

#### Step 2: Use clues involving the designer and the person watching martial-arts movies:
- Designer is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
- Owner of the lizard is between the bartender and the person watching martial-arts movies.
- Owner of the lizard is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.

From these, we can infer that the designer is not the person watching martial-arts movies, and the person watching martial-arts movies is to the right of the designer.

|               |       1       |     2     |    3     |        4        |
| Job           |               |           |          |                 |
| Movie-Genre   |               |           |          |                 |
| Nationality   | Polish        |           |          |                 |
| Pet           |               |           |          | Horse           |

#### Step 3: Use clue about the owner of the dog:
- The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the social-worker.
- The owner of the dog is to the right of the person watching action movies.

Since the designer is already placed, the social-worker must be in one of the other positions.

#### Step 4: Use clue about the German and the person watching zombie movies:
- The German is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies.
- The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.

This means the German cannot be the person watching zombie movies, and the person watching zombie movies is to the left of the owner of the lizard.

#### Step 5: Use clue about the bartender and the person watching crime movies:
- The bartender is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies.
- The person watching martial-arts movies is not the social-worker.

This means the social-worker is not in position 4.

#### Step 6: Use clue about the project-manager and the person watching crime movies:
- The project-manager is not the person watching crime movies.

#### Step 7: Use clue about the person watching martial-arts movies:
- The owner of the lizard is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
- The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.

This means the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 4, and the person watching zombie movies is in position 3.

| Job           |               |           |          |                 |
| Movie-Genre   |               |           |          | Martial-Arts    |
| Nationality   | Polish        |           |          |                 |
| Pet           |               |           |          | Horse           |

#### Step 8: Use remaining clues to fill in the rest:
- The designer (Polish) is not the person watching martial-arts movies.
- The German is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies.
- The German cannot be the person watching zombie movies.
- The owner of the dog is to the right of the person watching action movies.

Lv7-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
2. The scientist is the person drinking almond-milk.
3. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
4. The person drinking sprite is the person watching martial-arts movies.
5. The person who's hobby is cooking is not the person watching crime movies.
6. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
7. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the project-manager.
8. The police-officer is somewhere between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person who's hobby is cooking.
9. The police-officer is the person watching crime movies.
10. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person watching drama movies.
11. The mechanic is not the person watching crime movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the person watching crime movies.
From clue 9, we know the police-officer is the person watching crime movies.

#### Step 2: Position the person with the hobby of rock-climbing.
From clue 1, the person watching crime movies (police-officer) is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. So, the person with the hobby of rock-climbing must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Identify the scientist.
From clue 2, the scientist is the person drinking almond-milk.

#### Step 4: Position the person drinking almond-milk.
Since the scientist drinks almond-milk, the scientist must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But from clue 6, the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Therefore, the scientist can only be in positions 1 or 2.

#### Step 5: Identify the person drinking mirinda and sprite.
From clue 3, the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite. From clue 4, the person drinking sprite watches martial-arts movies. Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1 or 2, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 3 or 4.

#### Step 6: Position the person with the hobby of magic-tricks.
From clue 7, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the project-manager. Therefore, the project-manager must be in position 1 or 2, and the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 3 or 4.

#### Step 7: Position the police-officer.
From clue 9, the police-officer is the person watching crime movies, which is position 1. This means the person with the hobby of rock-climbing must be in position 2.

#### Step 8: Position the person drinking mirinda and sprite.
Since the police-officer is in position 1 and the person with the hobby of rock-climbing is in position 2, the person drinking mirinda and sprite must be in positions 3 and 4. From clue 3, the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking sprite, so the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3 and the person drinking sprite must be in position 4.

#### Step 9: Determine the remaining person and their beverage.
Since the scientist drinks almond-milk and is in position 2, the remaining person (in position 1) must be the project-manager. The remaining beverage (soy-milk) must be for the remaining person (in position 4).

#### Step 10: Determine the remaining hobbies and movies.
From clue 5, the person drinking mirinda is not the person watching martial-arts movies, so the person drinking mirinda (position 3) must watch either crime, drama, or satire. Since the police-officer (position 1) watches crime movies, the person in position 3 must watch either drama or satire.

From clue 10, the person drinking soy-milk (position 4) is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Therefore, the person in position 3 must watch satire, and the person in position 4 must watch drama.

From clue 5, the person with the hobby of cooking is not the person watching crime movies, so the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 4 (the person watching drama movies). Therefore, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 3 (the person watching satire movies).

From clue 8, the police-officer is between the person with the hobby of magic-tricks and the person with the hobby of cooking. Since the police-officer is in position 1, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 3, and the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 4.

Lv7-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Initial Setup:
We have 4 columns (1, 2, 3, 4) for each category: Beverage, Food, Nationality, and Transport.

|               |      1      |     2     |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      |             |           |          | soy-milk |
| Food          |             |           |          |          |
| Nationality   |             |           |          |          |
| Transport     |             |           |          |          |

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 7**: The person driving the ship is on the far left.
   - Transport 1: Ship

2. **Clue 8**: The person drinking soy-milk is the person driving the jet-ski.
   - Beverage 4: Soy-milk
   - Transport 4: Jet-ski

3. **Clue 11**: The Turkish person is drinking soy-milk.
   - Nationality 4: Turkish

4. **Clue 9**: The person driving the roller is somewhere between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the trike.
   - Since Transport 4 is Jet-ski, and Transport 1 is Ship, the roller must be between them.
   - Transport 2: Roller
   - Transport 3: Trike

5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship.
   - This is consistent with our previous assignments.

6. **Clue 10**: The person driving the ship is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
   - This is also consistent with our previous assignments.

7. **Clue 2**: The person drinking almond-milk is the person eating cabbage.
   - Beverage 2: Almond-milk
   - Food 2: Cabbage

8. **Clue 3**: The person eating banana is not the Turkish.
   - Nationality 2, 3 cannot be Turkish.

9. **Clue 4**: The person eating cabbage is not the person drinking milk.
   - Beverage 2 cannot be Milk.

10. **Clue 6**: The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage.
    - Beverage 1 or Beverage 3 is Milk.

11. **Clue 12**: The person drinking tea is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the person eating spinach.
    - Beverage 1 or Beverage 3 is Tea.
    - Beverage 1 or Beverage 3 is Spinach.

12. **Clue 13**: The person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the Brazilian.
    - Food 1 or Food 3 is Cabbage.
    - Nationality 1 or Nationality 3 is Brazilian.

### Assigning Remaining Values:

- From Clue 13, if Cabbage is at position 1 or 3, then the Brazilian is at the same position or adjacent.
- From Clue 12, if Soy-milk is at position 1 or 3, then Spinach is at the other position or adjacent.

Since we already know:
- Beverage 4 is Soy-milk.
- Nationality 4 is Turkish.
- Transport 4 is Jet-ski.
- Transport 1 is Ship.
- Transport 2 is Roller.
- Transport 3 is Trike.
- Beverage 2 is Almond-milk.
- Food 2 is Cabbage.
- Nationality 2 and 3 are not Turkish.
- Beverage 1 or 3 is Milk.
- Beverage 1 or 3 is Tea.
- Beverage 1 or 3 is Spinach.
- Food 1 or 3 is Cabbage.
- Nationality 1 or 3 is Brazilian.

Given that Cabbage is eaten by the person who drinks Almond-milk (Clue 2), and Cabbage is not eaten by the person who drinks Milk (Clue 4), and considering the positions, let's place them:

- If Cabbage is at position 1, then the person drinking Milk must be at position 3 or 4.
- If Cabbage is at position 3, then the person drinking Milk must be at position 1 or 2.

Let's assume Cabbage is at position 1:
- Beverage 1: Almond-milk
- Food 1: Cabbage
- Nationality 1: Brazilian

Now, the person drinking Milk must be at position 3:
- Beverage 3: Milk

Since the person drinking Tea must be between Soy-milk and Spinach:
- Beverage 2: Tea
- Beverage 4: Soy-milk (already assigned)
- Food 4: Spinach

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 4:** The person watching superhero movies is the person driving the ship (4).
