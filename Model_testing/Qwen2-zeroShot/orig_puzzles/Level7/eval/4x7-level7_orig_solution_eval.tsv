   - The sports are: biathlon, climbing, cycling, lacrosse, rugby, skiing, water-polo.

### Solving the Puzzle:

#### Step 1: Place Lacrosse and Water-Polo:
- The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far left.
- The person who's sport is water-polo is in an odd position (4th).

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |   4    |      5      |     6      |     7     |
| Food          |            |           |            |        |             |            |           |
| Hobby         |            |           |            |        |             |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |           |            | water-polo|             |            |           |
| Sport         | lacrosse   |           |            |        |             |            |           |
```

#### Step 2: Place Biathlon and Orange:
- The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
- The person eating orange is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
- The person eating orange is in an even position (4th).

Since the person eating orange is in position 4, and they are to the right of the person with woodworking as a hobby, the person with woodworking as a hobby must be in position 3. Also, the person with biathlon as a sport must be in position 5 or 6.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |   4    |      5      |     6      |     7     |
| Food          |            |           |            | orange |             |            |           |
| Hobby         |            |           | woodworking|        |             |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |           |            | water-polo|             |            |           |
| Sport         | lacrosse   |           |            |        | biathlon   |            |           |
```

#### Step 3: Place Skiing and Turkish:
- The person who's sport is skiing is in the middle (position 4).
- The Turkish is in an odd position (4th).

This means the Turkish person is in position 4, which conflicts with the previous placement. We need to adjust the positions accordingly.

Let's try placing the Turkish person in position 3 instead.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |   4    |      5      |     6      |     7     |
| Food          |            |           |            | orange |             |            |           |
| Hobby         |            |           | woodworking|        |             |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |           | turkish    | water-polo|             |            |           |
| Sport         | lacrosse   |           |            |        | biathlon   |            |           |
```

#### Step 4: Place Malaysian and Peas:
- The Malaysian is the person eating peas.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |   4    |      5      |     6      |     7     |
| Food          |            |           |            | orange | peas        |            |           |
| Hobby         |            |           | woodworking|        |             |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |           | turkish    | water-polo|             |            |           |
| Sport         | lacrosse   |           |            |        | biathlon   |            |           |
```

#### Step 5: Place Indian and Orange:
- The Indian is somewhere to the left of the person eating orange.
- The person eating orange is in an even position (4th).

So, the Indian must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |   4    |      5      |     6      |     7     |
| Food          |            |           |            | orange | peas        |            |           |
| Hobby         |            |           | woodworking|        |             |            |           |
| Nationality   |            | indian    | turkish    | water-polo|             |            |           |
| Sport         | lacrosse   |           |            |        | biathlon   |            |           |
```

#### Step 6: Place Australian and Banana:
- The Australian is somewhere to the right of the person eating banana.
- The person eating banana is on the right of the Thai.

So, the Thai must be in position 1, and the Australian in position 6.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |   4    |      5      |     6      |     7     |
| Food          |            |           |            | orange | peas        | banana    |           |
| Hobby         |            |           | woodworking|        |             |           |           |
| Nationality   | thai       | indian    | turkish    | water-polo|             | australian|           |
| Sport         | lacrosse   |           |            |        | biathlon   |           |           |
```

#### Step 7: Place Remaining Positions:
- The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
- The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the person eating lime.
- The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the Indian.

So, the person with biathlon as a sport must be in position 6.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |   4    |      5      |     6      |     7     |
| Food          |            |           |            | orange | peas        | banana    | lime     |
