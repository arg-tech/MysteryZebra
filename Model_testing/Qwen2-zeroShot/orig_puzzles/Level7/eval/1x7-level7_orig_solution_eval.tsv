Lv7-1x7-1	"Let's break down the clues step by step to determine the correct order of the music genres.

1. **The fan of techno is in the middle (position 4).**
   - This means the sequence around it will be: _, _, _, techno, _, _

2. **The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of techno.**
   - Since techno is at position 4, ambient can be either at position 3 or 5.
   
3. **The fan of dubstep is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the fan of techno.**
   - This means dubstep must be between reggae and techno, so reggae must be before techno and dubstep after reggae. Since techno is at position 4, reggae must be at position 3 and dubstep at position 5.
   - Now our sequence looks like this: _, reggae, _, techno, dubstep, _, _
   
4. **The fan of classical is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient.**
   - Since ambient is either at position 3 or 5, and we already have reggae at position 3, ambient must be at position 5. Therefore, classical must be to the right of ambient, which means classical is at position 7.
   - Our sequence now looks like this: _, reggae, _, techno, dubstep, _, classical
   
5. **The fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of reggae.**
   - Since reggae is at position 3, r&b must be at position 1.
   - Our sequence now looks like this: r&b, reggae, _, techno, dubstep, _, classical
   
6. **The fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of classical.**
   - We already placed ambient at position 5 and classical at position 7, which satisfies this condition.
   - The only remaining positions for r&b and ambient are positions 1 and 3, but since reggae is at position 3, ambient must be at position 3 and r&b at position 1.
   - Our sequence now looks like this: r&b, reggae, ambient, techno, dubstep, _, classical

7. **The only remaining genre is punk, which must go in the last position.**
   - Our final sequence is: r&b, reggae, ambient, techno, dubstep, punk, classical

Now, let's put this into the table format:

Lv7-1x7-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the helicopter is somewhere between the person driving the car and the person driving the train.
   - This means the order could be: Car, Helicopter, Train or Train, Helicopter, Car.

2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the train is somewhere between the person driving the roller and the person driving the helicopter.
   - This means the order could be: Roller, Train, Helicopter or Helicopter, Train, Roller.

3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train.
   - This means the trike must come before the train in the sequence.

4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the trike is somewhere between the person driving the van and the person driving the car.
   - This means the order could be: Van, Trike, Car or Car, Trike, Van.

5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train.
   - This means the train must come before the helicopter in the sequence.

6. **Clue 6:** The person driving the roller is somewhere between the person driving the helicopter and the person driving the trike.
   - This means the order could be: Trike, Roller, Helicopter or Helicopter, Roller, Trike.

7. **Clue 7:** The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3.

8. **Clue 8:** The person driving the snowmobile is on the far right.
   - This means the last position is the snowmobile.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

From Clue 8, we know:
```
7  |  Snowmobile
```

From Clue 5, since the helicopter is to the right of the train, and from Clue 2, the train is between the roller and the helicopter, we can start forming a sequence:
```
Roller, Train, Helicopter, ?
```

From Clue 1, the helicopter is between the car and the train, so the sequence now looks like:
```
Car, Train, Helicopter, ?
```

From Clue 4, the trike is between the van and the car, so the sequence could be:
```
Van, Trike, Car, Train, Helicopter, ?
```

From Clue 3, the trike is to the left of the train, which is already in the correct position:
```
Van, Trike, Car, Train, Helicopter, ?
```

From Clue 6, the roller is between the trike and the helicopter, so the sequence is:
```
Van, Trike, Roller, Car, Train, Helicopter, ?
```

Since we need to fit all vehicles into the seven positions and the snowmobile is at position 7, the only remaining vehicle is the van, which must be in the first position:
```
Van, Trike, Roller, Car, Train, Helicopter, Snowmobile
```

Lv7-1x7-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and place the transport means in their correct positions.

1. **The person driving the train is in an odd position (1 or 3 or 5).**
2. **The person driving the roller is in an odd position (1 or 3 or 5).**
3. **The person driving the train is on the left or right of the person driving the bike (position difference of 3).**
4. **The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship (position difference of 5).**
5. **The person driving the ship is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the taxi (position difference of 2).**
6. **The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train (position difference of 5).**
7. **The person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the ship and the person driving the bike (position difference of 7).**
8. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the scooter (position difference of 1).**
9. **The person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller (position difference of 5).**

Let's start placing the transports based on these clues:

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: Train and roller must be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
2. **Clue 3**: Train and bike must be 3 positions apart.
3. **Clue 4**: Taxi is to the left of ship.
4. **Clue 5**: Ship is between quad-bike and taxi.
5. **Clue 6**: Bike is to the left of train.
6. **Clue 7**: Taxi is between ship and bike.
7. **Clue 8**: Quad-bike is to the left of scooter.
8. **Clue 9**: Train is to the right of roller.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we know that both train and roller must occupy one of the odd positions. Let's try to place them first.

#### Trying Train at Position 3:
- If train is at position 3, then roller must be at either position 1 or 5 (since they are both in odd positions).

#### Trying Roller at Position 1:
- If roller is at position 1, then train must be at position 3 (since they are 2 positions apart).
- Now, bike must be at position 6 (since train is 3 positions to the right of bike).
- Ship must be at position 4 (since it is between quad-bike and taxi).
- Taxi must be at position 2 (since it is between ship and bike).
- Quad-bike must be at position 5 (since it is to the left of scooter).
- Scooter must be at position 7.

Let's check if all conditions are met with this arrangement:
- **Clue 3**: Train (3) and bike (6) are 3 positions apart.
- **Clue 4**: Taxi (2) is to the left of ship (4).
- **Clue 5**: Ship (4) is between quad-bike (5) and taxi (2).
- **Clue 6**: Bike (6) is to the left of train (3).
- **Clue 7**: Taxi (2) is between ship (4) and bike (6).
- **Clue 8**: Quad-bike (5) is to the left of scooter (7).
- **Clue 9**: Train (3) is to the right of roller (1).

All conditions are satisfied with this arrangement.

Lv7-1x7-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

1. **The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person driving the car**.
2. **The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car**.
3. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike**.
4. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the subway**.
5. **The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person driving the car**.
6. **The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right**.
7. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the trike**.
8. **The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the scooter**.
9. **The person driving the car is somewhere between the person driving the trike and the person driving the helicopter**.
10. **The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike**.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Constraint 6:
- The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right.
- Let's assume the subway is on the far left (we can check if it works on the far right later).

#### Constraint 4 and 7:
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the subway.
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the trike.
- Therefore, the order so far is: **Subway, Quad-bike, Trike**

#### Constraint 3:
- The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
- This fits with our current order: **Subway, Quad-bike, Trike**

#### Constraint 2:
- The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car.
- The person driving the car must be somewhere to the left of the person driving the scooter.

#### Constraint 9:
- The person driving the car is somewhere between the person driving the trike and the person driving the helicopter.
- This means the car must be between the trike and the helicopter.

#### Constraint 1 and 5:
- The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person driving the car.
- The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person driving the car.
- Since the car is between the trike and the helicopter, and the trike is on the right of the quad-bike which is on the right of the subway, we need to place the car and helicopter properly.

#### Constraint 8:
- The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the scooter.
- Since the car is between the trike and the helicopter, and the car is also between the quad-bike and the trike, the only place for the skateboard is before the quad-bike.

#### Final Arrangement:
- Let's try placing the subway on the far left:
  - Subway
  - Skateboard
  - Quad-bike
  - Trike
  - Car
  - Helicopter
  - Scooter

This arrangement satisfies all the constraints:
- The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the car (Helicopter after Car).
- The person driving the scooter is to the right of the person driving the car (Scooter after Car).
- The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike (Trike after Quad-bike).
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the subway (Quad-bike after Subway).
- The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the car (Trike after Car).
- The person driving the subway is on the far left (Subway at position 1).
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the trike (Quad-bike before Trike).
- The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the scooter (Skateboard before Scooter).
- The person driving the car is between the person driving the trike and the person driving the helicopter (Car between Trike and Helicopter).
- The person driving the skateboard is to the right of the person driving the quad-bike (Skateboard after Quad-bike).

Lv7-1x7-6	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.
3. The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
4. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is cooking (redundant with clue 1).
5. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
6. The person who's hobby is cooking is the person who's hobby is cooking (redundant).
7. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
8. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far left or far right.
9. The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere between the person who's hobby is cooking and the person who's hobby is puzzles.

First, let's use clues 1 and 2 to place cooking and gardening:
- Gardening is to the left of cooking.
- Chess is to the right of cooking.

This gives us the initial placement: 
\[ \text{Gardening} \rightarrow \text{Cooking} \rightarrow \text{Chess} \]

Next, we use clue 8 to place puzzles:
- Puzzles is on the far left or far right.

Since chess is already placed to the right of cooking, puzzles must be on the far left. This gives us:
\[ \text{Puzzles} \rightarrow \text{Gardening} \rightarrow \text{Cooking} \rightarrow \text{Chess} \]

Now, we use clue 3 to place chess:
- Chess is somewhere to the right of puzzles.

Since chess is already placed to the right of cooking, this confirms our current placement:
\[ \text{Puzzles} \rightarrow \text{Gardening} \rightarrow \text{Cooking} \rightarrow \text{Chess} \]

Next, we use clue 9 to place reading:
- Reading is between cooking and puzzles.

Since puzzles is on the far left, and cooking is next to it, reading cannot fit here as there is no space. Therefore, reading must be placed between chess and cooking:
\[ \text{Puzzles} \rightarrow \text{Gardening} \rightarrow \text{Reading} \rightarrow \text{Cooking} \rightarrow \text{Chess} \]

Now, we use clue 7 to place board-games:
- Board-games is on the left of magic-tricks.

Since puzzles is on the far left, board-games must be placed before magic-tricks:
\[ \text{Board-games} \rightarrow \text{Puzzles} \rightarrow \text{Gardening} \rightarrow \text{Reading} \rightarrow \text{Cooking} \rightarrow \text{Chess} \]
\[ \text{Magic-Tricks} \]

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining spot (position 6) with the only remaining hobby, which is magic-tricks.

Thus, the final solution is:
\[ \text{Board-games} \rightarrow \text{Puzzles} \rightarrow \text{Gardening} \rightarrow \text{Reading} \rightarrow \text{Cooking} \rightarrow \text{Magic-Tricks} \rightarrow \text{Chess} \]

Lv7-1x7-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each nationality in one of the seven positions while satisfying all the given conditions. Let's go through each condition step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Condition 1:** The British is somewhere between the Japanese and the Spanish.
   - This means the order must be Japanese (left), British (middle), Spanish (right) or Spanish (left), British (middle), Japanese (right).

2. **Condition 2:** The Turkish is on the left of the Colombian.
   - This means the order must be Turkish (left), Colombian (right).

3. **Condition 3:** The Spanish is in an odd position.
   - The possible positions for Spanish are 1, 3, or 5.

4. **Condition 4:** The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the Colombian.
   - This means the order must be Japanese (left), Colombian (right).

5. **Condition 5:** The Spanish is between the Argentine and the Colombian.
   - This means the order must be Argentine (left), Spanish (middle), Colombian (right).

6. **Condition 6:** The Nigerian is somewhere to the right of the Argentine.
   - This means the order must be Argentine (left), Nigerian (right).

7. **Condition 7:** The Nigerian is somewhere to the right of the British.
   - This means the order must be British (left), Nigerian (right).

8. **Condition 8:** The Colombian is somewhere to the left of the Spanish.
   - This means the order must be Colombian (left), Spanish (right).

### Combining Conditions:

From Condition 3, the Spanish must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

#### Case 1: Spanish in Position 1
- Spanish (1)
- From Condition 5, Argentine (2), Colombian (3)
- From Condition 4, Japanese (4), Colombian (5) - but this conflicts with Argentine (2), so Spanish cannot be in position 1.

#### Case 2: Spanish in Position 3
- Spanish (3)
- From Condition 5, Argentine (2), Colombian (4)
- From Condition 1, British (1), Japanese (2), Spanish (3), Colombian (4) - this fits.
- From Condition 4, Japanese (2), Colombian (4).
- From Condition 2, Turkish (1), Colombian (4) - but this conflicts with British (1), so Spanish cannot be in position 3.

#### Case 3: Spanish in Position 5
- Spanish (5)
- From Condition 5, Argentine (4), Colombian (6)
- From Condition 1, Japanese (2), British (3), Spanish (5), Colombian (6)
- From Condition 4, Japanese (2), Colombian (6).
- From Condition 2, Turkish (1), Colombian (6).
- From Condition 6, Argentine (4), Nigerian (5), British (3), Nigerian (5) - but this conflicts, so Spanish cannot be in position 5.

#### Correct Placement:
- Spanish (3)
- Argentine (2)
- Colombian (4)
- Japanese (2) - this conflicts, so let's re-evaluate.

Revisiting the conditions with correct placements:

- Spanish (3)
- Argentine (2)
- Colombian (4)
- British (1)
- Japanese (2) - conflict, so British must be before Japanese.
- Turkish (1), Colombian (4) - fits.
- Nigerian (5), Argentine (2), British (1), Spanish (3), Colombian (4), Turkish (1), Japanese (2) - all fit.

Lv7-1x7-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step using the given constraints:

1. The police-officer is on the left of the firefighter.
2. The police-officer is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
3. The mechanic is somewhere to the left of the scientist.
4. The mechanic is between the designer and the scientist.
5. The mechanic is between the writer and the designer.
6. The mechanic is to the left of the firefighter.
7. The security-guard is on the far left or far right.
8. The police-officer is on the right of the writer.
9. The mechanic is to the left of the writer.
10. The security-guard is on the left or right of the designer.
11. The police-officer is on the left or right of the firefighter.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Police-officer (PO) and Firefighter (FF):**
   - PO is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
   - PO is on the left of FF.
   
2. **Mechanic (M), Scientist (S), and Writer (W):**
   - M is between D and S.
   - M is between W and D.
   - M is to the left of FF.
   - M is to the left of W.

3. **Security-guard (SG):**
   - SG is on the far left or far right.

4. **Writer (W) and Police-officer (PO):**
   - PO is on the right of W.

### Possible Positions for PO and FF:
Since PO is in an odd position and on the left of FF, let's consider the possibilities:
- If PO is in position 1, then FF must be in position 3, 5, or 7.
- If PO is in position 3, then FF must be in position 5 or 7.
- If PO is in position 5, then FF must be in position 7.

### Consideration of M, S, and W:
- Since M is between D and S, and also between W and D, we can infer that D, M, and S (or W) must be consecutive.
- M is to the left of FF, so FF cannot be in position 1 if M is in position 1 or 3.
- M is to the left of W, so W cannot be in position 1 or 3 if M is in position 1 or 3.

### Security-guard (SG):
- SG is on the far left or far right, which means either position 1 or 7.

### Writer (W) and Police-officer (PO):
- PO is on the right of W, so W cannot be in position 5 or 7 if PO is in position 3 or 5.

### Combining all constraints:
- Let's assume PO is in position 1, then FF must be in position 3, 5, or 7.
- If PO is in position 3, then FF must be in position 5 or 7.
- If PO is in position 5, then FF must be in position 7.

Given the constraints, let's test PO in position 3 and FF in position 5:
- PO in 3, FF in 5.
- M must be between D and S, and also between W and D.
- M is to the left of FF (which is true since FF is in 5).
- M is to the left of W.
- SG must be in position 1 or 7.
- W must be to the left of PO (which is true since PO is in 3).

Possible positions:
- PO in 3, FF in 5.
- M, D, S (or W) must be consecutive.
- W must be to the left of PO (which is true since PO is in 3).

If W is in position 1, then:
- M, D, S must be in positions 2, 4, and 6.
- SG must be in position 7.

3. **The Egyptian is somewhere between the Canadian and the Polish.**
4. **The Malaysian is on the left or right of the Mexican.**
5. **The Japanese is on the right of the British.**
6. **The Canadian is on the left of the Egyptian.**
7. **The Mexican is on the right of the Japanese.**
8. **The British is somewhere to the left of the Japanese.** (This is redundant with clue 1)
9. **The Polish is somewhere to the left of the Japanese.**
10. **The British is somewhere to the right of the Polish.**

Let's analyze these clues step-by-step:

- From Clues 1 and 5, we know that the British must be immediately to the left of the Japanese.
- From Clue 2, the British is to the right of the Canadian, so the Canadian cannot be next to the British.
- From Clue 3, the Egyptian is between the Canadian and the Polish. This means the sequence involving the Canadian, Egyptian, and Polish must fit this pattern.
- From Clue 4, the Malaysian is either to the left or right of the Mexican.
- From Clue 6, the Canadian is to the left of the Egyptian.
- From Clue 7, the Mexican is to the right of the Japanese.
- From Clue 9, the Polish is to the left of the Japanese.
- From Clue 10, the British is to the right of the Polish.

Given these constraints, let's try to find a consistent order:

1. The British must be to the left of the Japanese and to the right of the Polish.
2. The Canadian must be to the left of the Egyptian.
3. The Polish is to the left of the Japanese.
4. The Mexican is to the right of the Japanese.
5. The Malaysian can be placed either before or after the Mexican.

Considering all these points, let's place the nationalities in an order that fits all the clues:

- Place the Canadian first because it needs to be to the left of the Egyptian.
- Place the Egyptian next because it needs to be between the Canadian and the Polish.
- Place the Polish next to the left of the Japanese.
- Place the British to the left of the Japanese.
- Place the Japanese to the right of the British.
- Place the Mexican to the right of the Japanese.
- Place the Malaysian either before or after the Mexican, but since the Mexican is already to the right of the Japanese, Malaysian can go anywhere as long as it's not to the left of the Mexican.

A possible order that fits all the clues is:
1. Canadian
2. Egyptian
3. Polish
4. British
5. Japanese
6. Mexican
7. Malaysian

So the final solution is:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Martial-arts (M) is on the left or right of Documentary (D).**
2. **M is somewhere between D and Zombie (Z).**
3. **Romance (R) is in the middle.**
4. **Scientific (S) is on the left or right of D.**
5. **Z is somewhere between S and Disaster (D1).**
6. **Z is on the left or right of Animation (A).**
7. **M is on the left of R.**
8. **R is somewhere to the left of Z.**
9. **R is on the left of A.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3: Romance (R) is in the middle.**
   - This means R is in position 4.
   
2. **Clue 7: M is on the left of R.**
   - Since R is in position 4, M must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

3. **Clue 8: R is somewhere to the left of Z.**
   - Since R is in position 4, Z must be in positions 5, 6, or 7.

4. **Clue 9: R is on the left of A.**
   - Since R is in position 4, A must be in positions 5, 6, or 7.

5. **Clue 1: M is on the left or right of D.**
   - Since M is on the left or right of D, and M is in positions 1, 2, or 3, D must be in positions 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.

6. **Clue 2: M is somewhere between D and Z.**
   - Given M is in positions 1, 2, or 3 and Z is in positions 5, 6, or 7, D must be in positions 3 or 5.

7. **Clue 4: S is on the left or right of D.**
   - Since D is in positions 3 or 5, S must be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

8. **Clue 5: Z is somewhere between S and D1.**
   - Since Z is in positions 5, 6, or 7 and D is in positions 3 or 5, S must be in positions 2 or 4, and D1 must be in positions 6 or 7.

9. **Clue 6: Z is on the left or right of A.**
   - Since Z is in positions 5, 6, or 7 and A is in positions 5, 6, or 7, Z must be in positions 5 or 6, and A must be in positions 6 or 7.

### Final Placement:

- **Position 1:** M (from Clue 7)
- **Position 2:** D (since M is in position 1 and D is to the right of M)
- **Position 3:** D (since M is in position 1 and D is to the right of M, and D cannot be in position 5 due to Clue 8)
- **Position 4:** R (middle position)
- **Position 5:** Z (since R is in position 4 and Z is to the right of R)
- **Position 6:** S (since Z is in position 5 and S is to the left of Z)
- **Position 7:** A (since Z is in position 5 and A is to the right of Z)

So, the final solution is:
