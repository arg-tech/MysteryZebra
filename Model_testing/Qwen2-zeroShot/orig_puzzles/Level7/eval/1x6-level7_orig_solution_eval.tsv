Lv7-1x6-1	"Let's analyze the clues step-by-step to determine the correct order of the music genres.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of folk is somewhere to the left of the fan of jazz.
   - This means folk comes before jazz in the sequence.

2. **Clue 2:** The fan of country is somewhere between the fan of classical and the fan of metal.
   - This means the sequence must be: Classical, Country, Metal or Metal, Country, Classical.

3. **Clue 3:** The fan of folk is somewhere between the fan of country and the fan of classical.
   - This means the sequence must be: Classical, Folk, Country or Country, Folk, Classical.

4. **Clue 4:** The fan of jazz is on the left of the fan of r&b.
   - This means jazz comes before r&b in the sequence.

5. **Clue 5:** The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical.
   - This means r&b comes before classical in the sequence.

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 1, we know folk < jazz.
- From Clue 2, we have two possible sequences for Classical, Country, Metal.
- From Clue 3, we have two possible sequences for Classical, Folk, Country.
- From Clue 4, we know jazz < r&b.
- From Clue 5, we know r&b < classical.

Combining all these, let's try to fit them together:

- Since r&b < classical (Clue 5) and jazz < r&b (Clue 4), we can place jazz, r&b, and classical in the sequence as follows:
  - jazz < r&b < classical

- Now, considering Clue 1 (folk < jazz) and Clue 3 (folk between classical and country), we need to place folk accordingly.

- From Clue 2, we know the sequence for Classical, Country, Metal must fit with the above constraints.

Given all these constraints, let's try placing the genres:

1. **jazz** must come before **r&b**.
2. **r&b** must come before **classical**.
3. **folk** must come before **jazz** and between **country** and **classical**.

A possible sequence that fits all these constraints is:

- **classical**
- **r&b**
- **jazz**
- **folk**
- **country**
- **metal**

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1   |    2    |  3   |  4   |  5  |     6     |
| Music-Genre   | classical | r&b | jazz | folk | country | metal |

Lv7-1x6-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The owner of the hedgehog is between the owner of the goat and the owner of the pony.**
   - This means that if we have positions G (goat), H (hedgehog), and P (pony), then the sequence must be G-H-P or P-H-G.

2. **The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig.**
   - This means G can be before or after the guinea-pig (G-GP or GP-G).

3. **The owner of the lizard is in an even position.**
   - Lizard can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

4. **The owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.**
   - If H is at position 1, G must be at position 3, 5, or 6. If H is at position 2, G must be at position 4 or 5. If H is at position 4, G must be at position 5 or 6.

5. **The owner of the hamster is somewhere between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the guinea-pig.**
   - This means if L is at position 2, H must be at position 3, and G must be at position 4. If L is at position 4, H must be at position 3, and G must be at position 5. If L is at position 6, H must be at position 5, and G must be at position 4.

6. **The owner of the goat is in an odd position.**
   - Goat can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Lizard is in an even position.** (Clue 3)
   - Possible positions for Lizard: 2, 4, 6.

2. **Goat is in an odd position.** (Clue 6)
   - Possible positions for Goat: 1, 3, 5.

3. **Hedgehog is between Goat and Pony.** (Clue 1)
   - Possible sequences: G-H-P or P-H-G.

4. **Hamster is between Lizard and Guinea-pig.** (Clue 5)

Let's start by placing Lizard in each possible even position and see which configuration fits all clues.

#### Case 1: Lizard in position 2
- Goat can only be in position 1 or 3 (Clue 6).
- If Goat is in position 1:
  - Hedgehog must be in position 2 (impossible since Lizard is there).
- If Goat is in position 3:
  - Hedgehog must be in position 2 (impossible since Lizard is there).

#### Case 2: Lizard in position 4
- Goat can only be in position 3 or 5 (Clue 6).
- If Goat is in position 3:
  - Hedgehog must be in position 2.
  - Guinea-pig must be in position 5.
  - Hamster must be in position 1.
  - This leaves position 6 for the pony.
  - Check: H-G-P, G-H-P (valid sequence).

- If Goat is in position 5:
  - Hedgehog must be in position 4 (impossible since Lizard is there).

#### Case 3: Lizard in position 6
- Goat can only be in position 5 (Clue 6).
- Hedgehog must be in position 4.
- Guinea-pig must be in position 3.
- Hamster must be in position 2.
- This leaves position 1 for the pony.
  - Check: H-G-P, G-H-P (valid sequence).

### Final Configuration:
- Position 1: Pony
- Position 2: Hamster
- Position 3: Guinea-pig
- Position 4: Hedgehog
- Position 5: Goat
- Position 6: Lizard

Lv7-1x6-4	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The fan of dubstep is on the far left.
2. The fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of indie.
3. The fan of indie is on the left of the fan of techno.
4. The fan of salsa is on the right of the fan of dubstep.
5. The fan of techno is somewhere between the fan of classical and the fan of indie.

We can start by placing the fan of dubstep in position 1 based on clue 1:
```
|               |    1    |   2   |     3      |   4   |   5    |     6     |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep |       |            |       |        |           |
```

Next, we place the fan of electronic to the left of the fan of indie (clue 2) and the fan of indie to the left of the fan of techno (clue 3). This means that electronic, indie, and techno must be in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively. However, we need to determine the exact order of these three genres. We also know from clue 5 that the fan of techno is somewhere between the fan of classical and the fan of indie. Let's explore the possibilities:

If we place electronic in position 2, indie in position 3, and techno in position 4, then the sequence for these three would be:
```
|               |    1    |   2   |     3      |   4   |   5    |     6     |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep | electronic | indie | techno |        |           |
```

Now, we need to fit the remaining genres (classical and salsa) into positions 5 and 6. From clue 3, we know that techno is between classical and indie, so classical cannot be in position 4. Therefore, classical must be in position 5 and salsa in position 6 because salsa is on the right of dubstep (clue 4).

So, the final arrangement is:
```
|               |    1    |   2   |     3      |   4   |   5    |     6     |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep | electronic | indie | techno | classical | salsa |
```

Thus, the final solution table is:
```
|               |    1    |   2   |     3      |   4   |   5    |     6     |

Lv7-1x6-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the nationalities in the correct order. Let's go through the clues step by step.

1. **The Mexican is somewhere between the Argentine and the Polish.**
   - This means the sequence must be: Argentine (A), Mexican (M), Polish (P) or Polish (P), Mexican (M), Argentine (A).

2. **The Thai is somewhere between the Polish and the Canadian.**
   - This means the sequence must be: Polish (P), Thai (T), Canadian (C) or Canadian (C), Thai (T), Polish (P).

3. **The Argentine is on the right of the Mexican.**
   - From Clue 1, we know that if the Mexican is between the Argentine and the Polish, then the Argentine must be to the right of the Mexican. So, the sequence must be: Argentine (A), Mexican (M), Polish (P).

4. **The Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Canadian.**
   - This means the Canadian cannot be on the far right.

5. **The Spanish is on the right of the Canadian.**
   - This confirms that the Spanish is to the right of the Canadian, so the sequence must include: Canadian (C), Spanish (S).

6. **The Polish is on the right of the Thai.**
   - This means the sequence must be: Thai (T), Polish (P).

7. **The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the Polish.**
   - This is already satisfied by Clue 1 and Clue 3 since we have Argentine (A), Mexican (M), Polish (P).

Now, let's combine all these clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we have: Argentine (A), Mexican (M), Polish (P).
- From Clue 2, we have: Polish (P), Thai (T), Canadian (C).
- From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we have: Canadian (C), Spanish (S).

Combining all the sequences, we get:
- Argentine (A)
- Mexican (M)

Lv7-1x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far right.
   - This means that position 6 is for martial-arts.

2. **Clue 2**: The person watching spy movies is between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person watching documentary movies.
   - Since martial-arts is in position 6, spy must be in position 4, and documentary must be in position 5.

3. **Clue 1**: The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - This is consistent with placing spy in position 4 and martial-arts in position 6.

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching horror movies.
   - This means that romance cannot be in positions 5 or 6, and horror cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

5. **Clue 6**: The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching documentary movies.
   - Since documentary is in position 5, crime can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

6. **Clue 5**: The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies.
   - Since documentary is in position 5, crime must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (consistent with Clue 6).

7. **Clue 7**: The person watching horror movies is somewhere between the person watching crime movies and the person watching romance movies.
   - This means that horror cannot be in positions 1 or 6, and it must be between crime and romance.

Let's now place the genres based on these clues:

- Martial-arts is in position 6.
- Spy is in position 4.
- Documentary is in position 5.
- Crime must be in position 1 (since it is to the left of documentary).
- Romance must be in position 3 (since it is to the right of crime and horror is between them).

Horror must be in position 2 (the only remaining position between crime and romance).

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Crime
- Position 2: Horror
- Position 3: Romance
- Position 4: Spy
- Position 5: Documentary
- Position 6: Martial-arts

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person who's hobby is photography is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
2. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
3. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening (redundant with clue 2).
4. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the far left.
5. The person who's hobby is photography is somewhere between the person who's hobby is gardening and the person who's hobby is woodworking.
6. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is photography.
7. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4:** Video-games is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Video-games

2. **Clue 7:** Rock-climbing is on the far left or far right.
   - Since Video-games is already on the far left, Rock-climbing must be on the far right.
   - Position 6: Rock-climbing

3. **Clue 5:** Photography is between Gardening and Woodworking.
   - Photography cannot be on the far left or far right because Rock-climbing is on the far right and Video-games is on the far left.
   - Therefore, Photography must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - Gardening and Woodworking must be on either side of Photography.

4. **Clue 1:** Photography is on the right of Woodworking.
   - If Photography is in position 3, Woodworking must be in position 2.
   - If Photography is in position 4, Woodworking must be in position 3.
   - If Photography is in position 5, Woodworking must be in position 4.

5. **Clue 2 & 3:** Cooking is on the left of Gardening.
   - Since Video-games is on the far left and Rock-climbing is on the far right, Cooking and Gardening must be in positions 2 and 4 or 3 and 5.
   - Given Photography is on the right of Woodworking, we can deduce that Photography cannot be in position 5 (because then Woodworking would need to be in position 4, and there wouldn't be room for Cooking and Gardening).

6. **Possible Arrangements:**
   - If Photography is in position 3, Woodworking is in position 2, and Gardening and Cooking must fit into positions 4 and 5.
   - If Photography is in position 4, Woodworking is in position 3, and Gardening and Cooking must fit into positions 2 and 5.
   - If Photography is in position 5, Woodworking is in position 4, and Gardening and Cooking must fit into positions 2 and 3.

7. **Final Arrangement:**
   - Considering all clues, the only valid arrangement is:
     - Position 1: Video-games
     - Position 2: Woodworking

1. From clue 7, we know that cranberry is to the left of lemon.
2. From clue 1, apricot is to the right of cranberry.
3. From clue 2, strawberry is to the left of apricot.
4. From clue 4, strawberry is between apricot and lemon.
5. From clue 5, lemon is on the left or right of strawberry.
6. From clue 6, apricot is to the left of blueberry.
7. From clue 8, strawberry is on the left of cucumber.

### Combining the Clues:
- Let's start with cranberry and lemon since they have a direct relationship (clue 7). We can place them first:
  - Cranberry (left) -> Lemon (right)

- Now, we need to place apricot and strawberry relative to these:
  - Apricot must be to the right of cranberry (clue 1).
  - Strawberry must be to the left of apricot (clue 2).
  - Strawberry must also be between apricot and lemon (clue 4).

Given the above, we can deduce:
  - Strawberry -> Apricot -> Lemon

- We now have the sequence: Cranberry -> Strawberry -> Apricot -> Lemon

- Since apricot is to the left of blueberry (clue 6), and strawberry is to the left of cucumber (clue 8), we can place the remaining foods:
  - Blueberry -> Cucumber

### Final Sequence:
- Cranberry
- Strawberry
- Apricot
- Lemon
- Blueberry
- Cucumber
