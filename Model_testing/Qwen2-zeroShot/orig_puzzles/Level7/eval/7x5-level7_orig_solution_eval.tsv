Lv7-7x5-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the appropriate categories. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 9**: The person watching disaster movies is on the far left.
2. **Clue 13**: The Japanese is the person watching adventure movies.
3. **Clue 12**: The Japanese is the person who's sport is surfing.
4. **Clue 11**: The Chinese is in the middle (position 3).
5. **Clue 24**: The person who's hobby is skydiving is in the middle (position 3).

So, we can place:
- Disaster movies: Position 1
- Adventure movies: Position 3
- Surfing: Position 3 (Japanese)

Next, let's look at the positions for the other elements:

6. **Clue 17**: The person driving the van is the person eating apple.
7. **Clue 16**: The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
8. **Clue 14**: The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person eating grapefruit.

10. **Clue 22**: The Egyptian is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon.
11. **Clue 28**: The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the Japanese.

From Clue 15, we know:
- Japanese (position 3) is between the person eating grapefruit and the scientist.
- The scientist cannot be in position 1 or 5 because there must be a person in between the Japanese and the scientist.

Since the Japanese is in position 3:
- The person eating grapefruit is in either position 2 or 4.
- The scientist is in either position 1 or 5.

From Clue 17:
- The person driving the van is the person eating apple.
- The person eating apple is in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Apple, Driving van

From Clue 9:
- Position 1: Disaster movies

So, we have:
- Position 1: Disaster movies, Apple, Driving van

From Clue 7:
- The person driving the van is the person eating apple.
- The person eating apple is in position 1.

Now, let's place the Japanese and the scientist:
- The Japanese is in position 3.
- The scientist is in position 5 (since the Japanese is in 3 and the scientist must be in an odd position).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Disaster movies, Apple, Driving van
- Position 3: Japanese, Watching adventure movies, Surfing
- Position 5: Scientist

From Clue 22:
- The Egyptian is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon.
- The person eating watermelon is in position 2 or 4.

From Clue 15:
- The person eating grapefruit is between the Japanese and the scientist.
- The person eating grapefruit is in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 2: Grapefruit, Between Japanese and Scientist
- Position 4: Watermelon, Egyptian

From Clue 14:
- The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
- The person watching drama movies is in position 1 (Disaster movies), so the person who's sport is water-polo is in position 2 or 4.

Since the person eating grapefruit is in position 2, the person who's sport is water-polo is in position 4 (Watermelon, Egyptian).

So, we have:
- Position 4: Watermelon, Egyptian, Sport: Water-polo

From Clue 16:
- The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
- The person who's sport is water-polo is in position 4 (Egyptian).

From Clue 28:
- The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the Japanese.

So, the person who's sport is handball is in position 4 (Egyptian).

So, the person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 4 (Egyptian).

So, the person watching zombie movies is in position 2 (Grapefruit).

So, the person driving the subway is in position 3 (Japanese).

- The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 3.

So, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 3 (Japanese).

From Clue 19:
- The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person watching fantasy movies.
