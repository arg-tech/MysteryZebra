Lv7-1x4-1	"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct order of the pets:

1. **The owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the snake.**
   - This means the snake must be in a position to the left of the frog.

2. **The owner of the goat is somewhere between the owner of the hamster and the owner of the snake.**
   - This means the goat cannot be at either end and must be between the hamster and the snake.

3. **The owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the goat.**
   - This means the hamster must be to the left of the goat.

Combining these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the goat is between the hamster and the snake, and the hamster is on the left of the goat, the only possible positions for the hamster, goat, and snake are:
  - Hamster (leftmost)
  - Goat (middle)
  - Snake (rightmost)

- The frog must be in the remaining position, which is position 1.

Thus, the order from left to right is:
1. Frog
2. Hamster
3. Goat
4. Snake

Now, let's present this in the required format:

```
|       |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |
| Pet   |  Frog   | Hamster | Goat | Snake |

Lv7-1x4-2	"Let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step to determine the correct order of the foods.

### Conditions Recap:
1. The person eating papaya is on the right of the person eating spinach.
2. The person eating papaya is somewhere between the person eating lettuce and the person eating apricot.
3. The person eating papaya is between the person eating lettuce and the person eating spinach.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

- From condition 1, we know that spinach must be before papaya.
- From condition 2, papaya is between lettuce and apricot.
- From condition 3, papaya is also between lettuce and spinach.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the foods in the correct order:

1. Lettuce (L), Papaya (P), Apricot (A), Spinach (S) or any permutation that satisfies all conditions.
2. Since papaya is between lettuce and apricot, and also between lettuce and spinach, the only possible order that fits all conditions is:
   - Lettuce must be first.
   - Papaya must be second.
   - Spinach must be third.
   - Apricot must be fourth.

So, the order should be:
- Lettuce (1)
- Papaya (2)
- Spinach (3)
- Apricot (4)

### Final Solution Table:
```
|        |    1    |    2    |   3    |    4    |
| Food   | Lettuce | Papaya  | Spinach| Apricot |

Lv7-1x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step-by-step:

1. **The person eating cabbage is on the left of the person eating pear.**
   - This means the sequence for these two foods must be: Cabbage (left) -> Pear (right).

2. **The person eating pumpkin is somewhere between the person eating pepper and the person eating pear.**
   - This means the sequence involving these three foods must be: Pepper (left) -> Pumpkin (middle) -> Pear (right).

3. **The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin.**
   - This clue reinforces that the sequence is indeed: Pepper (left) -> Pumpkin (middle) -> Pear (right).

Combining all these clues, we can deduce the order:
- Cabbage (leftmost)
- Pepper (second from left)
- Pumpkin (third from left)
- Pear (rightmost)

So, the final arrangement is:
- **Cabbage** (1)
- **Pepper** (2)
- **Pumpkin** (3)
- **Pear** (4)

Here is the final solution table:

```
|        |    1    |  2   |    3    |   4    |

Lv7-1x4-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the train is somewhere between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the jet-ski.
   - This means the order could be: Snowmobile -> Train -> Jet-ski or Jet-ski -> Train -> Snowmobile.

2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train.
   - This means the bike driver cannot be in position 4 (the rightmost position).

3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the bike is between the person driving the train and the person driving the snowmobile.
   - This means the order must include: Snowmobile -> Bike -> Train or Train -> Bike -> Snowmobile.

Let's combine these clues to find the correct order:

- From Clue 1, we know the order can be either:
  - Snowmobile -> Train -> Jet-ski
  - Jet-ski -> Train -> Snowmobile

- From Clue 2, the bike must be to the left of the train, so:
  - If the train is in position 3, the bike must be in position 1 or 2.
  - If the train is in position 4, it would violate Clue 2 as the bike cannot be to the left of the train.

- From Clue 3, the bike must be between the snowmobile and the train. Let's test both possible orders from Clue 1 with these conditions:

### Testing Order 1: Snowmobile -> Train -> Jet-ski
- If the train is in position 3, then the bike must be in position 1 or 2.
  - If the bike is in position 1, the order would be: Bike, Snowmobile, Train, Jet-ski.
  - If the bike is in position 2, the order would be: Snowmobile, Bike, Train, Jet-ski.

### Testing Order 2: Jet-ski -> Train -> Snowmobile
- If the train is in position 3, then the bike must be in position 1 or 2.
  - If the bike is in position 1, the order would be: Bike, Jet-ski, Train, Snowmobile.
  - If the bike is in position 2, the order would be: Jet-ski, Bike, Train, Snowmobile.

Now, let's check which of these fits all the clues:

- **Order 1: Bike, Snowmobile, Train, Jet-ski**
  - This satisfies Clue 3 (Bike is between Snowmobile and Train).
  - This also satisfies Clue 1 (Train is between Snowmobile and Jet-ski).

- **Order 2: Jet-ski, Bike, Train, Snowmobile**
  - This does not satisfy Clue 3 (Bike is not between Train and Snowmobile).

Thus, the only valid order is:

**Bike, Snowmobile, Train, Jet-ski**

So, the final solution table is:

```
|             |     1      |  2   |   3   |    4    |
| Transport   | Bike       | Snowmobile | Train | Jet-ski |

Lv7-1x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step-by-step:

1. **The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching crime movies.**
   - This means if the person watching crime movies is in position 1, then the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

2. **The person watching crime movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - This implies that the sequence must be Comedy -> Crime -> Martial-Arts or Martial-Arts -> Crime -> Comedy.
   - Given the first clue, the only valid sequence is Comedy -> Crime -> Martial-Arts.

3. **The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies.**
   - This means the person watching comedy movies can be either to the left or right of the person watching documentary movies.

4. **The person watching comedy movies is somewhere between the person watching documentary movies and the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - Since we already have the sequence Comedy -> Crime -> Martial-Arts, and the person watching comedy movies must be between the person watching documentary movies and the person watching martial-arts movies, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 1, and the person watching comedy movies must be in position 2.

Given these constraints, let's place the genres:

- Position 1: Documentary (since it must be before Comedy)
- Position 2: Comedy
- Position 3: Crime
- Position 4: Martial-Arts

Thus, the final arrangement is:

Lv7-1x4-6	"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct order of the nationalities.

1. **The Colombian is somewhere between the Turkish and the Russian.**
2. **The Thai is somewhere between the Colombian and the Turkish.**
3. **The Thai is either to the left or right of the Turkish.**
4. **The Thai is to the right of the Turkish.**

From clue 4, we know that the Thai must be to the right of the Turkish. From clue 2, the Thai is also between the Colombian and the Turkish. This means the order involving the Thai, Colombian, and Turkish must be either:
- Colombian - Thai - Turkish
- Turkish - Thai - Colombian

However, from clue 1, the Colombian is between the Turkish and the Russian. This means the order involving the Colombian, Turkish, and Russian must be either:
- Russian - Colombian - Turkish
- Turkish - Colombian - Russian

Since the Thai is to the right of the Turkish (clue 4), the only possible arrangement that satisfies all the clues is:

- Russian - Colombian - Thai - Turkish

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:
- The Colombian is between the Turkish and the Russian.
- The Thai is between the Colombian and the Turkish.
- The Thai is to the right of the Turkish.

So, the final solution is:

```

Lv7-1x4-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step:

1. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the person drinking almond-milk and the person drinking 7up.
2. The person drinking fanta is somewhere between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking almond-milk.
3. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up.

From these clues, we can deduce the following order:

- Since the person drinking iced-tea is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person drinking 7up (clue 1), and the person drinking iced-tea is also to the right of the person drinking 7up (clue 3), the order must be 7up, iced-tea, almond-milk.
- From clue 2, the person drinking fanta is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking almond-milk. Given that iced-tea is already placed between 7up and almond-milk, fanta must fit in the middle of the sequence 7up, iced-tea, almond-milk.

Therefore, the final order is:
- 7up
- fanta
- iced-tea
- almond-milk

Here is the final solution table:

```
|            |  1  |    2     |   3   |      4      |

Lv7-1x4-8	"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to solve the puzzle:

1. **The person watching action movies is in an odd position.**
   - This means the person watching action movies can be in position 1 or 3.

2. **The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person watching animation movies.**
   - This means the person watching animation movies must be in a position to the left of the person watching romance movies.

3. **The person watching animation movies is somewhere between the person watching action movies and the person watching horror movies.**
   - This means that if the person watching action movies is at position 1, the person watching animation movies must be at position 2, and the person watching horror movies must be at position 3. If the person watching action movies is at position 3, the person watching animation movies must be at position 2, and the person watching horror movies must be at position 4.

Now let's place these constraints into the table and see which positions fit all the clues.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Case 1: Action at Position 1
- If the person watching action movies is in position 1:
  - The person watching animation movies must be in position 2 (since it has to be between action and horror).
  - The person watching horror movies must be in position 3.
  - The person watching romance movies must be in position 4 (since it has to be on the right of the person watching animation movies).

This gives us:
- Position 1: Action
- Position 2: Animation
- Position 3: Horror
- Position 4: Romance

#### Case 2: Action at Position 3
- If the person watching action movies is in position 3:
  - The person watching animation movies must be in position 2.
  - The person watching horror movies must be in position 4.
  - The person watching romance movies must be in position 4, but this conflicts with the fact that there should be only one person in each position.

Thus, the only valid configuration is from Case 1.

### Final Solution Table:

Lv7-1x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right.**
2. **The person driving the van is somewhere to the right of the person driving the helicopter.**
3. **The person driving the scooter is on the right of the person driving the van.**
4. **The person driving the van is somewhere between the person driving the scooter and the person driving the subway.**

Let's denote:
- H for Helicopter
- S for Scooter
- T for Subway
- V for Van

From clue 1, we know that either T is in position 1 or position 4.

From clue 2, V must be to the right of H. This means if H is in position 1, V must be in position 2, 3, or 4. If H is in position 2, V must be in position 3 or 4. If H is in position 3, V must be in position 4. If H is in position 4, there is no position available for V (since V must be to the right of H).

From clue 3, S must be to the right of V.

From clue 4, V is between S and T. This means the order must be S-V-T or T-V-S.

Now, let's combine these clues:

- If T is in position 1, then from clue 2, V cannot be to the right of H because H would have to be in position 4, leaving no room for V. So, T cannot be in position 1.
- Therefore, T must be in position 4.
- From clue 2, since T is in position 4, V must be in position 3 or 2.
- From clue 3, S must be to the right of V. Since V can only be in position 3 or 2, S must be in position 4, but we already have T in position 4, so S must be in position 3.
- From clue 4, V is between S and T, which fits with S in position 3 and T in position 4.
- From clue 2, since V is in position 3 and S is in position 3, H must be in position 1 (the only remaining position to the left of V).

So, the positions are:
- Position 1: H (Helicopter)
- Position 2: (empty)
- Position 3: S (Scooter)
- Position 4: V (Van)
- Position 5: T (Subway)

However, we need to fit all the transports into the given slots. The only way to do this while satisfying all conditions is:

- Position 1: H (Helicopter)
- Position 2: (empty)
- Position 3: S (Scooter)
- Position 4: V (Van)
- Position 5: T (Subway)

But since we only have 4 positions and need to fill them, we need to rearrange based on the constraints:

- Position 1: H (Helicopter)
- Position 2: V (Van)
- Position 3: S (Scooter)
- Position 4: T (Subway)

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues:

1. T is in position 4.
2. V is to the right of H.
3. S is to the right of V.
4. V is between S and T.

So, the final solution table is:

```
|             |   1    |     2      |  3  |    4    |
| Transport   | Helicopter | Van | Scooter | Subway |

Lv7-1x4-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. **The analyst is somewhere between the fisherman and the chef.**
   - This means the sequence must be either Fisherman -> Analyst -> Chef or Chef -> Analyst -> Fisherman.

2. **The dancer is on the left of the analyst.**
   - This means the dancer cannot be to the right of the analyst.

3. **The chef is on the left of the dancer.**
   - This means the chef must come before the dancer in the sequence.

Let's combine these clues:

- From clue 1, we know the sequence must include ""Analyst"" between ""Fisherman"" and ""Chef"". So the possible sequences are:
  - Fisherman -> Analyst -> Chef
  - Chef -> Analyst -> Fisherman

- From clue 2, the dancer must be to the left of the analyst.
- From clue 3, the chef must be to the left of the dancer.

Given these constraints, the only sequence that fits all the clues is:
- Fisherman -> Chef -> Dancer -> Analyst

Now, let's place the jobs in the table:
