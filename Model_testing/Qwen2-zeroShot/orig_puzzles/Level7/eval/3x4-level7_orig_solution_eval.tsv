Lv7-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The Thai is the fan of disco.
2. **Clue 2:** The fan of classical is on the far right (position 4).
3. **Clue 3:** The Brazilian is in an odd position (positions 1 or 3).
4. **Clue 4:** The Italian is not the fan of classical.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is rugby is not the Thai.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the Brazilian.
7. **Clue 7:** The Brazilian is somewhere between the fan of disco and the Colombian.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who's sport is badminton is between the fan of country and the fan of disco.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is rugby is on the left or right of the fan of funk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- Thai -> Disco

#### Clue 2:
- Classical -> Position 4

#### Clue 3:
- Brazilian -> Odd position (1 or 3)

#### Clue 4:
- Italian -> Not Classical

#### Clue 5:
- Rugby -> Not Thai

#### Clue 6:
- Ice-Hockey -> Left or Right of Brazilian

#### Clue 7:
- Brazilian -> Between Disco and Colombian
- Since Thai is Disco, Brazilian must be in position 2 (since 1 and 3 are odd positions).

#### Clue 8:
- Badminton -> Between Country and Disco
- Since Disco is Thai, Badminton must be in position 3 (between 2 and 4).

#### Clue 9:
- Rugby -> Left or Right of Funk
- Since Brazilian is in position 2, and Badminton is in position 3, Funk must be in position 1 or 4.
- Since Thai is in position 4 and Rugby is not Thai, Rugby must be in position 1.
- Therefore, Funk must be in position 4.

### Final Placement:

- **Position 1:** Rugby
- **Position 2:** Brazilian
- **Position 3:** Badminton
- **Position 4:** Disco (Thai)

#### Remaining:
- Classical -> Position 4 (already assigned to Thai)
- Country -> Position 2 (Brazilian cannot have it as per clue 7)
- Ice-Hockey -> Position 1 (Rugby already has it)
- Sailing -> Position 3 (Badminton already has it)

Since Brazilian is in position 2, and it must be between Disco and Colombian, Colombian must be in position 3.

### Final Table:

Lv7-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person eating raspberry is on the far left or far right.
2. The person eating blueberry is in an odd position.
3. The person drinking sprite is not the person eating cauliflower.
4. The person drinking water is the person eating pepper.
5. The person eating blueberry is the Nigerian.
6. The person eating pepper is the Polish.
7. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the Mexican.
8. The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the Mexican.
9. The person drinking 7up is somewhere between the person eating raspberry and the person drinking sprite.
10. The Nigerian is on the left or right of the person eating pepper.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4:** The person drinking water is the person eating pepper. Therefore, the Polish person eats pepper.
2. **Clue 5:** The Nigerian eats blueberry.
3. **Clue 6:** The Polish person drinks water and eats pepper.
4. **Clue 1 & 8:** The person eating raspberry is on the far left or far right, and they are also on the left or right of the Mexican. This means the Mexican cannot be at the extreme ends (left or right) if the person eating raspberry is there. So, the person eating raspberry must be in positions 2 or 3, and the Mexican must be in one of the other positions.
5. **Clue 2:** The person eating blueberry is in an odd position, so the Nigerian (who eats blueberry) must be in position 1 or 3.
6. **Clue 7:** The person drinking sprite is on the right of the Mexican. If the Mexican is in position 2, then the sprite drinker must be in position 3 or 4. If the Mexican is in position 3, then the sprite drinker must be in position 4.
7. **Clue 3:** The person drinking sprite is not the person eating cauliflower.
8. **Clue 10:** The Nigerian is on the left or right of the person eating pepper. Since the Nigerian eats blueberry and the Polish eats pepper, the Nigerian must be next to the Polish.
9. **Clue 9:** The person drinking 7up is somewhere between the person eating raspberry and the person drinking sprite. Given that the sprite drinker is on the right of the Mexican, and the raspberry eater is either on the far left or right, we need to place the 7up drinker accordingly.

### Positioning:

- **Position 1:** Nigerian (blueberry)
- **Position 2:** Mexican (could be anything but not the sprite drinker)
- **Position 3:** Sprite drinker (since the sprite drinker is on the right of the Mexican, and the Mexican can't be in position 4)
- **Position 4:** 7up drinker (between the raspberry eater and the sprite drinker)

Given these constraints, let's fill in the table:

|               |       1       |      2      |     3     |   4    |

Lv7-3x4-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 3**: The person driving the bus is on the far right.
   - This means position 4 is the bus driver.

2. **Clue 1**: The person driving the bus is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.
   - Since the bus driver is in position 4, the boat driver must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

3. **Clue 7**: The person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the taxi.
   - This means the taxi driver must be in a position to the left of the bike driver.

4. **Clue 8**: The person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
   - This means camping is in position 1, 2, or 3, and board-games is in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1).

5. **Clue 9**: The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person driving the bike.
   - This means the taxi driver is in position 1, 2, or 3, and the bike driver is in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1).

6. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is fishing is in an even position (2 or 4).
   - Since the bus driver is in position 4, the person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 2.

7. **Clue 4**: The American is between the Russian and the person who's hobby is fishing.
   - Since the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 2, the American must be in position 3 (between the Russian and the person with the hobby of fishing).

8. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is fishing is not the person driving the taxi.
   - So, the person driving the taxi cannot be in position 2.

9. **Clue 6**: The person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere between the person who's hobby is camping and the Dutch.
   - Since the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 2, the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 1, and the Dutch must be in position 3.

Now let's summarize and fill in the positions:

- Position 1: Camping
- Position 2: Fishing
- Position 3: American
- Position 4: Bus

Next, we need to determine the nationalities and hobbies for the remaining positions:

- **Position 1 (Camping)**:
  - Nationality: Dutch (since American is in position 3)
  - Hobby: Can't be fishing (position 2) or board-games (must be in position 3 or 4)

- **Position 2 (Fishing)**:
  - Nationality: Russian (since American is in position 3)
  - Hobby: Fishing

- **Position 3 (American)**:
  - Nationality: Russian (since Dutch is in position 1)
  - Hobby: Can't be fishing (position 2) or camping (position 1)

- **Position 4 (Bus)**:
  - Nationality: American (since the American is in this position)
  - Hobby: Can't be fishing (position 2), camping (position 1), or writing (since only board-games and writing remain and board-games must be in position 3 or 4)

Thus, the remaining positions and hobbies are:
- Position 1: Camping (Dutch)
- Position 2: Fishing (Russian)
- Position 3: Board-games (American)
- Position 4: Bus (American)

The final solution table is:

Lv7-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The fan of jazz is on the far right (position 4).**
   - Jazz → Position 4

2. **The Indian is the person driving the motorbike.**
   - Indian → Motorbike

3. **The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.**
   - Since the motorbike is in position 2 (as per clue 2), the airplane must be in position 3.

4. **The fan of gospel is the person driving the motorbike.**
   - Gospel → Motorbike (Clue 4 contradicts clue 2, but we'll resolve it later).

5. **The Mexican is the fan of salsa.**
   - Salsa → Mexican

6. **The Argentine is the person driving the airplane.**
   - Argentine → Airplane

7. **The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of blues.**
   - Salsa (Mexican) can be in positions 1 or 4 (but 4 is taken by Jazz, so it must be in position 1).

8. **The person driving the ship is somewhere between the fan of gospel and the fan of jazz.**
   - Since jazz is in position 4, the ship must be in position 3 (airplane is already there, so it must be between gospel and jazz).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 1:
   - Jazz → Position 4

2. From Clue 2 and Clue 4 (contradiction):
   - Indian → Motorbike (Clue 2)
   - Gospel → Motorbike (Clue 4)

3. From Clue 3:
   - Airplane → Position 3 (right of motorbike)

4. From Clue 6:
   - Argentine → Airplane (Clue 6)

5. From Clue 5:
   - Salsa → Mexican

6. From Clue 7:
   - Salsa (Mexican) must be in position 1 (leftmost position).

7. From Clue 8:
   - Ship must be in position 2 (between gospel and jazz).

### Final Arrangement:

- **Position 1:** Salsa (Mexican)
- **Position 2:** Ship
- **Position 3:** Airplane (Argentine)
- **Position 4:** Jazz

Now, let's fill in the rest based on the nationalities and genres:

- **Position 1:** Salsa (Mexican)
  - Nationality: Mexican
  - Music Genre: Salsa

- **Position 2:** Ship
  - Nationality: Indian (since Indian drives the motorbike and motorbike is in position 2)
  - Music Genre: Gospel (since Indian is the driver and gospel is associated with the motorbike)

- **Position 3:** Airplane
  - Nationality: Argentine (since Argentine drives the airplane)
  - Music Genre: Blues (since Argentine is not associated with salsa, gospel, or jazz)

- **Position 4:** Jazz
  - Nationality: Nigerian (remaining nationality)
  - Music Genre: Jazz (given)

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |    3    |     4     |

Lv7-3x4-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking cola is not the fan of reggae.
2. **Clue 2**: The fan of country is somewhere between the owner of the cat and the fan of blues.
3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the horse is in position 4.
4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking cola is somewhere between the fan of country and the person drinking fanta.
5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking fanta is the owner of the rabbit.
6. **Clue 6**: The person drinking lemonade is on the far left or far right.
7. **Clue 7**: The owner of the mouse is the person drinking lemonade.
8. **Clue 8**: The fan of blues is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1**: Position the owner of the horse (Clue 3)
- Since the owner of the horse is in position 4, we can place ""horse"" in row 3, column 4.

```
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      |        |      |          | horse   |
| Music-Genre   |        |      |          |          |
| Pet           |        |      |          | cat     |
```

**Step 2**: Place the owner of the mouse (Clue 7)
- The owner of the mouse drinks lemonade and is on the far left or far right. Since position 4 is occupied by the horse, the owner of the mouse must be in position 1 or 2.

```
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | lemonade|      |          | horse   |
| Music-Genre   |        |      |          |          |
| Pet           | mouse  |      |          | cat     |
```

**Step 3**: Determine the positions of the fan of blues and the fan of country (Clues 2 and 8)
- The fan of blues is in an even position (Clue 8), so it can only be in position 2 or 4.
- The fan of country is between the owner of the cat and the fan of blues (Clue 2).

Since the owner of the cat is in position 3 and the fan of blues cannot be in position 4 (because the owner of the horse is there), the fan of blues must be in position 2 and the fan of country in position 3.

```
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | lemonade|      |          | horse   |
| Music-Genre   |        | blues |          |          |
| Pet           | mouse  |      | cat     | cat     |
```

**Step 4**: Place the fan of reggae (Clue 1)
- The person drinking cola is not the fan of reggae. Since the fan of country is in position 3, the person drinking cola cannot be in position 3.
- The person drinking cola is somewhere between the fan of country and the person drinking fanta (Clue 4). Therefore, the person drinking cola must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the person drinking lemonade (position 1) cannot drink cola (Clue 6), the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

```
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | lemonade| cola  |          | horse   |
| Music-Genre   |        | blues |          |          |
| Pet           | mouse  |      | cat     | cat     |
```

**Step 5**: Determine the remaining beverages and music-genre
- The person drinking fanta is the owner of the rabbit (Clue 5), and since the owner of the rabbit is in position 4, the person drinking fanta must be in position 3.

```
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | lemonade| cola  | fanta   | horse   |
| Music-Genre   |        | blues | reggae  |          |
| Pet           | mouse  |      | cat     | cat     |
```

- The only beverage left for position 1 is iced-tea.

Final solution:

```
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea| cola  | fanta   | horse   |
| Music-Genre   |        | blues | reggae  |          |
| Pet           | mouse  |      | cat     | cat     |

Lv7-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Egyptian is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks**
2. **Egyptian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess**
3. **Colombian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up**
4. **Person drinking lemonade is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks**
5. **Person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person drinking 7up**
6. **Person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking lemonade**
7. **Person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta**
8. **Person drinking lemonade is not the British**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Clue 5 & 6:** The person with the hobby of filmmaking drinks 7up, and the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.

So, we can place:
- Filmmaker -> 7up
- Lemonade -> 7up's left

This means:
- 7up (filmmaker) must be in position 4 (since it has to be on the right of lemonade).

Now, the positions for 7up and lemonade are fixed as:
- 7up (filmmaker) -> Position 4
- Lemonade -> Position 3

**Clue 4:** The person drinking lemonade is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
Since the filmmaker is in position 4 and the Egyptian has the hobby of magic tricks, the only possible position for the Egyptian is 1 or 2.

**Clue 2:** The Egyptian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess.
If the Egyptian is in position 1, then the person with chess must be in position 2 or 3. If the Egyptian is in position 2, then the person with chess must be in position 1 or 3. If the Egyptian is in position 3, then the person with chess must be in position 2.

Given that the person with chess cannot be in position 4 (as the Egyptian would be on the right), the only possible placement for the Egyptian is in position 1.

So:
- Egyptian -> Position 1 (magic tricks)
- Chess -> Position 2 or 3

**Clue 3:** The Colombian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up.
Since 7up is in position 4, the Colombian must be in position 3 or 4. But since 7up is in position 4, the Colombian must be in position 3.

So:
- Colombian -> Position 3

**Clue 7:** The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta.
Since the Colombian is in position 3, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the Egyptian is in position 1, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2.

So:
- Soy-milk -> Position 2

Finally, the only beverage left for position 1 is fanta.

So:
- Fanta -> Position 1

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |      4      |

| Nationality   |      Egyptian |   British |   Colombian |    Chinese   |

The final solution is:

Lv7-3x4-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the airplane**.
2. **The owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the doctor**.
3. **The owner of the dog is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the goat**.
4. **The doctor is somewhere to the right of the musician**.
5. **The person driving the train is in an even position** (i.e., 2 or 4).
6. **The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goldfish**.
7. **The musician is somewhere between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the airplane**.
8. **The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the train**.
9. **The librarian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Positioning the Train Driver:
- From clue 5, the person driving the train is in an even position. So, the train driver can be in either position 2 or 4.

#### Positioning the Motorbike Driver:
- From clue 8, the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the train.
- This means if the train driver is in position 2, the motorbike driver can be in position 1 or 3.
- If the train driver is in position 4, the motorbike driver can be in position 3 or 1.

#### Positioning the Airplane Driver:
- From clue 1, the motorbike driver must be to the left of the airplane driver.
- If the train driver is in position 2, the motorbike driver must be in position 1, making the airplane driver in position 3 or 4.
- If the train driver is in position 4, the motorbike driver must be in position 3, making the airplane driver in position 2 or 1.

#### Positioning the Goat Owner:
- From clue 2, the owner of the goat is to the right of the doctor.
- From clue 4, the doctor is to the right of the musician.
- Therefore, the doctor, musician, and goat owner cannot be in positions 3 or 4 because there would not be enough space for the goat owner to be to the right of the doctor.

#### Positioning the Dog Owner:
- From clue 3, the owner of the dog is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the goat.
- This implies that the dog owner must be in position 2, with the goldfish owner to the left and the goat owner to the right.

#### Positioning the Frog Owner:
- From clue 6, the owner of the frog is to the left of the owner of the goldfish.
- Since the dog owner is in position 2, the frog owner must be in position 1, and the goldfish owner must be in position 3.

#### Final Placement:
- The librarian must be to the left of the dog owner (clue 9), so the librarian must be in position 1.
- The musician must be to the left of the dog owner (clue 7), so the musician must be in position 1 (but we already placed the librarian here).

Let's place everything:
- Position 1: Librarian (dog)
- Position 2: Musician (goldfish)
- Position 3: Photographer (goat)
- Position 4: Doctor (frog)

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |     1     |    2     |     3     |      4       |
| Job         | Librarian | Musician | Photographer | Doctor       |
| Pet         | Dog       | Goldfish | Goat       | Frog         |
| Transport   | Airplane  | Motorbike| Quad-bike  | Train        |

Lv7-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the given conditions

1. **Lizard owner's hobby**: Dancing (Condition 1)
2. **Fish owner's position relative to Gardening hobby**: Fish is to the left of Gardening (Condition 2)
3. **Rat owner's position relative to Gardening hobby**: Rat is to the left of Gardening (Condition 3)
4. **Martial-arts movie watcher's position relative to Horror movie watcher**: Martial-arts is to the left of Horror (Condition 4)
5. **Board-games hobbyist's position**: First position (Condition 5)
6. **Musical movie watcher's position relative to Martial-arts movie watcher**: Musical is to the left of Martial-arts (Condition 6)
7. **Horror movie watcher's position relative to Martial-arts and Spy movie watchers**: Horror is between Martial-arts and Spy (Condition 7)
8. **Drawing hobbyist's position relative to Hedgehog owner**: Drawing is to the left of Hedgehog (Condition 8)
9. **Lizard owner's position relative to Horror movie watcher**: Lizard is to the left of Horror (Condition 9)
10. **Dancing hobbyist's position relative to Drawing hobbyist**: Dancing is to the left of Drawing (Condition 10)

### Step 2: Deduce positions and hobbies

From Condition 5:
- The first position must be Board-games.

From Condition 10:
- Dancing must be to the left of Drawing.

From Conditions 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10:
- The Lizard owner (Dancing) must be in the first or second position.
- Since Dancing must be to the left of Drawing, and Lizard is the Dancing owner, the only possible position for Lizard is the first position.
- This means Drawing must be in the third or fourth position.

From Conditions 4, 6, and 7:
- Horror is between Martial-arts and Spy.
- Musical is to the left of Martial-arts.

From Conditions 2, 3, and 9:
- Fish is to the left of Gardening.
- Rat is to the left of Gardening.
- Lizard (Dancing) is to the left of Horror.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements:

1. **First position**: Lizard (Dancing)
2. **Second position**: Fish (must be to the left of Gardening, so it cannot be Gardening)
3. **Third position**: Drawing
4. **Fourth position**: Hedgehog (since Drawing is to the left of Hedgehog)

Now, let's place the movies and pets:

- **First position**: Lizard (Dancing)
- **Second position**: Fish (Horror)
- **Third position**: Drawing (Spy)
- **Fourth position**: Hedgehog (Martial-arts)

This satisfies all the conditions.

Lv7-3x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly in the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating broccoli.
3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the dog is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
4. **Clue 4:** The person watching superhero movies is somewhere between the person watching animation movies and the person eating asparagus.
5. **Clue 5:** The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating blueberry.
6. **Clue 6:** The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goldfish.
7. **Clue 7:** The owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies.
8. **Clue 8:** The owner of the dog is on the left of the person watching crime movies.
9. **Clue 9:** The owner of the goat is on the left of the person eating papaya.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Placing Animation and Superhero Movies
From Clue 1, we know:
- Animation (A) < Superhero (S)

From Clue 4, we know:
- Asparagus (A) < Superhero (S)
- Animation (A) < Asparagus (A) < Superhero (S)

From Clue 4 and Clue 7, we can infer:
- Animation (A) < Goat (G) < Asparagus (A) < Superhero (S)

So far, we have:
```
| Movie-Genre |     A     |     G     |     A     |     S     |
```

#### Step 2: Placing Crime Movies
From Clue 2, we know:
- Broccoli (B) < Crime (C)

Since Animation (A) is already placed on the left of Superhero (S), and Crime (C) must be to the right of Broccoli (B), and considering the positions from previous steps, we can place Crime (C) as follows:
- Animation (A) < Goat (G) < Asparagus (A) < Superhero (S) < Crime (C)

So far, we have:
```
| Movie-Genre |     A     |     G     |     A     |     S     |     C     |
```

#### Step 3: Placing Chinchilla and Goldfish
From Clue 3, we know:
- Chinchilla (Ch) < Goldfish (Gf)

From Clue 6, we know:
- Chinchilla (Ch) < Goldfish (Gf)

Since Chinchilla (Ch) must be to the left of Goldfish (Gf), and considering the positions from previous steps, we can place them as follows:
- Chinchilla (Ch) < Goldfish (Gf)

So far, we have:
```
| Movie-Genre |     A     |     G     |     A     |     S     |     C     |
| Pet         |     Ch    |           |           |           |     Gf    |
```

#### Step 4: Placing Dog and Goat
From Clue 8, we know:
- Dog (D) < Crime (C)

Since Crime (C) is the last position, and Dog (D) must be to the left of Crime (C), we can place Dog (D) as follows:
- Dog (D) < Chinchilla (Ch)

From Clue 7, we know:
- Goat (G) > Animation (A)

Since Goat (G) is after Animation (A), and considering the positions from previous steps, we can place Goat (G) as follows:
- Goat (G) > Animation (A)

So far, we have:
```
| Movie-Genre |     A     |     G     |     A     |     S     |     C     |
| Pet         |     D     |     Ch    |           |           |     Gf    |
```

#### Step 5: Placing Remaining Pets and Foods
From Clue 9, we know:
- Goat (G) < Papaya (P)

Since Goat (G) is already placed, and Papaya (P) must be to the right of Goat (G), we can place Papaya (P) as follows:
- Goat (G) < Papaya (P)

The remaining pet, Dog (D), must be with the remaining food, which is Blueberry (B).

So, we have:
```
| Movie-Genre |     A     |     G     |     A     |     S     |     C     |
| Pet         |     D     |     Ch    |           |           |     Gf    |
| Food        |     B     |     P     |     Asp   |     Bb    |           |
```

### Final Solution Table:
