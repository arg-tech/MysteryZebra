Lv7-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 8:** The project-manager is on the far left.
   - So, the first column is for the project-manager.

2. **Clue 4:** The Chinese is in the middle.
   - Therefore, the second column is for the Chinese.

3. **Clue 1:** The person eating onion is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the project-manager is already on the far left, the person eating onion must be on the far right (column 3).

4. **Clue 2:** The person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the manager.
   - The manager cannot be in the first or third column (since the project-manager is there and the person eating onion is there), so the manager must be in the second column (Chinese).

5. **Clue 6:** The person eating cabbage is somewhere between the fan of dubstep and the American.
   - Since the manager is in the second column (Chinese), the only remaining columns for the fan of dubstep and the American are the first and third columns.
   - The person eating cabbage cannot be in the first column (project-manager) or the third column (onion-eater), so it must be in the second column (Chinese). This means the fan of dubstep and the American must be in the first and third columns respectively.

6. **Clue 7:** The fan of folk is the American.
   - So, the American is in the third column and the fan of folk is in the third column.

7. **Clue 3 & 5:** The person whose hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the fan of folk, and the person whose hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the fan of folk.
   - Since the fan of folk is in the third column, the person with the hobby of dancing and the person with the hobby of fishing must be in the first or second column.
   - Given that the person eating cabbage is in the second column (Chinese) and the fan of folk is in the third column (American), the person with the hobby of dancing and the person with the hobby of fishing must be in the first column.

8. **Clue 9:** The journalist is on the left or right of the manager.
   - Since the manager is in the second column (Chinese), the journalist can be in the first or third column. However, the first column is taken by the fan of dubstep, so the journalist must be in the third column (American).

9. **Clue 10:** The person eating onion is on the left of the person whose hobby is fishing.
   - The person eating onion is in the third column, so the person whose hobby is fishing must be in the first column.

Now, let's summarize the findings:

- Project-manager (first column)
- Chinese (second column)
- American (third column)

- Onion-eater (third column)
- Cabbage-eater (second column - Chinese)
- Fan of dubstep (first column)
- Fan of folk (third column - American)
- Dancing (first column)
- Fishing (first column)

We need to fill in the remaining details (food, job, music genre, nationality):

- The remaining job for the Chinese is the manager.
- The remaining job for the American is the journalist.
- The remaining job for the person in the first column is the project-manager.

- The remaining music genre for the Chinese is electronic.
- The remaining music genre for the American is folk.
- The remaining music genre for the person in the first column is dubstep.

- The remaining food for the Chinese is onion.
- The remaining food for the American is spinach.
- The remaining food for the person in the first column is cabbage.

So, the final table looks like this:

Lv7-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Analyze Clue 6
- The person drinking tea watches thriller movies.
- This means the person in row 3 (Movie-Genre) and column 3 (Beverage) is ""thriller"" and ""tea"".

|               |      1      |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage      |             |          | tea      |
| Job           |             |          |          |
| Movie-Genre   |             |          | thriller |
| Nationality   |             |          |          |
| Pet           |             |          |          |

### Step 2: Analyze Clue 5
- The owner of the mouse is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the person watching documentary movies.
- Since the person drinking tea is in position 3 (Beverage), the person watching documentary movies must be either in position 1 or 2 (Beverage).

### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The owner of the mouse is also between the person drinking juice and the person drinking tea.
- Since the person drinking tea is in position 3 (Beverage), the person drinking juice must be in position 1 or 2 (Beverage).

### Step 4: Analyze Clue 1
- The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
- Since the person drinking tea is in position 3 (Beverage), the person watching horror movies must be in position 1 or 2 (Beverage).

### Step 5: Analyze Clue 2
- The American is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice.
- If the person drinking juice is in position 1 (Beverage), the American must be in position 2 or 3 (Nationality).
- If the person drinking juice is in position 2 (Beverage), the American must be in position 3 (Nationality).

### Step 6: Analyze Clue 7
- The librarian is on the left of the Japanese.
- This means the librarian must be in position 1 (Nationality) and the Japanese in position 2 (Nationality) or 3 (Nationality).

### Step 7: Analyze Clue 4
- The analyst is between the person drinking juice and the engineer.
- This means the analyst cannot be in position 1 or 3 (Beverage) if the person drinking juice is in position 1 or 2 (Beverage).

### Step 8: Analyze Clue 8
- The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda.
- If the person drinking mirinda is in position 1 (Beverage), the owner of the dog must be in position 2 or 3 (Pet).
- If the person drinking mirinda is in position 2 (Beverage), the owner of the dog must be in position 3 (Pet).

### Step 9: Analyze Clue 9
- The analyst is on the left or right of the owner of the dog.
- This means the analyst and the owner of the dog cannot both be in position 2 (Beverage).

### Putting it all together:
From clue 6, we know:
- Position 3 (Beverage) = Tea
- Position 3 (Movie-Genre) = Thriller

From clue 3 and 5:
- Mouse owner is between juice and tea, so juice must be in position 1 or 2.
- Horror movies must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 2 and 7:
- American must be in position 2 or 3 (Nationality).
- Librarian must be in position 1 (Nationality).

From clue 4:
- Analyst is between the person drinking juice and the engineer.

From clue 8 and 9:
- Dog owner must be to the right of mirinda.
- Analyst is on the left or right of the dog owner.

After analyzing all clues, we can deduce:

|               |      1      |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda    | Juice    | Tea      |

Lv7-5x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step by step.

Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's sport is handball is the fan of soul.
2. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in an even position (position 2).
3. The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing.
4. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of disco.
5. The person drinking tea is on the right of the owner of the turtle.
6. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
7. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the fan of soul (this is redundant with clue 1).
8. The owner of the turtle is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the owner of the lizard.

Now, let's start filling in the table based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- Skydiving is in position 2.

|       | 1     | 2     | 3     |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Hobby |      | skydiving |       |
| ...   |       |       |       |

#### Clue 7:
- The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the fan of soul.
- Since the person who's sport is handball is the fan of soul, the person who's sport is skiing can be either in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 6:
- The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
- Since skydiving is in position 2, the person who's sport is skiing cannot be in position 2. Therefore, it must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 1:
- The person who's sport is handball is the fan of soul.
- Since the person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the fan of soul, and the fan of soul is in position 1 or 3, the person who's sport is skiing must be in position 3 if the fan of soul is in position 1, or in position 1 if the fan of soul is in position 3.

#### Clue 3:
- The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing.
- If the person who's sport is skiing is in position 1, then the person who's sport is basketball must be in position 3, which conflicts with the fan of soul being in position 1. Therefore, the person who's sport is skiing must be in position 3, and the person who's sport is basketball must be in position 2.

#### Clue 4:
- The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of disco.
- The fan of soul is in position 1, so the fan of disco cannot be in position 1.

#### Clue 5:
- The person drinking tea is on the right of the owner of the turtle.
- The person drinking tea cannot be in position 1 because the fan of soul is there.

#### Clue 8:
- The owner of the turtle is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the owner of the lizard.
- This means the owner of the turtle is in position 2, and the person drinking 7up and the owner of the lizard must be in positions 1 and 3.

### Final Table:

|       | 1     | 2     | 3     |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Hobby |      | skydiving |       |
| Bev   | 7up   |       | tea   |
| HG    | metal | soul  | disco |
| Pet   | lizard | turtle | ferret |
| Sp    | skiing | basketball | handball |

### Verification:

1. The person who's sport is handball is the fan of soul (soul is in position 2, handball is in position 3).
2. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2.
3. The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing (basketball is in position 2, skiing is in position 3).
4. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of disco (turtle is in position 2, disco is in position 3).
5. The person drinking tea is on the right of the owner of the turtle (tea is in position 3, turtle is in position 2).
6. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles (skying is in position 3, puzzles is in position 1).
7. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the fan of soul (skying is in position 3, soul is in position 2).
8. The owner of the turtle is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the owner of the lizard (turtle is in position 2, 7up is in position 1, and lizard is in position 3).

Lv7-5x3-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person driving the van is the person eating raspberry.
   - This gives us a direct link between ""van"" and ""raspberry"".

2. **Clue 8**: The owner of the horse is on the far left.
   - This places ""horse"" in position 1.

3. **Clue 5**: The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway.
   - This means ""bus"" comes before ""subway"" in the sequence.

4. **Clue 6**: The person driving the subway is in an odd position.
   - Since there are three positions (1, 2, 3), the only odd position for ""subway"" is position 1 or 3.
   - But from Clue 5, ""subway"" must be to the right of ""bus"", so it can't be in position 1 (because ""bus"" would have to be in position 2, which would make ""subway"" in position 3, an even position).
   - Therefore, ""subway"" must be in position 3.

5. **Clue 5** again: With ""subway"" in position 3, ""bus"" must be in position 1.

6. **Clue 6** confirms: ""subway"" is in position 3, which is an odd position.

7. **Clue 7** again: The person driving the van (position 3) is the person eating raspberry.
   - So, the person eating raspberry is in position 3, and the beverage they drink is ""van"".

8. **Clue 2**: The person eating raspberry is somewhere to the left of the person eating raspberry.
   - Since the person eating raspberry is in position 3, the person eating apple must be in position 1 or 2.
   - The person eating pear must be in position 2 because the person eating raspberry (in position 3) is to their right.

9. **Clue 1**: The person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person eating raspberry.
   - This is already satisfied by placing pear in position 2 and raspberry in position 3.

10. **Clue 3**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking milk.
    - This means milk is in position 1 or 2, and hot-chocolate is in position 2 or 3.
    - Since raspberry is in position 3, milk must be in position 1 and hot-chocolate in position 2.

11. **Clue 4**: The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
    - This means the owner of the lizard is in position 3 (since hot-chocolate is in position 2).

12. **Clue 9**: The owner of the horse is on the far left.
    - This places ""horse"" in position 1.

13. **Clue 10**: The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person driving the subway.
    - Since ""subway"" is in position 3, and ""soccer"" must be between ""skateboarding"" and ""subway"", ""skateboarding"" must be in position 1 and ""soccer"" in position 2.
    - This fits with the previous placements.

14. **Clue 11**: The person who's sport is rugby is in position 2.
    - This fits with the previous placement since ""soccer"" is in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the table based on these deductions:

```
|             |       1       |       2       |    3     |

7. The person watching action movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Mirinda.
8. The engineer is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Sprite.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The engineer is the French.
- Engineer = French

#### Clue 4: The person drinking Mirinda is the Mechanic.
- Mechanic = Drinks Mirinda

#### Clue 2: The Mexican is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
- Mexican is on the left of Horror

#### Clue 6: The owner of the mouse is the Mexican.
- Mexican = Owns Mouse

#### Clue 5: The person drinking Fanta is somewhere to the right of the Mexican.
- Mexican is to the left of Fanta

#### Clue 3: The person watching action movies is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the person drinking Fanta.
- Action is between Frog and Fanta

#### Clue 7: The person watching action movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Mirinda.
- Action is to the right of Mirinda

#### Clue 8: The engineer is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Sprite.
- Engineer is to the right of Sprite

Let's organize these clues into a table and fill in the information:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |
|---------------|------------|---------|----------|
| Beverage      |            |         |          |
| Job           |            |         |          |
| Movie-Genre   |            |         |          |
| Nationality   |            |         |          |
| Pet           |            |         |          |

From Clue 4:
- Mechanic = Drinks Mirinda

From Clue 1:
- Engineer = French

From Clue 6:
- Mexican = Owns Mouse

From Clue 5:
- Mexican is to the left of Fanta

From Clue 3:
- Action is between Frog and Fanta

From Clue 7:
- Action is to the right of Mirinda

From Clue 8:
- Engineer is to the right of Sprite

Now let's place these pieces of information into the table:

1. Since Mechanic = Drinks Mirinda, Mechanic cannot be in position 1 or 2.
2. Since Mexican = Owns Mouse, Mexican cannot be in position 3.
3. Since Mexican is to the left of Fanta, Fanta cannot be in position 1 or 2.
4. Since Action is between Frog and Fanta, and Action is to the right of Mirinda, we can deduce:
   - Mirinda is in position 1 (since it must be to the left of Action).
   - Action is in position 3 (since it is to the right of Mirinda and between Frog and Fanta).
   - Therefore, Frog must be in position 2.
   - Fanta must be in position 3 (since it is to the right of Action).

So we have:
- Position 1: Drinks Mirinda, Mechanic
- Position 2: Owns Frog
- Position 3: Watches Action, Drinks Fanta

Since the Engineer is to the right of Sprite, and the Engineer is French, we can deduce:
- Position 1: Drinks Mirinda, Mechanic
- Position 2: Owns Frog, Spanish
- Position 3: Watches Action, Drinks Fanta, French (Engineer)

Thus, the remaining positions and values are:
- Position 1: Drinks Mirinda, Mechanic, Spanish
- Position 2: Owns Frog, Spanish
- Position 3: Watches Action, Drinks Fanta, French (Engineer)

Now we can fill in the table with the remaining values:
- Position 1: Drinks Sprite, Watches Horror, Mexican
- Position 2: Owns Horse, Watches Scientific, Spanish
- Position 3: Watches Action, Drinks Fanta, French (Engineer)

Final solution table:

```
|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |
|---------------|------------|---------|----------|
| Beverage      | Sprite     |         | Fanta    |
| Job           | Mechanic   |         | Engineer |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror     |         | Action   |
| Nationality   | Spanish    |         | French   |

Lv7-5x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the fan of indie.**
   - This implies that rock-climbing and indie cannot be in the middle position.

2. **The person eating onion is on the far right.**
   - Therefore, onion is in position 3 for food.

3. **The person eating apricot is not the person driving the jet-ski.**
   - This means apricot and jet-ski are not in the same row.

4. **The person drinking juice is on the right of the person eating apricot.**
   - This means juice is in position 3 for beverage if apricot is in position 1 or 2 for food.

5. **The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere between the person whose hobby is drawing and the person drinking juice.**
   - This places soy-milk in the middle (position 2) if drawing and juice are on either side.

6. **The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the car.**
   - Rock-climbing can be in position 1 or 3 for hobby, and the car can be in position 1 or 3 for transport.

7. **The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the fan of country.**
   - This means jet-ski is in position 1 or 2 for transport, and country is in position 2 or 3 for music-genre.

### Placing the Information:

Let's start by placing the known positions:

1. **Food:**
   - Position 3: Onion (Clue 2)
   - Position 1 or 2: Apricot (since it must be before juice in the beverage order)

2. **Beverage:**
   - Position 3: Juice (Clue 4, since apricot is before juice)
   - Position 1 or 2: Soy-milk (Clue 5, since it's between drawing and juice)

3. **Hobby:**
   - Position 1 or 3: Rock-climbing (Clue 1, since it's on the left of indie)
   - Position 1 or 3: Drawing (since soy-milk is between them and juice is after soy-milk)

4. **Transport:**
   - Position 1 or 2: Jet-ski (Clue 7, since it's on the left of country)
   - Position 2 or 3: Car (since jet-ski is on the left of country, car can be in position 2 or 3)

5. **Music-Genre:**
   - Position 2 or 3: Country (Clue 7, since jet-ski is on the left of country)

Now let's fill in the table with the logical placements:

```

Lv7-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person whose hobby is fishing is on the left of the fan of electronic.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating cucumber is not the person watching zombie movies.
3. **Clue 3**: The person eating grapes is somewhere to the left of the Brazilian.
4. **Clue 4**: The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person watching animation movies.
5. **Clue 5**: The Japanese is not the person watching animation movies.
6. **Clue 6**: The person eating watermelon is somewhere between the person watching zombie movies and the fan of jazz.
7. **Clue 7**: The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the right of the Indian.
8. **Clue 8**: The fan of electronic is the person whose hobby is puzzles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Hobbies and Preferences:
- From Clue 8, we know the person whose hobby is puzzles is the fan of electronic.
- From Clue 4, the person whose hobby is puzzles (electronic) is on the left of the person watching animation movies.
- From Clue 7, the person whose hobby is puzzles (electronic) is on the right of the Indian. This means the Indian cannot be in the middle or rightmost position.

#### Step 2: Determine the Positions for Hobbies and Preferences:
- Since the person with puzzles is on the right of the Indian, the Indian must be in the leftmost or middle position.
- The person with puzzles (electronic) must be in the rightmost or middle position if the Indian is in the leftmost position, or in the rightmost position if the Indian is in the middle.

#### Step 3: Use Clue 1:
- The person whose hobby is fishing is on the left of the fan of electronic (puzzles). If the person with puzzles is in the rightmost position, then the person with fishing must be in the leftmost position. This fits with the Indian being in the middle.

So, we have:
- Left: Fishing
- Middle: Indian
- Right: Puzzles (Electronic)

#### Step 4: Use Clue 4:
- The person with puzzles (electronic) is on the left of the person watching animation movies. This means the person watching animation movies must be in the rightmost position (since the person with puzzles is in the middle).

So, we have:
- Left: Fishing
- Middle: Indian
- Right: Animation (Electronic)

#### Step 5: Use Clue 7:
- The person with puzzles (electronic) is on the right of the Indian. This confirms our previous placement.

#### Step 6: Use Clue 3:
- The person eating grapes is somewhere to the left of the Brazilian. Since the Indian is in the middle, the Brazilian must be in the rightmost position. The person eating grapes must be in the leftmost or middle position.

Since the leftmost position is occupied by the person with fishing, the person eating grapes must be in the middle position.

So, we have:
- Left: Fishing (Grapes)
- Middle: Indian (Grapes)
- Right: Animation (Electronic)

#### Step 7: Use Clue 6:
- The person eating watermelon is somewhere between the person watching zombie movies and the fan of jazz. The fan of jazz is the person with puzzles (electronic), which is in the rightmost position. The person watching zombie movies must be in the leftmost position.

So, the person eating watermelon must be in the middle position, but we already have the Indian there. Therefore, the person eating watermelon must be the person with fishing, and the person with fishing is the one watching zombie movies.

So, we have:
- Left: Fishing (Watermelon, Zombie)
- Middle: Indian (Grapes)
- Right: Animation (Electronic)

#### Step 8: Use Clue 2:
- The person eating cucumber is not the person watching zombie movies. Therefore, the person eating cucumber must be the person with puzzles (electronic).

So, we have:
- Left: Fishing (Watermelon)
- Middle: Indian (Grapes)
- Right: Animation (Electronic)

Finally, we assign the remaining foods and genres:
- The person eating grapes is the person with puzzles (Electronic).
- The person eating cucumber is the person with fishing (Zombie).

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
3. **Clue 3:** The fan of disco is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
5. **Clue 5:** This clue seems redundant with Clue 4.
6. **Clue 6:** The Chinese is on the right of the person eating pepper.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere between the fan of d&b and the person eating watermelon.
8. **Clue 8:** The fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the Nigerian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 8
From Clue 4 and Clue 8, we know:
- Lemonade (L) is to the right of 7up (U).
- Pop (P) is to the left of Lemonade (L).

This gives us the sequence for these three items:
\[ U - L - P \]

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
From Clue 1, the person eating pepper (Pe) is next to the person eating kiwi (K):
\[ Pe - K \text{ or } K - Pe \]

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 6
From Clue 6, the Chinese (Ch) is on the right of the person eating pepper:
\[ Pe - Ch \text{ or } K - Ch \text{ (if Pe - K)} \]

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 3
From Clue 3, the fan of disco (D) is next to the person eating kiwi:
\[ D - K \text{ or } K - D \]

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 2
From Clue 2, the person who's sport is basketball (B) is to the left of the person drinking mirinda (M):
\[ B - M \]

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 7
From Clue 7, the person who's sport is basketball is between the fan of d&b (Db) and the person eating watermelon (W):
\[ Db - B - W \]

#### Step 7: Analyze Clue 9
From Clue 9, the person who's sport is badminton (Ba) is on the right of the Nigerian (N):
\[ N - Ba \]

### Combining All Information:
Now, let's combine all the information to find the final arrangement:

1. From Clue 4 and Clue 8, we have \( U - L - P \).
2. From Clue 1, we have \( Pe - K \) or \( K - Pe \).
3. From Clue 6, we have \( Pe - Ch \) or \( K - Ch \).
4. From Clue 3, we have \( D - K \) or \( K - D \).
5. From Clue 2, we have \( B - M \).
6. From Clue 7, we have \( Db - B - W \).
7. From Clue 9, we have \( N - Ba \).

Given the constraints, let's assume:
- Kiwi (K) is eaten by the person on the far left.
- Pepper (Pe) is eaten by the person next to Kiwi.
- Disco (D) is the fan of the person eating Kiwi.
- Basketball (B) is the sport of the person drinking Mirinda.
- Badminton (Ba) is the sport of the person on the far right.
- Chinese (Ch) is on the right of the person eating Pepper.

This gives us:
- Kiwi (K) - Pepper (Pe) - Chinese (Ch)
- Disco (D) is the fan of Kiwi (K)

For the sports and beverages:
- Basketball (B) is between d&b (Db) and Watermelon (W).
- Badminton (Ba) is on the right of Nigerian (N).
- Lemonade (L) is to the right of 7up (U).

Final arrangement:
- Kiwi (K) - Pepper (Pe) - Chinese (Ch)
- Disco (D) - Kiwi (K)
- 7up (U) - Lemonade (L) - Watermelon (W)
- Basketball (B) - d&b (Db) - Watermelon (W)
- Badminton (Ba) - Nigerian (N)

```
|               |      1       |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | 7up          | Lemonade   | Watermelon|
| Food          | Kiwi         | Pepper     | Chinese   |
| Music-Genre   | Disco        | Kiwi       | Chinese   |

Lv7-5x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the polish.**
2. **The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.**
3. **The project-manager is somewhere between the person who's sport is surfing and the australian.**
4. **The photographer is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.**
5. **The turkish is in an even position.**
6. **The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies.** (This is redundant with clue 4)
7. **The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the polish.** (This is redundant with clue 1)
8. **The person who's sport is water-polo is between the person watching scientific movies and the person who's hobby is sudoku.**

### Deductions:
- From clues 1 and 7, we know that the person with the hobby of woodworking is in the third position and the Polish person is in the first position.
- From clue 5, the Turkish person must be in the second or fourth position (even positions).
- From clue 3, the Project-Manager is between the person who surfs and the Australian. This means the Project-Manager cannot be in the first or third position.
- From clue 2, the person who surfs is to the left of the person who has the hobby of drawing.
- From clue 4, the Photographer is to the right of the person who watches superhero movies.
- From clue 8, the person who does water-polo is between the person who watches scientific movies and the person who has the hobby of sudoku.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Positioning Polish and Woodworking:**
   - Polish person is in position 1.
   - Woodworking is in position 3.

2. **Turkish Position:**
   - The Turkish person is in an even position (2 or 4).

3. **Surfing Position:**
   - Surfing is to the left of Drawing.
   - Since Polish is in 1 and Woodworking is in 3, Surfing can only be in position 2 (since it needs to be to the left of Drawing and cannot be in 1 or 3).

4. **Project-Manager Position:**
   - Project-Manager is between Surfing and Australian.
   - Surfing is in 2, so Project-Manager must be in 3 (but Woodworking is already there), or 4.
   - Therefore, Project-Manager is in position 4.
   - This makes the Australian in position 2 (since Surfing is in 2 and Project-Manager is in 4).

5. **Sport Water-Polo:**
   - Water-Polo is between Scientific and Sudoku.
   - Since Surfing is in 2, Water-Polo must be in 3 (Woodworking) or 4 (Project-Manager). But Woodworking is in 3.
   - Therefore, Water-Polo is in 4 (Project-Manager), Scientific is in 2 (Surfing), and Sudoku is in 1 (Polish).

6. **Hobby and Job:**
   - The Photographer is to the right of the person who watches superhero movies.
   - Superhero movies are watched by the Australian (position 1).
   - Therefore, the Photographer is in position 3 (Woodworking).

### Final Table:
```
|               |    1    |        2        |      3       |
| Hobby         |  Sudoku |     Superhero   | Woodworking  |
| Job           |  Doctor |  Photographer   | Project-Manager|
| Movie-Genre   |  Scientific|  Satire  |  Superhero   |
| Nationality   |  Polish |   Australian   |   Turkish    |
| Sport         |  Surfing|   Water-Polo   | Climbing     |
```
