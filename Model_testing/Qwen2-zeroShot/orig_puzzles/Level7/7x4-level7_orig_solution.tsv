### Step 2: Use logical deductions to fill in the table.

Let's start with what we know for sure:

1. **Job**: The Japanese is the coach (Clue 1).
2. **Transport**: The pilot drives the boat (Clue 4), and the videographer drives the car (Clue 3). The person driving the subway is between the person driving the car and the person driving the tram (Clue 16).

From Clue 16, we can infer:
- Car (videographer) -> Subway -> Tram

Since the videographer is on the left side of the pilot (Clue 10):
- Videographer -> Pilot -> Boat (pilot)

So, the order for transport is:
1. Videographer -> Car
2. Submarine
3. Tram
4. Pilot -> Boat

Now let's place the sports:
- The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person eating raspberry (Clue 6).
- The owner of the chinchilla is not the person eating raspberry (Clue 7).
- The person who's sport is parkour is not the Japanese (Clue 17).

Since the Japanese is the coach (Clue 1), and the owner of the chinchilla is not the person eating raspberry, the person eating raspberry must be the person whose sport is not parkour, not chinchilla, and not raspberry. This leaves us with hamster or chinchilla. Let's assume the person eating raspberry is the one whose sport is not parkour and not chinchilla.

Given the constraints, we can deduce:
- The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person eating raspberry.
- The person whose sport is parkour is not the Japanese.
- The person whose sport is parkour must be the person on the right side.

Let's place the sports:
1. Baseball
2. Handball
3. Parkour
4. Cycling

Since the person driving the tram is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour (Clue 13):
- Tram -> Parkour

Since the person driving the tram is between the person driving the car and the person driving the tram (Clue 16):
- Car -> Tram -> Parkour

Since the person driving the tram is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour:
- Car -> Tram -> Parkour

Now, let's place the pets:
- The owner of the cat is on the far right (Clue 5).
- The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person eating raspberry (Clue 6).
- The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the librarian (Clue 8).

Since the person eating pineapple is not the person driving the car (Clue 1):
- The person eating pineapple cannot be the videographer.

Since the person driving the subway is not the person eating peas (Clue 2):
- The person driving the subway cannot be the person eating peas.

Now, let's place the movie genres:
- The Turkish is on the right of the person watching zombie movies (Clue 1).
- The person watching mystery movies is the owner of the cat (Clue 2).
- The Japanese is on the right of the person watching horror movies (Clue 15).

Since the Turkish is on the right of the person watching zombie movies:
- Turkish -> Zombie Movies

Since the person watching mystery movies is the owner of the cat:
- Mystery Movies -> Cat

Since the Japanese is on the right of the person watching horror movies:
- Japanese -> Horror Movies

Finally, let's place the nationalities:
- The Turkish is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is handball (Clue 1).
- The Polish is on the right of the person watching horror movies (Clue 2).

Since the Turkish is on the left of the person who's sport is handball:
- Turkish -> Handball

Since the Polish is on the right of the person watching horror movies:
- Polish -> Horror Movies
