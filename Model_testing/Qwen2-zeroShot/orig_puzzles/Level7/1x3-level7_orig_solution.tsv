Lv7-1x3-1	"Sure, let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step.

We have three positions (1, 2, 3) and three different music genres: house, jazz, and metal. The clues provided are:

1. The fan of metal is somewhere to the right of the fan of house.
2. The fan of metal is somewhere between the fan of house and the fan of jazz.

Let's analyze these clues:

### Clue 1: The fan of metal is somewhere to the right of the fan of house.
This means that if house is in position 1, metal must be in position 2 or 3. If house is in position 2, metal must be in position 3. House cannot be in position 3 because then there would be no room for metal to the right.

### Clue 2: The fan of metal is somewhere between the fan of house and the fan of jazz.
This means that house and jazz must be on either side of metal, with metal in the middle.

Combining both clues, we can deduce the following:

- If house is in position 1, metal must be in position 2 (since it needs to be to the right of house), and jazz must be in position 3.
- If house is in position 2, metal must be in position 3, and jazz must be in position 1.

So, the only possible configurations are:
1. House in position 1, Metal in position 2, Jazz in position 3.
2. Jazz in position 1, House in position 2, Metal in position 3.

However, the second configuration does not satisfy Clue 1 because the fan of metal is not to the right of the fan of house. Therefore, the only valid configuration is:

- House in position 1
- Metal in position 2
- Jazz in position 3

Now, let's fill this into the table:

```
|               |   1   |   2   |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | HOUSE | METAL | JAZZ |
```

### Final Solution Table

```
|               |   1   |   2   |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | HOUSE | METAL | JAZZ |

Lv7-1x3-2	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

Given:
1. The person driving the trike is somewhere between the person driving the train and the person driving the boat.
2. The person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.

Let's denote:
- Boat as B
- Train as T
- Trike as Tr

From the second clue, we know that the order must be B _ T or T _ B. However, the first clue states that the trike driver is between the train and the boat. Therefore, the only possible order is:

B _ Tr _ T

This means the sequence must be:

Boat (B), some other mode of transport (let's call it X for now), trike (Tr), and then train (T).

Since there are only three modes of transport and we have already used boat, trike, and train, the only possible arrangement is:

Boat (B) -> Trike (Tr) -> Train (T)

So, the final arrangement is:

Boat (B) -> Trike (Tr) -> Train (T)

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|             |  1   |   2   |   3   |
| Transport   | Boat | Trike | Train |
```

Final solution table:

```

### Clue Analysis:
1. **""the person watching animation movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching zombie movies""**
   - This means the order must be either: Romance → Animation → Zombie or Zombie → Animation → Romance.

2. **""the person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies""**
   - This means that Romance cannot be to the right of Animation. Therefore, the only possible order is: Romance → Animation → Zombie.

### Final Order:
Based on the two clues, the only valid order is:
- **Romance (1)**
- **Animation (2)**
- **Zombie (3)**

### Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |     2     |   3    |

Given the conditions:
1. The person eating nectarine is somewhere between the person eating peas and the person eating asparagus.
2. The person eating peas is on the far right.

We can deduce the positions of the foods based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Condition 2**: The person eating peas is on the far right. This means that peas must be in position 3.
   ```
   |        |     1     |     2     |  3   |
   | Food   |           |           | peas |
   ```

2. **Condition 1**: The person eating nectarine is somewhere between the person eating peas and the person eating asparagus. Since peas is in position 3, asparagus must be in position 1 and nectarine in position 2 to satisfy this condition.
   ```
   |        |     1     |     2     |  3   |
   | Food   | asparagus | nectarine | peas |
   ```

So, the final arrangement is:

```
|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |
| Food   | asparagus | nectarine | peas |

### Clues:
1. The person driving the bus is somewhere between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the tram.
2. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

### Analysis:
- From clue 1, we know that the order must be either quad-bike, bus, tram or tram, bus, quad-bike.
- From clue 2, we know that the bus must be to the right of the quad-bike, which eliminates the possibility of quad-bike, bus, tram.

Therefore, the only possible order based on both clues is:
- Quad-bike
- Bus
- Tram

### Final Solution Table:

Lv7-1x3-7	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step.

Given:
1. The entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the engineer.
2. The engineer is somewhere between the entrepreneur and the manager.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: First column
- Position 2: Second column
- Position 3: Third column

We need to place the three jobs (engineer, entrepreneur, manager) into these columns while satisfying both conditions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Condition 1**: The entrepreneur is to the right of the engineer.
   - This means the engineer cannot be in position 3 because there would be no space to the right for the entrepreneur.

2. **Condition 2**: The engineer is between the entrepreneur and the manager.
   - This means the engineer must be in the middle position (position 2), with the entrepreneur in position 3 and the manager in position 1.

So, we can place the jobs as follows:
- Position 1: Manager
- Position 2: Engineer
- Position 3: Entrepreneur

### Final Solution Table:

```
|       |    1    |    2     |      3       |
| Job   | Manager | Engineer | Entrepreneur |

We have three people who prefer different music genres: d&b, reggae, and soul. We need to arrange them in positions 1, 2, and 3 based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of soul.
2. The fan of soul is somewhere between the fan of d&b and the fan of reggae.

### Analysis:

From clue 1, we know:
- The fan of d&b must be in position 3 (since it's on the right of the fan of soul).

From clue 2, we know:
- The fan of soul is between the fan of d&b and the fan of reggae.
- Since the fan of d&b is in position 3, the fan of soul must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the fan of reggae must be in position 1.

So, the arrangement should be:
- Position 1: Reggae
- Position 2: Soul
- Position 3: d&b

Lv7-1x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the motorbike is somewhere between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the ship.

From these clues, we can infer the following order:
- The person driving the motorbike must be in the middle because it needs to be both to the left of the person driving the ship and between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the ship.

Given that there are three positions (1, 2, and 3), the only possible arrangement that satisfies both clues is:
- Position 1: Quad-bike
- Position 2: Motorbike
- Position 3: Ship

Now, let's place this information into the table:

```
|             |     1     |     2     |  3   |
| Transport   | Quad-bike | Motorbike | Ship |
```

This arrangement satisfies both clues:
- Clue 1: The motorbike (position 2) is to the left of the ship (position 3).
- Clue 2: The motorbike (position 2) is between the quad-bike (position 1) and the ship (position 3).

So, the final solution is:

```
|             |     1     |     2     |  3   |
| Transport   | Quad-bike | Motorbike | Ship |
