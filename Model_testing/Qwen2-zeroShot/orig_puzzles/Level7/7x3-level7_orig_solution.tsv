- From clue 14, the person who's sport is skiing is the person driving the bus.
- Therefore, the person driving the bus (sport: skiing) must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Thriller Fan
- From clue 3, the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the fan of metal.
- From clue 6, the person eating banana is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies.
- From clue 4, the person eating banana is in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Since the person driving the bus (skiing) is either 1 or 3, the person eating banana cannot be in position 1 if the bus driver is there.
- Hence, the person eating banana must be in position 3, and the person driving the bus must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the person watching thriller movies is in position 2.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Magic-Tricks Person
- From clue 1, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
- Since the bus driver is in position 1 and the person driving the skateboard cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate clue 1), the person driving the skateboard must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 3 (which is already occupied by the person eating banana).

This creates a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

#### Re-evaluation:
- If the person driving the bus is in position 3, then the person whose hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 2.
- The person driving the skateboard must be in position 1 (since they are to the left of the magic-tricks person).

#### Step 4: Re-positioning the Thriller Fan
- The person watching thriller movies is still to the left of the fan of metal.
- Since the person eating banana is in position 1 (odd position), the person watching thriller movies must be in position 2.
- The fan of metal must be in position 3.

#### Step 5: Positioning the Cat Owner
- From clue 2, the owner of the cat is between the person eating kale and the person watching action movies.
- From clue 10, the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
- The person who's sport is skateboarding must be in position 2 (since the owner of the cat cannot be in position 1 or 3).

#### Step 6: Final Positioning
- The person eating banana is in position 1.
- The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 2.
- The person watching thriller movies is in position 3.
- The person driving the bus (skiing) is in position 3 (contradiction, so re-evaluate again).

#### Final Re-evaluation:
- If the person driving the bus is in position 1, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 2.
- The person driving the skateboard is in position 3.
- The person watching thriller movies is in position 1.
- The fan of metal is in position 2.

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating zucchini is not the Spanish.
2. **Clue 2**: The Brazilian is on the left or right of the Spanish.
3. **Clue 10**: The Paramedic is not the Brazilian.

From Clues 2 and 10, we can deduce that the Brazilian cannot be next to the Spanish, and the Paramedic cannot be the Brazilian. This means the Brazilian must be either next to the American or next to the Spaniard but not with both.

4. **Clue 5**: The owner of the pony is the Dancer.
5. **Clue 4**: The person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the owner of the bird.

```

From Clue 9, we know:
```
|   | Hiking |   |
|   | Tennis |   |
|   |   | American |
```

Now, let's fill in the remaining clues:

- From Clue 7, the person eating kale is on the left of the person whose hobby is reading.

- From Clue 3, the Firefighter is on the left or right of the person whose sport is snowboarding.
- From Clue 8, the person drinking Sprite is on the left or right of the Firefighter.
- From Clue 6, the Paramedic is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Sprite.

After analyzing all the clues, we can place the items as follows:

Lv7-7x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate values in the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The owner of the lizard is in an odd position (1 or 3).**
2. **The photographer is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.**
3. **The photographer is not the owner of the rabbit.**
4. **The Argentine is on the far right (position 3).**
5. **The person who's sport is water-polo is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.**
6. **The Australian is not the photographer.**
7. **The person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the Chinese.**
8. **The person eating pumpkin is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit.**
9. **The person drinking fanta is between the librarian and the person eating peas.**
10. **The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the librarian.**
11. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games.**
12. **The person who's hobby is hiking is in an odd position (1 or 3).**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Argentine and the Hiker
- From Clue 4, the Argentine is in position 3.
- From Clue 12, the hiker must be in an odd position (1 or 3), but since the Argentine is already in position 3, the hiker must be in position 1.

#### Step 2: Placing the Photographer
- From Clue 5, the person who does rock-climbing also does water-polo.
- From Clue 2, the photographer is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person doing rock-climbing.
- From Clue 6, the Australian is not the photographer.
- From Clue 10, the person doing rock-climbing is to the right of the librarian.

Since the hiker is in position 1, the photographer cannot be there. The photographer must be in position 2 because it is the only remaining odd position for the rock-climber.

#### Step 3: Placing the Lizard Owner
- From Clue 1, the lizard owner is in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Since the hiker is in position 1, the lizard owner must be in position 3.

#### Step 4: Placing the Rabbit Owner
- From Clue 8, the rabbit owner is to the right of the person eating pumpkin.
- From Clue 7, the person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the Chinese.
- From Clue 9, the person drinking fanta is between the librarian and the person eating peas.
- From Clue 10, the rock-climber (who does water-polo) is to the right of the librarian.

Let's start placing these:
- Position 3 (lizard owner): This is the Argentine.
- Position 2 (photographer): This is someone else.
- Position 1 (hiker): This is someone else.
- Position 2 (photographer): This must be someone other than the Argentine or the hiker.
- Position 3 (lizard owner): This is the Argentine.

Given the constraints, let's assume the photographer is in position 2. We can then deduce the rest.

#### Step 5: Placing the Librarian and the Peasant Eater
- The librarian must be to the left of the person drinking fanta.
- The person drinking fanta is between the librarian and the person eating peas.
- The person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the Chinese.
- The person eating pumpkin is to the left of the rabbit owner.

From Clue 9, the person drinking fanta is between the librarian and the person eating peas. Given the positions, the librarian must be in position 1, the person drinking fanta in position 2, and the person eating peas in position 3.

#### Final Table:
```plaintext
|               |       1       |      2       |         3          |
| Beverage      |      fanta    |     soy-milk |        tea         |

Lv7-7x3-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue Analysis:
1. **The person who's hobby is video-games is somewhere to the left of the fan of r&b.**
2. **The person eating plum is in an odd position (4th).**
3. **The Chinese is on the left of the videographer.**
4. **The fan of house is on the far left.**
5. **The owner of the bird is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the person who's hobby is collecting.**
6. **The Egyptian is on the far left or far right.**
7. **The Egyptian is somewhere to the left of the person eating zucchini.**
8. **The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird.**
9. **The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting.**
10. **The social-worker is on the right of the photographer.**
11. **The person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's sport is water-polo.**
12. **The person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding.**
13. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the videographer.**
14. **The Nigerian is on the far left or far right.**

#### Initial Setup:
We will start by placing the known positions and then use the other clues to fill in the rest.

**Position 1:**
- Fan of house (Clue 4)
- Chinese (Clue 3, must be next to the videographer)
- Egyptian (Clue 6, must be at one end)

Since the Chinese must be next to the videographer and the Egyptian must be at one end, let's place the Egyptian at position 1 (since it makes more sense for the Chinese to be next to the videographer).

**Position 1: Egyptian**
**Position 2: Chinese**
**Position 3: Videographer**
**Position 4: Plum Eater (Clue 2)**
**Position 5: (To be determined)**
**Position 6: (To be determined)**
**Position 7: (To be determined)**

#### Filling in More Information:
**Position 1: Egyptian**
- Since the Egyptian is on the far left or far right, and we placed him at position 1, he cannot be on the far right.
- The Chinese must be next to the videographer, so the videographer is at position 3.

**Position 1: Egyptian**
**Position 2: Chinese**
**Position 3: Videographer**
**Position 4: Plum Eater**
**Position 5: (To be determined)**
**Position 6: (To be determined)**
**Position 7: (To be determined)**

**Position 5: (To be determined)**
- The person who's hobby is video-games is somewhere to the left of the fan of r&b.
- The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting (Clue 9).
- The person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's sport is water-polo (Clue 11).

Since the videographer is at position 3, the person with the hobby of video-games must be on the left of the person with the hobby of r&b and the person with the hobby of collecting. Let's place the person with the hobby of video-games at position 2.

**Position 1: Egyptian**
**Position 2: Video-games**
**Position 3: Videographer**
**Position 4: Plum Eater**
**Position 5: Collecting**
**Position 6: (To be determined)**
**Position 7: (To be determined)**

**Position 6: (To be determined)**
- The person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's sport is water-polo (Clue 11).
- The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the videographer (Clue 13).

Since the videographer is at position 3, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be either at position 2 or 4. Given that the person with the hobby of video-games is at position 2, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be at position 4.

**Position 1: Egyptian**
**Position 2: Video-games**
**Position 3: Videographer**
**Position 4: Plums (Collecting)**
**Position 5: Skydiving (Water-polo)**
**Position 6: (To be determined)**
**Position 7: (To be determined)**

**Position 6: (To be determined)**
- The person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding (Clue 12).
- The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the videographer (Clue 13).

Given that the person who's sport is skateboarding is at position 4, the person eating pear must be at position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is already taken by the Egyptian, the person eating pear must be at position 2, but this conflicts with the person with the hobby of video-games. Therefore, the person eating pear must be at position 5.

**Position 1: Egyptian**
**Position 2: Pear**
**Position 3: Videographer**
**Position 4: Plums (Collecting)**
**Position 5: Skydiving (Water-polo)**
**Position 6: (To be determined)**
**Position 7: (To be determined)**

**Position 6: (To be determined)**
- The owner of the bird is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the person who's hobby is collecting (Clue 5).
- The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird (Clue 8).

Given the positions, the only way to fit these is:
- Owner of the bird at position 6
- Owner of the frog at position 7
