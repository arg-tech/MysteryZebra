Lv7-1x5-1	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the order of the transports.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person driving the quad-bike is in the middle (position 3).**
   - This means the quad-bike is in position 3.
   - The arrangement looks like: \_ \_ quad-bike \_ \_

2. **The person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the taxi.**
   - This means the ship must be to the left of the taxi.
   - Possible positions: (ship, taxi) can be (1,2), (2,3), or (3,4).

3. **The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike.**
   - This means the bike cannot be in position 5, and the jet-ski must be to the right of the bike.
   - Possible positions: (bike, jet-ski) can be (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), or (2,3).

4. **The person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the ship and the person driving the quad-bike.**
   - Since the quad-bike is in position 3, the taxi must be either in position 2 or 4.
   - If the taxi is in position 2, the ship must be in position 1.
   - If the taxi is in position 4, the ship must be in position 3 (which is already occupied by the quad-bike).
   - Therefore, the taxi must be in position 2 and the ship in position 1.

5. **The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship.**
   - Given that the ship is in position 1, the bike must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - But since the taxi is in position 2, the bike must be in position 4.
   - This leaves position 2 for the jet-ski.

### Final Arrangement:
- Position 1: Ship
- Position 2: Jet-ski
- Position 3: Quad-bike
- Position 4: Bike
- Position 5: Taxi

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |  1   |  2   |     3     |  4   |    5    |
| Transport   | Ship | Jet-ski | quad-bike | Bike | Taxi   |

Lv7-1x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue step-by-step and place the sports accordingly.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
2. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting (redundant with 1).
3. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby.
4. The person who's sport is rugby is in an even position.
5. The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere between the person who's sport is tennis and the person who's sport is golf.
6. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's sport is tennis.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: Rugby is in an even position. Therefore, rugby can be in positions 2 or 4.
2. **Clue 5**: Rugby is between tennis and golf. This means the order must be Tennis, Rugby, Golf or Golf, Rugby, Tennis.
3. **Clue 6**: Weightlifting is between rugby and tennis. Combining this with Clue 5, we see that if Rugby is in position 2, then Tennis must be in position 1 and Golf in position 3. This would make Weightlifting fit in position 4. If Rugby is in position 4, then Tennis must be in position 3 and Golf in position 5, making Weightlifting fit in position 2. However, Clue 1 states Tennis is to the left of Weightlifting, so Rugby cannot be in position 4.

Thus, Rugby is in position 2, and the sequence must be:
- Position 1: Tennis
- Position 2: Rugby
- Position 3: Golf
- Position 4: Weightlifting

Now, we need to fit Cycling into the remaining position (position 5).

4. **Clue 3**: Cycling is on the left or right of Rugby. Since Rugby is in position 2, Cycling can be in position 1 or 3, but position 1 is already taken by Tennis. Thus, Cycling must be in position 3, which conflicts with Golf being in position 3. Therefore, Cycling must be in position 5.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Tennis
- Position 2: Rugby
- Position 3: Golf
- Position 4: Weightlifting
- Position 5: Cycling

### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |   1    |       2       |    3    |   4   |  5   |
| Sport   | Tennis | Rugby         | Golf    | Weightlifting | Cycling |

Lv7-1x5-3	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the boat is the person driving the boat (This clue is redundant and doesn't provide new information).
3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the car and the person driving the train.
4. **Clue 4**: The person driving the jet-ski is on the far left.
5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the taxi.

Let's start placing the transports based on these clues:

- From Clue 4, we know the jet-ski is in position 1.
- From Clue 1, the boat must be to the right of the jet-ski. Therefore, the boat can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- From Clue 5, the car is to the right of the taxi. This means the taxi cannot be in position 5.
- From Clue 3, the taxi is between the car and the train. So, if the taxi is in position 2, the car must be in position 3 and the train in position 4. Or, if the taxi is in position 3, the car must be in position 4 and the train in position 5. But since the car must be to the right of the taxi, the only possible positions for the taxi, car, and train are 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

Given that the jet-ski is in position 1, and the boat must be to its right, let's place the boat in position 2, which leaves positions 3, 4, and 5 for the taxi, car, and train. According to Clue 3, the taxi must be between the car and the train. The only way this can fit is if the taxi is in position 2, the car in position 3, and the train in position 4. This leaves the boat in position 2, which contradicts our previous assumption. Therefore, the boat must be in position 3, and the remaining positions are 4 and 5 for the taxi and train. Since the car must be to the right of the taxi, the only possible arrangement is:

- Position 1: Jet-ski
- Position 2: Boat
- Position 3: Taxi
- Position 4: Car
- Position 5: Train

So, the final arrangement is:

```
|             |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Jet-ski | Boat | Taxi  | Car  | Train |

Lv7-1x5-4	"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct order of jobs.

1. **The dressmaker is somewhere between the paramedic and the manager.**
   - This means the sequence must be something like: Paramedic, Dressmaker, Manager or Manager, Dressmaker, Paramedic.

2. **The manager is somewhere to the left of the bartender.**
   - This means the bartender cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the manager is in position 3, 4, or 5.

3. **The paramedic is on the left of the dressmaker.**
   - This confirms that the sequence must be Paramedic, Dressmaker, Manager (since the manager is to the right of the paramedic).

4. **The bartender is somewhere to the right of the paramedic.**
   - This aligns with the previous clue, as the paramedic is already to the left of the dressmaker and the manager.

5. **The teacher is on the far right.**
   - This means the teacher is in position 5.

Given these constraints, let's deduce the positions:

- Since the teacher is in position 5, we can start filling from there.
- The paramedic must be to the left of the dressmaker, and the manager must be to the left of the bartender.
- The manager is to the left of the bartender, and the paramedic is to the left of the dressmaker.

From clue 1, the sequence must be: Paramedic, Dressmaker, Manager, Bartender, Teacher.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Paramedic
- Position 2: Dressmaker
- Position 3: Manager
- Position 4: Bartender
- Position 5: Teacher

Here is the final solution table:

2. The person watching sports movies is on the far left.
3. The person watching horror movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching documentary movies.
4. The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Sports (since it must be on the far left)
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: Documentary (since it must be to the right of Horror and Spy must be to its right)
- Position 5: Spy

Now, let's place these according to the given clues:

1. Since the person watching sports movies is on the far left, we can place ""Sports"" at position 1.
2. The person watching horror movies must be to the left of the person watching documentary movies, and there must be a person watching romance movies between them. This means that Horror cannot be in position 4 or 5 because then Documentary would not be to its right. Also, since Horror needs to be between Romance and Documentary, and Documentary is in position 4, Horror must be in position 2 and Romance in position 3.
3. The person watching spy movies must be to the right of the person watching documentary movies, which is in position 4. Therefore, Spy must be in position 5.

So, the final arrangement is:

- Position 1: Sports
- Position 2: Horror
- Position 3: Romance
- Position 4: Documentary
- Position 5: Spy

Here is the final solution table:

Lv7-1x5-7	"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the correct order of the movie genres.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching romance movies is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - This means that either the person watching romance movies is next to the person watching martial-arts movies or they are separated by one other genre.

2. **The person watching comedy movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching family movies.**
   - This places comedy movies between romance and family movies.

3. **The person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching romance movies.**
   - This places martial-arts movies between comedy and romance movies.

4. **The person watching sports movies is in an odd position.**
   - This means sports movies are in positions 1, 3, or 5.

5. **The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - This confirms that the person watching martial-arts movies must be on the left side of the person watching romance movies.

6. **The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person watching family movies.**
   - This means sports movies cannot be in position 5 (since family movies would need to be on the right).

### Deductions:

- From clue 4, sports movies can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- From clue 6, if sports movies are in position 1, family movies must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- From clue 5, since sports movies are on the left of family movies, and considering the positions, sports movies must be in position 1 and family movies in position 2, 3, or 4.
- From clue 3, martial-arts movies must be between comedy and romance movies.
- From clue 2, comedy movies are between romance and family movies.

Given these constraints, let's test possible positions:

- If sports movies are in position 1:
  - Family movies must be in position 2 or 4.
  - Martial-arts movies must be between comedy and romance.
  - Comedy movies must be between romance and family.

Considering all these constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:

1. Sports
2. Family
3. Comedy
4. Romance
5. Martial-Arts

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:
- Sports movies are in an odd position (position 1).
- Comedy movies are between romance and family movies.

Lv7-1x5-8	"Let's analyze the given conditions step by step to determine the correct order of the beverages:

1. **Condition 1:** The person drinking sprite is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking iced-tea.
   - This means the order must be either: mirinda, sprite, iced-tea or iced-tea, sprite, mirinda.

2. **Condition 2:** The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking sprite.
   - This means the order must be either: mirinda, soy-milk, sprite or sprite, soy-milk, mirinda.

3. **Condition 3:** The person drinking almond-milk is between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking soy-milk.
   - This means the order must be either: mirinda, almond-milk, soy-milk or soy-milk, almond-milk, mirinda.

4. **Condition 4:** The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
   - This means almond-milk must come after mirinda.

Combining all these conditions, let's deduce the final order:

- From Condition 1 and Condition 2, we know that sprite and soy-milk must be in the middle, with mirinda on one side and iced-tea on the other.
- From Condition 3, we know that almond-milk must be between mirinda and soy-milk.
- From Condition 4, we know that mirinda must be to the left of almond-milk.

Given these constraints, the only possible order that fits all conditions is:
- mirinda, almond-milk, soy-milk, sprite, iced-tea.

Lv7-1x5-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
2. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's sport is skiing.
3. The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person who's sport is lacrosse (redundant information).
4. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing.
5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
6. The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf.

### Analyzing Clues:

- From clue 1, we know that Ice Hockey (I) comes before Lacrosse (L).
- From clue 2, Snowboarding (S) is between Golf (G) and Skiing (Sk). So the order must be G-Sk-S or Sk-G-S.
- From clue 4, Skiing (Sk) is to the left of Snowboarding (S).
- From clue 5, Snowboarding (S) is to the right of Lacrosse (L).
- From clue 6, Skiing (Sk) is to the left of Golf (G).

### Putting it Together:

From clue 2 and 4:
- Since Skiing (Sk) is to the left of Snowboarding (S), and Snowboarding (S) is between Golf (G) and Skiing (Sk), the only possible order is G-Sk-S.

From clue 1 and 5:
- Ice Hockey (I) comes before Lacrosse (L), and Snowboarding (S) is to the right of Lacrosse (L). This means the only place for Lacrosse (L) can be the second position, making the order I-L-S.

Combining these:
- We have G-Sk-S from clue 2 and 4.
- We have I-L-S from clue 1 and 5.

Since there are only 5 positions and we need to fit all sports, the only way to arrange them is:
- Position 1: Ice Hockey (I)
- Position 2: Lacrosse (L)
- Position 3: Skiing (Sk)
- Position 4: Snowboarding (S)
- Position 5: Golf (G)

Lv7-1x5-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. **The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the dog.**
   - This means that the horse and dog cannot be in positions 4 or 5 together; they must be in positions 1-2 and 3-5 respectively.

2. **The owner of the snake is somewhere between the owner of the horse and the owner of the guinea-pig.**
   - This means the order of these three pets must be either horse-snake-guinea-pig or guinea-pig-snake-horse.

3. **The owner of the chinchilla is in the middle.**
   - The middle position is 3.

4. **The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake.**
   - This means the order must be snake-guinea-pig (since the owner of the guinea-pig cannot be to the left of the snake).

Now, let's combine these clues:

- From clue 3, we know the chinchilla is in position 3.
- From clue 2, the order involving the snake, guinea-pig, and chinchilla must be snake-guinea-pig-chinchilla.
- From clue 4, the guinea-pig must be to the right of the snake, which fits with the order snake-guinea-pig-chinchilla.
- From clue 1, the horse must be on the left of the dog, and since the chinchilla is in position 3, the horse and dog must occupy positions 1-2 and 3-5 respectively.

Given the constraints:
- Position 1 and 2 can only be horse and dog (in that order).
- Positions 4 and 5 must be snake and guinea-pig (in that order).

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Horse
- Position 2: Dog
- Position 3: Chinchilla
- Position 4: Snake
- Position 5: Guinea-pig
