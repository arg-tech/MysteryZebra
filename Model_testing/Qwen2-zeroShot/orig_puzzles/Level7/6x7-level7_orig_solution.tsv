Lv7-6x7-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items in the correct order. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the final position for Time-Travel Movies (Clue 53):**
   - The person watching time-travel movies is on the far right.
   - Therefore, position 7 is for ""time-travel"" movies.

2. **Determine the position for Video-Games (Clue 18):**
   - The person who's hobby is video-games is on the far right.
   - Therefore, position 7 is also for ""video-games"" hobby.

This creates a conflict. Since both ""time-travel"" movies and ""video-games"" are in position 7, let's resolve this by checking other clues. 

3. **Identify the position for Dressmaker (Clue 19):**
   - The software-developer is the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - The person who's sport is handball is somewhere to the left of the software-developer.
   - The person who's sport is handball is not the person drinking tea (Clue 42).
   - The person drinking tea is the dressmaker (Clue 5).

Given that the software-developer is watching martial-arts movies, and the person who's sport is handball is to the left of the software-developer, the software-developer cannot be in position 1 (since it would leave no room for handball). 

Let's place the dressmaker in position 6:
- Position 6: Dressmaker (drinking tea)

4. **Determine the position for Software-Developer (Clue 13):**
   - The software-developer is watching martial-arts movies.
   - Since the software-developer is in position 6, the martial-arts movies must be in position 6.

Now, let's fill in the positions step-by-step:

### Filling Positions:

   - The person who's sport is handball is not the person watching time-travel movies.
   - The person who's sport is handball is not the person watching time-travel movies.
