Lv7-4x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to fill in the table based on the given clues. Let's break down each clue and deduce the information step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing.**
2. **The person who's sport is basketball is in the middle.**
3. **The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person driving the boat.**
4. **The person driving the helicopter is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person watching thriller movies.**
5. **The person watching fantasy movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing.**
6. **The person watching disaster movies is somewhere between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is photography.**

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 2:
- The person who's sport is basketball is in the middle (column 2).

#### Clue 3:
- The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person driving the boat.
  - This means the person driving the boat must be in column 1.

#### Clue 4:
- The person driving the helicopter is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person watching thriller movies.
  - This means the person watching thriller movies cannot be in column 1 or 3 (since the person driving the helicopter is between them).

#### Clue 1:
- The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing.
  - Since the person who's sport is basketball is in column 2, the person watching fantasy movies must be in column 1 or 2, and the person who's sport is surfing must be in column 2 or 3.

#### Clue 5:
- The person watching fantasy movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing.
  - This eliminates the possibility of fishing being the hobby for the person watching fantasy movies.

#### Clue 6:
- The person watching disaster movies is somewhere between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is photography.
  - This means the person watching disaster movies must be in column 2, and the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is photography must be in columns 1 and 3.

### Filling the Table:

Let's start filling the table with the known information:

|               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         |             |              |          |
| Movie-Genre   |             | Fantasy      |          |
| Sport         | Boat        | Basketball   | Surfing  |
| Transport     |             |             |          |

From Clue 6:
- The person watching disaster movies is in column 2.
- The person watching thriller movies must be in column 3 because the person watching fantasy movies is in column 2.
- The person watching disaster movies is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is photography.

So, the table now looks like this:

|               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         | Fishing     | Photography  |          |

| Transport     |             |             |          |

From Clue 3:
- The person driving the boat is in column 1.

So, the table now looks like this:

|               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         | Fishing     | Photography  |          |

| Transport     | Van         |             |          |

From Clue 4:
- The person driving the helicopter is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person watching thriller movies.
- Since the person watching thriller movies is in column 3, the person driving the helicopter must be in column 2.
- The person who's sport is cycling must be in column 1.

So, the table now looks like this:

|               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         | Fishing     | Photography  | Magic-Tricks |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster    | Fantasy      | Thriller |
| Sport         | Cycling     | Basketball   | Surfing  |
| Transport     | Van         | Helicopter  | Boat      |

Finally, we can confirm the table:

|               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
| Hobby         | Fishing     | Photography  | Magic-Tricks |

- From clue 6, the person watching western movies (W) is to the right of the person watching horror movies (H), so we can only have H W _.

#### Step 2: Assign the genres.
- From clue 5, the fan of techno is in the middle, so the order must be H T W.
- The remaining genre is mystery (M), so the order is H T M W.

Lv7-4x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the correct arrangement of each column (Beverage, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre) for each row (Person 1, Person 2, Person 3).

Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person who's hobby is collecting is the person watching mystery movies.**
   - Collecting → Mystery

2. **The manager is somewhere to the left of the person watching adventure movies.**
   - Manager → Not in the last position for Adventure

3. **The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the teacher.**
   - Rock-climbing → Left of Teacher

4. **The teacher is not the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.**
   - Teacher ≠ Rock-climbing

5. **The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the manager.**
   - Adventure → Right of Manager

6. **The person drinking iced-tea is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person drinking almond-milk.**
   - Iced-tea → Between Rock-climbing and Almond-milk

7. **The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the manager and the person who's hobby is collecting.**
   - Iced-tea → Between Manager and Collecting

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of Collecting and Mystery
- From Clue 1, Collecting → Mystery.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of Manager and Adventure
- From Clue 2, Manager is somewhere to the left of Adventure.
- From Clue 5, Adventure is to the right of Manager.

This means Manager cannot be in the last position, and Adventure must be in the last position or second position.

#### Step 3: Determine the positions of Rock-climbing and Teacher
- From Clue 3, Rock-climbing is on the left of Teacher.
- From Clue 4, Teacher ≠ Rock-climbing.

#### Step 4: Determine the positions of Iced-tea, Rock-climbing, and Almond-milk
- From Clue 6, Iced-tea is between Rock-climbing and Almond-milk.
- From Clue 7, Iced-tea is between Manager and Collecting.

Since Collecting is Mystery, and Iced-tea is between Manager and Collecting, we can infer:
- If Collecting is in the middle, then Manager must be on the left, and Iced-tea must be in the middle.
- This leaves Rock-climbing and Almond-milk to be placed such that Rock-climbing is to the left of Teacher and Teacher is not Rock-climbing.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements:

- If Manager is in position 1, Collecting is in position 2 (Mystery), and Iced-tea is in position 2 (since it's between Manager and Collecting).
- Rock-climbing must be in position 1 or 2, and Teacher must be in position 3.
- Since Rock-climbing is to the left of Teacher and Teacher is not Rock-climbing, Rock-climbing must be in position 1 and Teacher in position 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- Manager is in position 1.
- Collecting is in position 2 (Mystery).
- Iced-tea is in position 2.
- Rock-climbing is in position 1.
- Teacher is in position 3.
- Almond-milk is in position 3.

#### Step 5: Assign the remaining beverages
- 7up must be in position 3.

### Final Table:
```

| Hobby         | Rock-climbing| Collecting| Teacher     |

Lv7-4x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding values in the correct cells of the table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the fan of classical.**
2. **The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.**
3. **The person who's hobby is baking is the fan of classical.**
4. **The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.**
5. **The person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person drinking water.**
6. **The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere between the fan of gospel and the person who's hobby is video-games.**
7. **The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical.**
8. **The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person drinking milk.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Hobbies
From clues 3 and 5:
- The person who's hobby is baking is the fan of classical.
- The person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person drinking water.

From clues 1 and 7:
- The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the fan of classical (who is the person with the hobby of baking).
- The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical.

This means the person with the hobby of baking (classical) must be in position 2 or 3, and the person drinking water must be in position 1 or 2. Since the person with the hobby of baking cannot be in position 1 (as it would not satisfy clue 7), the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 2, and the person drinking water must be in position 1.

Thus:
- Position 1: Drinking Water
- Position 2: Baking (Classical)

From clue 2:
- The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
Since the person with the hobby of baking is in position 2, the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 1.

Thus:
- Position 1: Drinking Water (Video-Games)
- Position 2: Baking (Classical)
- Position 3: Puzzles (Classical)

#### Step 2: Determine the Sports
From clue 4:
- The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.

From clue 8:
- The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person drinking milk.

Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the person drinking milk must be in position 3. Therefore, the person who's sport is tennis is in position 1, and the person who's sport is volleyball is in position 2, and the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 3.

Thus:
- Position 1: Tennis (Water)
- Position 2: Volleyball (Classical)
- Position 3: Snowboarding (Milk)

#### Step 3: Determine the Music-Genres
From clue 6:
- The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere between the fan of gospel and the person who's hobby is video-games.
Since the person who's sport is tennis is in position 1 and the person who's hobby is video-games is in position 1, there is no one between them, so this clue does not provide new information about the music-genre.

From clue 7:
- The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical.
We already know the person drinking water is in position 1 and the fan of classical is in position 2, so the fan of classical must be in position 2.

Thus:
- Position 1: Tennis (Water - Gospel)
- Position 2: Baking (Classical)
- Position 3: Snowboarding (Milk - Metal)

Since the fan of classical is in position 2, the person in position 3 must be the fan of metal.

Thus:
- Position 1: Tennis (Water - Gospel)
- Position 2: Baking (Classical)
- Position 3: Snowboarding (Milk - Metal)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |     2     |      3       |

Lv7-4x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break down each clue step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere between the person who's sport is skiing and the person eating pumpkin.**
   - This implies that the order is Skiing -> Snowboarding -> Pumpkin.

2. **The egyptian is somewhere to the right of the british.**
   - This means British is to the left of Egyptian.

3. **The fan of salsa is not the person eating pumpkin.**
   - So, the person eating pumpkin cannot be the fan of salsa.

4. **The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the fan of classical.**
   - This means Skiing -> Classical (in terms of position).

5. **The person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin.**
   - This means the person eating strawberry is either next to or directly adjacent to the person eating pumpkin.

6. **The british is on the left or right of the japanese.**
   - This means British and Japanese are adjacent.

7. **The person eating eggplant is on the left of the japanese.**
   - This means Eggplant -> Japanese.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Placing Sports and Music-Genres

From clues 1 and 4:
- Skiing -> Snowboarding -> Pumpkin
- Skiing -> Classical

So, the order for sports is:
- 1: Skiing
- 2: Snowboarding
- 3: Pumpkin

The person who likes classical must be in position 1 or 2 (since skiing is on the left of classical). Since skiing is in position 1, classical must be in position 2.

Thus:
- 1: Skiing -> Classical
- 2: Snowboarding
- 3: Pumpkin

#### Step 2: Placing Food

From clues 3 and 5:
- The fan of salsa is not the person eating pumpkin.
- The person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin.

Since pumpkin is in position 3, the person eating pumpkin can't be the fan of salsa. Thus, the fan of salsa must be in position 1 or 2. But since classical is in position 2, the fan of salsa must be in position 1.

So, the person eating strawberry must be in position 2 or 3. Since pumpkin is in position 3, the person eating strawberry must be in position 2.

Thus:
- 1: Salsa
- 2: Strawberry
- 3: Pumpkin

#### Step 3: Placing Nationalities

From clues 2 and 6:
- The egyptian is to the right of the british.
- The british is on the left or right of the japanese.
- The person eating eggplant is on the left of the japanese.

Since the person eating eggplant is on the left of the japanese, and the egyptian is to the right of the british, we have two possible arrangements for British, Japanese, and Egyptian:

1. British -> Japanese -> Egyptian
2. British -> Egyptian -> Japanese

Since the person eating eggplant is on the left of the japanese, the only valid arrangement is:

- 1: British
- 2: Japanese
- 3: Egyptian

### Final Table:

```plaintext
##############
|               |    1     |      2       |    3     |
| Food          | Salsa   | Strawberry   | Pumpkin  |
| Music-Genre   | Classical |            |          |
| Nationality   | British  | Japanese     | Egyptian |
| Sport         | Skiing  | Snowboarding |          |

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv7-4x3-6	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the final solution:

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **Baseball is left of Surfing:**
   - This means the person with baseball preference is to the left of the person with surfing preference.

2. **Electrician is left of Climbing:**
   - The electrician is to the left of the person whose preferred sport is climbing.

3. **Designer owns Hamster:**
   - The designer has the hamster as a pet.

4. **Designer is left or right of Spy:**
   - The designer is either to the left or right of the person who prefers spy movies.

5. **Spy Movies is between Drama and Rat Owner:**
   - The person who prefers spy movies is between the person who prefers drama movies and the owner of the rat.

6. **Architect is Climbing:**
   - The architect's preferred sport is climbing.

7. **Family Movies is right of Drama:**
   - The person who prefers family movies is to the right of the person who prefers drama movies.

8. **Goat Owner is not Designer:**
   - The person who owns the goat is not the designer.

### Initial Setup:
We need to assign each job, movie genre, pet, and sport to the three positions (1, 2, 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 6:**
   - Architect = Climbing
   - So, position 3 must be Climbing.

2. **From Clue 2:**
   - Electrician is left of Climbing.
   - Since Climbing is in position 3, Electrician can only be in position 1 or 2.

3. **From Clue 1:**
   - Baseball is left of Surfing.
   - So, Baseball cannot be in position 3, and Surfing cannot be in position 1.

4. **From Clue 4:**
   - Designer is left or right of Spy.
   - Designer can't be in position 2 because Spy would have to be in position 1 or 3, which conflicts with other constraints.

5. **From Clue 3:**
   - Designer owns Hamster.
   - Designer can't be in position 2 because Spy would have to be in position 1 or 3, which conflicts with other constraints.

6. **From Clue 5:**
   - Spy is between Drama and Rat Owner.
   - Spy can't be in position 2 because it would force Drama and Rat Owner to be in positions 1 and 3, which doesn't work with other constraints.

7. **From Clue 7:**
   - Family Movies is right of Drama.
   - Family Movies can't be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3, but we already know position 3 is Climbing, so this is a contradiction unless we adjust our positions.

8. **From Clue 8:**
   - Goat Owner is not Designer.
   - If Designer is in position 1, Goat Owner can be in position 2 or 3.

### Adjusted Solution:

- **Position 3:** Climbing (Architect)
- **Position 1:** Electrician (must be left of Climbing)
- **Position 2:** Remaining job (Designer or remaining person)

### Re-evaluating the positions:

- **Position 1:** Electrician (left of Climbing)
- **Position 2:** Designer (owns Hamster)
- **Position 3:** Architect (Climbing)

Now, let's assign the remaining preferences:

- **Drama and Spy:** Spy must be between Drama and Rat Owner.
- **Family and Baseball/Surfing:** Family is right of Drama.

### Final Assignment:

- **Position 1:** Electrician (Sport: Baseball)
- **Position 2:** Designer (Pet: Hamster, Movie: Spy)
- **Position 3:** Architect (Sport: Climbing, Movie: Drama, Pet: Rat)

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |
| Job           | Electrician | Designer   | Architect |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama      | Spy        | Family    |
| Pet           | Goat       | Hamster    | Rat       |
| Sport         | Baseball   | Climbing   | Surfing   |

Lv7-4x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the correct assignments for each column (Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Sport). Let's analyze each clue step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The fan of ambient is on the far left.**
   - This means the first column is the fan of ambient.

2. **The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.**
   - This means the column with ""tennis"" cannot be the first column, and the column with ""skateboarding"" must be to the left of the column with ""tennis"".

3. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the fan of metal.**
   - This means the column with ""skateboarding"" can either be the first or second column if the fan of metal is the third column, or it can be the second or third column if the fan of metal is the first column.

4. **The fan of metal is not the project-manager.**
   - The fan of metal cannot be the project-manager.

5. **The person watching comedy movies is somewhere between the coach and the person watching spy movies.**
   - This means the column with ""comedy"" must be between the columns with ""coach"" and ""spy"".

6. **The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching spy movies.**
   - This means the column with ""comedy"" must be to the left of the column with ""spy"".

7. **The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is soccer.**
   - This means the column with ""comedy"" must be to the right of the column with ""soccer"".

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Ambient is on the far left.**
   - Column 1: Ambient

2. **Tennis is to the right of skateboarding.**
   - Since ambient is on the left, tennis cannot be in the first column. So, tennis must be in column 3 or 2, and skateboarding must be in column 1 or 2.
   
3. **Skateboarding is left or right of metal.**
   - If skateboarding is in column 1, then metal must be in column 2 or 3.
   - If skateboarding is in column 2, then metal must be in column 3.

4. **Metal is not the project-manager.**
   - Metal cannot be in the same column as the project-manager.

5. **Comedy is between coach and spy, and to the left of spy.**
   - This means comedy, coach, and spy must be in three consecutive columns with comedy to the left of spy.

6. **Comedy is to the right of soccer.**
   - This means soccer must be in column 1 or 2, and comedy must be in column 2 or 3.

### Combining the clues:

- From clue 2, tennis must be in column 3 or 2.
- From clue 3, skateboarding can be in column 1 or 2.
- From clue 5, comedy is between coach and spy, and to the left of spy.
- From clue 6, comedy is to the right of soccer.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements:

1. **Ambient** (from clue 1) is in column 1.
2. **Soccer** must be in column 2 because comedy is to the right of soccer (clue 6).
3. **Comedy** must be in column 3 because it is between coach and spy, and to the left of spy (clue 5).
4. **Spy** must be in column 4 because comedy is to the left of spy.
5. **Tennis** cannot be in column 1 (clue 2), so it must be in column 3 or 4. But since comedy is already in column 3, tennis must be in column 4.
6. **Skateboarding** must be in column 2 because it is left or right of metal, and tennis is in column 4.
7. **Metal** cannot be in column 2 (skateboarding) or column 4 (tennis), so it must be in column 3.
8. **Coach** must be in column 1 because it is the only remaining job that fits the pattern.

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |    4    |
| Job           | Coach   | Skateboarding   | Metal    | Tennis  |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy  | Epic            | Spy      | Spy     |

| Sport         | Soccer  | Skating         | Tennis   | Soccer  |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv7-4x3-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person watching fantasy movies is the bartender.**
   - Bartender -> Fantasy Movies

2. **The person watching family movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.**
   - Family Movies -> Left of Fishing Hobby

3. **The australian is on the far right.**
   - Australian -> 3rd Position (Rightmost)

4. **The russian is not the person who's hobby is reading.**
   - Russian -> Not Reading Hobby

5. **The videographer is somewhere between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the bartender.**
   - Videographer -> Between Skydiving Hobby and Bartender

6. **The bartender is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.**
   - Bartender -> Right of Reading Hobby

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Bartender
- From Clue 1: Bartender -> Fantasy Movies
- From Clue 6: Bartender -> Right of Reading Hobby

Since the Bartender is on the right of the Reading Hobby, the Bartender cannot be in position 1 or 2. The only possible position for the Bartender is 3.

#### Step 2: Place the Australian
- From Clue 3: The Australian is on the far right.
- Therefore, the Australian must be in position 3.

#### Step 3: Determine the Bartender's Hobbies and Jobs
- Since the Bartender is in position 3, and the Australian is also in position 3, the Bartender cannot be the Australian.
- From Clue 1: Bartender -> Fantasy Movies.
- From Clue 6: Bartender -> Right of Reading Hobby.
- Therefore, the Bartender must be the Russian (since the Russian is not reading).

So, we have:
- Position 3: Russian (Bartender, Fantasy Movies)

#### Step 4: Determine the Remaining Positions
- Position 1 and 2 must be filled with the remaining people (Australian and Indian).
- From Clue 3: The Australian is on the far right, so the Australian must be in position 3, which we already placed as the Russian.

Now, we need to place the Indian in either position 1 or 2.

#### Step 5: Determine the Reading Hobby
- From Clue 6: Bartender (Russian) -> Right of Reading Hobby.
- Since the Bartender is in position 3, the Reading Hobby must be in position 1 or 2.
- From Clue 2: Family Movies -> Left of Fishing Hobby.
- If the Reading Hobby is in position 1, then the Family Movies must be in position 2, and the Fishing Hobby must be in position 3, but the Bartender is in position 3, which contradicts Clue 6.
- Therefore, the Reading Hobby must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 2: Reading Hobby

#### Step 6: Determine the Jobs and Movie Genres
- Position 1: Reading Hobby
- Position 2: Family Movies
- Position 3: Russian (Bartender, Fantasy Movies)

From Clue 5: The videographer is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the bartender.
- Since the Bartender is in position 3, the skydiving hobbyist must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the Reading Hobby is in position 2, the skydiving hobbyist must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the skydiving hobbyist is in position 1, and the reading hobbyist is in position 2.

From Clue 4: The Russian is not the person who's hobby is reading.
- Therefore, the reading hobbyist must be the Indian.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Indian (Reading Hobby)
- Position 2: Family Movies (Indian)
- Position 3: Russian (Bartender, Fantasy Movies)

From Clue 5: The videographer is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the bartender.
- The skydiving hobbyist is in position 1, and the bartender is in position 3.
- Therefore, the videographer must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Indian (Reading Hobby)
- Position 2: Videographer (Family Movies)
- Position 3: Russian (Bartender, Fantasy Movies)

#### Final Table:

```
|               |     1     |      2       |     3      |

Lv7-4x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
2. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left or far right.
3. The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is golf.
4. The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the left of the French.
5. The Indonesian is somewhere between the Pakistani and the owner of the bird.
6. The Pakistani is not the owner of the hedgehog.
7. (This seems to be an additional clue that might not fit perfectly with the others, but we'll consider it for completeness.)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
- The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left or far right.
- This means the person with the hobby ""hiking"" must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the left of the French.
- This means the French cannot be in position 1 if the sport is golf, so the sport ""golf"" must be in position 2 or 3, and the French must be in position 3 or 1.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is golf.
- If golf is in position 2, then water-polo must be in position 3. If golf is in position 3, there is no valid position for water-polo (since it needs to be to the right).

So, golf must be in position 2, and water-polo must be in position 3.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 1
- The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
- Since water-polo is in position 3, the hobby ""traveling"" must be in position 2 or 3. But since position 3 is already taken by water-polo, traveling must be in position 2.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
- The Indonesian is somewhere between the Pakistani and the owner of the bird.
- This implies the Indonesian cannot be in position 1 or 3, so they must be in position 2. However, position 2 is already taken by the hobby ""traveling"". So, the Indonesian must be in position 3, and the owner of the bird must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
- The Pakistani is not the owner of the hedgehog.
- Since the Indonesian is in position 3, the Pakistani cannot be in position 3. The Pakistani must be in position 1 or 2. But since the Indonesian is in position 3, the Pakistani must be in position 1.

#### Step 7: Assign Remaining Hobbies and Sports
- Position 1: Pakistani (not hedgehog)
- Position 2: Traveling (from clue 1)
- Position 3: Indonesian (from clue 5)

Now, let's assign the remaining sports and hobbies:

- The sport ""climbing"" must be in position 1 (since golf is in position 2 and water-polo is in position 3).
- The sport ""golf"" is in position 2.
- The sport ""water-polo"" is in position 3.

- The hobby ""chess"" must be in position 1 (since hiking is in position 1 or 3, and traveling is in position 2).
- The hobby ""hiking"" must be in position 3 (since it's on the far left or right, and traveling is in position 2).
- The hobby ""travelling"" is in position 2.

Now, let's assign the nationalities and pets:

- The French must be in position 3 (since golf is in position 2 and the French must be to the right of golf).
- The Indonesian is in position 3, so the Pakistani must be in position 1.
- The owner of the bird must be in position 1 (since the Indonesian is in position 3 and the Pakistani is in position 1).

- The pet ""hamster"" must be in position 1 (since the bird is in position 1 and the hedgehog is not owned by the Pakistani).
- The pet ""hedgehog"" must be in position 3 (since the bird is in position 1 and the Indonesian is in position 3).
- The pet ""bird"" must be in position 2 (since the Indonesian is in position 3 and the Pakistani is in position 1).

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |
| Hobby         | Chess     | Traveling  | Hiking    |
| Nationality   | Pakistani | French     | Indonesian|

Lv7-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
2. The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing.
3. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere between the dutch and the person who's sport is water-polo.
4. The fan of salsa is on the right of the fan of hip-hop.
5. The brazilian is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is soccer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: 
The person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.

This means that if the sport is soccer, the hobby must be writing in the next column.

#### Clue 2: 
The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing.

If the hobby is writing, then the fan of hip-hop can be either to the left or right of the person with the hobby of writing.

#### Clue 3: 
The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere between the dutch and the person who's sport is water-polo.

This means the woodworking person is not directly adjacent to the dutch or the water-polo person.

#### Clue 4: 
The fan of salsa is on the right of the fan of hip-hop.

This means that if the fan of hip-hop is in column 1, the fan of salsa must be in column 2 or 3. If the fan of hip-hop is in column 2, the fan of salsa must be in column 3.

#### Clue 5: 
The brazilian is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is soccer.

This means the brazilian cannot be in the same column as or to the right of the person with the sport of soccer.

### Initial Setup:
We will use columns 1, 2, and 3 for the clues and fill them based on the given constraints.

|               |     1      |      2      |    3    |
| Hobby         |            |             |         |
| Music-Genre   |            |             |         |
| Nationality   |            |             |         |
| Sport         |            |             |         |

### Applying Clues:
1. **Clue 1**: 
   - If the sport is soccer in column 3, the hobby must be writing in column 2.
   
2. **Clue 2**: 
   - The fan of hip-hop can be in column 1 or 2 relative to the writing person.
   
3. **Clue 3**: 
   - The woodworking person must be between the dutch and the water-polo person.
   
4. **Clue 4**: 
   - The fan of salsa must be to the right of the fan of hip-hop.
   
5. **Clue 5**: 
   - The brazilian must be to the left of the person with soccer.

### Solving:
- Let's start with the sport column:
  - Since the brazilian must be to the left of the soccer person, and there are only three positions, let's assume the brazilian is in column 1, and soccer is in column 3.
  
  |               |     1      |      2      |    3    |
  | Hobby         |            |             |         |
  | Music-Genre   |            |             |         |
  | Nationality   |            |             |         |
  | Sport         | brazilian  |             | soccer  |

- Now, the woodworking person must be between the dutch and water-polo person. This means the woodworking person cannot be in column 1 (brazilian) or 3 (soccer), so it must be in column 2.
  
  |               |     1      |      2      |    3    |
  | Hobby         |            | woodworking|         |
  | Music-Genre   |            |             |         |
  | Nationality   |            |             |         |
  | Sport         | brazilian  | woodworking| soccer  |

- The fan of hip-hop must be on the left or right of the writing person. Since writing is in column 2, the hip-hop fan can be in column 1 or 3.
  
  - If the hip-hop fan is in column 1, the salsa fan must be in column 2 or 3.
    - But since the woodworking person is already in column 2, the salsa fan must be in column 3.
    - This would mean the hip-hop fan cannot be in column 1 because the salsa fan would need to be in column 3, but the soccer person is in column 3.
  
  - Therefore, the hip-hop fan must be in column 3, and the salsa fan must be in column 2.
  
  |               |     1      |      2      |    3    |
  | Hobby         |            |             | writing |
  | Music-Genre   | hip-hop    | salsa       |         |
  | Nationality   |            |             |         |
  | Sport         | brazilian  | woodworking| soccer  |

- Finally, we need to assign the remaining nationalities (dutch and italian) to the remaining columns. Since the woodworking person is in column 2, the dutch and italian must be in columns 1 and 3.
  
  - The dutch cannot be in column 3 (soccer), so the dutch must be in column 1, and the italian must be in column 3.
  
  |               |     1      |      2      |    3    |
  | Hobby         |            |             | writing |
  | Music-Genre   | hip-hop    | salsa       |         |
  | Nationality   | dutch      |             | italian |
  | Sport         | brazilian  | woodworking| soccer  |

- Now, we need to assign the music genres to the remaining cells. Since the hip-hop fan is in column 1 and the salsa fan is in column 2, the remaining genre (rock) must be in column 3.
  
  |               |     1      |      2      |    3    |
  | Hobby         |            |             | writing |
  | Music-Genre   | hip-hop    | salsa       | rock    |
  | Nationality   | dutch      |             | italian |
  | Sport         | brazilian  | woodworking| soccer  |

- Finally, we assign the remaining hobbies to the remaining columns. Since the woodworking person is in column 2, the remaining hobbies (filmmaking and writing) must be assigned to the remaining columns.

  |               |     1      |      2      |    3    |
  | Hobby         | filmmaking | woodworking| writing |
  | Music-Genre   | hip-hop    | salsa       | rock    |
  | Nationality   | dutch      | italian    | brazilian|
  | Sport         | brazilian  | woodworking| soccer  |

### Final Solution:
```
|               |     1      |      2      |    3    |
| Hobby         | filmmaking | woodworking| writing |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop    | salsa       | rock    |
| Nationality   | dutch      | italian    | brazilian|
| Sport         | brazilian  | woodworking| soccer  |
