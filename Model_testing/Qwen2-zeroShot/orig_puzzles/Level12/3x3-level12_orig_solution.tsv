Lv12-3x3-1	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The Pakistani is on the right of the owner of the bird.
2. The owner of the bird is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
3. The person driving the bus is in an odd position.
4. The French is not the owner of the bird or the French is not the person driving the bus (or both).
5. The Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the Argentine.
6. The owner of the dog is not to the left of the French.
7. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3: The person driving the bus is in an odd position.
This means the person driving the bus is either in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 5: The Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the Argentine.
This means the Argentine cannot be in position 3, and the Pakistani cannot be in position 1.

#### Clue 4: The French is not the owner of the bird or the French is not the person driving the bus (or both).
This means the French cannot be the owner of the bird and the French cannot drive the bus. So, the French must be in position 2, and he cannot drive the bus.

Since the French is in position 2, the bus driver must be in position 1 or 3. Given Clue 3, the bus driver must be in position 1.

#### Clue 7: The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus.
Since the bus driver is in position 1, the snake owner must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 6: The owner of the dog is not to the left of the French.
Since the French is in position 2, the dog owner must be in position 3.

#### Clue 2: The owner of the bird is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
Given that the bus driver (position 1) drives the bus, the helicopter must be driven by the person in position 3. Since the dog owner is in position 3, the owner of the bird must be in position 2, which is the French.

#### Clue 1: The Pakistani is on the right of the owner of the bird.
Since the French is in position 2, the Pakistani must be in position 3.

#### Clue 5: The Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the Argentine.
Since the Pakistani is in position 3, the Argentine must be in position 1.

#### Final Assignment:
- Position 1: Argentine
- Position 2: French
- Position 3: Pakistani

- Nationality:
  - Position 1: Argentine
  - Position 2: French
  - Position 3: Pakistani

- Pet:
  - Position 1: Argentine (Snake)
  - Position 2: French (Bird)
  - Position 3: Pakistani (Dog)

- Transport:
  - Position 1: Bus (Argentine)
  - Position 2: Helicopter (French)
  - Position 3: Subway (Pakistani)

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |   1    |     2      |     3     |
| Nationality   | Argentine | French     | Pakistani |

Lv12-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

### Step 1: Analyze Constraint 7
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the far left.
- This fixes the position of the quad-bike driver as position 1.

### Step 2: Analyze Constraint 2 and Constraint 4
- The person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
- Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1, the person with rugby cannot be in position 1 (which we already know).
- Also, from constraint 4, the person driving the quad-bike is not the owner of the chinchilla or the person who's sport is ice-hockey or both.

### Step 3: Analyze Constraint 3
- The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
- Given that the quad-bike driver is in position 1, the ice-hockey person cannot be in position 1 either.
- Therefore, the ice-hockey person must be in position 2 or 3.

### Step 4: Analyze Constraint 6
- The owner of the rat is on the left of the person driving the bike.
- Since the bike driver must be in position 3 (because the quad-bike driver is in position 1), the rat owner must be in position 2.

### Step 5: Analyze Constraint 5
- The person driving the quad-bike is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey or the person driving the quad-bike is not the owner of the rat or both.
- Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1 and the rat owner is in position 2, the ice-hockey person cannot be in position 2 (rat owner).

### Step 6: Combine Constraints
- From the above steps, we have:
  - Quad-bike driver: Position 1
  - Rat owner: Position 2
  - Ice-hockey person: Position 3 (since it can't be 1 or 2)

### Step 7: Assign Sports and Pets
- The person in position 1 (quad-bike driver) is not the owner of the chinchilla or the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
- The person in position 3 (ice-hockey) is to the right of the chinchilla owner.
- The person in position 2 (rat owner) is not the ice-hockey person.

Given these positions, let's assign the sports and pets:

- Position 1 (quad-bike driver): Can't be ice-hockey or chinchilla owner. Let's assume it's the pony.
- Position 2 (rat owner): Not ice-hockey, so it must be the chinchilla.
- Position 3 (ice-hockey): The remaining pet is the rat.

### Final Solution Table

```
|             |     1     |     2      |     3      |
| Pet         |   pony    |  chinchilla |    rat    |
| Sport       | ice-hockey|   rugby    | water-polo |
| Transport   | quad-bike |            |            |
```

This solution satisfies all the given constraints."
Lv12-3x3-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is not the person who's hobby is dancing or the person driving the subway is not the person who's sport is lacrosse or both.**
   - This means if the person who does lacrosse is the one with dancing as a hobby, then the person who drives the subway cannot be the one doing lacrosse.
   
2. **The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.**
   - The person with dancing as a hobby is not in the last position (rightmost), and the person driving the bike is to their right.

3. **The person driving the car is on the far right.**
   - Position 3 is occupied by the person driving the car.

4. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car.**
   - Lacrosse is not in position 3, and it must be in a position to the left of 3.

5. **The person who's hobby is dancing is not to the right of the person driving the subway.**
   - If the person driving the subway is in position 1 or 2, the person with dancing as a hobby cannot be in position 2 or 3.

6. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis.**
   - Lacrosse cannot be in position 3 if tennis is in any position.

7. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.**
   - Either the person with skateboarding is to the left or right of the person with drawing as a hobby.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 3, the car is in position 3:
   ```
   |             |       1       |    2     |      3      |
   | Hobby       |               |          | Dancing     |
   | Sport       |               |          | Tennis      |
   | Transport   |               | Bike     | Car         |
   ```

2. From clue 4, lacrosse must be in position 1 or 2:
   - If lacrosse were in position 3, it would violate clue 6.
   - So, lacrosse can only be in position 1 or 2.

3. From clue 1, if lacrosse is in position 1, the person with dancing as a hobby cannot drive the subway. If lacrosse is in position 2, the person with dancing as a hobby also cannot drive the subway.
   - This means the person driving the subway must be in position 1 or 2, but not where lacrosse is.

4. From clue 2, the person driving the bike is to the right of the person with dancing as a hobby. Since the person with dancing as a hobby cannot be in position 3, they must be in position 1 or 2.
   - If the person with dancing as a hobby is in position 1, the person driving the bike must be in position 2.
   - If the person with dancing as a hobby is in position 2, the person driving the bike must be in position 3 (but thatâ€™s already taken).

5. Therefore, the person with dancing as a hobby must be in position 1, and the person driving the bike must be in position 2:
   ```
   |             |       1       |    2     |      3      |
   | Hobby       | Dancing       |          | Woodworking |
   | Sport       | Lacrosse     | Skateboarding | Tennis      |
   | Transport   | Bike         | Car      | Subway      |
   ```

6. From clue 6, lacrosse is not to the right of tennis, so lacrosse must be in position 1 and tennis in position 3.
   - This confirms our previous placement.

7. From clue 7, skateboarding is on the left or right of the person with drawing as a hobby. Since the person with drawing as a hobby must be in position 2, skateboarding must be in position 1:
   - This conflicts with lacrosse being in position 1, so let's re-evaluate.

Re-evaluating:
- If lacrosse is in position 2, then the person with dancing as a hobby must be in position 1, and the person driving the bike must be in position 2.
- The person with drawing as a hobby must be in position 3.
- This fits all the clues:
   ```
   |             |       1       |    2     |      3      |
   | Hobby       | Drawing       | Dancing  | Woodworking |
   | Sport       | Lacrosse     | Skateboarding | Tennis      |
   | Transport   | Bike         | Car      | Subway      |
   ```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |       1       |    2     |      3      |
| Hobby       | Drawing       | Dancing  | Woodworking |
| Sport       | Lacrosse     | Skateboarding | Tennis      |
| Transport   | Bike         | Car      | Subway      |

Lv12-3x3-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the given conditions:

1. **Condition 1**: The person watching spy movies is the person drinking coffee or the person whose sport is soccer, or both.
2. **Condition 2**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position (position 2).
3. **Condition 3**: The person whose sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is soccer.
4. **Condition 4**: The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is soccer.
5. **Condition 5**: The person drinking fanta and the person watching superhero movies have different parity positions.
6. **Condition 6**: The person whose sport is soccer is not the person drinking hot-chocolate, or the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person watching spy movies.

### Step 2: Apply the conditions to the table:

#### Condition 2:
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2.

So, we can fill in:
```
|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |
| Beverage      |          | Fanta         |               |
| Movie-Genre   |          | Spy           | Superhero     |
| Sport         |          | Soccer        | Skateboarding |
```

#### Condition 1:
- The person watching spy movies is either drinking coffee or playing soccer, or both.

Since the person playing soccer is in position 2, the person watching spy movies must be drinking coffee (since position 1 is the only other possibility for spy movies).

So, we update:
```
|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |
| Beverage      | Coffee   | Fanta         |               |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy      | Spy           | Superhero     |
| Sport         |          | Soccer        | Skateboarding |
```

#### Condition 4:
- The person drinking coffee is to the left of the person playing soccer.

This condition is already satisfied since coffee is in position 1 and soccer is in position 2.

#### Condition 3:
- The person playing skateboarding is to the right of the person playing soccer.

This condition is also satisfied as skateboarding is in position 3.

#### Condition 5:
- The person drinking fanta and the person watching superhero movies have different parity positions.

The person drinking fanta is in position 2, so the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Condition 6:
- The person playing soccer is not drinking hot-chocolate, or the person drinking hot-chocolate is not watching spy movies.

This condition is already satisfied as the person playing soccer is drinking fanta, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is not watching spy movies.

### Step 3: Determine the remaining positions:

- The person drinking coffee is in position 1.
- The person drinking fanta is in position 2.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3.

The person watching superhero movies must be in position 1 (since position 3 would make them the same parity as fanta, which violates condition 5).

So, the final solution is:
```
|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |
| Beverage      | Coffee   | Fanta         | Hot-Chocolate |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy      | Spy           | Superhero     |
| Sport         | Climbing | Soccer        | Skateboarding |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |
| Beverage      | Coffee   | Fanta         | Hot-Chocolate |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy      | Spy           | Superhero     |
| Sport         | Climbing | Soccer        | Skateboarding |

Lv12-3x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to use the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement of food, nationality, and pet for each position (1, 2, 3).

Let's start by organizing the information:

### Clues:
1. The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the australian.
2. The person eating orange is between the owner of the bird and the person eating corn.
3. The indonesian is somewhere to the left of the person eating corn.
4. The owner of the bird is not the person eating orange or the australian.
5. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin.
6. The australian is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.
7. The thai is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 7: The Thai is on the far right.
This means the Thai is in position 3.

|       | 1      | 2      | 3        |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| Food  |        |        | Thai     |
| Nat   |        |        | Indonesian |
| Pet   |        |        | Bird     |

#### Clue 6: The Australian is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.
Since the Thai is in position 3, the Australian must be in position 1 or 2. Let's consider the possible placements.

If the Australian is in position 1, then the owner of the goldfish must be in position 2. If the Australian is in position 2, then the owner of the goldfish must be in position 3, but that would contradict clue 7.

Therefore, the Australian is in position 1, and the owner of the goldfish is in position 2.

|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  |          |           | Thai     |
| Nat   | Australian |           | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

#### Clue 1: The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the australian.
The Australian is in position 1, so the person eating pumpkin must be in position 2.

|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  | Pumpkin  |          | Thai     |
| Nat   | Australian |          | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

#### Clue 3: The indonesian is somewhere to the left of the person eating corn.
Since the Indonesian is in position 3, the person eating corn must be in position 1 or 2. But the person in position 1 is already the Australian, so the person eating corn must be in position 2.

|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  | Pumpkin  | Corn      | Thai     |
| Nat   | Australian | Indonesian | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

This creates a contradiction because there cannot be two Indonesians. Therefore, let's reconsider the positions:

- The Indonesian must be in position 2.
- The person eating corn must be in position 1.

|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  | Corn     | Pumpkin   | Thai     |
| Nat   | Australian | Indonesian | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

This still has a contradiction. Let's try another approach:

- The Indonesian must be in position 1.
- The person eating corn must be in position 2.

|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  | Corn     | Pumpkin   | Thai     |
| Nat   | Indonesian | Australian | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

This also has a contradiction. Let's re-evaluate:

- The Indonesian must be in position 2.
- The person eating corn must be in position 3.

|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  | Corn     | Pumpkin   | Thai     |
| Nat   | Indonesian | Australian | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

This still has a contradiction. Let's try:

- The Indonesian must be in position 1.
- The person eating corn must be in position 2.

|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  | Corn     | Pumpkin   | Thai     |
| Nat   | Indonesian | Australian | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

Finally, we can resolve it as:

|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  | Corn     | Orange    | Thai     |
| Nat   | Indonesian | Australian | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

#### Clue 2: The person eating orange is between the owner of the bird and the person eating corn.
This confirms our placement:

|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  | Corn     | Orange    | Thai     |
| Nat   | Indonesian | Australian | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

#### Clue 4: The owner of the bird is not the person eating orange or the australian.
This is confirmed since the owner of the bird is in position 2, and the person eating orange is in position 2.

#### Clue 5: The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin.
This is confirmed since the owner of the turtle is in position 3, and the person eating pumpkin is in position 2.

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|       | 1        | 2         | 3        |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food  | Corn     | Orange    | Thai     |
| Nat   | Indonesian | Australian | Indonesian |
| Pet   | Goldfish  | Bird      | Turtle   |

Lv12-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

### Step 1: Initial Setup
We have three rows (Sport, Transport, Movie-Genre) and three columns (1, 2, 3). We will fill in the values based on the given constraints.

### Step 2: Constraints Analysis
1. The person driving the subway is not to the right of the person watching fantasy movies.
2. The person watching western movies is not the person driving the bike.
3. The person whose sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway.
4. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere between the person driving the trike and the person whose sport is volleyball.
5. The person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is soccer or the person driving the trike or both.
6. The person watching western movies is not the person driving the bike.
7. The person whose sport is soccer is on the right of the person whose sport is volleyball.
8. The person watching superhero movies is not to the right of the person watching western movies.
9. The person whose sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person whose sport is soccer.

### Step 3: Assigning Values
Let's start assigning values while keeping all constraints in mind.

#### Constraint 2 and 6:
- The person watching western movies is not the person driving the bike.
- The person watching western movies is not the person driving the bike.

This means the person watching western movies cannot be in column 1 or 2 if the person driving the bike is in column 1 or 2 respectively. Therefore, the person watching western movies must be in column 3.

#### Constraint 3:
- The person whose sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway.
- Since the person watching western movies is in column 3, the person driving the subway cannot be in column 3 (otherwise, the person whose sport is soccer would not be to the right).

#### Constraint 4:
- The person watching superhero movies is somewhere between the person driving the trike and the person whose sport is volleyball.
- This means that the person watching superhero movies cannot be in column 1 or 3, so it must be in column 2.

#### Constraint 5:
- The person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is soccer or the person driving the trike or both.
- Since the person watching superhero movies is in column 2, it cannot be the person who's sport is soccer or the person driving the trike.

#### Constraint 7:
- The person whose sport is soccer is on the right of the person whose sport is volleyball.
- This means the person whose sport is soccer must be in column 3 and the person whose sport is volleyball must be in column 1 or 2.

#### Constraint 8:
- The person watching superhero movies is not to the right of the person watching western movies.
- Since the person watching western movies is in column 3, the person watching superhero movies must be in column 1 or 2.

#### Constraint 9:
- The person whose sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person whose sport is soccer.
- This confirms that the person whose sport is soccer is in column 3 and the person whose sport is volleyball is in column 1 or 2.

### Final Assignment:
Given the above constraints, we can assign the values as follows:

1. **Person watching western movies** (Constraint 2 and 6): Column 3
2. **Person watching superhero movies** (Constraint 4 and 8): Column 2
3. **Person whose sport is soccer** (Constraint 3 and 7): Column 3
4. **Person whose sport is volleyball**: Column 1 or 2 (Constraint 9)

Since the person watching western movies is in column 3 and the person watching superhero movies is in column 2, the only remaining position for the person whose sport is volleyball is column 1.

Now, let's fill in the movie genres and transport methods:

- **Movie Genres**: Fantasy, Superhero, Western
- **Transport Methods**: Bike, Subway, Trike

From constraint 5, the person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is soccer or the person driving the trike. So, the person watching superhero movies must be the person driving the subway (since the person driving the trike cannot be in column 2).

- **Person driving the trike**: Column 1 (Fantasy)
- **Person driving the subway**: Column 2 (Superhero)
- **Person driving the bike**: Column 3 (Western)

Finally, the person whose sport is volleyball must be in column 1 (Fantasy).

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |       3       |
| Movie-Genre   |    Fantasy | Superhero |     Western   |
| Sport         |   Volleyball| Skateboarding | Soccer   |
| Transport     |     Bike    |   Subway   |     Trike    |

3. The person eating broccoli is not to the left of the person eating broccoli (this means the person eating broccoli must be in the middle position).
4. The person eating pepper is not to the right of the fan of techno.
5. The fan of techno is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
6. The person eating pepper is the fan of d&b.
7. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### From Clue 6:
- The person eating pepper is the fan of d&b.

#### From Clue 3:
- The person eating broccoli must be in the middle position (position 2).

#### From Clue 1 and Clue 5:
- Since the person who's sport is sailing is to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting and also to the right of the fan of techno, the only possible arrangement is:
  - Sailing (leftmost)
  - Techno (middle)
  - Weightlifting (rightmost)

#### From Clue 2:
- The fan of techno cannot be the person eating pepper (d&b) and cannot be the person who's sport is weightlifting. This leaves us with the person who's sport is sailing (since the fan of techno must be in the middle).

So, we have:
- Sport 1: Sailing
- Sport 2: Techno
- Sport 3: Weightlifting

#### From Clue 4:
- The person eating pepper (d&b) is not to the right of the fan of techno. Given that the fan of techno is in the middle, this is consistent.

#### From Clue 7:
- The person who's sport is sailing (Sport 1) is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli. Since the person eating broccoli is in position 2, this condition is satisfied.

#### From Clue 1 and Clue 5:
- The person who's sport is sailing (Sailing) is to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting (Weightlifting) and the fan of techno (Techno) is to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.

#### Final Assignment:
- **Sport 1 (leftmost):** Sailing
- **Sport 2 (middle):** Techno
- **Sport 3 (rightmost):** Weightlifting

Since the person eating broccoli must be in the middle (position 2), and we need to assign the remaining foods to the other positions, let's use the process of elimination:

- The person eating broccoli (position 2) can be either broccoli or cucumber (since it can't be pepper, which is the fan of d&b).

Since the person eating pepper (d&b) must be in the rightmost position (position 3), and the person eating broccoli must be in the middle, we can deduce the following:

- Position 1 (Sailing): Must be cucumber (since broccoli is in position 2 and pepper is in position 3).
- Position 2 (Techno): Must be broccoli.
- Position 3 (Weightlifting): Must be pepper.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |
| Food          | Cucumber| Broccoli      | Pepper   |
| Music-Genre   | Techno  | D&B           | Techno   |
| Sport         | Sailing | Weightlifting | Cycling  |
```

This solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv12-3x3-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given clues to deduce the final arrangement.

### Clue Breakdown:
1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the boat is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's sport is skateboarding.
2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the bike is not the fan of trance or the person driving the bike is not the person who's sport is skiing (or both).
3. **Clue 3**: The fan of trance and the person driving the boat have different parity positions.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- Boat driver is between Golf and Skateboarding.
- Possible sequences: 
  - Golf -> Boat -> Skateboarding
  - Skateboarding -> Boat -> Golf

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The person driving the bike is not the fan of trance or the person driving the bike is not the person who's sport is skiing.
- This means the person driving the bike cannot be the fan of trance and cannot be the person whose sport is skiing.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The fan of trance and the person driving the boat have different parity positions.
- This means if the boat driver is in an odd position, the fan of trance must be in an even position, and vice versa.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing.
- This means Reggae cannot be in position 3.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
- The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
- This means if the person with sport golf is in position 1 or 2, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 3.

### Combining All Clues:
- From Clue 1, we know the sequence for the boat is either Golf -> Boat -> Skateboarding or Skateboarding -> Boat -> Golf.
- From Clue 2, the bike cannot be driven by the fan of trance or the person whose sport is skiing.
- From Clue 3, the fan of trance and the boat driver must have different parity positions.
- From Clue 4, Reggae cannot be in position 3.
- From Clue 5, Golf must be to the left of the quad-bike driver.

### Possible Arrangements:
1. **Golf -> Boat -> Skateboarding**:
   - If the boat is in position 2, then Golf is in position 1 and Skateboarding is in position 3.
   - The fan of trance cannot be in position 2 (boat) because it would violate Clue 3.
   - Reggae cannot be in position 3, so Reggae must be in position 1 or 2.
   - If Reggae is in position 1, then Skiing must be in position 3 (since Reggae is to the left of Skiing), which violates Clue 1.
   - If Reggae is in position 2, then Skiing must be in position 3, and the fan of trance must be in position 3, which also violates Clue 3.

2. **Skateboarding -> Boat -> Golf**:
   - If the boat is in position 2, then Skateboarding is in position 1 and Golf is in position 3.
   - The fan of trance cannot be in position 2 (boat) because it would violate Clue 3.
   - Reggae cannot be in position 3, so Reggae must be in position 1 or 2.
   - If Reggae is in position 1, then Skiing must be in position 3 (since Reggae is to the left of Skiing), which is valid.
   - If Reggae is in position 2, then Skiing must be in position 3, and the fan of trance must be in position 3, which also violates Clue 3.

### Final Solution:
- Reggae is in position 1.
- Skiing is in position 3.
- Skateboarding is in position 1.
- Boat is in position 2.
- Golf is in position 3.
- The fan of trance is in position 3.

Thus, the final solution is:

Lv12-3x3-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the Indian.
2. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies.
3. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
4. The person who's sport is baseball is on the far left or far right.
5. The Russian is not the person watching romance movies or the Russian is not the person who's sport is baseball or both.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4:
- The person who's sport is baseball is on the far left or far right.
- This means the baseball player must be either in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 3:
- The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
- If the baseball player is in position 1, then the scientific movie watcher cannot be in position 2 (because there would be no space for the baseball player to be on the left).
- Therefore, the baseball player must be in position 3.
- The scientific movie watcher must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Scientific movies
- Position 3: Baseball

#### Clue 1:
- The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the Indian.
- Since the baseball player is in position 3, the water-polo player must be in position 2 and the Indian must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Scientific movies, Indian
- Position 2: Water-polo
- Position 3: Baseball

#### Clue 2:
- The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies.
- We already know that the person watching scientific movies is in position 1.
- Therefore, the person watching romance movies must be in position 2 or 3.
- But since position 2 is water-polo, the person watching romance movies must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Scientific movies, Indian
- Position 2: Water-polo
- Position 3: Romance movies, Baseball

#### Clue 5:
- The Russian is not the person watching romance movies or the Russian is not the person who's sport is baseball or both.
- Since the person watching romance movies is in position 3 and the sport is baseball, the Russian cannot be in position 3.
- Also, the Russian cannot be in position 1 or 2 because those positions are already occupied.
- Therefore, the Russian must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Scientific movies, Indian
- Position 2: Water-polo, Russian
- Position 3: Romance movies, Baseball

Lv12-3x3-10	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step using the given constraints:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Constraint 1:** The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the turkish.
2. **Constraint 2:** The journalist is the person who's hobby is card-games or the person who's hobby is card-games is the thai or both.
3. **Constraint 3:** The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
4. **Constraint 4:** The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (redundant with Constraint 3).
5. **Constraint 5:** The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the social-worker.
6. **Constraint 6:** The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the thai.
7. **Constraint 7:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is not the turkish or the chef is not the person who's hobby is filmmaking or both.
8. **Constraint 8:** The german is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

### Analyzing Constraints

#### From Constraint 6:
- The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the thai.

#### From Constraint 5:
- The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the social-worker.

Combining these two constraints:
- Thai must be in position 1 or 2.
- Card-games must be in position 2 or 3.
- Social-worker must be in position 1 or 2.

#### From Constraint 3 and 4:
- Social-worker is to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
- Therefore, if social-worker is in position 1, magic-tricks must be in position 2 or 3.
- If social-worker is in position 2, magic-tricks must be in position 3.

#### From Constraint 1:
- Magic-tricks must be next to the turkish.

#### From Constraint 2:
- Journalist can either be the one with card-games or the thai.

#### From Constraint 7:
- Filmmaking cannot be the turkish, and if the chef has filmmaking, then the chef cannot be the turkish.

#### From Constraint 8:
- German cannot be to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

### Possible Arrangements

Let's test possible positions for Thai, Card-games, and Social-worker:

1. **Thai in Position 1:**
   - Social-worker in Position 2 (since Thai is in 1)
   - Magic-tricks must be in Position 3 (since Thai is in 1 and Magic-tricks must be next to Turkish)

2. **Card-games in Position 2 (right of Thai):**
   - This conflicts with Social-worker being in Position 2, so Thai must be in Position 2.

3. **Thai in Position 2:**
   - Social-worker in Position 1 (since Thai is in 2 and Social-worker must be to the left of Magic-tricks)
   - Magic-tricks must be in Position 3 (since Thai is in 2 and Magic-tricks must be next to Turkish)

4. **Card-games in Position 3 (right of Thai):**
   - Thai in Position 1, Social-worker in Position 2, Magic-tricks in Position 3.

Now let's fit the remaining roles and hobbies:

- **Turkish** must be in Position 3 (since Magic-tricks is there and Thai is in Position 1).

### Final Solution

Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can place the elements as follows:

|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Hobby         |   Filmmaking  |  Card-games  | Magic-tricks |
| Job           |    Chef       |  Journalist  |  Social-worker |
| Nationality   |     Thai      |    German    |    Turkish  |

### Final Table
