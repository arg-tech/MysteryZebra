Lv12-4x5-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the relationships step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 20:** The person drinking milk is in the middle (position 3).
   - Beverage: Milk -> Position 3

2. **Clue 19:** The person drinking milk is between the fan hip-hop and the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - This means the fan hip-hop and the person who's hobby is card-games must be in positions 2 and 4 respectively, with the person drinking milk in position 3.

3. **Clue 11:** The owner of the fish is not the person drinking almond-milk or the person drinking almond-milk is not the fan punk or both.
   - This means if the person drinking almond-milk is not the fan punk, then the owner of the fish cannot be the person drinking almond-milk.
   - Since the person drinking milk is in position 3, let's consider the fan hip-hop and card-games positions:
     - Fan hip-hop: Position 2
     - Person who's hobby is card-games: Position 4

4. **Clue 18:** The person who's hobby is gardening is the fan soul or the person who's hobby is gardening is the owner of the fish or both.
   - Since the owner of the fish cannot be the person drinking almond-milk (from Clue 11), it can only be the person who's hobby is gardening.

5. **Clue 21:** The person who's hobby is gardening is the fan soul or the person who's hobby is gardening is the owner of the fish or both.
   - From the previous deduction, the owner of the fish has the hobby of gardening.

6. **Clue 8:** The owner of the fish is the fan punk.
   - Therefore, the person who's hobby is gardening is the fan soul.

7. **Clue 4:** The fan hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
   - Since fan hip-hop is in position 2, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in position 4 (which is already occupied by the person who's hobby is card-games).

8. **Clue 5:** The fan classical is not the owner of the frog.
   - The fan classical is in position 1.

9. **Clue 6:** The fan classical is not to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2 (fan hip-hop) or 3 (milk). Since fan hip-hop is in position 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 3 (milk).

10. **Clue 17:** The person who's hobby is card-games and the fan dubstep have different parity positions.
    - Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 4, the fan dubstep must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

11. **Clue 10:** The fan dubstep is somewhere to the left of the owner of the horse.
    - Since the fan dubstep is in position 1, the owner of the horse must be in position 3 or 4. But since position 3 is occupied by the person drinking milk, the owner of the horse must be in position 4.

12. **Clue 7:** The owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is board-games or the fan classical is the owner of the bird, but not both.
    - Since the fan classical is in position 1, the owner of the bird must be the person who's hobby is board-games.

13. **Clue 9:** The owner of the frog is on the left of the owner of the fish.
    - Since the owner of the fish is in position 4, the owner of the frog must be in position 1 or 2. But the fan classical is in position 1, so the owner of the frog must be in position 2.

14. **Clue 12:** The person drinking almond-milk is not to the right of the owner of the frog.
    - Since the owner of the frog is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is occupied by the fan classical, so the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3.

15. **Clue 3:** The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish.
    - Since the person drinking milk is in position 3 and the owner of the fish is in position 4, this is consistent.

16. **Clue 16:** The owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade.
    - Since the owner of the fish is in position 4, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But positions 1 and 2 are occupied, so the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3 (already occupied by milk). This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

Re-evaluating the positions, we find that the correct arrangement is:

|               |      1      |       2       |     3     |    4     |     5      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Lemonade      | Milk      | Hot-chocolate |              |
| Hobby         | Board-games | Card-games    | Filmmaking | Gardening   |              |
| Music-Genre   | Classical   | Dubstep       | Hip-hop   | Soul        |              |
| Pet           | Bird        | Frog          | Turtle    | Fish        | Horse        |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |       2       |     3     |    4     |     5      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Lemonade      | Milk      | Hot-chocolate |              |
| Hobby         | Board-games | Card-games    | Filmmaking | Gardening   |              |

22. **The person whose hobby is Board-Games is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is Basketball.**
23. **The fan of Blues is somewhere to the left of the Mexican.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From constraint 6:** The person whose hobby is Board-Games is on the far left (position 1) or far right (position 5).
2. **From constraint 2:** The Dutch must be somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is Rowing.
3. **From constraint 19:** The fan of Blues is between the Dutch and the person whose hobby is Board-Games. Since the Dutch must be to the right of the person whose sport is Rowing, and the person whose hobby is Board-Games is either at position 1 or 5, the only viable placement for the Dutch is position 4, making the person whose hobby is Board-Games at position 1.
4. **From constraint 18:** The Argentine is the fan of Dubstep or the Argentine is the person whose hobby is Magic-Tricks. Since the person whose hobby is Board-Games is at position 1, the Argentine cannot be at position 1. Thus, the Argentine could be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
5. **From constraint 10:** The person whose hobby is Gardening is not the Argentine or the Argentine is not the person whose sport is Volleyball. This means the Argentine is not at position 4 (Volleyball), so the Argentine can be at positions 2, 3, or 5.
6. **From constraint 1:** The Argentine is not the fan of Blues. So, the fan of Blues must be at position 2, 3, or 5.
7. **From constraint 13:** The fan of Metal is on the left or right of the Dutch (position 4). Therefore, the fan of Metal must be at position 3.
8. **From constraint 3:** The person whose hobby is Gardening is somewhere between the fan of Blues and the person whose sport is Swimming. If the fan of Blues is at position 2, the person whose sport is Swimming must be at position 5.
9. **From constraint 4:** The person whose sport is Swimming (position 5) is to the right of the person whose sport is Volleyball. This means the person whose sport is Volleyball must be at position 3.
10. **From constraint 11:** The person whose hobby is Camping is on the right of the fan of Metal (position 3). Therefore, the person whose hobby is Camping must be at position 5.
11. **From constraint 12:** The person whose sport is Basketball is to the left of the fan of Dubstep. Since the Argentine is not at position 4, and the fan of Dubstep must be at position 5, the person whose sport is Basketball must be at position 1 (Board-Games).
12. **From constraint 17:** The person whose sport is Swimming (position 5) and the fan of Dubstep (position 5) have different parity positions. This is already satisfied as both are at position 5.
13. **From constraint 14:** The Nigerian is somewhere between the fan of Techno and the fan of Ambient. Since the fan of Dubstep is at position 5, the Nigerian must be at position 3 (Metal) or 4 (Blues).
14. **From constraint 5:** The Nigerian is between the fan of Ambient and the fan of Dubstep. Therefore, the Nigerian must be at position 3 (Metal).
15. **From constraint 16:** The Mexican is not to the right of the person whose sport is Skiing. Therefore, the Mexican must be at position 1 (Board-Games) or 2 (Blues).
16. **From constraint 21:** The person whose sport is Skiing is on the right of the fan of Metal (position 3). Therefore, the person whose sport is Skiing must be at position 4 (Blues).
17. **From constraint 16:** The Mexican is not to the right of the person whose sport is Skiing. Therefore, the Mexican must be at position 1 (Board-Games).
18. **From constraint 1:** The Argentine is not the fan of Blues or the Argentine is not the person whose sport is Volleyball. Since the person whose sport is Volleyball is at position 3, the Argentine must be at position 2 (Gardening).
19. **From constraint 22:** The person whose hobby is Board-Games is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is Basketball. This is already satisfied as the person whose hobby is Board-Games is at position 1.
20. **From constraint 23:** The fan of Blues is somewhere to the left of the Mexican. Since the Mexican is at position 1 and the fan of Blues is at position 2, this is satisfied.
21. **From constraint 15:** The person whose hobby is Woodworking is on the left of the fan of Ambient. Since the fan of Ambient is at position 4, the person whose hobby is Woodworking must be at position 1 (Board-Games).

Lv12-4x5-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

1. **The person eating watermelon is on the far left.**
   - This means the first column is for watermelon.

2. **The australian is on the far left or far right.**
   - Since the first column is already occupied by watermelon, the australian must be in the last column (column 5).

3. **The electrician is in the middle.**
   - This places the electrician in column 3.

4. **The electrician and the australian have the same parity positions.**
   - Since the electrician is in column 3 (odd position) and the australian is in column 5 (also odd position), this constraint is satisfied.

5. **The electrician is not to the left of the freelancer.**
   - The electrician is in column 3, so the freelancer must be in column 4 or 5.

6. **The electrician and the person eating grapefruit have different parity positions.**
   - The electrician is in an odd position, so the person eating grapefruit must be in an even position (column 2 or 4).

7. **The person eating cucumber is on the left of the owner of the rat.**
   - This means the cucumber eater is to the left of the rat owner.

8. **The person eating cucumber is on the right of the person eating grapefruit.**
   - Combining with the previous constraint, the cucumber eater must be in column 4 and the grapefruit eater in column 2.

9. **The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the left of the engineer.**
   - This means the engineer cannot be in column 1, and since cucumber is in column 4, the engineer must be in column 5.

10. **The owner of the rat is not to the right of the chinese.**
    - The rat owner must be in columns 1, 2, or 3.

11. **The freelancer and the person eating lime have the same parity positions.**
    - The freelancer can be in column 4 or 5, and the lime eater must be in column 2 or 4.

12. **The electrician and the person eating grapefruit have different parity positions.**
    - The electrician is in column 3, so the grapefruit eater must be in column 2 or 4.

13. **The person eating lime is not the electrician or the freelancer.**
    - So, the lime eater must be in column 2 or 4.

14. **The owner of the dog is not to the left of the engineer.**
    - The engineer is in column 5, so the dog owner must be in column 4 or 5.

    - The cat owner must be in column 4, and the italian and the engineer must be in columns 3 and 5 respectively.

16. **The electrician is not to the left of the freelancer.**
    - The electrician is in column 3, so the freelancer must be in column 4 or 5.

17. **The owner of the dog and the lawyer have the same parity positions.**
    - The dog owner and the lawyer must be in the same column (both even or both odd).

18. **The person eating grapefruit is not to the right of the electrician.**
    - The grapefruit eater must be in column 2.

19. **The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the police-officer.**
    - The hedgehog owner must be in column 4 or 5, and the police-officer must be in column 3 or 2.

20. **The owner of the cat is between the italian and the engineer.**
    - The cat owner is in column 4, the italian in column 3, and the engineer in column 5.

Now let's fill in the table based on these deductions:

- The engineer is in column 5 (already placed).
- The cucumber eater is in column 4.
- The grapefruit eater is in column 2.

- The chinchilla owner is in column 2.
- The dog owner is in column 4.
- The cat owner is in column 4.
- The hedgehog owner is in column 5.
- The lawyer must be in column 4 (same parity as the dog owner).

Lv12-4x5-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step 1: Analyze Constraints and Place Known Values

1. **Constraint 19**: The person who's hobby is baking is the person watching documentary movies.
   - This means the 5th position has baking as the hobby and documentary as the movie genre.

2. **Constraint 20**: The Chinese is on the left of the Egyptian.
   - This means the Chinese cannot be in the 5th position, and the Egyptian cannot be in the 1st position.

3. **Constraint 22**: The person who's hobby is chess is not to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - Since baking is in the 5th position, chess must be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

4. **Constraint 23**: The American is in the middle (3rd position).
   - This means the American is in the 3rd position.

5. **Constraint 21**: The person who's hobby is fishing is the Argentine.
   - This means the 2nd position has fishing as the hobby and the Argentine nationality.

6. **Constraint 14**: The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
   - Since fishing is in the 2nd position, singing must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 4th position.

### Step 2: Place Known Values in the Table

|               |      1       |    2     |    3     |     4     |      5      |
| Hobby         | chess        | fishing  | american | singing   | baking      |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure    | epic     |         |          | documentary |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |          |           |             |
| Nationality   | chinese      | argentine|         |          | egyptian    |

### Step 3: Use Remaining Constraints to Fill in the Rest

7. **Constraint 1**: The fan disco is somewhere to the right of the egyptian.
   - Since the Egyptian is in the 5th position, the fan disco must be in the 4th or 1st position.

8. **Constraint 7**: The fan dubstep is on the left or right of the argentine.
   - Since the Argentine is in the 2nd position, the fan dubstep can be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.

9. **Constraint 4**: The fan pop is somewhere to the left of the fan punk.
   - This means the fan pop must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position, and the fan punk must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

10. **Constraint 10**: The person watching musical movies is not to the left of the fan punk.
    - This means the fan punk cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position if the person watching musical movies is in those positions.

11. **Constraint 12**: The person watching musical movies is not to the left of the fan punk.
    - Similar to the previous constraint, this restricts the positions of the fan musical and fan punk.

12. **Constraint 15**: The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the fan disco.
    - Since fishing is in the 2nd position, the fan disco must be in the 1st or 3rd position.

13. **Constraint 16**: The Argentine is somewhere between the dutch and the fan disco.
    - This means the Argentine must be in the 2nd position (which it already is), and the fan disco must be in the 1st or 3rd position.

14. **Constraint 17**: The person who's hobby is chess is not to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
    - Since baking is in the 5th position, chess must be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

15. **Constraint 18**: The person who's hobby is chess is not to the left of the fan punk.
    - This means the fan punk cannot be in the 1st position if chess is in the 1st position.

16. **Constraint 24**: The person who's hobby is chess is not to the left of the fan punk.
    - Similar to the previous constraint.

Based on these constraints, we can deduce:

- The fan disco must be in the 3rd position.
- The fan punk must be in the 4th position.
- The fan pop must be in the 1st position.
- The fan musical must be in the 2nd position.
