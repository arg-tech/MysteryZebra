   - This implies that if the electrician does not have a hobby of dancing, then the person with a hobby of dancing is not watching comedy movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's start by placing some basic constraints and then refine them based on the clues.

#### Step 1: Initial Placement Based on Parity (Clue 6)
- Cola and Snowmobile must be in different parity positions (odd/even).

#### Step 2: Initial Placement Based on Clues 1, 4, and 7
- From Clue 1: [Horror, Gardening, Boat] or [Boat, Gardening, Horror]
- From Clue 4: [Boat, Electrician, Architect] or [Architect, Electrician, Boat]
- From Clue 7: Electrician = Hiking or Electrician = Helicopter or both.

Let's try:
- [Boat, Electrician, Architect] and Gardening is between Horror and Boat.

So, possible orders for Clue 1 are:
- [Horror, Gardening, Boat, Electrician, Architect]
- [Boat, Gardening, Horror, Electrician, Architect]

#### Step 3: Refine with Clue 2
- The person watching comedy movies is not to the right of the electrician.

This means:
- If [Boat, Gardening, Horror, Electrician, Architect], then the person watching comedy cannot be in position 4 or 5.
- If [Horror, Gardening, Boat, Electrician, Architect], then the person watching comedy cannot be in position 4 or 5.

#### Step 4: Refine with Clue 3
- The person drinking mirinda is not to the right of the person driving the helicopter.

This means:
- If [Boat, Gardening, Horror, Electrician, Architect], then Helicopter must be before Mirinda.
- If [Horror, Gardening, Boat, Electrician, Architect], then Helicopter must be before Mirinda.

#### Step 5: Refine with Clue 5
- The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.

This means:
- If [Boat, Gardening, Horror, Electrician, Architect], then Hiking must be before Comedy.
- If [Horror, Gardening, Boat, Electrician, Architect], then Hiking must be before Comedy.

#### Step 6: Refine with Clue 8
- The person watching horror movies is the project-manager or the project-manager is the person drinking mirinda, but not both.

This means:
- If [Boat, Gardening, Horror, Electrician, Architect], then Horror cannot be Project-Manager and Project-Manager cannot drink Mirinda.
- If [Horror, Gardening, Boat, Electrician, Architect], then Horror cannot be Project-Manager and Project-Manager cannot drink Mirinda.

#### Step 7: Refine with Clue 9
- The electrician is not the person who's hobby is dancing or the person who's hobby is dancing is not the person watching comedy movies or both.

This means:
- If [Boat, Gardening, Horror, Electrician, Architect], then Dancing ≠ Electrician and Dancing ≠ Comedy.
- If [Horror, Gardening, Boat, Electrician, Architect], then Dancing ≠ Electrician and Dancing ≠ Comedy.

2. **Position 3 (rightmost)**:
   - Indonesian (clue 6).

3. **Position 2**:
   - Cannot be the Indonesian (clue 6), so it can be the fisherman or the coach.
   - Fisherman is in an odd position (clue 11), so the fisherman must be in position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is taken by the bird owner, the fisherman must be in position 3, which contradicts clue 6. Therefore, the fisherman must be in position 1, and the coach must be in position 3.

4. **Position 3 (rightmost)**:
   - Indonesian (from previous steps).

5. **Position 2 (middle)**:
   - Must be the coach (from previous steps).

9. **Lizard owner**:
   - Canadian (from previous steps).

10. **Turtle owner**:
    - From clue 4, the owner of the turtle is not the person watching crime movies. The person watching crime movies cannot be the Canadian (owner of the lizard), the Indonesian (position 3), or the coach (position 3). The only remaining person is the fisherman (position 1).

    - The person driving the jet-ski is the Thai (position 3).
    - The person driving the skateboard is the Canadian (position 1).
    - The person driving the scooter is the software-developer (position 2).

- This means the order must be: fan of dubstep -> fan of indie -> owner of the fish.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 6
- The Brazilian is the fan of indie or the Brazilian is the owner of the cat, but not both.
- Since the fan of indie and the Brazilian have the same parity positions (Clue 8), the Brazilian must be the fan of indie.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 2

2. **Clue 10:** The fan of blues is not the person driving the trike.

3. **Clue 14:** The owner of the mouse is on the left of the fan of blues.

So, the owner of the mouse must be in cell 1.

4. **Clue 11:** The fan of folk is on the left or right of the dancer.

Since the fan of blues is in cell 2, the fan of folk cannot be in cell 1 (owner of the mouse), so it must be in cell 3.

5. **Clue 12:** The person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.

6. **Clue 15:** The person driving the bus is the owner of the fish or the dancer is the person driving the bus, but not both.

7. **Clue 1:** The dancer is on the right of the person driving the roller.

8. **Clue 13:** The person driving the roller is not the person watching horror movies.

9. **Clue 5:** The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the fan of folk.

So, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in cell 3.

10. **Clue 7:** The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.

Since the owner of the mouse is in cell 1, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in cell 3.

11. **Clue 3:** The fan of blues is not to the left of the person driving the bus.

Since the fan of blues is in cell 2, the person driving the bus must be in cell 1.

12. **Clue 4:** The architect is not to the right of the fan of blues.

So, the architect cannot be in cell 3.

13. **Clue 9:** The fan of blues is not the person watching family movies or the person watching family movies is not the person driving the bus or both.

Since the fan of blues is in cell 2, the person watching family movies cannot be in cell 2.

14. **Clue 2:** The person watching family movies is not to the left of the owner of the mouse.

Since the owner of the mouse is in cell 1, the person watching family movies must be in cell 3.

15. **Clue 8:** The person driving the trike is not to the right of the person driving the trike (redundant).

### Final Placement:

From the above steps, we can deduce the following:

- **Dancer** is in cell 3 (right of the person driving the roller).
- **Fan of blues** is in cell 2.
- **Owner of the mouse** is in cell 1.
- **Person watching martial-arts movies** is in cell 3.
- **Person driving the bus** is in cell 1.
- **Person watching family movies** is in cell 3.
- **Architect** is in cell 1.

Now, let's place the remaining categories:

- **Job**: Architect is in cell 1, Dancer is in cell 3.
- **Movie-Genre**: Family in cell 3, Martial-arts in cell 3.
- **Music-Genre**: Folk in cell 3.
- **Pet**: Mouse in cell 1, Fish in cell 3.
- **Transport**: Bus in cell 1, Trike in cell 3.

Thus, the final solution is:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is baking and the person driving the boat have different parity positions**:
   - This means one is in an odd position (1 or 3) and the other in an even position (2).

2. **The person watching documentary movies is not the chef or the person watching documentary movies is not the person who's hobby is magic-tricks or both**:
   - This is a tautology, so it doesn't provide new information.

3. **The chef is somewhere to the right of the accountant**:
   - This means the accountant must be in a position to the left of the chef.

4. **The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person watching epic movies**:
   - This means the documentary movie watcher is in position 2 or 3, and the epic movie watcher is in position 1 or 2.

   - The person driving the train is neither drinking tea nor watching epic movies.

9. **The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the person drinking hot-chocolate or the person watching documentary movies is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, but not both**:
   - One of these must be true, but not both.

10. **The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not the person watching epic movies or the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not the person drinking tea or both**:
    - The person with the hobby of magic-tricks is neither watching epic movies nor drinking tea.

11. **The accountant is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks**:
    - The accountant cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is in position 3.

12. **The chef is not to the right of the person watching epic movies**:
    - The chef must be in position 1 or 2 if the person watching epic movies is in position 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's start placing the information based on the clues:

1. **Clue 3**: The chef is to the right of the accountant.
2. **Clue 6**: The person driving the boat is to the left of the journalist.
3. **Clue 7**: The accountant drives the bus or drinks tea.

9. **Clue 11**: The accountant is not to the left of the person with the hobby of magic-tricks.
10. **Clue 12**: The chef is not to the right of the person watching epic movies.

From these, let's start filling in the table:

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
|-------------- |-------------- |-------- |------------ |
| Beverage     |               |         |             |
| Hobby        |               |         |             |
| Job          |               |         |             |
| Movie-Genre  |               |         |             |
| Transport    |               |         |             |

Let's assume the accountant is in position 1 and drives the bus (from clue 7):

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
|-------------- |-------------- |-------- |------------ |
| Beverage     |               |         |             |
| Hobby        |               |         |             |
| Job          | accountant   |         |             |
| Movie-Genre  |               |         |             |
| Transport    | bus           |         |             |

Since the chef is to the right of the accountant (clue 3), the chef could be in position 2 or 3. But from clue 12, the chef is not to the right of the person watching epic movies, so the chef must be in position 2.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
|-------------- |-------------- |-------- |------------ |
| Beverage     |               |         |             |
| Hobby        |               |         |             |
| Job          | accountant   | chef    |             |
| Movie-Genre  |               |         |             |
| Transport    | bus           |         |             |

The person driving the boat is to the left of the journalist (clue 6). Since the accountant is driving the bus, the person driving the boat must be in position 1 or 2. Given the accountant is in position 1, the boat driver must be in position 2.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
|-------------- |-------------- |-------- |------------ |
| Beverage     |               |         |             |
| Hobby        |               |         |             |
| Job          | accountant   | chef    |             |
| Movie-Genre  |               |         |             |
| Transport    | bus           | boat    |             |

The documentary movie watcher is to the right of the epic movie watcher (clue 4), so the documentary watcher is in position 2 or 3, and the epic watcher is in position 1 or 2. Since the accountant is in position 1 and the boat driver is in position 2, the epic watcher must be in position 1, and the documentary watcher in position 3.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |

| Movie-Genre  | epic          |         | documentary |
| Transport    | bus           | boat    |             |

Now, using clue 5, the person drinking tea is not to the left of the person with the hobby of baking. So the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 2 or 3, and the person drinking tea in position 3 or 1. Since the person with the hobby of baking is in position 2, the person drinking tea must be in position 3.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
|-------------- |-------------- |-------- |------------ |
| Beverage     | tea           |         |             |
| Hobby        | baking        |         |             |
| Job          | accountant   | chef    |             |
| Movie-Genre  | epic          |         | documentary |
| Transport    | bus           | boat    |             |

Using clue 9, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks drinks hot-chocolate or watches documentary movies, but not both. Since the documentary watcher is in position 3, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must drink hot-chocolate.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
|-------------- |-------------- |-------- |------------ |
| Beverage     | tea           |         | hot-chocolate |
| Hobby        | baking        |         | magic-tricks |

| Transport    | bus           | boat    |             |

The person who drinks tea is the accountant (clue 7), so the accountant drinks tea.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
|-------------- |-------------- |-------- |------------ |

| Transport    | bus           | boat    |             |

The person who drinks hot-chocolate has the hobby of magic-tricks (clue 9).

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
|-------------- |-------------- |-------- |------------ |

9. **Clue 9**: The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
10. **Clue 10**: The person drinking iced-tea is in an even position.
11. **Clue 11**: The person eating carrot is on the left of the Brazilian.
12. **Clue 12**: The person driving the bus is the Brazilian or the person driving the bus is the person watching martial-arts movies or both.

### Step 2: Deductions from Clues

From Clue 10, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2 (even position).

From Clue 3, since the Brazilian is to the right of the person watching disaster movies, the Brazilian cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 1, and the Brazilian must be in position 2 or 3.

From Clue 7, the person watching disaster movies is to the left of the Japanese, so the Japanese must be in position 3.

From Clue 9, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching disaster movies, which means the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 1. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 1, this means the person driving the jet-ski must be the person watching disaster movies.

From Clue 1, if the person watching martial-arts movies is the person eating mango, then the person watching martial-arts movies can't be the person drinking iced-tea. If the person watching martial-arts movies is the person drinking iced-tea, then the person eating mango can be anyone.

From Clue 2, if the person watching thriller movies is not the person drinking iced-tea, then the person eating mango cannot be the person watching thriller movies. So, the person drinking iced-tea must be the person watching thriller movies.

From Clue 4, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1 or 3.

From Clue 5, the person eating mango is not to the left of the person driving the car. Since the person driving the jet-ski (disaster movies) is in position 1, the person eating mango must be in position 3.

From Clue 6, the person driving the jet-ski is the person drinking cola or the person drinking cola is the person eating cauliflower. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 1, the person drinking cola must be in position 1, which is the person driving the jet-ski.

From Clue 8, the person drinking soy-milk is the Mexican or the person drinking soy-milk is the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the person eating mango is in position 3, the person drinking soy-milk must be the Mexican.

From Clue 11, the person eating carrot is on the left of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian is in position 2, the person eating carrot must be in position 1.

From Clue 12, the person driving the bus is the Brazilian or the person driving the bus is the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the Brazilian is in position 2, the person driving the bus is the Brazilian.

2. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person driving the train.
3. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is dancing.
4. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person driving the train.
5. The person driving the snowmobile is the person drinking water.
6. The person drinking sprite is not the fan of funk or the person drinking sprite is not the person whose hobby is filmmaking (or both).

10. The person eating lettuce is on the left of the person driving the train.
11. The fan of disco is on the left of the fan of indie.
12. The fan of funk is not to the right of the person eating banana.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The person driving the snowmobile is the person drinking water.
   - Let's denote the person driving the snowmobile as \( W \).

2. **Clue 4 & 8**: The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person driving the train, and the person whose hobby is dancing is on the left of the person drinking water.
   - Since \( W \) is the person drinking water, the person driving the train must be either in position 1 or 2, and the person whose hobby is dancing must be in position 1 or 2 as well.

3. **Clue 2**: The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person driving the train.
   - If the person driving the train is in position 1, then the person whose hobby is filmmaking must be in position 3.
   - If the person driving the train is in position 2, then the person whose hobby is filmmaking must be in position 3.

4. **Clue 3**: The person driving the snowmobile (drinking water) is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is dancing.
   - Since \( W \) is in position 3 (from Clue 5), the person whose hobby is dancing must be in position 1 or 2.

5. **Clue 1**: The person whose hobby is filmmaking is not to the left of the person whose hobby is dancing.
   - This confirms that the person whose hobby is dancing must be in position 2 if the person driving the train is in position 1, and in position 1 if the person driving the train is in position 2.

6. **Clue 10**: The person eating lettuce is on the left of the person driving the train.
   - If the person driving the train is in position 1, then the person eating lettuce must be in position 1 or 2.
   - If the person driving the train is in position 2, then the person eating lettuce must be in position 1.

7. **Clue 9**: The person eating banana is not to the right of the fan of funk.
   - This means the person eating banana cannot be in position 3 if the fan of funk is in position 2 or 3.

8. **Clue 11**: The fan of disco is on the left of the fan of indie.
   - This means the fan of disco must be in position 1 or 2, and the fan of indie must be in position 2 or 3.

9. **Clue 6**: The person drinking sprite is not the fan of funk or the person drinking sprite is not the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
   - This means the person drinking sprite can't be the fan of funk and can't be the person whose hobby is filmmaking.

10. **Clue 7**: The person whose hobby is card-games and the person drinking lemonade have the same parity positions.
    - This means they must be in the same odd or even position.

11. **Clue 12**: The fan of funk is not to the right of the person eating banana.
    - This means the fan of funk cannot be in position 3 if the person eating banana is in position 2.

### Final Configuration:

- Position 1: Person eating lettuce, hobby = card-games (odd position)
- Position 2: Person whose hobby is dancing, drinking sprite (even position)
- Position 3: Person whose hobby is filmmaking, drinking water (odd position)

Given these constraints, let's fill in the remaining details:

- The person driving the train is in position 2 (since the person whose hobby is dancing is in position 2 and the person drinking water is in position 3).
- The person eating lettuce is in position 1.
- The person eating banana is in position 3 (not to the right of the fan of funk).

Now we assign the specific items:

- Position 1: Person eating lettuce, hobby = card-games, drinking lemonade
- Position 2: Person whose hobby is dancing, drinking sprite
- Position 3: Person whose hobby is filmmaking, drinking water

Assigning the remaining items:

- Position 1: Person eating lettuce, hobby = card-games, drinking lemonade
- Position 2: Person whose hobby is dancing, drinking sprite, genre = disco
- Position 3: Person whose hobby is filmmaking, drinking water, genre = indie

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | lemonade   | sprite    | water     |
| Food          | lettuce    | banana    | blueberry |
| Hobby         | card-games | dancing   | filmmaking|
| Music-Genre   | disco      | funk      | indie     |
| Transport     | jet-ski    | snowmobile| train    |
