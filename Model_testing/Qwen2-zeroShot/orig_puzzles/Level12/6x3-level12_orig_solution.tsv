15. **The person whose hobby is reading is somewhere to the right of the Canadian.**
    - This means if the Canadian is in position 1, the person whose hobby is reading must be in position 2 or 3.

### Solving the Puzzle

Let's start placing the information based on the clues:

1. **Clue 11**: The person drinking mirinda is in an even position (2 or 3).
2. **Clue 12**: The person drinking mirinda is not the person whose hobby is reading.
3. **Clue 1**: Since the person drinking lemonade is to the left of the person drinking mirinda, and mirinda is in an even position, lemonade must be in position 1.
4. **Clue 8**: The fan of dubstep is to the right of the person whose sport is handball. This means the fan of dubstep cannot be in position 1.
5. **Clue 10**: The person driving the ship is not to the right of the person whose sport is handball.
6. **Clue 5**: The French and the person whose hobby is reading have the same parity positions.
7. **Clue 6**: The French and the person driving the ship have the same parity positions.
8. **Clue 3**: The person whose hobby is filmmaking and the Canadian have different parity positions.
9. **Clue 7**: The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is singing.
10. **Clue 14**: The Russian is the person driving the van or the person drinking mirinda or both.
11. **Clue 15**: The person whose hobby is reading is to the right of the Canadian.

14. **Clue 2**: The person driving the van and the fan of dubstep have the same parity positions.
15. **Clue 13**: The person whose sport is parkour is on the left of the fan of d&b.

By analyzing these clues, we can determine the following:

- Position 1: Lemonade (since it is to the left of Mirinda)
- Position 2: Mirinda (since it is in an even position and not reading)
- Position 3: Soy-Milk (since lemonade and mirinda are taken)

From here, we can further deduce:

- The person driving the ship is in position 1 (since they are not to the right of the person whose sport is handball).
- The French person is in position 2 (since they have the same parity as the person driving the ship).
- The person whose hobby is reading is in position 3 (since the French person is in position 2 and has the same parity).

We can continue this process for all the other clues until we have a complete table:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | Lemonade | Mirinda    | Soy-Milk   |
| Hobby         | Handball | Reading    | Singing    |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep  | Folk       | D&B        |
| Nationality   | Russian  | French     | Canadian   |
| Sport         | Soccer   | Filmmaking | Parkour    |
| Transport     | Ship     | Skateboard | Van        |
```

This is the final solution table."
Lv12-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step 1: List all the given information and constraints:

1. The person whose sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person driving the taxi.
2. The person whose sport is cricket is not to the left of the person watching drama movies.
3. The Egyptian is to the left of the Dutch.
4. The person whose sport is cricket is not the fan of salsa or the person whose sport is cricket is not the person watching drama movies, or both.
5. The Indian is the fan of rock.
6. The fan of rock is not the person watching thriller movies.
7. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person whose sport is golf.
8. The fan of gospel is on the right of the fan of salsa.
9. The fan of gospel is not to the right of the Dutch.
10. The person whose hobby is reading is on the far right.
11. The person whose sport is climbing is not the Indian or the person watching drama movies is not the person whose sport is climbing, or both.
12. The person whose hobby is reading and the person driving the taxi have different parity positions (one is odd, one is even).
13. The person watching romance movies is the Egyptian.
14. The person whose hobby is hiking is not to the right of the person watching drama movies.
15. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person driving the ship.
16. The person whose hobby is hiking is the person watching romance movies or the person whose hobby is hiking is the person whose sport is cricket, but not both.
17. The fan of rock is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies.

### Step 2: Deduce the positions and preferences based on the constraints:

1. **Positioning of Reading**: From constraint 10, the person with the hobby of reading must be in position 3 (the far right).

2. **Sport Cricket and Taxi**: From constraint 1, the person whose sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person driving the taxi. Since the person driving the taxi can't be in position 3 (reading), the taxi driver must be in position 1 or 2. Also, from constraint 2, the person whose sport is cricket cannot be to the left of the person watching drama movies.

3. **Hobby Rock Climbing and Ship**: From constraint 15, the person with the hobby of rock climbing is on the right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship can't be in position 3 (reading), the ship driver must be in position 1 or 2, and the rock climber must be in position 2 or 3. But since reading is in position 3, the rock climber must be in position 2 and the ship driver in position 1.

4. **Indian and Fan Rock**: From constraint 5, the Indian is the fan of rock. From constraint 6, the fan of rock is not the person watching thriller movies. So the Indian cannot watch thriller movies.

5. **Fan Gospel and Salsa**: From constraint 8, the fan of gospel is on the right of the fan of salsa. Since the Indian is the fan of rock, and the fan of rock is not the person watching thriller movies, the Indian must be in position 2 (rock climbing) and the fan of gospel in position 3 (reading).

6. **Dutch and Egyptian**: From constraint 3, the Egyptian is to the left of the Dutch. Since the Egyptian is watching romance movies (constraint 13), and the Dutch cannot be in position 3 (reading), the Dutch must be in position 3, and the Egyptian in position 1 or 2. Given that the Indian is in position 2, the Egyptian must be in position 1.

7. **Sport Climbing and Drama Movies**: From constraint 11, the person whose sport is climbing is not the Indian or the person watching drama movies is not the person whose sport is climbing, or both. Since the Indian is rock climbing, the person watching drama movies cannot be climbing. From constraint 14, the person whose hobby is hiking is not to the right of the person watching drama movies. So the person watching drama movies must be in position 1 (Egyptian). Therefore, the person with the hobby of hiking must be in position 2 (rock climbing).

8. **Golf and Thriller Movies**: From constraint 7, the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person whose sport is golf. Since the rock climber is in position 2, the golfer must be in position 1 or 3. From constraint 17, the fan of rock is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the Indian is the fan of rock and the person watching thriller movies cannot be the golfer, the golfer must be in position 1.

9. **Sport Climbing and Drama Movies**: From constraint 16, the person whose hobby is hiking is the person watching romance movies or the person whose hobby is hiking is the person whose sport is cricket, but not both. Since the person watching romance movies is the Egyptian (constraint 13), the person whose hobby is hiking must be the person whose sport is cricket.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |
| Hobby         | Hiking  | Rock Climbing | Reading  |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance | Thriller      | Drama    |
| Music-Genre   | Gospel  | Rock          | Salsa    |
| Nationality   | Egyptian| Dutch         | Indian   |
| Sport         | Cricket | Golf          | Climbing |
| Transport     | Ship    | Taxi          | Bike     |

Lv12-6x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding elements into the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking milk and the fan of funk have the same parity positions.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking lemonade and the person eating cherry have the same parity positions.
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching adventure movies is the person eating cherry.
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person watching family movies.
5. **Clue 5:** The person watching family movies is somewhere between the paramedic and the person watching adventure movies.
6. **Clue 6:** The person watching family movies is not to the right of the person drinking milk.
7. **Clue 7:** The person eating radish is not to the right of the fan of funk.
8. **Clue 8:** The person eating cherry is somewhere to the left of the person eating watermelon.
9. **Clue 9:** The journalist is not the person drinking water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person drinking milk is not the person driving the quad-bike or the accountant is not the person drinking milk or both.
11. **Clue 11:** The person eating watermelon is in the middle.
12. **Clue 12:** The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.
13. **Clue 13:** The person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the fan of country.
14. **Clue 14:** The person eating watermelon is not to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
15. **Clue 15:** The fan of disco is in the middle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11:** The person eating watermelon is in the middle (position 2).
2. **Clue 8:** The person eating cherry is somewhere to the left of the person eating watermelon. Therefore, the person eating cherry is in position 1.
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching adventure movies is the person eating cherry. So, the person in position 1 watches adventure movies.
4. **Clue 5:** The person watching family movies is somewhere between the paramedic and the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching adventure movies is in position 1, the person watching family movies must be in position 2 (middle), and the paramedic must be in position 3.
5. **Clue 4:** The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person watching family movies. So, the person in position 3 drives the quad-bike.
6. **Clue 14:** The person eating watermelon is not to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This confirms our previous placement since the person eating watermelon is in position 2 and the person driving the quad-bike is in position 3.
7. **Clue 12:** The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person driving the quad-bike is in position 3, the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 1 or 2. However, position 1 is occupied by the person eating cherry, so the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 2.
8. **Clue 13:** The person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the fan of country. So, the fan of country cannot be in position 1.
9. **Clue 7:** The person eating radish is not to the right of the fan of funk. Since the fan of funk must be in position 3 (because the person driving the quad-bike is in position 3), the person eating radish cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the person eating radish must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is already occupied by the person eating cherry, so the person eating radish must be in position 2.
10. **Clue 6:** The person watching family movies is not to the right of the person drinking milk. So, the person drinking milk cannot be in position 3. Since the person in position 3 drives the quad-bike, the person drinking milk must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is occupied by the person eating cherry, so the person drinking milk must be in position 2.
11. **Clue 10:** The person drinking milk is not the person driving the quad-bike or the accountant is not the person drinking milk or both. Since the person drinking milk is in position 2 and does not drive the quad-bike, the accountant must be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is occupied by the person eating cherry, so the accountant must be in position 3.
12. **Clue 2:** The person drinking lemonade and the person eating cherry have the same parity positions. Since the person eating cherry is in position 1, the person drinking lemonade must also be in position 1.
13. **Clue 9:** The journalist is not the person drinking water. Since the person drinking milk is in position 2 and the person drinking water cannot be the journalist, the journalist must be in position 3.
14. **Clue 1:** The person drinking milk and the fan of funk have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking milk is in position 2 and the person driving the quad-bike is in position 3, the fan of funk must be in position 3.
15. **Clue 15:** The fan of disco is in the middle. Since the fan of funk is in position 3, the fan of disco must be in position 2.
16. **Clue 10:** The person drinking milk is not the person driving the quad-bike or the accountant is not the person drinking milk or both. This is consistent with our placements.

Lv12-6x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break down the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The Canadian is on the left of the person eating lemon.
2. **Clue 2:** The Canadian is the person watching musical movies or the Canadian is the person drinking fanta or both.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the person eating pomegranate.
4. **Clue 4:** The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is parkour is in an odd position.
6. **Clue 6:** The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the Russian.
7. **Clue 7:** The person eating pomegranate and the person watching comedy movies have the same parity positions.
8. **Clue 8:** The Canadian is not the person drinking hot-chocolate.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere between the person eating pomegranate and the person who's sport is biathlon.
10. **Clue 10:** The person watching comedy movies is not the person who's sport is cycling or the person who's sport is cycling is not the person drinking milk or both.
11. **Clue 11:** The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person who's sport is parkour.
12. **Clue 12:** The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person watching musical movies (redundant).
13. **Clue 13:** The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla.
14. **Clue 14:** The person drinking milk is the owner of the horse or the person drinking milk is the Brazilian or both.
15. **Clue 15:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is in the middle.
16. **Clue 16:** The person drinking fanta is not the person eating lemon or the person watching horror movies is not the person drinking fanta or both.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 15:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is in the middle (position 2). So, we can write:
   ```
   |               |      1      |      2      |      3     |
   ```

2. **Clue 1:** The Canadian is on the left of the person eating lemon. Since the Canadian cannot be in position 3, he must be in position 1. Let's denote the Canadian as C. So, we have:
   ```
   | C               |      1      |      2      |      3     |
   ```

3. **Clue 14:** The person drinking milk is the owner of the horse or the person drinking milk is the Brazilian. We will use this later after more information is gathered.

4. **Clue 8:** The Canadian is not the person drinking hot-chocolate. This confirms that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not C. Since C is in position 1, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2 or 3. But since it's in the middle (Clue 15), the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2. Let's denote the person drinking hot-chocolate as H. So, we have:
   ```
   | C               |      H      |      2      |      3     |
   ```

5. **Clue 1:** The Canadian is on the left of the person eating lemon. Therefore, the person eating lemon must be in position 3. Let's denote the person eating lemon as L. So, we have:
   ```
   | C               |      H      |      L      |      3     |
   ```

6. **Clue 6:** The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the Russian. Since the Canadian is in position 1, the Russian cannot be in position 1. The person watching horror movies could be in position 2 or 3. Let's assume the person watching horror movies is in position 3 (we will verify later). Let's denote the person watching horror movies as R. So, we have:
   ```
   | C               |      H      |      R      |      3     |
   ```

7. **Clue 3:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the person eating pomegranate. This means the person eating pomegranate cannot be in position 1. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 3. This aligns with our previous assumption. So, we have:
   ```
   | C               |      H      |      P      |      3     |
   ```

8. **Clue 4:** The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2, so the owner of the ferret must be in position 3. Let's denote the owner of the ferret as F. So, we have:
   ```
   | C               |      H      |      F      |      3     |
   ```

9. **Clue 13:** The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the ferret is in position 3, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 1 (we will verify later). Let's denote the person who's sport is biathlon as B. So, we have:
   ```
   | B               |      H      |      F      |      3     |
   ```

10. **Clue 6:** The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the Russian. Since the person watching horror movies is in position 3, the Russian must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the Russian is in position 2 (we will verify later). So, we have:
    ```
    | B               |      R      |      F      |      3     |
    ```

11. **Clue 10:** The person watching comedy movies is not the person who's sport is cycling or the person who's sport is cycling is not the person drinking milk or both. Since the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 1, the person who's sport is cycling cannot be in position 1. Let's assume the person who's sport is cycling is in position 3 (we will verify later). Let's denote the person who's sport is cycling as Cy. So, we have:
    ```
    | B               |      R      |      Cy     |      3     |
    ```

12. **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere between the person eating pomegranate and the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 1 and the person who's sport is cycling is in position 3, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 2. So, we have:
    ```
    | B               |      P      |      Cy     |      3     |
    ```

13. **Clue 14:** The person drinking milk is the owner of the horse or the person drinking milk is the Brazilian. Since the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 1, the Brazilian cannot be in position 1. The person drinking milk must be in position 2 or 3. Let's assume the person drinking milk is in position 2 (we will verify later). Let's denote the person drinking milk as M. So, we have:
    ```
    | B               |      M      |      Cy     |      3     |
    ```

14. **Clue 7:** The person eating pomegranate and the person watching comedy movies have the same parity positions. Since the person eating pomegranate is in position 2, the person watching comedy movies must be in position 4. Let's denote the person watching comedy movies as Co. So, we have:
    ```
    | B               |      M      |      Cy     |      Co    |
    ```

15. **Clue 11:** The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in position 3, the person watching musical movies must be in position 1. Let's denote the person watching musical movies as Mu. So, we have:
    ```
    | Mu              |      M      |      Cy     |      Co    |
    ```

16. **Clue 12:** The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person watching musical movies (redundant).

17. **Clue 16:** The person drinking fanta is not the person eating lemon or the person watching horror movies is not the person drinking fanta or both. Since the person drinking fanta is not the person eating lemon, the person drinking fanta must be the Canadian. So, we have:

    ```

18. **Clue 10:** The person watching comedy movies is not the person who's sport is cycling or the person who's sport is cycling is not the person drinking milk or both. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in position 3, the person drinking milk must be in position 2. So, we have:

15. **Clue 15:** The Colombian is not the person driving the boat or the Colombian is not the owner of the fish or both.
16. **Clue 16:** The person watching family movies is on the right of the person drinking fanta.

### Initial Setup:
We will start by placing some basic constraints based on the clues.

#### Clue 14 and Clue 11:
- The Colombian is on the left or right of the person eating papaya.
- The Turkish is not to the right of the Colombian.

This implies that the Colombian cannot be in position 3, and the Turkish must be in either position 1 or 2.

- The person driving the bike is the person watching family movies or the person eating lettuce is the person driving the bike, but not both.

This implies that if one condition is true, the other cannot be true.

### Analyzing Each Position:

#### Position 1:
- Since the Colombian cannot be in position 3, let's consider the Colombian in position 1.
- If the Colombian is in position 1, then the Turkish must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Position 2:
- If the Colombian is in position 1, the Turkish can only be in position 2.
- This leaves position 3 for the person who is not the Colombian or Turkish.

#### Position 3:
- The person in position 3 cannot be the Colombian or Turkish.

### Placing Other Information:

#### Clue 2:
- The person eating lettuce is not to the right of the person driving the bike.

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta.

#### Clue 4:
- The person eating raspberry is somewhere between the person eating lettuce and the person watching mystery movies.

#### Clue 5:
- The owner of the fish is not to the right of the person watching satire movies.

#### Clue 7:
- The person drinking 7up and the person driving the train have different parity positions.

#### Clue 8:
- The owner of the snake is not the person driving the train.

#### Clue 9:
- The person watching family movies is not to the left of the owner of the fish.

- The Turkish is not to the right of the Colombian.

#### Clue 12:
- The owner of the fish is not the person drinking coffee.

#### Clue 13:
- The person driving the train is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog.

#### Clue 16:
- The person watching family movies is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
