### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Snowmobile
- From clue 2, the person driving the snowmobile is on the far right (position 5).

| Pet         |          |          |              |          |     Snowmobile      |
| Sport       |          |          |              |          |                     |
| Transport   |          |          |              |          |                     |

#### Step 2: Trike and Train
- From clue 3, the person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train.
- From clue 9, the owner of the bird is not to the left of the person driving the train.
- From clue 10, the owner of the bird is not to the left of the person driving the train.

This suggests that the person driving the train cannot be in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the trike must be in position 4 or 5. Since the snowmobile is in position 5, the trike must be in position 4.

| Pet         |          |          |              |          |     Snowmobile      |
| Sport       |          |          |              |         Trike    |                     |
| Transport   |          |          |              |          |                     |

#### Step 3: Bird Owner and Train Driver
- From clue 4, the owner of the bird is the person who's sport is biathlon or the owner of the bird is the person driving the train or both.
- From clue 10, the owner of the bird is not to the left of the person driving the train.

This implies that the owner of the bird could be the person driving the train or the person who's sport is biathlon. Given that the train is in position 3, the owner of the bird is the person driving the train (position 3).

| Pet         |          |          | Bird         |          |     Snowmobile      |
| Sport       |          |          | Biathlon    |         Trike    |                     |
| Transport   |          |          | Train       |          |                     |

#### Step 4: Ferret and Ship
- From clue 5, the owner of the ferret is on the left of the person driving the ship.
- From clue 1, the person whose sport is tennis and the owner of the ferret have the same parity positions.

Given the positions so far, the only even position left for the owner of the ferret is position 2. Thus, the person driving the ship must be in position 4.

| Pet         | Ferret   |          | Bird         |          |     Snowmobile      |
| Sport       | Tennis   |          | Biathlon    |         Trike    |                     |
| Transport   | Ship     |          | Train       |          |                     |

#### Step 5: Snowboarding and Swimming
- From clue 6, the person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere between the person who's sport is swimming and the person driving the trike.
- From clue 13, the person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis.

Since the trike is in position 4, the swimming sport must be in position 2 and the snowboarding sport in position 3.

| Pet         | Ferret   | Swimming | Bird         |          |     Snowmobile      |
| Sport       | Tennis   | Snowboarding | Biathlon    |         Trike    |                     |
| Transport   | Ship     |          | Train       |          |                     |

#### Step 6: Goat and Frog
- From clue 7, the owner of the goat is not to the right of the owner of the frog.
- From clue 15, the owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the goat.

This places the goat in position 1 and the frog in position 3.

| Pet         | Goat     | Swimming | Bird         | Frog     |     Snowmobile      |
| Sport       | Tennis   | Snowboarding | Biathlon    |         Trike    |                     |
| Transport   | Ship     |          | Train       |          |                     |

#### Step 7: Final Adjustments
- From clue 1, the person whose sport is tennis and the owner of the ferret have the same parity positions. This means the owner of the ferret must be in position 2.
- From clue 8, the owner of the frog is not the person who's sport is snowboarding. This is already satisfied.
- From clue 14, the person driving the train is not the person who's sport is water-polo or the person who's sport is water-polo is not the owner of the frog or both. This is already satisfied.
- From clue 16, the person who's sport is swimming is not to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. This is already satisfied.
- From clue 17, the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. This is already satisfied.
- From clue 18, the owner of the bird is not to the left of the owner of the fish. This is already satisfied.

Thus, the final solution is:

```
| Pet         | Goat     | Swimming | Bird         | Frog     |     Snowmobile      |
| Sport       | Tennis   | Snowboarding | Biathlon    |         Trike    |                     |
| Transport   | Ship     |          | Train       |          |                     |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking almond-milk is the person who's hobby is reading.
   - \( \text{Reading} \rightarrow \text{Almond-Milk} \)

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is sudoku is the person driving the quad-bike.
   - \( \text{Sudoku} \rightarrow \text{Quad-Bike} \)

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - \( \text{Woodworking} \rightarrow \text{Hot-Chocolate (left)} \)

4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is reading is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
   - Since the person drinking almond-milk is the one with the hobby of reading, this clue is inherently true and doesn't add new information.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
   - \( \text{Puzzles} \rightarrow \text{Sudoku (right)} \)
   - Since Sudoku is driving the quad-bike, Puzzles must be somewhere to the right of the quad-bike.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is reading is not the person driving the roller or the person driving the roller is not the person drinking tea or both.
   - This clue can be simplified as: the person with the hobby of reading is not driving the roller, or the person driving the roller does not drink tea.
   - Since reading is almond-milk, and reading is not the person driving the roller, the person driving the roller does not drink tea.

7. **Clue 7:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter.
   - \( \text{Hot-Chocolate} \rightarrow \text{Scooter (left or right)} \)

8. **Clue 8:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person driving the subway or the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person who's hobby is reading or both.
   - Since the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be the person with the hobby of reading (almond-milk), and they are not driving the subway, we need to place them elsewhere.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up.
   - \( \text{Puzzles} \rightarrow \text{7Up (right)} \)

10. **Clue 10:** The person who's hobby is hiking is not to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

    - This clue simplifies to: the person with the hobby of hiking is not driving the roller, or the person drinking 7up is not hiking.
    - Since the person with the hobby of hiking is not driving the roller, and the person drinking 7up is not hiking, we need to place them accordingly.

13. **Clue 13:** The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
    - \( \text{Hiking} \rightarrow \text{Lemonade (left)} \)

14. **Clue 14:** The person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
    - \( \text{Hiking} \rightarrow \text{Woodworking (right)} \)

15. **Clue 15:** The person driving the quad-bike is the person who's hobby is sudoku or the person who's hobby is sudoku is the person drinking lemonade or both.
    - This clue simplifies to: the person with the hobby of sudoku is either driving the quad-bike or drinking lemonade.
    - Since Sudoku is driving the quad-bike, this clue is inherently true and doesn't add new information.

16. **Clue 16:** The person drinking almond-milk is the person who's hobby is puzzles or the person driving the roller is the person drinking almond-milk, but not both.
    - This clue simplifies to: the person with the hobby of puzzles is drinking almond-milk, or the person driving the roller is drinking almond-milk, but not both.
    - Since the person with the hobby of puzzles is not the same as the person driving the roller, we need to place them accordingly.

17. **Clue 17:** The person driving the skateboard is not to the right of the person driving the subway.
    - \( \text{Skateboard} \rightarrow \text{Subway (not right)} \)

18. **Clue 18:** The person drinking 7up is on the far left.

Lv12-3x5-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 4:** The Thai is in the middle (position 3).
2. **Clue 2:** The British is on the right of the Thai (so British must be in position 4 or 5).
3. **Clue 16:** The Thai is not the one driving the train.
4. **Clue 11:** The British is not to the right of the person driving the motorbike.

From Clues 2 and 4, since the Thai is in position 3 and the British cannot be in position 5 (as the Thai is in the middle), the British must be in position 4.

Since the British is in position 4, and the Thai is in position 3, we can now place the Thai and British:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Beverage      |            |           |    Thai |    Brit   |         |
| Nationality   |            |           |    Thai |    Brit   |         |
| Transport     |            |           |         |          |         |
```

5. **Clue 10:** The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the Chinese.
6. **Clue 8:** The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.
7. **Clue 13:** The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person drinking cola.
8. **Clue 12:** The person driving the van and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).

Since the British is in position 4, the Thai is in position 3, and the British is not to the right of the person driving the motorbike, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the motorbike driver is in position 1 for now.

9. **Clue 5:** The Thai and the person driving the motorbike have different parity positions. Since the Thai is in an odd position (3), the motorbike driver must be in an even position (1 or 5). We already assumed the motorbike driver is in position 1, so this fits.

10. **Clue 7:** The Malaysian is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the German.
11. **Clue 6:** The person drinking soy-milk is not the person driving the van or the person drinking soy-milk is not the Malaysian or both. This means the Malaysian cannot be in position 5 (driving the van) and the person drinking soy-milk cannot be the Malaysian.

Let's try to place the remaining elements:
- Position 1: Motorbike driver (even position)
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: Thai
- Position 4: British
- Position 5: ?

Given the clues, let's fill in the positions:

1. Motorbike driver (even position): Assume position 1.
2. Position 2: Person drinking cola (since the Malaysian must be between the person drinking 7up and the German, and the person drinking cola must be next to the motorbike driver).

```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Beverage      | Motorbike  |   Cola    |    Thai |    Brit   |         |
| Nationality   | Motorbike  |   Cola    |    Thai |    Brit   |         |
| Transport     | Motorbike  |   Cola    |         |          |         |
```

3. Position 3: Thai
4. Position 4: British
5. Position 5: Malaysian (since the Thai is in the middle and the Malaysian must be between the person drinking 7up and the German).

```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Beverage      | Motorbike  |   Cola    |    Thai |    Brit   | 7up/Mal |
| Nationality   | Motorbike  |   Cola    |    Thai |    Brit   | 7up/Mal |
| Transport     | Motorbike  |   Cola    |         |          |         |
```

Now, let's assign the remaining beverages and nationalities:
- Position 1: Motorbike
- Position 2: Cola
- Position 3: Thai
- Position 4: British
- Position 5: Malaysian

We need to assign the beverages and nationalities:
- The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the Chinese (Clue 10).
- The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee (Clue 9).
- The person drinking water is on the left of the person driving the scooter (Clue 3).
- The person drinking water is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile (Clue 17).

Assuming the person drinking 7up is in position 5, and the person drinking water is in position 4, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2.

```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Beverage      | Motorbike  |   Coffee  |    Thai |    Water  |    7up  |
| Nationality   | Motorbike  |   Chinese |    Thai |    Malay  |    Brit  |
| Transport     | Motorbike  |   Cola    |         |          |         |
```

Finally, assigning the remaining transport:
- Position 1: Motorbike
- Position 2: Cola
- Position 3: Thai
- Position 4: Water
- Position 5: 7up

Final Solution:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |

    - If Hot-chocolate = Even, then Videographer = Even
    - If Hot-chocolate = Odd, then Videographer = Odd

### Solving the Puzzle:

1. **Bartender drinks 7up** (Clue 3), so Bartender: 7up.
2. **Goldfish is in position 3** (Clue 1), so Goldfish: 3.
3. **Librarian is between accountant and bartender (Clue 11)**, and bartender is 3, so librarian can be 2 or 4.
4. **Sprite is to the left of bartender (Clue 7)**, so sprite cannot be 3.
5. **Hamster is to the right of hot-chocolate (Clue 6)**, so Hamster > Hot-chocolate.
6. **Pilot is to the left of librarian (Clue 14)**, and librarian can be 2 or 4.
7. **Cat ≠ Videographer (Clue 2)**.
8. **Sprite is to the right of cat (Clue 12)**, and sprite is to the left of bartender (Clue 7).
9. **Iced-tea is to the left of sprite (Clue 13)**, and sprite is to the left of bartender (Clue 7).

Let's try placing the items:

- **Bartender: 7up**
- **Goldfish: 3**

Since the librarian is between the accountant and the bartender, and bartender is 3, librarian must be 2 or 4.

- **Sprite must be to the left of 7up**, so sprite can be 1 or 2.

Since sprite is to the right of cat and to the left of 7up:
- If sprite is 2, cat must be 1.
- If sprite is 1, cat must be 2 (but librarian can't be 2 if sprite is 1).

So, let's assume:
- **Sprite: 2**
- **Cat: 1**
- **Librarian: 4**
- **Accountant: 2 or 4 (but since 4 is taken by librarian, accountant must be 2)**

Now, we need to place the remaining items:
- **Pilot: 1 (left of librarian, so 1 or 2)**
- **Hot-chocolate and videographer have the same parity positions (both even or both odd)**.
- **Hamster is to the right of hot-chocolate (Clue 6)**.
- **Owner of hamster is not the person drinking iced-tea (Clue 9)**.

Given the constraints, let's place:
- **Pilot: 1**
- **Videographer: 5 (must be odd, so 5)**
- **Hot-chocolate: 4 (even, so 4)**
- **Hamster: 5 (right of 4, so 5)**
- **Iced-tea: 1 (left of sprite, so 1)**

This fits all the clues. Let's summarize:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position (4).
2. **Clue 17:** The person who's hobby is reading is in an odd position (4).
   - Therefore, the person with hobby ""reading"" is in position 4.

3. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person eating onion.
   - This means the person eating onion must be in a position before the person with hobby ""board-games"".

4. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is swimming is between the person who's hobby is chess and the person eating grapefruit (2).
   - Since chess is in position 4, the person eating grapefruit must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 4:** The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess (4).
   - This is consistent with Clue 3.

6. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is reading is not the person eating grapefruit or the person who's hobby is reading is not the person who's sport is handball or both (2).
   - Since the person with hobby ""reading"" is in position 4, they cannot be eating grapefruit (position 2).

7. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is handball is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
   - This means the person with hobby ""rock-climbing"" has the sport ""handball"".

8. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions (9).
   - Since rock-climbing is in an odd position (4), volleyball must also be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

9. **Clue 8:** The person who's sport is cycling is in the middle (3).
   - This means the person with sport ""cycling"" is in position 3.

10. **Clue 9:** The person eating garlic is not the person who's hobby is reading (6).
    - Since reading is in position 4, garlic cannot be in position 4.

11. **Clue 10:** The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person eating tomato (5).
    - Since chess is in position 4, tomato must be in position 1 or 2 (but we already know 2 is for grapefruit).

12. **Clue 11:** The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (3).
    - Since cycling is in position 3, puzzles must be in position 2 or 4 (but 2 is for grapefruit and 4 is for reading).

13. **Clue 12:** The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (3).
    - Since rock-climbing is in position 4, swimming must be in position 3 or 5 (but 3 is for cycling).

    - Since cycling is in position 3, garlic must be in position 4 or 5.

15. **Clue 14:** The person who's hobby is puzzles and the person eating tomato have the same parity positions (9).
    - Since tomato is in position 1 or 3 (since 2 is for grapefruit), puzzles must be in position 1 or 3.

16. **Clue 15:** The person eating tomato is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (4).
    - Since rock-climbing is in position 4, tomato must be in position 5.

17. **Clue 16:** The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games (3).
    - Since reading is in position 4, board-games must be in position 2 or 5.
