### Explanation:
1. **Position 1 (Far Left):** The fan of folk (clue 28).
2. **Position 2:** The person who's hobby is card-games (clue 26), which must be in an even position, so it can't be here. Therefore, it must be in position 4.
3. **Position 3:** The person who's hobby is magic-tricks (clue 20) can't be to the left of the fan of d&b (clue 20), so it can't be in position 1. It also can't be in position 2 because the person with hobby card-games is in position 4. So, it must be in position 3.
4. **Position 4:** The person who's hobby is video-games (clue 29), which can't be to the right of the person eating asparagus (clue 29). Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 4, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 1.
5. **Position 2:** The person who's hobby is card-games (clue 26) must be in an even position, so it must be in position 2.
6. **Position 3:** The person who's hobby is magic-tricks (clue 20) can't be to the left of the fan of d&b (clue 20), so it must be in position 3.
7. **Position 4:** The person who's hobby is video-games (clue 29) can't be to the right of the person eating asparagus (clue 29). Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 4, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 1.
