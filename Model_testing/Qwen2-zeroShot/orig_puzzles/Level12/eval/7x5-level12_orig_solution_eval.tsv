Lv12-7x5-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Given the complexity, I'll break down the clues and systematically fill in the table.

Let's start by summarizing some key points from the clues:

1. **Clue 4**: The Polish is not the person drinking tea or the Polish is not the teacher.

15. **Clue 37**: The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the Spanish.
16. **Clue 38**: The owner of the snake is the owner of the snake (redundant).

Now let's start filling in the table step-by-step based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Clue 4**: Polish ≠ Tea, Polish ≠ Teacher.
2. **Clue 7**: Teacher > Cola.
3. **Clue 13**: Teacher < Russian.

13. **Clue 35**: Tea > Weightlifting.
14. **Clue 36**: Fanta ≠ Snowboarding.
15. **Clue 37**: Gardening < Spanish.

From Clue 33, we know that the teacher is driving the scooter. From Clue 7, the teacher must be in position 4 or 5. Since the teacher is also driving the scooter (Clue 33), the teacher must be in position 4. Therefore, the teacher is in position 4.

### Filling in Remaining Information
