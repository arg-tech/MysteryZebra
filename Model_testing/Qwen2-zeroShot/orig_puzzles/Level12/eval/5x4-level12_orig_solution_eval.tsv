    - From clue 13, the person with the hobby of skydiving is the police-officer or the owner of the hamster is the person with the hobby of skydiving.

8. **Singing and Writing Hobbies**:
    - The person with the hobby of singing is to the left of the person with the hobby of writing.
    - Therefore, the person with the hobby of singing is in position 1 or 2.

Lv12-5x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the correct information step by step.

Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing information:

### Clues Summary:
1. The Russian and the person driving the helicopter have different parity positions.
2. The person whose hobby is fishing is either the fan of trance or French, but not both.
3. The Russian and the person driving the ship have different parity positions.
4. The fan of punk is not the person whose hobby is board-games.
5. The fan of punk is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
6. The person driving the trike is not to the right of the person whose hobby is fishing.
7. The Russian is not the person driving the trike or the Russian is not the fan of punk (or both).
8. The person driving the tram is in an even position.
9. The Colombian is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is soccer.
10. The person whose hobby is cooking is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is board-games.
11. The fan of trance is the person whose sport is handball or the fan of trance is the person driving the ship, but not both.
12. The person driving the ship is between the person driving the tram and the Colombian.
13. The person driving the trike is not to the left of the French.
14. The person whose hobby is filmmaking and the fan of punk have different parity positions.
15. The fan of punk is the Colombian or the person driving the ship is the fan of punk (or both).

17. The fan of ambient is not the Russian or the fan of ambient is not the person whose hobby is filmmaking (or both).
18. The fan of rock is not the person driving the helicopter.
19. The person driving the ship is not the person whose hobby is filmmaking or the person driving the ship is not the person whose sport is soccer (or both).
20. The person whose sport is handball is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is rowing.
21. The fan of trance is not the Thai.
22. The person whose sport is rowing is on the left of the fan of rock.

### Deductions:
1. **Clue 8**: The person driving the tram is in an even position. So, the person driving the tram is either in position 2 or 4.
2. **Clue 9** & **Clue 16**: The Colombian is to the right of the person whose sport is soccer and also to the left of the person whose hobby is cooking. This implies that the person whose sport is soccer must be in position 1, and the Colombian must be in position 3.
3. **Clue 12**: The person driving the ship is between the person driving the tram and the Colombian. Since the Colombian is in position 3, the person driving the tram must be in position 2, and the person driving the ship must be in position 4.
4. **Clue 10**: The person whose hobby is cooking is to the right of the person whose hobby is board-games. So, the person whose hobby is board-games must be in position 1, and the person whose hobby is cooking must be in position 3 (but since the Colombian is already in position 3, this is incorrect). We need to adjust our placements.
5. **Clue 2**: The person whose hobby is fishing is either the fan of trance or French, but not both. This means the person whose hobby is fishing cannot be the fan of trance and cannot be French.
6. **Clue 11**: The fan of trance is the person whose sport is handball or the fan of trance is the person driving the ship, but not both. Since the person driving the ship is in position 4, the fan of trance cannot be the person driving the ship. Thus, the fan of trance must be the person whose sport is handball.
7. **Clue 20**: The person whose sport is handball is to the left of the person whose sport is rowing. Since the fan of trance is the person whose sport is handball, the person whose sport is rowing must be in position 3.
8. **Clue 19**: The person driving the ship is not the person whose hobby is filmmaking or the person driving the ship is not the person whose sport is soccer (or both). Since the person driving the ship is in position 4, the person whose sport is soccer cannot be in position 4. The person whose sport is soccer must be in position 1.
9. **Clue 22**: The person whose sport is rowing is on the left of the fan of rock. So, the fan of rock must be in position 3, which is occupied by the person whose sport is rowing. This is a contradiction unless we adjust our placements again.
10. **Clue 18**: The fan of rock is not the person driving the helicopter. So, the fan of rock must be the person whose hobby is cooking.
11. **Clue 15**: The fan of punk is the Colombian or the person driving the ship is the fan of punk. Since the person driving the ship is in position 4, the fan of punk must be the Colombian.
12. **Clue 14**: The person whose hobby is filmmaking and the fan of punk have different parity positions. Since the fan of punk is the Colombian (position 3), the person whose hobby is filmmaking must be in position 1.
13. **Clue 21**: The fan of trance is not the Thai. So, the fan of trance must be the Russian.
14. **Clue 7**: The Russian is not the person driving the trike or the Russian is not the fan of punk. Since the Russian is the fan of trance, the Russian cannot be the person driving the trike.
15. **Clue 13**: The person driving the trike is not to the left of the French. So, the person driving the trike must be the Thai.
16. **Clue 6**: The person driving the trike is not to the right of the person whose hobby is fishing. So, the person whose hobby is fishing must be in position 2.

### Final Assignment:

Based on the clues and logical deductions:
- Thai (Lawyer) | Chess

We can now fill in the rest based on the remaining positions and sports:

1. Thai (Lawyer) | Chess

4. Mexican | Dancing

Now, we need to assign the sports and movie genres:

- **Cycling (Action)**: Must be on the right side, so it could be position 3 or 4.
- **Sailing**: Must be on the right side, so it could be position 3 or 4.
- **Lacrosse (Climbing)**: Left of Sudoku, so it must be position 1 or 2.
- **Climbing**: Right of Lacrosse, so it must be position 3 or 4.

Given these constraints, let's place them:

1. Thai (Lawyer) | Chess
2. Polish | Sudoku
3. Dutch | Lacrosse (Climbing)
4. Mexican | Dancing (Action)

Finally, we assign the remaining sports and movie genres:

1. Thai (Lawyer) | Chess | Climbing | Action
