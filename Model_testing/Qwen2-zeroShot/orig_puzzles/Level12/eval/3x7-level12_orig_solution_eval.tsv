3. **From constraint 10:** If the person with the hobby ""traveling"" is in position 1, then the mechanic cannot be the fan folk.
4. **From constraint 17:** The fan house must be in an odd position, so it can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
5. **From constraint 18:** The fan house must be in an odd position, and since the person with the hobby ""traveling"" is in position 1, the fan house must be in position 5.

28. The owner of the dog is not to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
29. The person eating broccoli is the owner of the dog.
30. The person eating tomato is not to the right of the person eating garlic.

### Step 2: Place Items Based on Clues
Let's start placing the items based on the clues:

1. **Clue 15**: The person drinking 7up is in the middle (position 4).
2. **Clue 11**: The person eating artichoke is the person drinking juice.
3. **Clue 29**: The person eating broccoli is the owner of the dog.
4. **Clue 23**: The person drinking water is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, 5, 7).

Since the person drinking 7up is in position 4, and the person drinking juice is the person eating artichoke, let's place these first:
- Position 4: 7up (Beverage)
- Position 1: Juice (Beverage) / Artichoke (Food)

Next, we know that the owner of the dog is the person eating broccoli, so:
- Position 1: Juice (Beverage) / Broccoli (Food)

Since the person drinking juice and the person eating artichoke are in the same position, and the person drinking juice is in position 1, the person eating artichoke must also be in position 1:
- Position 1: Juice (Beverage) / Artichoke (Food)

The person drinking water is in an odd position, and the person drinking juice is in position 1, so the person drinking water cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person drinking water could be in position 3 or 5 or 7.

Let's continue with the other clues:
- **Clue 22**: The person drinking juice is not the owner of the ferret.
- **Clue 20**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
- **Clue 28**: The owner of the dog is not to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
- **Clue 26**: The person eating avocado and the owner of the dog have different parity positions.

Given the above, we can deduce:
- The person drinking juice is in position 1, so the owner of the guinea-pig and the person drinking juice have the same parity (both in position 1, which is odd).
- The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret, and the person drinking juice is in position 1, so the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 3, 5, or 7.

Since the person drinking juice is in position 1, and the person drinking water is in an odd position, the person drinking water must be in position 3, 5, or 7. Given the constraints, let's place the person drinking water in position 3:
- Position 3: Water (Beverage)

Now, we need to place the remaining items:
- **Clue 6**: The person drinking 7up is not the person eating grapefruit.
- **Clue 16**: The person drinking water and the person eating broccoli have different parity positions.
- **Clue 10**: The person eating broccoli is not to the right of the person eating tomato.
- **Clue 30**: The person eating tomato is not to the right of the person eating garlic.

Given the above, we can deduce:
- The person eating broccoli is in position 1 (since the person drinking juice is in position 1 and the person drinking water is in position 3).
- The person eating tomato is in position 2 or 4 or 6 (not to the right of the person eating garlic).

Given the constraints, let's place the person eating tomato in position 2:
- Position 2: Tomato (Food)

Now, we need to place the remaining items:
- **Clue 9**: The person eating broccoli is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
- **Clue 14**: The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person eating carrot.
- **Clue 19**: The person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the person eating broccoli.
- **Clue 24**: The person drinking iced-tea and the owner of the chinchilla have the same parity positions.

Given the above, we can deduce:
- The person drinking iced-tea is in position 5 (since the person drinking juice is in position 1 and the person drinking water is in position 3).
- The person drinking soy-milk is in position 6 (since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 5 and the person drinking 7up is in position 4).

Now, we need to place the remaining items:
- **Clue 8**: The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat.
- **Clue 21**: The person drinking iced-tea is not the person eating avocado or the owner of the dog is not the person drinking iced-tea or both.

Given the above, we can deduce:
- The owner of the ferret is in position 2 (since the person eating tomato is in position 2).
- The owner of the cat is in position 6 (since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 5).

Finally, we need to place the remaining items:
- **Clue 25**: The person eating avocado and the owner of the chinchilla have the same parity positions.
- **Clue 27**: The person eating carrot is not the owner of the guinea-pig.
- **Clue 28**: The owner of the dog is not to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
- **Clue 31**: The person eating carrot is not the owner of the guinea-pig.

Given the above, we can deduce:
- The person eating avocado is in position 3 (since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 5 and the person drinking 7up is in position 4).
- The owner of the chinchilla is in position 7 (since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 5).
- The person eating carrot is in position 6 (since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 5 and the person drinking 7up is in position 4).

### Analysis and Placement:

Let's start with the Beverage column:

- **Beverage 1** (Tea) must be next to 7 (Hot-Chocolate), so it could be in position 6 or 8.
- **Beverage 3** (Cola) must be such that the Mexican is on its right and has different parity positions from the person drinking Cola.
- **Beverage 2** (Almond-Milk) must be in the middle (position 4).

6. **Beverage 3 (Cola)**: Position 8 (Mexican on the right, different parity from Cola drinker).
7. **Beverage 1 (Tea)**: Position 6 (next to Hot-Chocolate).

Now, let's fill in the rest of the table based on the job and nationality constraints:

- **Job 7 (Teacher)**: Position 7.
- **Nationality 7 (Polish)**: Position 7 (right of Cola).

- **Nationality 4 (Colombian)**: Position 4 (left of Social-Worker).
- **Job 3 (Dancer)**: Position 3 (not left of Cola).
- **Nationality 3 (Pakistani)**: Position 3 (left of Social-Worker).
