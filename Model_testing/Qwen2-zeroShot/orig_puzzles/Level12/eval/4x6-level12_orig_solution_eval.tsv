1. **Clue 2**: Tea -> Card-games.
2. **Clue 19**: Cranberry -> Not Tea.
3. **Clue 4**: Cranberry -> Right of Tea.
4. **Clue 32**: Tea -> Even position (2 or 4).
5. **Clue 14**: 7up -> Odd position (1, 3, or 5).

Let's place Tea at position 2 (since it must be in an even position and not at 4 due to 7up being to the left):

Since Cranberry is to the right of Tea:
- **Cranberry -> 3**.

- **Juice -> 3 or 5**.

Since Tea is at 2 and 7up is at 1, Juice must be at 5:
- **Juice -> 5**.

**Clue 10**: Juice -> Juice.
- **Juice -> 5**.

**Clue 11**: Horse -> Right of Pony.
**Clue 12**: Hamster -> Far left or right.
**Clue 13**: Fishing -> Right of Artichoke.
**Clue 16**: Juice and Horse have the same parity positions (both odd).
- **Horse -> 5**.
- **Hamster -> 1 or 6**.

Since Horse is at 5, Hamster must be at 1:
- **Hamster -> 1**.

**Clue 17**: Fish -> Left or right of Horse.
- **Fish -> 4**.

**Clue 28**: Hedgehog -> Left of Apple.
- **Apple -> 6**.

**Clue 29**: Reading -> Left or right of Puzzles.
- **Puzzles -> 3**.

**Clue 30**: Cooking -> Right of Fish.

**Clue 38**: Horse -> Not Apple or Reading -> Not Horse.
- **Reading -> 4**.

**Clue 39**: Juice -> Not Artichoke or Cooking -> Not Juice.
- **Artichoke -> 2**.

**Clue 40**: Hedgehog -> Same parity as Cooking (both odd).
