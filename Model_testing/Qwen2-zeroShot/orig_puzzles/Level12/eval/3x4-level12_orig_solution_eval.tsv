#### Step 3: Analyze the Avocado and Pepper
From clue 2:
- The person eating avocado is to the right of the person eating pepper.

Since the car driver is in position 1, the person eating pepper must be in position 2 or 3 (since the car driver is to the left of the person eating nectarine and apple).

#### Step 4: Analyze the Nectarine and Apple
From clues 3 and 4:
- The person eating nectarine is to the right of the car driver (position 1).
- The person eating apple is to the right of the person eating avocado.

#### Step 5: Analyze the Train and Jet Ski
From clue 5:
- The person driving the train is not to the right of the person driving the jet ski.

From clue 6:
- The person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the Japanese.

From clue 7:
- The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

From clue 8:
- The person driving the car is on the left of the Brazilian.

From clue 9:

Lv12-3x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items (food, music genre, and pet) in the correct order. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The fan of punk is on the left of the person eating raspberry.
2. The owner of the horse is on the right of the fan of hip-hop.
3. The owner of the snake is not to the left of the fan of electronic.
4. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
5. The owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the person eating carrot.
6. The fan of electronic is the person eating raspberry or the fan of electronic is the owner of the horse or both.
7. The fan of punk is not the owner of the snake or the fan of punk is not the person eating raspberry or both.
8. The owner of the horse is on the left of the person eating raspberry.
9. The person eating lettuce is on the right of the owner of the rabbit.
10. The person eating asparagus is not to the right of the person eating raspberry.
11. The owner of the horse and the person eating carrot have the same parity positions.
12. The owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the fan of electronic.
13. The person eating asparagus and the fan of country have different parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions for the fan of punk and the person eating raspberry.
From Clue 1 and Clue 8, we know that the fan of punk must be immediately to the left of the person eating raspberry. So, let's denote the person eating raspberry as R.

#### Step 2: Identify the position for the owner of the horse.
From Clue 2 and Clue 4, the owner of the horse must be on the right of the fan of hip-hop and also on the right of the person eating raspberry. Therefore, the fan of hip-hop cannot be in position 1, and the owner of the horse must be in position 4.

#### Step 3: Identify the position for the fan of electronic.
From Clue 6, the fan of electronic could either be the person eating raspberry or the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the horse is in position 4, the fan of electronic must be the person eating raspberry. Thus, R = electronic.

#### Step 4: Identify the position for the fan of punk.
Since R = electronic, the fan of punk must be in position 3.

#### Step 5: Identify the position for the person eating carrot.
From Clue 11, the owner of the horse (position 4) and the person eating carrot have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the horse is in position 4 (even), the person eating carrot must be in position 2.

#### Step 6: Identify the position for the owner of the rabbit.
From Clue 5 and Clue 12, the owner of the rabbit cannot be in position 1 and must be to the right of the person eating carrot. Therefore, the owner of the rabbit is in position 3, which conflicts with the fan of punk. This means the person eating carrot must be in position 2, and the owner of the rabbit must be in position 4.

#### Step 7: Identify the remaining positions.
From Clue 9, the person eating lettuce is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the rabbit is in position 4, the person eating lettuce must be in position 1.

#### Step 8: Identify the remaining food, music genre, and pet.
From Clue 10, the person eating asparagus is not to the right of the person eating raspberry. Since the person eating raspberry is in position 3, the person eating asparagus must be in position 1, which conflicts. Therefore, the person eating asparagus must be in position 2, and the person eating lettuce must be in position 1.

Finally, from Clue 7, the fan of punk is not the owner of the snake or the fan of punk is not the person eating raspberry. Since the fan of punk is in position 3 and the person eating raspberry is in position 3, the fan of punk is not the person eating raspberry.

10. **Clue 10:** The Mexican is not the owner of the snake or the person who's hobby is traveling is not the Mexican.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the person who's hobby is traveling.
13. **Clue 13:** The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the bird.
14. **Clue 14:** The person who's hobby is traveling is in an odd position.
15. **Clue 15:** The owner of the rat and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions.
16. **Clue 16:** The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the Pakistani.
17. **Clue 17:** The person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the German have different parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **From Clue 14:** The person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 1 or 3 (odd positions).
2. **From Clue 8:** The Pakistani has the hobby of puzzles.
3. **From Clue 11:** The person who's hobby is dancing is in position 4.
4. **From Clue 16:** The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the Pakistani. Since the Pakistani is not in position 4 (as they have the hobby of puzzles), the owner of the rat must be in position 2 or 3.
5. **From Clue 15:** The owner of the rat and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions. If the owner of the rat is in position 2 (even), then the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must also be in position 2. If the owner of the rat is in position 3 (odd), then the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must also be in position 3.
6. **From Clue 12:** The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the Pakistani is in position 2 or 3, and the person who's hobby is traveling is in position 1 or 3, the only possible placement for the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 2 if the owner of the rat is in position 3.
7. **From Clue 6:** The owner of the ferret is on the far left (position 1) or far right (position 4). Since the person who's hobby is dancing is in position 4, the owner of the ferret must be in position 1.
8. **From Clue 7:** The American is the owner of the ferret or the American is the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the American cannot be in position 4 (as the person who's hobby is dancing is there), the American must be the owner of the ferret in position 1.
9. **From Clue 5:** The American is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the American is in position 1 and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 2, this condition is satisfied.
10. **From Clue 3:** The Mexican is not the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is in position 1 or 3, and the Mexican cannot be in position 1 (as the American is there), the Mexican must be in position 2 or 3.
11. **From Clue 2:** The Mexican is not to the left of the Pakistani. Since the Pakistani is in position 2 or 3, the Mexican must be in position 3.
12. **From Clue 10:** The Mexican is not the owner of the snake or the person who's hobby is traveling is not the Mexican. Since the Mexican is in position 3, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 1.
13. **From Clue 9:** The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the owner of the rat. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 2 and the owner of the rat is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.
14. **From Clue 13:** The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the rat is in position 3, the owner of the snake must be in position 2, and the owner of the bird must be in position 4.
15. **From Clue 4:** The Pakistani is the person who's hobby is puzzles. This is already determined.
16. **From Clue 17:** The person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the German have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 2 and the German must be in position 3.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The owner of the ferret is not to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon.
2. **Clue 2**: The owner of the turtle is in an even position (position 2 or 4).
3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the ferret is on the left of the owner of the horse.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person eating pineapple.
5. **Clue 5**: The person eating papaya is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is biathlon is not the person eating cranberry or the person who's sport is biathlon is not the owner of the turtle or both.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is biathlon is the owner of the turtle or the owner of the turtle is the person eating blueberry or both.
9. **Clue 9**: The person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating cranberry.
10. **Clue 10**: The person who's sport is biathlon is not the owner of the dog or the person who's sport is biathlon is not the person eating blueberry or both.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Turtle
From Clue 2, the owner of the turtle must be in position 2 or 4. Since Clue 8 states that the owner of the turtle is either the person eating blueberry or the person who's sport is biathlon, let's consider these options.

#### Step 2: Biathlon Owner
From Clue 6, the owner of the turtle cannot be the person who's sport is biathlon. Therefore, the person who's sport is biathlon must be the owner of the turtle.

Since the turtle is in an even position (2 or 4), the biathlon owner must be in position 2 or 4.

#### Step 3: Biathlon Position
Let's assume the biathlon owner is in position 4 for now. This means the turtle is in position 4. Now we need to place the other items considering the remaining clues.

#### Step 4: Ferret and Horse
From Clue 3, the owner of the ferret is on the left of the owner of the horse. Since the biathlon owner is in position 4, the ferret owner must be in position 1 or 2.

If the ferret owner is in position 1, then the horse owner must be in position 2. But since the turtle is in position 4, the horse owner cannot be in position 4. So, the ferret owner must be in position 2, and the horse owner must be in position 3.

#### Step 5: Surfing and Pineapple
From Clue 4, the person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person eating pineapple. From Clue 5, the person eating papaya is to the right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the biathlon owner is in position 4, the surfing person cannot be in position 4. 

Assume the surfing person is in position 1, then the pineapple eater must be in position 2 or 3. But the ferret owner is in position 2, so the pineapple eater must be in position 3. 

Now, the person eating papaya must be in position 4 because it is to the right of the surfing person.

#### Step 6: Remaining Items
The only remaining items are cranberry and blueberry. Since the biathlon owner is in position 4 and the turtle is in position 4, the person eating cranberry cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the person eating cranberry must be in position 1 or 2. Since the surfing person is in position 1, the person eating cranberry must be in position 2.

This leaves the person eating blueberry in position 1.

#### Final Table:

```
|         |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4     |
| Food    | Blueberry | Cranberry | Pineapple  | Papaya   |
| Pet     | Ferret    | Turtle    | Horse      | Dog      |

   - This means the fan of electronic cannot be in position 4 if the fan of blues is in position 3 or 4.

4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the writer.
   - This reiterates Clue 2 and reinforces that iced-tea must be in position 1 or 2, and the writer must be in position 2 or 3.

5. **Clue 5**: The fan of blues is not the person drinking iced-tea or the person drinking iced-tea is not the writer or both.
   - This means if the person drinking iced-tea is the writer, then the fan of blues cannot be the person drinking iced-tea.

6. **Clue 6**: The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the fan of indie.
   - This means sprite can be in position 1, 2, or 3 if indie is in position 2, 3, or 4, respectively.

7. **Clue 7**: The scientist and the fan of electronic have different parity positions.
   - This means if the scientist is in an odd position (1 or 3), the fan of electronic must be in an even position (2 or 4), and vice versa.

8. **Clue 8**: The fan of indie is somewhere to the left of the pilot.
   - This means the fan of indie cannot be in position 3 or 4 if the pilot is in position 2, 3, or 4.

   - This means the pilot cannot be in position 3 or 4 if the writer is in position 3 or 4.

10. **Clue 10**: The fan of indie is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the fan of metal.
    - This means the fan of indie must be in the middle if the person drinking mirinda and the fan of metal are on either side.

11. **Clue 11**: The nurse is the fan of metal.
    - This directly places the nurse as the fan of metal.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Nurse**:
   - From Clue 11, the nurse is the fan of metal. Therefore, the nurse is in one of the positions, and the fan of metal is also in that position.

2. **Positioning the Writer**:
   - From Clues 2 and 4, the writer must be in position 2 or 3 because the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the writer and cannot be to the right of the writer.

3. **Positioning the Fan of Electronic**:
   - From Clue 1, the fan of electronic cannot be in the same position as the person drinking iced-tea if the person drinking iced-tea is the nurse. Also, from Clue 3, the fan of electronic cannot be to the right of the fan of blues.

4. **Positioning the Fan of Blues**:
   - From Clue 5, the fan of blues cannot be the person drinking iced-tea if the person drinking iced-tea is the writer. This helps us narrow down the positions for the fan of blues.

5. **Positioning Sprite and Indie**:
   - From Clue 6, sprite is on the left or right of the fan of indie. Clue 8 and Clue 9 help us determine the relative positions of the pilot and the writer.

6. **Final Placement**:
   - We need to ensure all constraints are satisfied. Let's try placing the values based on the above analysis.

### Final Solution Table:

Lv12-3x4-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the American.
2. The fan of disco is not the person watching action movies or the fan of disco is not the Malaysian, or both.
3. The Brazilian and the person watching epic movies have different parity positions (i.e., if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position, and vice versa).
4. The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the person watching action movies.
5. The fan of metal is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies.
6. The fan of disco is on the left of the Malaysian.
7. The Brazilian is not the fan of disco or the person watching action movies is not the Brazilian, or both.
8. The Japanese is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
9. The American is on the left of the Brazilian.
10. The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the American.
11. The fan of house is on the left of the fan of metal.
12. The fan of indie is the Brazilian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Brazilian
From Clue 12, the Brazilian is the fan of indie. So, we can fill in:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |    3     |     4     |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |          |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |          |           |
| Nationality   |          | Indie     |          |           |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the Position of the American
From Clue 9, the American is on the left of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian is in position 2, the American must be in position 1. So, we have:
```
|               | Action  | Indie     |          |           |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |          |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |          |           |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     |          |           |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the Position of the Person Watching Animation Movies
From Clue 1, the person watching animation movies is on the right of the American. Therefore, the person watching animation movies must be in position 2, but since the American is already there, the person watching animation movies must be in position 3. So, we have:
```
|               | Action  | Animation |          |           |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |          |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |          |           |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     |          |           |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the Position of the Person Watching Epic Movies
From Clue 3, the Brazilian and the person watching epic movies have different parity positions. Since the Brazilian is in position 2 (even), the person watching epic movies must be in an odd position (1 or 3). But since position 1 is occupied by the American, the person watching epic movies must be in position 3. So, we have:
```
|               | Action  | Animation | Epic     |           |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |          |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |          |           |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     |          |           |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the Remaining Positions
From Clue 4, the Japanese is somewhere to the left of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching action movies is in position 1, the Japanese must be in position 4. So, we have:
```
|               | Action  | Animation | Epic     | Satire   |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     |          | Japanese |
```

From Clue 8, the Japanese is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Therefore, the person watching satire movies must be in position 4. So, we have:
```
|               | Action  | Animation | Epic     | Satire   |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     |          | Japanese |
```

From Clue 6, the fan of disco is on the left of the Malaysian. Since the Malaysian cannot be in position 4 (satire) and the person watching action movies is in position 1, the Malaysian must be in position 3. Therefore, the fan of disco must be in position 2. So, we have:
```
|               | Disco   | Animation | Epic     | Satire   |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     | Malaysian| Japanese |
```

From Clue 5, the fan of metal is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 2, the fan of metal must be in position 1. So, we have:
```
|               | Metal   | Animation | Epic     | Satire   |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     | Malaysian| Japanese |
```

From Clue 11, the fan of house is on the left of the fan of metal. Since the fan of metal is in position 1, the fan of house must be in position 2. So, we have:
```
|               | House   | Animation | Epic     | Satire   |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |          |          |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     | Malaysian| Japanese |
```

From Clue 2, the fan of disco is not the person watching action movies or the fan of disco is not the Malaysian, or both. Since the fan of disco is in position 2 and the person watching action movies is in position 1, the fan of disco cannot be the person watching action movies. Also, the fan of disco is not the Malaysian, so the fan of disco must be the American. Therefore, we have:
```
|               | House   | Animation | Epic     | Satire   |
| Movie-Genre   | Action  |          |          |          |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |          |          |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     | Malaysian| Japanese |
```

Finally, from Clue 7, the Brazilian is not the fan of disco or the person watching action movies is not the Brazilian, or both. Since the Brazilian is in position 2 and the person watching action movies is in position 1, the person watching action movies is not the Brazilian. Therefore, the person watching action movies must be the American. So, we have:
```
|               | House   | Animation | Epic     | Satire   |
| Movie-Genre   | Action  |          |          |          |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |          |          |
| Nationality   | American | Indie     | Malaysian| Japanese |
```

Now, we need to assign the movie genres and music genres:
- From Clue 10, the person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the American. Since the American is in position 1 and the person watching animation movies is in position 3, the person watching animation movies is on the right of the American.
- From Clue 2, the fan of disco is not the person watching action movies or the fan of disco is not the Malaysian, or both. Since the fan of disco is in position 2 and the person watching action movies is in position 1, the fan of disco cannot be the person watching action movies. Also, the fan of disco is not the Malaysian, so the fan of disco must be the American.
- From Clue 11, the fan of house is on the left of the fan of metal. Since the fan of metal is in position 1, the fan of house must be in position 2.
- From Clue 12, the fan of indie is the Brazilian. So, the fan of indie is in position 2.

Thus, the final solution is:
```
|               | House   | Animation | Epic     | Satire   |
| Movie-Genre   | Action  | Comedy    | Romance  | Documentary |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   | House     | Indie    | Metal     |
| Nationality   | American| Brazilian | Malaysian| Japanese  |

Lv12-3x4-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2:** The Turkish is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 5:** The Thai is on the left of the Turkish.
3. **Clue 4:** The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.
4. **Clue 8:** The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the photographer.
5. **Clue 11:** The Dressmaker and the Mexican have the same parity positions.

From Clues 2 and 5, we can deduce that the Thai must be in position 1 (far left) because the Turkish cannot be in position 1 and the Thai must be to the left of the Turkish. So, we have:
- Thai: 1
- Turkish: 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1)

From Clue 4 and Clue 8, since the Turkish is to the right of both the photographer and the person who prefers climbing, the photographer cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because the Turkish is to the right of the photographer). Therefore, the photographer must be in position 3 or 4.

From Clue 11, the Dressmaker and the Mexican have the same parity positions. This means if one is in an even position, the other must be in an even position, and if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an odd position.

From Clue 6, the Thai and the person who prefers skiing have different parity positions. Since Thai is in position 1 (odd), the person who prefers skiing must be in an even position (2 or 4).

From Clue 7, the person who prefers climbing and the Mexican have the same parity positions. Since the Thai is in position 1 (odd), the person who prefers climbing must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

From Clue 3, the Dressmaker is the Turkish or the Turkish is the person who prefers snowboarding or both. We know the Turkish is not in position 1, so the Dressmaker must be the person who prefers snowboarding.

From Clue 10, the Dressmaker is somewhere between the Chef and the person who prefers ice hockey. This implies the Dressmaker is not in position 1 or 4, leaving positions 2 or 3 for the Dressmaker.

### Deduction:

- Thai: 1 (from Clue 5)
- Turkish: 3 or 4 (from Clue 2, 4, and 8)
- Photographer: 3 or 4 (from Clue 4 and 8)
- Dressmaker: 2 or 3 (from Clue 10)
- Person who prefers ice hockey: 2 or 4 (from Clue 6)

Since the Dressmaker and the Mexican have the same parity positions (Clue 11), and the Thai is in position 1 (odd), the Dressmaker must be in position 3 (odd) and the Mexican must be in position 3 as well.

So, the Dressmaker is in position 3.

- Thai: 1
- Dressmaker: 3
- Photographer: 4 (since the Dressmaker is in 3 and the Photographer must be to the right of the Dressmaker)
- Turkish: 2 (since the Photographer is in 4 and the Turkish is to the right of the Photographer)

Now we need to assign the sports and jobs:
- The person who prefers ice hockey is in position 2 (even).
- The person who prefers climbing is in position 1 (odd) or 3 (odd).

Since the Thai is in position 1 and the person who prefers climbing is in position 1 or 3, and the Thai cannot be the person who prefers climbing (from Clue 12), the person who prefers climbing must be in position 3 (Dressmaker).

Therefore:
- Position 1: Thai (Climbing)
- Position 2: (Ice Hockey)
- Position 3: Dressmaker (Skiing)
- Position 4: Photographer (Snowboarding)

Now we need to assign the jobs:
- The Dressmaker is in position 3 and prefers Skiing.
- The Photographer is in position 4 and prefers Snowboarding.
- The Thai is in position 1 and prefers Climbing.
- The remaining job is Chef, which must be in position 2.

So the final assignments are:
- Position 1: Thai (Climbing, Chef)
- Position 2: Mexican (Ice Hockey, Chef)
- Position 3: Dressmaker (Skiing, Photographer)
- Position 4: Photographer (Snowboarding, Chef)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |       1        |      2       |     3      |      4       |

Lv12-3x4-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the correct assignments for each column (nationality, pet, and transport) for each row (1, 2, 3, 4). Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the turtle.**
2. **The person driving the bus is not to the left of the person driving the taxi.**
3. **The Brazilian is not to the right of the owner of the dog.**
4. **The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.**
5. **The Thai is on the left or right of the person driving the bus.**
6. **The owner of the dog is not to the right of the Brazilian.**
7. **The person driving the bus is in an odd position.**
8. **The Egyptian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.**
9. **The Brazilian is not the owner of the ferret or the Brazilian is not the person driving the bus or both.**
10. **The person driving the taxi is not the owner of the turtle.**
11. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the far right.**
12. **The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the helicopter.**

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Driver of the Quad-Bike
- From clue 11, the driver of the quad-bike must be in position 4.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Driver of the Bus
- From clue 7, the driver of the bus must be in an odd position.
- From clue 12, the driver of the taxi must be to the right of the driver of the helicopter.
- Since the driver of the quad-bike is in position 4, the only possible positions for the drivers of the bus and taxi are 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- From clue 12, the taxi cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 3, and the bus must be in position 2.

#### Step 3: Filling in the Positions
- The bus is in position 2.
- The taxi is in position 3.
- The quad-bike is in position 4.

#### Step 4: Filling in the Nationalities
- From clue 5, the Thai must be in position 1 or 2.
- From clue 9, the Brazilian cannot be the driver of the bus (since the Thai could be in position 1 or 2).
- From clue 6, the owner of the dog cannot be to the right of the Brazilian.
- From clue 8, the Egyptian must be to the left of the owner of the dog.

Given these constraints:
- The Thai cannot be in position 4 because the Brazilian would need to be to the right of the owner of the dog, and there wouldn't be enough space.
- Therefore, the Thai must be in position 1.
- The Brazilian cannot be in position 1 (Thai), 2 (bus), or 3 (taxi), so the Brazilian must be in position 4 (quad-bike).

Since the Brazilian is in position 4, the owner of the dog cannot be in position 4, and the Egyptian must be in position 1 (Thai) or 2 (bus).

Given that the Thai is in position 1 and the Brazilian is in position 4, the owner of the dog must be in position 3 (taxi).

Therefore, the Egyptian must be in position 2 (bus).

#### Step 5: Filling in the Pets
- From clue 1, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the turtle.
- The owner of the chinchilla cannot be in position 4 (Brazilian), so it must be in position 1 (Thai) or 2 (Egyptian).

Since the Thai is in position 1, the Egyptian must have the chinchilla.
