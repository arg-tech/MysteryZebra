### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - This means the person drinking iced-tea must be to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
   - This means the position of the person eating pomegranate must be to the left of the person eating carrot.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating carrot and the person watching documentary movies have different parity positions.
   - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position.

4. **Clue 4:** The person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
   - This reiterates Clue 1 but from another perspective.

5. **Clue 5:** The person whose hobby is hiking is not to the left of the person whose hobby is board-games.
   - This means the person with board-games must be to the left of the person with hiking.

6. **Clue 6:** The person whose hobby is hiking is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the person watching time-travel movies.
   - This places hiking in the middle of these two activities.

7. **Clue 7:** The person eating carrot is not the person whose hobby is camping or the person watching documentary movies is not the person eating carrot or both.
   - This means the person eating carrot cannot be the person whose hobby is camping, and the person watching documentary movies cannot be the person eating carrot.

8. **Clue 8:** The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person eating pomegranate.
   - This places iced-tea to the right of pomegranate.

9. **Clue 9:** The person watching documentary movies and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions.
   - This means they must both be in either odd or even positions.

10. **Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is camping is not to the left of the person watching family movies.
    - This means the person watching family movies must be to the left of the person whose hobby is camping.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positions:**
   - We have three positions (1, 2, 3).

2. **Parity Positions:**
   - Odd: 1, 3
   - Even: 2

3. **Person Watching Time-Travel Movies:**
   - From Clues 1 and 4, this person cannot be in position 3.
   - Letâ€™s assume the person watching time-travel movies is in position 1 (we will check consistency later).

4. **Person Drinking Iced-Tea:**
   - From Clues 1, 4, and 8, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3 (right of the person eating pomegranate).

7. **Person Eating Pomegranate:**
   - From Clues 2 and 8, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 1 (left of the person eating carrot).

8. **Person Watching Family Movies:**
   - From Clue 10, the person watching family movies must be in position 2 (left of the person whose hobby is camping).

9. **Person Watching Time-Travel Movies:**
   - Since the person watching time-travel movies is in position 1 (from Clue 1), and the person drinking iced-tea is in position 3 (from Clue 8), the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 1.

10. **Person with Hiking Hobby:**
    - From Clue 6, the person with hiking hobby must be in position 2 (between 7up and time-travel).

11. **Person with Board-Games Hobby:**
    - From Clue 5, the person with board-games hobby must be in position 1 (left of hiking).

12. **Person with Camping Hobby:**
    - From Clue 10, the person with camping hobby must be in position 3 (right of family movies).

Lv12-4x3-2	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **Swimming and Tomato have the same parity positions**: This means if Swimming is in an odd position, Tomato must be in an odd position; if Swimming is in an even position, Tomato must be in an even position.
2. **Skydiving is not to the right of Baseball**: This means Skydiving cannot be in position 2 or 3 if Baseball is in position 1.
3. **Snowboarding is the Photographer**: The person whose sport is Snowboarding is the Photographer.
4. **Baking or Swimming or Tomato**: At least one of these must be true:
   - Baking and Swimming have the same parity positions (if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an odd position).
   - Tomato is the one with the baking hobby.
5. **Swimming is not the Photographer or Skydiving**: This means Swimming cannot be in the same position as the Photographer or Skydiving.
6. **Scientist and Swimming have the same parity positions**: If Swimming is in an odd position, Scientist must be in an odd position; if Swimming is in an even position, Scientist must be in an even position.
7. **Plum is to the left of Tomato**: Plum must be in position 1 or 2, and Tomato must be in position 2 or 3.

10. **Skydiving is to the right of Blueberry**: Skydiving must be in position 2 or 3, and Blueberry must be in position 1 or 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From clue 3**: Snowboarding is the Photographer.
2. **From clue 6**: Scientist and Swimming have the same parity positions.
3. **From clue 2**: Skydiving cannot be to the right of Baseball.
4. **From clue 8**: Swimming is not to the left of the Coach.
5. **From clue 7**: Plum is to the left of Tomato.
6. **From clue 9**: Baseball is to the left of Baking.
7. **From clue 10**: Skydiving is to the right of Blueberry.

### Assigning Positions:

1. **Assigning Snowboarding (Photographer)**:
   - Let's assume Snowboarding is in position 3 (since it can't be in position 1 or 2 due to constraints from other clues).

2. **Assigning Swimming**:
   - Since Swimming and Scientist have the same parity positions, and Swimming can't be in position 1 (due to clue 8), it must be in position 3 (same as Snowboarding).
   - Therefore, Scientist must also be in position 3.

3. **Assigning Blueberry and Skydiving**:
   - Skydiving must be to the right of Blueberry, and it can't be in position 1 (due to clue 10). So, Skydiving could be in position 2, and Blueberry in position 1.
   - This also fits with clue 2 (Skydiving not to the right of Baseball) and clue 9 (Baseball to the left of Baking).

4. **Assigning Tomato and Plum**:
   - Plum must be to the left of Tomato (clue 7).
   - Since Swimming and Tomato have the same parity positions, Tomato must be in position 1 or 3. But since Swimming is in position 3, Tomato must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, Plum must be in position 2.

5. **Assigning Baseball and Baking**:
   - Baseball must be to the left of Baking (clue 9).
   - Since Blueberry is in position 1, Baseball must be in position 2, and Baking must be in position 3.

6. **Assigning Hobbies and Jobs**:
   - From clue 4, we know that either Baking or Tomato is the person with the baking hobby, but since Tomato is in position 1, the person with the baking hobby must be in position 1.
   - From clue 5, we know that either Baking or Swimming or Tomato has the same hobby. Since Tomato is in position 1, and Baking is in position 3, the person with the baking hobby must be Tomato.
   - From clue 5, the person with the baking hobby is Tomato, so the person with the baking hobby must be in position 1.
   - The person with the sport Snowboarding (position 3) is the Photographer, so the job for position 3 must be Photographer.
   - The person with the sport Swimming (position 3) is Scientist, so the job for position 3 must be Scientist.
   - The person with the sport Baseball (position 2) is the Coach, so the job for position 2 must be Coach.
   - The person with the sport Baking (position 3) is the Scientist, so the job for position 3 must be Scientist.
   - The person with the sport Tomato (position 1) is the Baker, so the job for position 1 must be Baker.

### Final Table:

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 1:
- The person driving the bike is between the Japanese and the Spanish.
- Possible order: Japanese -> Bike Driver -> Spanish or Spanish -> Bike Driver -> Japanese.
- We will consider both possibilities but will narrow it down later.

#### Clue 2:
- The person who's sport is golf is not to the right of the person driving the subway.
- This implies the person driving the subway is either in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 3:
- The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf.
- This implies the person watching mystery movies is adjacent to the person who's sport is golf.

- This implies the person driving the ship is either in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 5:
- The person watching adventure movies is not to the right of the person who's sport is rugby.
- This implies the person who's sport is rugby is either in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 6:
- The person watching adventure movies is not the person who's sport is rugby.
- This further restricts the positions for these two roles.

#### Clue 7:
- The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf.
- This implies the person who's sport is badminton is in a position before the person who's sport is golf.

#### Clue 9:
- Redundant with Clue 10, so we can ignore it.

#### Clue 10:
- The person watching thriller movies is not to the right of the Spanish.
- This implies the Spanish is either in position 1 or 2, and the person watching thriller movies is in position 1 or 2 as well.

### Placing the Information:

Let's start placing the information based on the above deductions:

1. **Japanese and Bike Driver**:
   - If the Japanese is in position 1, the Bike Driver must be in position 2 (since they are between Japanese and Spanish).

2. **Subway Driver**:
   - The Subway Driver cannot be in position 3 (as the person who's sport is golf is not to the right of the Subway Driver).

3. **Sport Positions**:
   - Since the person who's sport is golf is not to the right of the Subway Driver, the person who's sport is golf must be in position 1 or 2.
   - The person who's sport is badminton must be to the left of the person who's sport is golf.

4. **Spanish Position**:
   - The Spanish cannot be in position 3 (as the person watching thriller movies is not to the right of the Spanish).

5. **Adventure and Rugby**:
   - The person watching adventure movies is not to the right of the person who's sport is rugby.
   - The person who's sport is rugby cannot be in position 3.

### Final Table:

Based on all the deductions, we can fill in the table as follows:

```

| Sport         | Badminton | Golf     | Rugby    |
| Transport     | Subway   | Ship     | Bike     |
```

### Verification:

- The person driving the bike is between the Japanese and the Spanish.
- The person who's sport is golf is not to the right of the person driving the subway.
- The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf.
- The Japanese is not to the right of the person driving the ship.
- The person watching adventure movies is not to the right of the person who's sport is rugby.
- The person watching adventure movies is not the person who's sport is rugby.

Lv12-4x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through each clue step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis

1. **The person who's hobby is reading is the person eating nectarine.**
   - This means the person with ""reading"" as their hobby is also eating nectarine.

2. **The person eating peas is not to the left of the person who's hobby is reading.**
   - If the person eating peas is at position 1, then the person with ""reading"" as their hobby cannot be at position 1.

3. **The person who's hobby is traveling is not the person eating nectarine or the person who's hobby is traveling is not the owner of the rabbit or both.**
   - This means the person with ""traveling"" as their hobby cannot be eating nectarine, or the person with ""traveling"" as their hobby cannot own the rabbit, or both.

4. **The owner of the goat is on the left of the fan of soul.**
   - The owner of the goat must be in a position to the left of the person who listens to soul music.

5. **The person who's hobby is reading and the person eating radish have the same parity positions.**
   - If the person with ""reading"" as their hobby is at an odd position (1 or 3), then the person eating radish must also be at an odd position. Conversely, if the person with ""reading"" as their hobby is at an even position (2), then the person eating radish must also be at an even position.

6. **The person who's hobby is card-games and the person eating peas have the same parity positions.**
   - Similar to the previous clue, if the person with ""card-games"" as their hobby is at an odd position, then the person eating peas must also be at an odd position. Conversely, if the person with ""card-games"" as their hobby is at an even position, then the person eating peas must also be at an even position.

7. **The person eating nectarine is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.**
   - The person eating nectarine (who has ""reading"" as their hobby) must be in a position to the left of the person who owns the rabbit.

8. **The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the left of the fan of pop.**
   - The person who owns the rabbit must be in a position to the left of the person who listens to pop music.

### Step-by-Step Solution

Let's start by placing the known information:

- From clue 1, the person with ""reading"" as their hobby is eating nectarine.
- From clue 7, the person eating nectarine (reading) must be to the left of the rabbit owner.

Given these clues, let's assume the person with ""reading"" as their hobby is at position 1 (since they can't be at position 2 based on clue 2).

- Position 1: Reading, Nectarine

Now, let's use clue 3:
- The person with ""traveling"" as their hobby cannot be eating nectarine (which is at position 1). Also, if the person with ""traveling"" as their hobby owns the rabbit, they cannot be at position 1. So, the person with ""traveling"" as their hobby must be at position 2 or 3.

Next, using clue 4:
- The owner of the goat must be to the left of the fan of soul. Since the person with ""reading"" as their hobby is at position 1, the goat owner must be at position 1 or 2.

Using clue 5:
- The person with ""reading"" (position 1) and the person eating radish have the same parity. Since ""reading"" is at position 1 (odd), the person eating radish must also be at an odd position. Therefore, the person eating radish could be at position 1 or 3. But since position 1 is already taken by ""reading"" and nectarine, the person eating radish must be at position 3.

- Position 3: Radish

Using clue 6:
- The person with ""card-games"" and the person eating peas have the same parity. Since the person eating radish (position 3) is at an odd position, the person with ""card-games"" must also be at an odd position. Therefore, the person with ""card-games"" could be at position 1 or 3. But position 1 is taken by ""reading"" and nectarine, so the person with ""card-games"" must be at position 3. However, position 3 is already taken by radish, so the person with ""card-games"" must be at position 1.

- Position 1: Card-Games

Using clue 8:
- The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the left of the fan of pop. Since the person with ""card-games"" (position 1) is not the rabbit owner, the rabbit owner must be at position 2 or 3. But position 3 is taken by radish, so the rabbit owner must be at position 2.

- Position 2: Rabbit

Finally, the only remaining position for the person with ""traveling"" as their hobby is position 3, and the only remaining food is peas.

- Position 3: Traveling, Peas

Now we have all the information:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching comedy movies and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions.
   - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must also be in an odd position; if one is in an even position, the other must also be in an even position.

2. **Clue 2:** The fan of salsa is the person drinking water or the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the fan of salsa or both.
   - This implies that either the person drinking water is the fan of salsa, or the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is the fan of salsa, or both.

3. **Clue 3:** The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa.
   - This means the fan of hip-hop cannot be in the rightmost position, and the fan of salsa must be to the right of the fan of hip-hop.

   - This places the sports movies person in position 1 and the action movies person in position 2 or 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person drinking mirinda is the person who's hobby is writing.
   - This directly links the person drinking mirinda with the person whose hobby is writing.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is writing is not the fan of dubstep or the fan of dubstep is not the person drinking mirinda or both.
   - This means the person whose hobby is writing cannot be the fan of dubstep, or the fan of dubstep cannot be the person drinking mirinda, or both.

7. **Clue 7:** The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person watching action movies.
   - This places the person drinking water in position 1 or 2, and the person watching action movies in position 2 or 3.

8. **Clue 8:** The person watching sports movies is on the far left.
   - This places the person watching sports movies in position 1.

1. **Positioning Sports Movies Person:**
   - From Clue 8, the person watching sports movies is in position 1.

2. **Hobby and Drinking Mirinda:**
   - From Clue 5, the person drinking mirinda has the hobby of writing.
   - Therefore, the person in position 1 (sports movies) has the hobby of writing and drinks mirinda.

3. **Action Movies Position:**
   - From Clue 4, the person watching action movies must be in position 2 or 3.
   - From Clue 7, the person drinking water is to the left of the person watching action movies.

   - Therefore, the person watching action movies must be in position 3.

4. **Salsa and Hip-Hop:**
   - From Clue 3, the fan of hip-hop is to the left of the fan of salsa.
   - From Clue 2, the fan of salsa is either the person drinking water or the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
   - Since the person drinking water is in position 2 or 3, and the person watching action movies is in position 3, the person drinking water must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person drinking water is the fan of salsa, and the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is the fan of hip-hop.

5. **Parity Check for Comedy and Iced Tea:**
   - From Clue 1, the person watching comedy movies and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions.
   - Since the person drinking water (salsa) is in position 2, the person watching comedy movies must be in position 4 (even), and the person drinking iced-tea must also be in position 4 (even).

6. **Dubstep and Writing:**
   - From Clue 6, the person whose hobby is writing is not the fan of dubstep.
   - Since the person whose hobby is writing is the person drinking mirinda, the person drinking mirinda is not the fan of dubstep.
   - Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea must be the fan of dubstep.

   - **Constraint 5:** The person who's hobby is camping is between the person eating kale and the person eating watermelon.
   - **Constraint 6:** The person who's sport is cricket is the person who's hobby is filmmaking or the person who's sport is cricket is the person eating kale, but not both.
   - **Constraint 7:** The person who's sport is skateboarding is not the person eating kale or the person who's sport is skateboarding is not the mechanic or both.
   - **Constraint 8:** The person eating watermelon is the security-guard.
   - **Constraint 9:** The person who's hobby is camping is the person eating kale or the person eating kale is the person who's sport is sailing, but not both.
   - **Constraint 10:** The person eating grapes is somewhere between the mechanic and the person who's sport is cricket.

3. **Initial Assumptions and Deductions:**

   - From Constraint 8: The person eating watermelon is the security-guard. So, we place ""security-guard"" under ""Job"" for ""watermelon.""
   
   - From Constraint 5: The person who's hobby is camping is between the person eating kale and the person eating watermelon. Since the security-guard is eating watermelon, the person eating kale must be to the left of the person who's hobby is camping, and the person who's hobby is camping must be to the left of the security-guard.
   
   - From Constraint 2: The person who's hobby is camping is the person who's sport is skateboarding. Therefore, the person who's hobby is camping (and hence the person who's sport is skateboarding) cannot be the security-guard.
   
   - From Constraint 3: The person who's sport is sailing is not to the left of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person who's hobby is camping is the person who's sport is skateboarding, the person who's sport is sailing cannot be to the left of this person.
   
   - From Constraint 4: The person eating kale is not to the right of the person who's sport is sailing. This means the person who's sport is sailing must be to the right of the person eating kale.
   
   - From Constraint 9: The person who's hobby is camping is the person eating kale or the person eating kale is the person who's sport is sailing, but not both. Given that the person who's hobby is camping is the person who's sport is skateboarding, the person eating kale cannot be the person who's sport is sailing. Therefore, the person who's hobby is camping (skateboarding) is the person eating kale.
   
   - From Constraint 6: The person who's sport is cricket is the person who's hobby is filmmaking or the person who's sport is cricket is the person eating kale, but not both. Since the person who's sport is cricket cannot be the person eating kale, the person who's sport is cricket must be the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
   
   - From Constraint 7: The person who's sport is skateboarding is not the person eating kale or the person who's sport is skateboarding is not the mechanic or both. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's hobby is camping (kale), the person who's sport is skateboarding cannot be the mechanic.
   
   - From Constraint 10: The person eating grapes is somewhere between the mechanic and the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person who's sport is cricket is the person who's hobby is filmmaking, the person eating grapes must be between the mechanic and the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

Lv12-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person watching animation movies is not the journalist.
2. The designer is not the person watching zombie movies.
3. The person drinking almond-milk is between the fan soul and the fan reggae.
4. The fan r&b is on the right of the person watching animation movies.
5. The person drinking juice is the fan soul.
6. The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the bartender.
7. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
8. The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
9. The person watching thriller movies is not to the left of the fan reggae.
10. The person watching zombie movies is not the person drinking almond-milk or the person drinking almond-milk is not the fan reggae or both (This is essentially saying that if the person drinking almond-milk is the fan reggae, then the person watching zombie movies cannot be the person drinking almond-milk).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 5:** The person drinking juice is the fan soul.
2. **From Clue 1:** The person watching animation movies is not the journalist.
3. **From Clue 2:** The designer is not the person watching zombie movies.
4. **From Clue 3:** The person drinking almond-milk is between the fan soul and the fan reggae. Since the fan soul drinks juice, the person drinking almond-milk must be between the person drinking juice and the person drinking reggae. So, the person drinking almond-milk could be either in position 1 or 3.
5. **From Clue 4:** The fan r&b is on the right of the person watching animation movies.
6. **From Clue 6:** The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the bartender.
7. **From Clue 7:** The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. This is already satisfied since the person drinking juice is in position 2.
8. **From Clue 8:** The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
9. **From Clue 9:** The person watching thriller movies is not to the left of the fan reggae.
10. **From Clue 10:** The person watching zombie movies is not the person drinking almond-milk or the person drinking almond-milk is not the fan reggae or both. This means if the person drinking almond-milk is the fan reggae, then the person watching zombie movies cannot be the person drinking almond-milk.

### Let's place the items based on these clues:

- Since the fan soul drinks juice, and the person drinking almond-milk is between the fan soul and the fan reggae, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1 (since it has to be between the fan soul and the fan reggae, and the fan soul is in position 2).
- Therefore, the fan reggae must be in position 3.
- The fan r&b is on the right of the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching animation movies cannot be the journalist, let's assume the person watching animation movies is the bartender (since the designer can't watch zombie movies). So, the bartender watches animation.
- The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. The bartender is in position 1, so the designer must be the person watching zombie movies (since the designer cannot watch zombie movies, this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate).
- The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the bartender. So, the designer must be in position 3 (zombie movies) and the journalist must be in position 2 (since the designer is not the journalist).

Lv12-4x3-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given constraints.

### Constraints Recap:
1. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee.
2. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up.
3. The owner of the chinchilla is the fan of funk.
4. The fan of classical is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
5. The person eating radish and the owner of the chinchilla have the same parity positions (both odd or both even).
6. The owner of the snake is on the left of the person eating tomato.
7. The person eating tomato and the owner of the turtle have the same parity positions.
8. The fan of funk is not the person eating peach or the owner of the turtle is not the fan of funk or both.
9. The person eating tomato is on the left or right of the fan of classical.
10. The person drinking coffee is the fan of trance or the person eating peach is the person drinking coffee, but not both.
11. The owner of the turtle is not the fan of trance or the owner of the turtle is not the person drinking 7up or both.
12. The owner of the turtle is the person drinking coffee.
13. The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Constraint 12
- The owner of the turtle drinks coffee.
- This means the person drinking coffee is fixed at position 1.

#### Step 2: Analyze Constraint 2
- Coffee is to the left of 7up.
- Therefore, 7up must be in position 3.

#### Step 3: Analyze Constraint 1
- Soy-milk is to the right of coffee.
- Since coffee is in position 1, soy-milk must be in position 3 (but 7up is already there), so it must be in position 2.

So far:
```
|   1    |   2    |   3    |
| Coffee | Soy-milk | 7up   |
```

#### Step 4: Analyze Constraint 4
- The fan of classical is to the left of the person drinking 7up.
- Since 7up is in position 3, the fan of classical must be in position 2.

So far:
```
|   1    |   2    |   3    |
| Coffee | Classical | 7up   |
```

#### Step 5: Analyze Constraint 3
- The owner of the chinchilla is the fan of funk.
- The fan of funk cannot be in position 1 or 3 (since the fan of classical is in position 2).

So far:
```
|   1    |   2    |   3    |
| Coffee | Classical | 7up   |
| Funk   |          |       |
```

#### Step 6: Analyze Constraint 5
- The person eating radish and the owner of the chinchilla have the same parity positions.
- The owner of the chinchilla (funk) is in an odd position (position 1 or 3). Therefore, the person eating radish must also be in an odd position.

#### Step 7: Analyze Constraint 6
- The owner of the snake is on the left of the person eating tomato.
- Tomato must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

Since tomato is in an odd position, let's place it in position 1 for now and see if it fits all constraints.

So far:
```
|   1    |   2    |   3    |
| Tomato | Classical | 7up   |
| Funk   |          |       |
```

#### Step 8: Analyze Constraint 7
- The person eating tomato and the owner of the turtle have the same parity positions.
- Tomato is in position 1 (odd), so the owner of the turtle must also be in position 1 (odd).

Since the owner of the turtle is in position 1, and we already have tomato there, this constraint is satisfied.

#### Step 9: Analyze Constraint 11
- The owner of the turtle is not the fan of trance or the owner of the turtle is not the person drinking 7up or both.
- The owner of the turtle is in position 1 (tomato), which is not the person drinking 7up (position 3).

So far:
```
|   1    |   2    |   3    |
| Tomato | Classical | 7up   |
| Funk   |          |       |
```

#### Step 10: Analyze Constraint 8
- The fan of funk is not the person eating peach or the owner of the turtle is not the fan of funk or both.
- The owner of the turtle is in position 1 (tomato), which is not the fan of funk (position 1).

So far:
```
|   1    |   2    |   3    |
| Tomato | Classical | 7up   |
| Funk   | Peach    |       |
```

#### Step 11: Analyze Constraint 9
- The person eating tomato is on the left or right of the fan of classical.
- Tomato is in position 1, and the fan of classical is in position 2, so this constraint is satisfied.

#### Step 12: Analyze Constraint 10
- The person drinking coffee is the fan of trance or the person eating peach is the person drinking coffee, but not both.
- The person drinking coffee is in position 1 (Tomato), which is not the fan of trance, and the person eating peach (position 2) is not the person drinking coffee (position 1).

So far:
```
|   1    |   2    |   3    |
| Tomato | Peach   | 7up   |
| Funk   |         |       |
```

#### Step 13: Analyze Constraint 13
- The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
- The fan of classical is in position 2, and the owner of the chinchilla (funk) is in position 1, which does not satisfy this constraint. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- If the fan of classical is in position 3, then the owner of the chinchilla (funk) can be in position 2.

So, the correct arrangement is:
```
|   1    |   2    |   3    |
| Tomato | Funk    | 7up   |
| Peach  | Classical |       |
```

Finally, filling in the remaining food and pet:
- The person eating radish must be in position 3 (since tomato and funk are already placed and they have the same parity).
- The owner of the snake must be in position 2 (since tomato is in position 1 and the owner of the turtle is in position 3).

So, the final solution is:
```
|   1    |   2    |   3    |
| Tomato | Funk    | Radish |
| Peach  | Classical | Snake  |
```
