Lv12-7x7-1	"Solving this complex logic puzzle requires a systematic approach, often involving trial and error or using a constraint satisfaction algorithm. Below is a step-by-step reasoning process that can help us solve the puzzle. However, due to the complexity, I will provide a detailed explanation of how each clue leads to a solution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Clue 33:** The Indonesian is the accountant.
   - This fixes the accountant position as the Indonesian (Position 3).

2. **Clue 6:** The person drinking cola is the accountant or the accountant is the owner of the goat, but not both.
   - Since the Indonesian (accountant) is in position 3, the person drinking cola cannot be the Indonesian.
   - Therefore, the Indonesian must be the owner of the goat.
   - So, the goat is in position 3.

3. **Clue 60:** The person who's sport is swimming and the fan dubstep have the same parity positions.
   - Swimming is an even position (6), so the fan dubstep must also be in an even position (2, 4, 6, or 8).

4. **Clue 27:** The fan dubstep is somewhere to the left of the Dutch.
   - The Dutch must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7).
   - Since the fan dubstep is in an even position, it cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5.
   - Therefore, the fan dubstep must be in position 6.

5. **Clue 52:** The owner of the goat and the person drinking coffee have different parity positions.
   - The goat is in position 3 (odd), so the person drinking coffee must be in an even position (2, 4, 6, or 8).

6. **Clue 51:** The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the fan metal.

- **Position 6**: Quad-bike (since it's the far right and the person driving it can be the police-officer or the person eating pepper).

Let's place these in the table:
```

| Movie-Genre   |                    |            |            |           |             |               | zombie         |
| Nationality   |                    |            |            |           |             |               |                |
