From Clue 11, the person who's hobby is collecting is not to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. This means:
- The person who's hobby is collecting cannot be in position 3 or 4 if the person who's hobby is chess is in position 2.

#### Step 6: Positioning the Person Who's Hobby is Video-Games
From Clue 8, the person who's hobby is video-games is not the journalist or the journalist is not the person watching action movies or both. This means:
- The person who's hobby is video-games cannot be the journalist if the journalist is not the person watching action movies.

#### Step 7: Positioning the Person Who's Hobby is Satire Movies
From Clue 15, the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. This means:
- The person who's hobby is collecting must be next to the person watching satire movies.

#### Step 8: Positioning the Person Who's Hobby is Martial-Arts Movies

### Step 2: Solve the Puzzle

#### 1. Determine the Sport and Transport for Rugby and Skateboard
- From clue 1, the person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.
- From clue 7, the person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby.
- From clue 13, the person driving the taxi is the Brazilian or the person who's sport is lacrosse is the person driving the taxi, but not both.

Since the person driving the skateboard is either the Brazilian or the person eating corn (clue 2), let's assume the person driving the skateboard is the Brazilian (to simplify). This means the person who's sport is rugby cannot be to the left of the Brazilian.

#### 2. Determine the Sport and Transport for Lacrosse
- Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is to the right of the person who's sport is rugby, and the person driving the skateboard is the Brazilian, the person who's sport is lacrosse must be to the right of the Brazilian.

#### 3. Determine the Sport and Transport for Handball
- The Thai is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is handball (clue 10).
- The Thai and the firefighter have different parity positions (clue 3).
- The firefighter is not to the right of the person eating cranberry (clue 9).

#### 4. Determine the Sport and Transport for Tennis
- The person eating lemon is the person who's sport is tennis (clue 22).

#### 5. Determine the Sport and Transport for Handball
- Since the Thai is to the right of the person who's sport is handball, and the Thai cannot be the firefighter (since they have different parity positions), the person who's sport is handball must be to the left of the Thai.

#### 6. Determine the Sport and Transport for Motorbike
- The person driving the motorbike is not to the right of the software-developer (clue 20).
- The Brazilian is not the person driving the motorbike (clue 16).

#### 7. Determine the Sport and Transport for Taxi
- The person driving the taxi is the Brazilian or the person who's sport is lacrosse is the person driving the taxi (clue 13).

Given all these constraints, we can deduce:

- The person who's sport is lacrosse is to the right of the person who's sport is rugby.
- The person who's sport is tennis eats lemon.
- The person who's sport is handball is to the left of the Thai.
- The person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.
- The person driving the skateboard is the Brazilian.
- The person driving the taxi is the Brazilian or the person who's sport is lacrosse.

Based on these deductions, we can fill in the table as follows:
