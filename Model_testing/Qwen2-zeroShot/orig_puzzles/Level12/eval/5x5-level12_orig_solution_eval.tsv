### Step-by-Step Deductions:

1. From Clue 12, the Malaysian is the person watching sports movies, so we can place:
   - Malaysian = 1, Sport = Biathlon

2. From Clue 2, since the person with Biathlon is either the Security Guard or Argentine, we can deduce that:
   - Security Guard or Argentine = 1

3. From Clue 5, the Project Manager is the person with Baking, so we can place:
   - Hobby (Baking) = 5

4. From Clue 16, the Malaysian is on the far left or far right, so we place:
   - Malaysian = 1 (already placed)
   - We need another person to be on the far right, so let's assume:
   - Far Right = 5 (Hobby: Baking)

5. From Clue 17, the person with Basketball is between the Security Guard and Hiking, so we can place:
   - Basketball = 2 (assuming Security Guard is 1 and Hiking is 3)

6. From Clue 22, the person with Hiking is on the left of the Australian, so we place:
   - Hiking = 2 (already placed as Basketball), so:
   - Australian = 3

7. From Clue 23, the Argentine is on the left or right of the person with Biathlon, so we place:
   - Argentine = 4 (since 1 is already the Malaysian and 3 is the Australian)

8. From Clue 19, the person with Drawing is not to the left of the Pilot, so we place:
   - Drawing = 4 (since 3 is the Australian and 4 is the Argentine)

9. From Clue 26, the Pilot is on the left of the person with Video Games, so we place:
   - Pilot = 2 (already placed as Basketball), so:
   - Video Games = 4 (since 3 is the Australian and 4 is the Argentine)

10. From Clue 28, the person with Drawing is not the Pilot, so we confirm:
    - Drawing = 4 (not 2)

11. From Clue 29, the person with Animation is not the same parity position as the person with Drawing, so we place:
    - Animation = 3 (since 4 is the Drawing and 5 is the Baking)

12. From Clue 30, the Malaysian and the person with Hiking have the same parity positions, so we confirm:
    - Malaysian = 1 (odd), Hiking = 2 (even), so:
    - Parity check confirms correctness.

13. From Clue 31, the Pakistani is not the person with Rugby, so we place:
    - Rugby = 2 (already placed as Basketball), so:
    - Pakistani = 3 (already placed as Australian)

14. From Clue 32, the Firefighter is somewhere to the left of the person with Golf, so we place:
    - Firefighter = 1 (already placed as Malaysian), so:
    - Golf = 4 (since 3 is the Australian and 4 is the Argentine)

15. From Clue 21, the person with Comedy is not the person with Rugby or the person with Action is not the Pakistani, so we place:
    - Comedy = 5 (since 4 is the Argentine and 5 is the Baking)

| Movie-Genre   |             |          |             |           |             |
| Nationality   |             |          |             |           |             |

```

Next, we place the person eating peach in the middle (Clue 8):

```
|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |     4     |      5      |
| Beverage      | Argentine   |          |             |           | American    |
| Food          |             |          | Peach       |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   |             |          |             |           |             |
| Nationality   |             |          |             |           |             |
| Pet           |             |          |             |           |             |
```

Since the person watching comedy movies has the same parity position as the person eating peach (Clue 3), the person watching comedy movies must be in an even-numbered column (2 or 4).

Now, let's consider Clue 2: If the person watching time-travel movies is the person drinking iced-tea, then the person drinking iced-tea is in an odd-numbered column (1, 3, or 5). Since the person watching comedy movies and the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in the same column (Clue 2), the person watching time-travel movies must be the person drinking iced-tea. Thus, the person drinking iced-tea is in an odd-numbered column, and the person watching comedy movies is in an even-numbered column.

Given that the person eating peach is in column 3, the person watching comedy movies must be in column 2 or 4. Let's assume the person watching comedy movies is in column 2 for now.

```
|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |     4     |      5      |
| Beverage      | Argentine   |          | Peach       |           | American    |
| Food          |             |          |             |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   |             | Comedy   |             |           |             |
| Nationality   |             |          |             |           |             |
| Pet           |             |          |             |           |             |
```

The person watching time-travel movies is in column 1 or 3. Since the person drinking iced-tea must be in an odd-numbered column, the person watching time-travel movies is in column 1, and the person drinking iced-tea is in column 3.

```
|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |     4     |      5      |

| Food          |             |          |             |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel | Comedy   | Iced-tea    |           |             |
| Nationality   |             |          |             |           |             |
| Pet           |             |          |             |           |             |
```

Next, we place the person eating pineapple between the person eating peach and the person eating cucumber (Clue 10). Since the person eating peach is in column 3, the person eating pineapple must be in column 2, and the person eating cucumber must be in column 4.

```
|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |     4     |      5      |

| Food          |             |          |             |           |             |

| Pet           |             |          |             |           |             |
```

```

The person watching mystery movies is not to the right of the German (Clue 6), so the person watching mystery movies must be in column 1, and the German must be in column 3.

```
|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |     4     |      5      |

```

The person drinking 7up and the owner of the guinea-pig have different parity positions (Clue 12). Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in column 3 (odd), the person drinking 7up must be in an even-numbered column (2 or 4).

#### Deductions:
1. From clue 20, the person drinking 7up is at position 1 or 5 (odd positions).
2. From clue 22, since 7up is in an odd position, it must be in position 1 or 3 or 5.
3. From clue 24, the person eating garlic must also be in an odd position if 7up is in an odd position.
4. From clue 19, the person eating cherry is on the left of the person drinking juice.

9. From clue 26, the entrepreneur cannot be to the left of the person drinking 7up.
