### Initial Setup:
We need to assign:
- Beverage (B)
- Job (J)
- Movie Genre (M)
- Transport (T)

for four individuals (1, 2, 3, 4).

### Constraints Analysis:

1. **The person drinking iced-tea is not the person driving the scooter or the person drinking iced-tea is not the person watching crime movies or both.**
   - This means if someone drinks iced-tea, they cannot drive the scooter or watch crime movies.
   
2. **The person drinking milk and the software-developer have the same parity positions.**
   - This means if the software-developer is in an odd position, the person drinking milk must be in an odd position; if even, then even.

3. **The person drinking mirinda and the person driving the helicopter have different parity positions.**
   - If one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position.

4. **The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.**
   - T4 > B4

5. **The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.**
   - M1 or M4 = B1 or B4

6. **The mechanic is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.**
   - J1 or J4 = B1 or B4

7. **The person drinking milk is on the far left or far right.**
   - B1 or B4 = milk

8. **The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies.**
   - M3 or M4 > M1 or M2

9. **The person watching documentary movies is the person driving the scooter or the person watching documentary movies is the pilot or both.**
   - T4 = M4 or J4 = M4

10. **The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.**
    - M1 or M2 < M3 or M4

11. **The person drinking soy-milk is not to the right of the fisherman.**
    - B4 ≠ J3

12. **The fisherman is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies.**
    - J3 or J4 > M3 or M4

13. **The fisherman is on the left of the mechanic.**
    - J1 < J2

14. **The person driving the bike is not to the left of the person driving the scooter.**
    - T1 ≠ T2 and T1 < T2

15. **The person drinking mirinda is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.**
    - B4 ≠ T2

16. **The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike.**
    - T3 or T4 > T1 or T2

17. **The person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person watching crime movies.**
    - T2 ≠ M3 or M4

18. **The person watching documentary movies is the person driving the scooter.**
    - M4 = T4

19. **The pilot is not to the right of the person watching family movies.**
    - J3 or J4 > M3 or M4

20. **The mechanic is not to the left of the person driving the bike.**
    - J1 ≠ T1

### Solution Steps:

1. **From constraint 18:** 
   - M4 = T4 (The person watching documentary movies drives the scooter).

2. **From constraint 16:**
   - T3 or T4 > T1 or T2
   - Since T4 is already assigned, T3 must be to the right of T1 or T2.

3. **From constraint 14:**
   - T1 ≠ T2 and T1 < T2
   - So, T1 must be bike, T2 must be snowmobile, and T3 or T4 must be helicopter.

4. **From constraint 15:**
   - B4 ≠ T2 (Person drinking mirinda is not to the right of the person driving the scooter).
   - So, B4 can only be iced-tea, milk, or soy-milk.

5. **From constraint 7:**
   - B1 or B4 = milk
   - Let’s assume B1 = milk for now.

6. **From constraint 1:**
   - The person drinking iced-tea cannot drive the scooter or watch crime movies.
   - So, B4 cannot be iced-tea and M4 cannot be crime.

7. **From constraint 4:**
   - T4 > B4 (Person driving snowmobile is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk).

8. **From constraint 5:**
   - M1 or M4 = B1 or B4
   - Since B1 = milk, M1 or M4 must be milk.

9. **From constraint 8:**
   - M3 or M4 > M1 or M2
   - Since M1 or M4 must be milk, M3 or M4 must be documentary or family.

10. **From constraint 10:**
    - M1 or M2 < M3 or M4
    - So, M3 or M4 must be family.

11. **From constraint 12:**
    - J3 or J4 > M3 or M4
    - So, J3 or J4 must be pilot.

12. **From constraint 13:**
    - J1 < J2
    - So, J1 must be fisherman and J2 must be mechanic.

13. **From constraint 11:**
    - B4 ≠ J3
    - So, B4 must be soy-milk.

14. **From constraint 6:**
    - J1 or J4 = B1 or B4
    - Since B4 = soy-milk, J1 or J4 must be soy-milk.

15. **From constraint 2:**
    - The person drinking milk and the software-developer have the same parity positions.
    - Since B1 = milk, the software-developer must be in an odd position.

16. **From constraint 3:**
    - The person drinking mirinda and the person driving the helicopter have different parity positions.
    - So, B3 must be mirinda and T2 must be helicopter.

17. **From constraint 9:**
    - The person watching documentary movies is the person driving the scooter.
    - So, M4 = T4.

18. **From constraint 17:**
    - T2 ≠ M3 or M4
    - So, T2 must be bike.

19. **From constraint 19:**
    - The pilot is not to the right of the person watching family movies.
    - So, J3 or J4 must be pilot.

20. **From constraint 20:**
    - The mechanic is not to the left of the person driving the bike.
    - So, J2 must be mechanic.

### Final Solution Table:

```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The fan of punk is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Punk

2. **Clue 10**: The fan punk is somewhere to the left of the Pakistani.
   - This means the Pakistani cannot be in position 1.

3. **Clue 3**: The Pakistani and the fan punk have the same parity positions.
   - Since the fan punk is in position 1 (odd), the Pakistani must also be in an odd position (1, 3).

4. **Clue 10**: The fan punk is somewhere to the left of the Pakistani.
   - Since the fan punk is in position 1, the Pakistani must be in position 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The scientist is somewhere to the right of the dancer.
   - This means the scientist and dancer cannot be in the first two positions together.

6. **Clue 8**: The Malaysian is not the dancer.
   - So, the Malaysian could be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

7. **Clue 9**: The Polish is on the right of the police officer.
   - This means the Polish and police officer cannot be in the first two positions together.

8. **Clue 13**: The doctor is the person watching time-travel movies.
   - We need to place the doctor in a position that allows for the other constraints.

9. **Clue 5**: The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the Egyptian.
   - This means the Egyptian cannot be in the middle if the person watching satire movies is in the first or last position.

10. **Clue 6**: The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the scientist.
    - This means the scientist and action movie watcher cannot be in the first two positions together.

11. **Clue 12**: The person watching satire movies is somewhere between the person watching action movies and the fan trance.
    - This means the person watching satire movies is not at the extreme ends but in between the action movie watcher and the fan trance.

12. **Clue 14**: The person watching satire movies is somewhere between the person watching action movies and the fan trance.
    - This reinforces the previous clue.

13. **Clue 11**: The fan hip-hop is not to the left of the person watching time-travel movies.
    - This means the fan hip-hop cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the time-travel movie watcher is in position 3 or 4.

14. **Clue 7**: The Pakistani is not the fan hip-hop or the doctor is not the Pakistani or both.
    - Since the Pakistani is in position 3, they are not the fan hip-hop.

15. **Clue 15**: The person watching horror movies is not the fan hip-hop or the police officer is not the person watching horror movies or both.
    - This means the police officer is not the horror movie watcher if the fan hip-hop is not the horror movie watcher.

### Final Placement:

Let's place the elements based on these constraints:

1. Punk (Fan of Punk)
2. Hip-Hop (Fan of Hip-Hop)
3. Pakistani (Nationality)
4. Trance (Fan of Trance)

- The doctor watches time-travel movies and can only be in positions 2 or 4.

19. **Clue 19:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography.
20. **Clue 20:** The person driving the train is not to the left of the mechanic.

### Analysis:
- From Clue 2, the person driving the train (1) must be a specific person.
- From Clue 14, the lawyer (3) drives the snowmobile.
- From Clue 18, the chef (4) is the fan metal.
- From Clue 7, the person who's hobby is sudoku (4) is the fan punk.
- From Clue 10, the person who's hobby is sudoku (4) is not the chef (4), so this is consistent.
- From Clue 11, the person who's hobby is sudoku (4) is not to the right of the lawyer (3), so it must be in position 2 or 4.
- From Clue 15, the fan classical (1) is to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku (4).
- From Clue 12, the person driving the boat (3) is in an odd position, so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- From Clue 13, the person who's hobby is woodworking (4) is on the left or right of the person driving the boat (3).
- From Clue 19, the person who's hobby is woodworking (4) is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (1).

### Deduction:
- Since the person driving the train (1) is on the far left, let's place them as follows:
  - Train (1): Person A
  - Boat (3): Person B
  - Snowmobile (3): Lawyer (3)
  - Airplane (4): Mechanic

Since the lawyer drives the snowmobile and is in position 3, we can deduce:
- Train (1): Person A
- Boat (3): Lawyer (3)
- Snowmobile (3): Lawyer (3)
- Airplane (4): Mechanic

From Clue 14, the lawyer drives the snowmobile, so:
- Train (1): Person A
- Boat (3): Lawyer (3)
- Snowmobile (3): Lawyer (3)
- Airplane (4): Mechanic

Now, let's place the remaining positions:
- From Clue 7, the person who's hobby is sudoku (4) is the fan punk, so they must be in position 2 or 4.
- From Clue 15, the fan classical (1) is to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku (4).
- From Clue 18, the chef (4) is the fan metal, so they are in position 4.
- From Clue 10, the person who's hobby is sudoku (4) is not the chef (4), so it must be in position 2.
- From Clue 11, the person who's hobby is sudoku (4) is not to the right of the lawyer (3), so it must be in position 2.
- From Clue 19, the person who's hobby is woodworking (4) is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (1).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Train (1): Person A (Magic-Tricks)
- Boat (3): Lawyer (3) (Sudoku)
- Snowmobile (3): Lawyer (3) (Sudoku)
- Airplane (4): Mechanic (Photography)

Lv12-4x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the correct cells of the table. Let's break down the clues and solve step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the right of the person watching family movies.
2. The person watching family movies and the owner of the lizard have the same parity positions.
3. The person watching family movies is not the owner of the hedgehog.
4. The person who's hobby is drawing is the owner of the hedgehog or the person who's sport is rugby is the person who's hobby is drawing, but not both.
5. The person watching sports movies is not to the right of the owner of the rat.
6. The owner of the rat is between the person watching sports movies and the person who's sport is skiing.
7. The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing.
8. The person who's sport is sailing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
9. The person watching satire movies and the owner of the rat have different parity positions.
10. The person who's sport is skiing is the person who's hobby is drawing.
11. The person who's hobby is baking is not the person who's sport is sailing.
12. The owner of the turtle is not to the right of the owner of the turtle (redundant, likely a typo).
13. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person watching family movies.
14. The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
15. The person watching family movies is not the person who's sport is rugby or the person watching family movies is not the owner of the turtle or both.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 10**: The person who's sport is skiing is the person who's hobby is drawing.
2. **From Clue 4**: Since the person who's hobby is drawing is either the owner of the hedgehog or the person who's sport is rugby, and since the person who's hobby is drawing is the person who's sport is skiing, it must be that the person who's sport is rugby is not the person who's hobby is drawing. Therefore, the person who's hobby is drawing is the owner of the hedgehog.
3. **From Clue 3**: The person watching family movies is not the owner of the hedgehog. So, the person watching family movies cannot be the person who's hobby is drawing.
4. **From Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing (the person who's hobby is drawing). This means the person who's hobby is baking is to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.
5. **From Clue 13**: The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person watching family movies. This means the person who's hobby is video-games is either 3 or 4.
6. **From Clue 14**: The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. This means the person who's sport is sailing is either 3 or 4, and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is either 1 or 2.
7. **From Clue 2**: The person watching family movies and the owner of the lizard have the same parity positions. If the person watching family movies is 1 or 3, then the owner of the lizard is also 1 or 3.
8. **From Clue 5**: The person watching sports movies is not to the right of the owner of the rat. This means the person watching sports movies is either 1 or 2.
9. **From Clue 6**: The owner of the rat is between the person watching sports movies and the person who's sport is skiing. This means if the person watching sports movies is 1, the owner of the rat is 2, and the person who's sport is skiing is 3.
10. **From Clue 9**: The person watching satire movies and the owner of the rat have different parity positions. If the owner of the rat is 2 (even), then the person watching satire movies must be 1 (odd) or 3 (odd).
11. **From Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the right of the person watching family movies. If the person watching family movies is 1, then the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is 1 or 2.
12. **From Clue 8**: The person who's sport is sailing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. This means the person who's sport is sailing is 1 or 2, and the person who's sport is rugby is 3 or 4.
13. **From Clue 15**: The person watching family movies is not the person who's sport is rugby or the person watching family movies is not the owner of the turtle or both. Since the person who's sport is rugby is 3 or 4, the person watching family movies cannot be 3 or 4, so the person watching family movies must be 1 or 2.

### Final Placement:
- Person 1: Watching family movies, owning the lizard, hobby is baking.
- Person 2: Watching sports movies, owning the rat, hobby is rock-climbing.
- Person 3: Watching satire movies, owning the hedgehog, sport is sailing.
- Person 4: Watching animation movies, owning the turtle, sport is rugby.
