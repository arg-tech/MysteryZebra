**Constraint 16:** The person driving the boat is the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
**Constraint 17:** The person eating peas is on the far right.

#### 3. **Solving the Constraints**

**Step 1:** From Constraint 9, we know:
```
|               |     1      |       2       |    3    |
| Food          | kale      |               |         |
| Hobby         |            |               |         |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |         |
| Nationality   |            |               | Japanese|
| Pet           |            |               |         |
| Sport         |            |               |         |
| Transport     |            |               |         |
```

**Step 2:** From Constraint 10, we know:
```
|               |     1      |       2       |    3    |
| Food          | kale      |               |         |
| Hobby         | filmmaking|               |         |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |         |
| Nationality   |            |               | Japanese|
| Pet           |            |               |         |
| Sport         |            |               |         |
| Transport     |            |               |         |
```

**Step 3:** From Constraint 1, we know that the person eating kale can be the fan of trance or Polish or both. Since the person eating kale is the one with the filmmaking hobby (from constraint 10), we need to place them accordingly.

**Step 4:** From Constraint 2, the person eating kale cannot be to the right of the fan of ambient. So, the fan of ambient must be in position 1 or 2. Let's try placing the fan of ambient in position 1:
```
|               |     1      |       2       |    3    |
| Food          | kale      |               |         |
| Hobby         | filmmaking| ambient      |         |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |         |
| Nationality   |            |               | Japanese|
| Pet           |            |               |         |
| Sport         |            |               |         |
| Transport     |            |               |         |
```

**Step 5:** From Constraint 3, the person driving the quad-bike is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey or the fan of disco is not the person driving the quad-bike or both. Let's assume the fan of disco is not the person driving the quad-bike. We will determine the sport later.

**Step 6:** From Constraint 4, the fan of disco is not the person eating peas or the fan of disco is not the Polish or both. Since the person eating kale is the Polish (from constraint 1), the fan of disco cannot be the Polish.

**Step 7:** From Constraint 5, the owner of the ferret is the person who's hobby is baking or the person who's hobby is baking is the person who's sport is skateboarding or both. Let's assume the owner of the ferret has the baking hobby.

**Step 8:** From Constraint 6, the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit. If the owner of the ferret is in position 3, then the owner of the rabbit must be in position 1 or 2.

**Step 9:** From Constraint 7, the person eating papaya is between the person eating kale and the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person eating kale is in position 1 and the person who's hobby is camping cannot be in position 1 or 3, it must be in position 2.

**Step 10:** From Constraint 8, the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person driving the boat have the same parity positions. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the fan of ambient (position 1), the person driving the boat must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

**Step 11:** From Constraint 11, the person eating kale and the owner of the turtle have different parity positions. Since the person eating kale is in position 1 (odd), the owner of the turtle must be in an even position (2 or 3).

**Step 12:** From Constraint 12, the fan of ambient is the person who's sport is ice-hockey. So, the person driving the boat must be in position 3.

**Step 13:** From Constraint 13, the Mexican is the person eating peas or the person eating peas is the person who's hobby is baking, but not both. Since the person eating kale is the Polish, the Mexican must be the person eating peas.

**Step 14:** From Constraint 14, the person driving the quad-bike is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person driving the boat is in position 3, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1 or 2.

**Step 15:** From Constraint 15, the person driving the car is the person who's hobby is filmmaking or the person driving the car is the fan of trance, but not both. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 2, the person driving the car must be the fan of trance.

**Step 16:** From Constraint 16, the person driving the boat is the person who's hobby is filmmaking. So, the person driving the boat must be in position 1.

**Step 17:** From Constraint 17, the person eating peas is on the far right. So, the person eating peas must be in position 3.

#### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |       2       |    3    |
| Food          | kale      | papaya      | peas   |
| Hobby         | filmmaking| trance      | camping|
| Music-Genre   | ambient   | disco       | trance |
| Nationality   | polish    | mexican     | japanese|
| Pet           | ferret    | rabbit      | turtle |
| Sport         | ice-hockey| skateboarding| skiing |
| Transport     | boat      | car         | quad-bike|
```
