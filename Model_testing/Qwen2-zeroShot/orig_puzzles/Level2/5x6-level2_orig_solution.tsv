Lv2-5x6-8	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 15**: The owner of the hamster is the person eating cherry.
2. **Clue 3**: The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person eating cherry. Since the owner of the hamster is eating cherry, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 2 or 3.
3. **Clue 12**: The owner of the frog is on the far right (position 6).
4. **Clue 14**: The owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the frog. So, the owner of the mouse is in position 5.
5. **Clue 1**: The person watching sports movies is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla can only be in positions 2 or 3, the person watching sports movies must be in position 4 or 5. But since the owner of the frog is in position 6, the owner of the chinchilla cannot be in position 3. Thus, the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2 and the person watching sports movies is in position 4.
6. **Clue 7**: The person eating broccoli is the person watching martial-arts movies. Broccoli is not eaten by the owner of the hamster, so the person watching martial-arts movies is not in position 2.
7. **Clue 10**: The person eating cherry is on the right of the person driving the trike. Since the owner of the hamster is eating cherry, the person driving the trike must be in position 1.
8. **Clue 5**: The person eating broccoli is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the person driving the trike is in position 1, the person eating broccoli must be in position 3 or 4. But the person watching sports movies is in position 4, so the person eating broccoli must be in position 3.
9. **Clue 2**: The person drinking cola is between the person driving the jet-ski and the owner of the pony.

10. **Clue 17**: The person driving the subway is on the left of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is in position 5, the person driving the subway must be in position 4.
11. **Clue 11**: The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person watching sports movies is in position 4, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 3.
12. **Clue 6**: The person drinking coffee is between the person driving the bike and the person eating eggplant. Since the person eating broccoli is in position 3 and the person watching mystery movies is in position 3, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2.
13. **Clue 16**: The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking cola is in position 5 and the person drinking tea cannot be in position 5, the person drinking tea must be in position 4, and the person drinking lemonade must be in position 5 (but we already know this from Clue 2).
14. **Clue 8**: The person driving the trike is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person driving the trike is in position 1, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2.
15. **Clue 9**: The person eating papaya is the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching sports movies is in position 4 and the person watching mystery movies is in position 3, the person watching spy movies must be in position 1.
