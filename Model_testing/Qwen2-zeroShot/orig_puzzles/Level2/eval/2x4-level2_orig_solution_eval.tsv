Lv2-2x4-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking cola is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the far left.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking juice.
4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking water is on the far left.
5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola.

From Clue 4, we know:
- Water is on the far left (Position 1).

From Clue 2, we know:
- Weightlifting is on the far left (Position 1), so it must be the same as the person drinking water.

So, the first row looks like this:
```
|            |       1       |    2    |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage   |   Water       |         |          |            |
| Sport      | Weightlifting |         |          |            |
```

From Clue 1, the person drinking cola is to the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the person with weightlifting is in Position 1, the person with soccer cannot be in Position 1 or 2. Therefore, soccer must be in Position 3 or 4, and cola must be in Position 4.

From Clue 3, the person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking juice. This means that the sequence for sports must be:
- Ice-hockey, soccer, juice, or
- Juice, soccer, ice-hockey

Since soccer must be in Position 3 or 4 and cola must be in Position 4, the only possible positions for soccer and cola are:
- Soccer in Position 3 and cola in Position 4, or
- Soccer in Position 4 and cola in Position 5 (but there is no Position 5, so it must be Position 3 and 4).

Let's assume soccer is in Position 3 and cola is in Position 4. Then the sequence is:
- Ice-hockey in Position 2
- Soccer in Position 3
- Juice in Position 2 (since it can't be in Position 3)

So, the second row looks like this:
```
|            |       1       |    2    |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage   |   Water       |         |          | Cola       |
| Sport      | Weightlifting | Ice-hockey | Soccer  |            |
```

Now, from Clue 5, the person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola. Since cola is in Position 4 and juice is in Position 2, lemonade must be in Position 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
```
|            |       1       |    2    |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage   |   Water       | Juice   | Lemonade | Cola       |
| Sport      | Weightlifting | Ice-hockey | Soccer  |            |
```

The final solution table is:

```
|            |       1       |    2    |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage   |   Water       | Juice   | Lemonade | Cola       |

Lv2-2x4-2	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The Turkish person is between the person whose hobby is reading and the Colombian.
2. The person whose hobby is video-games is on the far right (position 4).
3. The Dutch person is on the right of the British.
4. The person whose hobby is gardening is on the left of the British.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Video-Games
Since the person with the hobby of video-games is on the far right (position 4), we can place that as follows:
```
|               |      1       |     2     |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         |              |           |         | video-games |
| Nationality   |              |           |         |            |
```

#### Step 2: Positioning Gardening and British
The person with the hobby of gardening is on the left of the British. This means the British cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to the left). So, let's consider possible positions for the British and Gardening:

- If British is in position 2, then Gardening must be in position 1.
- If British is in position 3, then Gardening must be in position 1 or 2.

Let's try these possibilities.

##### Case 1: British in position 2
```
|               |      1       |     2     |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | gardening    |           |         | video-games |
| Nationality   |              | british   |         |            |
```

Now, we need to fit the remaining nationalities (Turkish, Colombian, Dutch) into positions 1 and 3. But this doesn't fit clue 1 because the Turkish person needs to be between the reader and the Colombian.

##### Case 2: British in position 3
```
|               |      1       |     2     |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | gardening    |           | british | video-games |
| Nationality   |              |           |         |            |
```

Here, we need to fit the remaining nationalities (Turkish, Colombian, Dutch) into positions 1 and 2. Let's check if this fits all the clues.

#### Step 3: Fitting Turkish and Colombian
Clue 1 states that the Turkish person is between the person whose hobby is reading and the Colombian. So, let's place the Turkish person in position 2 and the Colombian in position 1 or 3.

##### Sub-case 2.1: Turkish in position 2, Colombian in position 1
```
|               |      1       |     2     |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | reading      | gardening | british | video-games |
| Nationality   | colombian    | turkish   |         |            |
```

Now, the Dutch person must be in position 3 (right of the British).

```
|               |      1       |     2     |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | reading      | gardening | dutch   | video-games |
| Nationality   | colombian    | turkish   | british |            |
```

This fits all the clues perfectly:
1. The Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian.
2. The person with video-games is in position 4.
3. The Dutch person is to the right of the British.
4. The person with gardening is to the left of the British.

### Final Solution:
```
|               |      1       |     2     |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | reading      | gardening | dutch   | video-games |
| Nationality   | colombian    | turkish   | british |            |

Lv2-2x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and place the information into the table step by step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The Colombian is on the right of the person eating kale.**
2. **The Colombian is between the British and the person eating corn.**
3. **The British is on the far left.**
4. **The French is on the left of the person eating cranberry.**
5. **The person eating corn is the French.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3: The British is on the far left.**
   - This means the British person is in position 1.
   
2. **Clue 5: The person eating corn is the French.**
   - Since the French is on the left of the person eating cranberry (Clue 4), the French must be in position 2 or 3. But since the British is in position 1, the French must be in position 2 (because if French were in position 3, there would be no space to the left for the cranberry).
   - So, the French is in position 2, and they are eating corn.

3. **Clue 4: The French is on the left of the person eating cranberry.**
   - Since the French is in position 2, the person eating cranberry must be in position 3 or 4. Let's denote the person eating cranberry as X for now.

4. **Clue 2: The Colombian is between the British and the person eating corn.**
   - The British is in position 1 and the French (eating corn) is in position 2. Therefore, the Colombian must be in position 3.

5. **Clue 1: The Colombian is on the right of the person eating kale.**
   - Since the Colombian is in position 3, the person eating kale must be in position 2, but we already know that position 2 is occupied by the French. This means our initial assumption about the positions needs adjustment.
   - Revisiting the clues, the French (corn) cannot be in position 2 because it would violate clue 1. Thus, the French must be in position 3, and the person eating cranberry must be in position 4.

6. **Revised positions:**
   - British in position 1.
   - French (corn) in position 3.
   - Colombian in position 2.
   - Cranberry in position 4.

7. **Clue 1: The Colombian is on the right of the person eating kale.**
   - The only remaining position for the person eating kale is position 1, which is occupied by the British. This means the person eating kale must be in position 4, and the cranberry must be in position 3.

8. **Final assignments:**
   - Position 1: British, eating kale.
   - Position 2: Colombian, eating cranberry.
   - Position 3: French, eating corn.
   - Position 4: Person eating cranberry (this conflicts with the previous step, so re-evaluate).

### Correct Final Solution:
- Position 1: British, eating kale.
- Position 2: Colombian, eating cranberry.
- Position 3: French, eating corn.
- Position 4: Cranberry (conflict resolved by correct placement).

### Final Table:
```

Lv2-2x4-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is biathlon is the owner of the lizard.
   - This means the person in position 4 (rightmost) has a lizard as their pet.

2. **Clue 2**: The owner of the cat is between the person who's sport is basketball and the owner of the rat.
   - This means the person with the cat is not in positions 1 or 4, and they must be in position 2 or 3. Also, the person with basketball is to the left of the person with the cat, and the person with the rat is to the right of the person with the cat.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is biathlon is on the far right.
   - This confirms that the person in position 4 has biathlon and a lizard.

4. **Clue 4**: The owner of the cat is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby.
   - This means the person with the cat is to the right of the person with rugby. Since the person with the cat can only be in positions 2 or 3, the person with rugby must be in position 1.

Now let's place these pieces into the table:

- Position 4 (far right) has biathlon and a lizard.
- Position 1 must have rugby because the owner of the cat is to the right of the person with rugby.
- The owner of the cat cannot be in position 1 or 4, so it must be in either position 2 or 3.

Given Clue 2:
- If the owner of the cat is in position 2, then the person with basketball would be in position 1, which conflicts with Clue 4 (the owner of the cat is to the right of the person with rugby).
- Therefore, the owner of the cat must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rugby
- Position 2: Basketball (since the owner of the cat is between rugby and the person with the rat)
- Position 3: Cat
- Position 4: Biathlon (and the lizard)

Now, we need to assign the remaining sports and pets:
- The owner of the rat must be in position 1 or 2, but since position 1 is rugby and position 2 is basketball, the owner of the rat must be in position 1 or 2. Given the placement, the owner of the rat is in position 1, leaving the pony for position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Rugby (rat)
- Position 2: Basketball (pony)
- Position 3: Cat
- Position 4: Biathlon (lizard)

The final solution table is:

```
|         |   1   |   2    |     3      |    4     |
| Pet     | Rat   | Pony   | Cat        | Lizard   |

Lv2-2x4-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
2. **Clue 2**: The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the far left.
3. **Clue 3**: The person whose hobby is card-games is on the far right.
4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking soy-milk is between the person whose hobby is card-games and the person whose hobby is dancing.

We need to fill in the table with the beverages and hobbies accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of Magic-Tricks**:
   - From Clue 2, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 1.
   
   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |       4       |

   | Hobby      | magic-tricks |          |           |               |

2. **Position of Card-Games**:
   - From Clue 3, the person whose hobby is card-games is in position 4.
   
   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |       4       |
   | Beverage   |              |          |           |               |
   | Hobby      | magic-tricks |          |           | card-games    |

3. **Position of Soy-Milk**:
   - From Clue 4, the person drinking soy-milk is between the person whose hobby is card-games (position 4) and the person whose hobby is dancing.
   - Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 3.
   
   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |       4       |

   | Hobby      | magic-tricks |          |           | card-games    |

4. **Position of Fanta and Iced-Tea**:
   - From Clue 1, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - The only positions left for fanta and iced-tea are 1 and 2.
   - Since magic-tricks is in position 1, fanta must be in position 2, and iced-tea must be in position 3 (but we already have soy-milk there).
   - This means that fanta must be in position 2 and iced-tea must be in position 3, but since position 3 is taken by soy-milk, we need to re-evaluate.

   Re-evaluating:
   - Position 1 has magic-tricks.
   - Position 4 has card-games.
   - Position 3 has soy-milk.
   - Therefore, position 2 must have fanta, and position 3 must have iced-tea.

   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |       4       |

   | Hobby      | magic-tricks |          |           | card-games    |

5. **Determine Dancing**:
   - The only remaining hobby is dancing, which must be in position 2.
   
   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |       4       |

6. **Final Table**:
   - We now have all the information filled in.
   
   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |       4       |

Lv2-2x4-6	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour.
2. The fan of salsa is the person who's sport is rowing.
3. The fan of salsa is on the far right.
4. The fan of d&b is the person who's sport is cycling.
5. The fan of pop is between the fan of classical and the fan of d&b.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From point 2 and 3:**
   - The fan of salsa (rowing) is on the far right (position 4).

2. **From point 1:**
   - The person who's sport is rowing (salsa) is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour.
   - Therefore, the person with parkour must be in position 1 or 2, and the person with rowing must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **From point 4:**
   - The fan of d&b is the person who's sport is cycling.
   - So, the person with cycling is the fan of d&b.

4. **From point 5:**
   - The fan of pop is between the fan of classical and the fan of d&b.
   - This means the order of the sports must be such that the fan of pop is sandwiched between the fan of classical and the fan of d&b.

Given these constraints, let's deduce the positions:

- Since the fan of salsa (rowing) is on the far right (position 4), the person with parkour can only be in position 1 or 2.
- The person with rowing (salsa) must be in position 2 or 3.
- The person with cycling (d&b) must be in position 1, 2, or 3 but not in the same position as the person with rowing (salsa).
- The fan of pop is between the fan of classical and the fan of d&b (cycling).

Let's try to fit all these pieces together:

- If the person with parkour is in position 1, then the person with rowing (salsa) must be in position 2.
- This leaves position 3 for the fan of pop, which must be between the fan of classical and the fan of d&b (cycling).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Parkour
- Position 2: Salsa (rowing)
- Position 3: Pop
- Position 4: D&b (cycling)

Now, let's fill in the music genres based on the remaining information:
- The fan of d&b (cycling) is in position 4, so the fan of pop (position 3) must be between the fan of classical and the fan of d&b.
- This means the fan of classical must be in position 1 or 2, but since position 2 is already occupied by salsa, it must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Classical
- Position 2: Salsa (rowing)
- Position 3: Pop
- Position 4: D&b (cycling)

4. The person driving the helicopter is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person driving the helicopter (Sport 4) is on the far right.
   - Therefore, Sport 4 = Lacrosse and Transport 4 = Helicopter.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is biathlon is on the far left.
   - Therefore, Sport 1 = Biathlon and Transport 1 = ?

3. **Clue 1**: The person driving the helicopter (Lacrosse) is on the far right.
   - This confirms that Transport 4 = Helicopter and Sport 4 = Lacrosse.

4. **Clue 2**: The person driving the motorbike is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person driving the roller.
   - This means the order for sports and transport must be such that the person with soccer is not adjacent to the person with roller, but the person with motorbike is in between them.

Given these constraints, let's assign the remaining sports and transports:

- Since Transport 4 is Helicopter, Transport 1 must be something other than Helicopter.
- Since the person with biathlon (Sport 1) is on the far left, Transport 1 could be any of the remaining options: motorbike, roller, or snowmobile.
- The person with soccer must be either Transport 2 or Transport 3, and the person with roller must be the other one, with motorbike in between.

Let's try to fit the remaining sports and transports:

- **Sport 1 = Biathlon** and **Transport 1 = Snowmobile** (since we need to place roller and motorbike in between).
- **Sport 2 = Soccer** and **Transport 2 = Motorbike** (as it is between roller and another sport).
- **Sport 3 = Roller** and **Transport 3 = ?** (it must be roller since motorbike is already assigned to Transport 2).

So, the final arrangement would be:

|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Sport       | Biathlon | Soccer        | Roller     | Lacrosse   |
| Transport   | Snowmobile | Motorbike    | Roller     | Helicopter |

Lv2-2x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the jobs and transportation modes accordingly.

Let's break down the clues:

1. **The librarian is between the person driving the boat and the dressmaker.**
2. **The person driving the van is on the left of the dressmaker.**
3. **The videographer is on the right of the dressmaker.**
4. **The person driving the boat is on the left of the person driving the van.**
5. **The dressmaker is on the left of the person driving the ship.**

First, let's list out the positions and what we know about them:
- Position 1: (Leftmost)
- Position 2: 
- Position 3: 
- Position 4: (Rightmost)

From clue 4, the person driving the boat is on the left of the person driving the van. This gives us two possible sequences for these two positions:
- Boat, Van
- Van, Boat

From clue 2, the person driving the van is on the left of the dressmaker. So, the sequence must be:
- Boat, Van, Dressmaker

From clue 5, the dressmaker is on the left of the person driving the ship. Therefore, the sequence must be:
- Boat, Van, Dressmaker, Ship

This leaves us with one position for the librarian and the videographer. From clue 1, the librarian is between the person driving the boat and the dressmaker. Given our current sequence (Boat, Van, Dressmaker, Ship), the librarian must be in position 2.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Boat
- Position 2: Librarian
- Position 3: Van
- Position 4: Dressmaker, Ship

From clue 3, the videographer is on the right of the dressmaker. Since the only remaining job is videographer, the videographer must be in position 4 and the dressmaker in position 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Boat
- Position 2: Librarian
- Position 3: Van
- Position 4: Dressmaker, Ship

Now, we need to assign the jobs and transportation modes. We know:
- The librarian is not the driver of the boat or van.
- The person driving the van is not the dressmaker.
- The dressmaker is not the driver of the ship.
- The videographer is on the right of the dressmaker.

Given the jobs and transportation modes:
- Dressmaker can't drive the boat, van, or ship.
- Entrepreneur is not specified but must fit the remaining roles.

So, we can assign:
- Position 1 (Boat): Entrepreneur
- Position 2 (Librarian): Videographer
- Position 3 (Van): Dressmaker
- Position 4 (Ship): Entrepreneur

However, since the videographer is on the right of the dressmaker, and we need to ensure all jobs and transports are correctly placed, the correct assignments are:
- Position 1 (Boat): Entrepreneur
- Position 2 (Librarian): Videographer
- Position 3 (Van): Entrepreneur
- Position 4 (Ship): Dressmaker

Since the videographer cannot be the dressmaker, the correct assignment should be:
- Position 1 (Boat): Entrepreneur
- Position 2 (Librarian): Videographer
- Position 3 (Van): Entrepreneur
- Position 4 (Ship): Librarian

Final solution:

Lv2-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person eating plum.
2. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person eating peach.
3. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person eating garlic.
4. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
5. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person eating garlic and the person who's sport is tennis.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- Ice-hockey (I) is to the right of Plum (P).

#### Clue 2:
- Swimming (S) is to the right of Peach (Pe).

#### Clue 3:
- Avocado (A) is to the right of Garlic (Ga).

#### Clue 4:
- Swimming (S) is to the right of Ice-hockey (I).

#### Clue 5:
- Ice-hockey (I) is between Garlic (Ga) and Tennis (T).

From Clue 5, we can deduce that the order for these three is: Garlic (Ga), Ice-hockey (I), Tennis (T).

Now let's fit all the clues together:

1. From Clue 1: I must be to the right of P.
2. From Clue 4: S must be to the right of I.
3. From Clue 5: Ga, I, T must be in that order.

So far, we have:
- Ga -> I -> T
- I is to the right of P, so P cannot be in the last position.
- S is to the right of I, so S cannot be in the first or second positions.

Given these constraints, the only possible order is:
- P (Plum)
- I (Ice-hockey)
- T (Tennis)
- S (Swimming)

Now, we need to fit Avocado (A) and Garlic (Ga) into the remaining positions. From Clue 3, A is to the right of Ga. So, the only possible arrangement for the food is:
- Garlic (Ga) -> Avocado (A)

Putting it all together, we get:

|         |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4     |
| Food    | Garlic | Avocado    |          |          |
| Sport   | Swimming | Ice-hockey | Tennis  | Baseball |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4     |
| Food    | Garlic | Avocado    |          |          |
| Sport   | Swimming | Ice-hockey | Tennis  | Baseball |
