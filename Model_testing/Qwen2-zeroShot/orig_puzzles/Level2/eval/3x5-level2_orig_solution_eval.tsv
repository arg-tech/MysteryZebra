10. The person eating papaya is on the right of the person whose hobby is board-games.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 9**: The person driving the boat is the person eating carrot.
   - This places the person eating carrot in position 1 (leftmost).

2. **Clue 4**: The person driving the roller is on the far left.
   - This places the person driving the roller in position 1 (leftmost).
   
   Since both positions 1 are occupied by the same person, we need to resolve this. The only way this can happen is if there is a mistake in interpretation or an overlap in clues. However, let's proceed with the correct interpretation that the person driving the roller and the person eating carrot are separate individuals.

3. **Clue 1**: The person whose hobby is singing is on the far left.
   - This places the person with the hobby of singing in position 1.

4. **Clue 5**: The person whose hobby is singing is on the left of the person whose hobby is video-games.
   - This confirms the person with the hobby of singing is in position 1.

5. **Clue 2**: The person eating zucchini is between the person eating garlic and the person driving the train.
   - Let's denote the positions as follows:
     - Position 1: Singing
     - Position 2: ?
     - Position 3: ?
     - Position 4: ?
     - Position 5: ?

6. **Clue 3**: The person driving the boat is between the person driving the train and the person driving the taxi.
   - This means the person driving the boat is not at positions 1 or 5.

7. **Clue 8**: The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the boat.
   - This means the person driving the taxi is in position 5.

8. **Clue 6**: The person driving the subway is on the left of the person whose hobby is woodworking.
   - This means the person driving the subway is in position 1 or 2.

9. **Clue 7**: The person whose hobby is board-games is on the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
   - This means the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 1 or 2.

10. **Clue 10**: The person eating papaya is on the right of the person whose hobby is board-games.
    - This means the person eating papaya is in position 3, 4, or 5.

### Final Placement:

Based on the clues, we can place the items as follows:

1. **Position 1**: Singing (person driving the boat, eating carrot)
2. **Position 2**: Roller (person eating garlic)
3. **Position 3**: Zucchini (person driving the train)
4. **Position 4**: Papaya (person eating papaya)
5. **Position 5**: Video-games (person driving the taxi)

Now, let's fill in the food and hobbies:

1. **Hobby**: Singing (Food: Carrot)
2. **Hobby**: Roller (Food: Garlic)
3. **Hobby**: Train (Food: Zucchini)
4. **Hobby**: Papaya (Food: Unknown)
5. **Hobby**: Video-games (Food: Unknown)

We need to assign the remaining foods and hobbies:

- **Woodworking**: Needs to be on the right of the subway driver.
- **Papaya**: Needs to be on the right of board-games.
- **Video-games**: Needs to be on the right of the person with the hobby of singing.

Given the constraints, we can deduce:

- **Position 4**: Papaya (Hobby: Board-games)
- **Position 5**: Video-games (Hobby: Woodworking)

Final placement:

1. **Hobby**: Singing (Food: Carrot)
2. **Hobby**: Roller (Food: Garlic)
3. **Hobby**: Train (Food: Zucchini)
4. **Hobby**: Board-games (Food: Papaya)
5. **Hobby**: Woodworking (Food: Unknown)

Lv2-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Analyze Clue 6
- The software-developer is the person driving the ship.
- This gives us:
  - Job 6: Software-developer
  - Transport 6: Ship

### Step 2: Analyze Clue 9
- The person driving the airplane is on the left of the egyptian.
- This gives us:
  - Transport 1: Airplane (leftmost)
  - Nationality 1: Egyptian

### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the egyptian.
- Since the egyptian is at position 1, the motorbike must be at position 2.
- This gives us:
  - Transport 2: Motorbike
  - Nationality 2: [To be determined]

### Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The person driving the taxi is between the french and the person driving the airplane.
- Since the airplane is at position 1, the taxi must be at position 3 or 4.
- The french cannot be at position 2 (since the motorbike is there) or at position 1 or 5 (since they must be between the taxi and the airplane).
- Therefore, the taxi must be at position 3 and the french at position 4.
- This gives us:
  - Transport 3: Taxi
  - Transport 4: French
  - Nationality 3: [To be determined]
  - Nationality 4: French

### Step 5: Analyze Clue 7
- The person driving the taxi is on the left of the french.
- This is consistent with our previous placement of the taxi and french.

### Step 6: Analyze Clue 5
- The librarian is on the right of the egyptian.
- Since the egyptian is at position 1, the librarian must be at position 3 or 4.
- But we already have the taxi at position 3 and the french at position 4.
- Therefore, the librarian must be at position 5.
- This gives us:
  - Nationality 5: Librarian

### Step 7: Analyze Clue 3
- The architect is on the left of the software-developer.
- Since the software-developer is at position 6, the architect must be at position 1 or 2.
- But the egyptian is at position 1, so the architect must be at position 2.
- This gives us:
  - Job 2: Architect
  - Nationality 2: [To be determined]

### Step 8: Analyze Clue 4
- The librarian is between the person driving the trike and the chef.
- Since the librarian is at position 5, the trike and the chef must be at positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- We already have the taxi at position 3 and the french at position 4, so the trike and chef must be at positions 2 and 3.
- But the architect is at position 2, so the trike must be at position 2 and the chef at position 3.
- This gives us:
  - Transport 2: Trike
  - Job 3: Chef

### Step 9: Analyze Clue 8
- The indonesian is on the left of the chef.
- Since the chef is at position 3, the indonesian must be at position 1.
- This gives us:
  - Nationality 1: Indonesian

### Step 10: Analyze Clue 10
- The american is on the left of the argentine.
- Since the egyptian is at position 1 and the indonesian is also at position 1, the american must be at position 2.
- This gives us:
  - Nationality 2: American
  - Nationality 4: Argentine

Lv2-3x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the correct positions. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The nurse is on the left of the owner of the pony.**
   - This means the nurse cannot be in position 4 or 5.
   
2. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the videographer and the person who's sport is surfing.**
   - This implies that the sequence must be videographer, weightlifter, surfer or surfer, weightlifter, videographer.
   
3. **The owner of the pony is the person who's sport is parkour.**
   - The owner of the pony does parkour.
   
4. **The videographer is on the left of the police-officer.**
   - The videographer cannot be in position 4 or 5.
   
5. **The owner of the dog is on the far left.**
   - The owner of the dog is in position 1.
   
6. **The videographer is on the far left.**
   - The videographer is in position 1.
   
7. **The owner of the goldfish is between the analyst and the owner of the lizard.**
   - This means the owner of the goldfish is not in position 1 or 5.
   
8. **The dressmaker is in the middle.**
   - The dressmaker is in position 3.
   
9. **The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left.**
   - The person who does snowboarding is in position 1, but since the videographer is also in position 1, this must mean the person who does snowboarding is the videographer (which contradicts clue 4, so re-evaluate).

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- **Position 1:** The owner of the dog and the videographer.
- **Position 3:** The dressmaker.
- **Position 5:** The owner of the pony (who does parkour).

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the rest:

- Since the videographer is in position 1 and the owner of the dog is also in position 1, this is a contradiction unless the person who does snowboarding is the videographer, which contradicts clue 4. Therefore, the person who does snowboarding must be the owner of the dog, and the videographer must be in position 2.

- **Position 2:** The owner of the dog (who does snowboarding).
- **Position 4:** The person who does weightlifting.
- **Position 5:** The owner of the pony (who does parkour).

Since the videographer is in position 2, the weightlifter must be in position 4, and the surfer must be in position 3.

- **Position 1:** The owner of the dog (who does snowboarding) and the videographer.
- **Position 2:** The owner of the dog (who does snowboarding).
- **Position 3:** The dressmaker (who does surfing).
- **Position 4:** The videographer (who does weightlifting).
- **Position 5:** The owner of the pony (who does parkour).

Now, let's assign the jobs and pets based on the remaining constraints:

- **Position 1:** The owner of the dog (who does snowboarding). This person is the videographer.
- **Position 2:** The owner of the dog (who does snowboarding).
- **Position 3:** The dressmaker (who does surfing).
- **Position 4:** The videographer (who does weightlifting).
- **Position 5:** The owner of the pony (who does parkour).

The only jobs left are analyst and police-officer. Since the nurse is not in position 4 or 5, and the videographer is in position 2, the nurse must be in position 3, making the dressmaker the nurse. This leaves the police-officer for position 5.

- **Position 1:** The owner of the dog (who does snowboarding) and the videographer (dressed as a nurse).
- **Position 2:** The owner of the dog (who does snowboarding).
- **Position 3:** The dressmaker (who does surfing and is the nurse).
- **Position 4:** The videographer (who does weightlifting and is the nurse).
- **Position 5:** The owner of the pony (who does parkour and is the police-officer).

Finally, we assign the pets:

- The owner of the dog (position 1) has the goldfish.
- The owner of the pony (position 5) has the lizard.
- The owner of the goldfish (position 3) has the turtle.
- The owner of the lizard (position 3) has the goldfish.
- The owner of the turtle (position 5) has the pony.

2. **From Clue 6:** The owner of the pony is the fan of r&b.
3. **From Clue 8:** The person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the pony.
   - Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk is the fan of r&b.
4. **From Clue 1:** The person drinking soy-milk (r&b) is on the left of the owner of the dog.
   - So, the owner of the dog must be in position 2 or 3.
5. **From Clue 7:** The owner of the snake is the fan of country.
6. **From Clue 5:** The owner of the turtle is on the right of the fan of country.
   - Since the fan of country is the owner of the snake, the owner of the turtle must be in position 4 or 5.
7. **From Clue 2:** The person drinking tea is between the fan of country and the fan of r&b.
   - The fan of country is the owner of the snake, and the fan of r&b is the person drinking soy-milk.
   - Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 3.
8. **From Clue 3:** The fan of r&b is on the right of the person drinking cola.
   - The fan of r&b is the person drinking soy-milk, so the person drinking cola must be in position 1.
9. **From Clue 9:** The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
   - The person drinking 7up is the fan of classical, so the person drinking sprite must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Since the person drinking cola is in position 1, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2.
10. **From Clue 10:** The fan of ambient is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
    - The fan of ambient must be in position 1, which is already occupied by the person drinking cola.
    - Therefore, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2, and the fan of ambient must be in position 3 (which is already occupied by the person drinking tea).
    - This implies that the person drinking sprite must be in position 4, and the fan of ambient must be in position 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Middle Position
From Clue 2, the person drinking water is in the middle (position 3).

|             |      1      |    2     | **3**    |    4     |     5      |
| Beverage    |             |          | **water**|          |            |
| Pet         |             |          | **?**    |          |            |
| Transport   |             |          | **?**    |          |            |

#### Step 2: Determine the Order of Beverages
From Clue 3, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Therefore, positions 1 and 4 must be filled with these two beverages.

|             | **almond-milk** |    2     | **3**    | **soy-milk** |     5      |
| Beverage    |                 |          | **water**|            |            |
| Pet         |                 |          | **?**    |            |            |
| Transport   |                 |          | **?**    |            |            |

#### Step 3: Determine the Owner of Hedgehog
From Clue 4, the owner of the hedgehog is the person drinking lemonade. Therefore, position 2 must be the lemonade drinker.

|             | **almond-milk** | **lemonade** | **3**    | **soy-milk** |     5      |
| Beverage    |                 |             | **water**|            |            |
| Pet         |                 | **hedgehog** | **?**    |            |            |
| Transport   |                 |             | **?**    |            |            |

#### Step 4: Determine the Transport and Ownership Relationships
From Clue 9, the owner of the lizard is between the person driving the ship and the person driving the van. From Clue 6, the person driving the van is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Therefore, the owner of the lizard must be in position 2 or 3.

Since position 2 is already occupied by the hedgehog, the owner of the lizard must be in position 3.

|             | **almond-milk** | **lemonade** | **lizard** | **soy-milk** |     5      |
| Beverage    |                 |             | **water**  |            |            |
| Pet         |                 | **hedgehog** | **lizard** |            |            |
| Transport   |                 |             | **?**      |            |            |

From Clue 5, the owner of the turtle is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the owner of the lizard is in position 3, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1 or 2. But since position 2 is already occupied, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1.

|             | **turtle**      | **lemonade** | **lizard** | **soy-milk** |     5      |
| Beverage    |                 |             | **water**  |            |            |
| Pet         |                 | **hedgehog** | **lizard** |            |            |
| Transport   |                 |             | **?**      |            |            |

From Clue 1, the owner of the fish is on the left of the person driving the ship. Therefore, the owner of the fish must be in position 1.

|             | **fish**        | **lemonade** | **lizard** | **soy-milk** |     5      |
| Beverage    |                 |             | **water**  |            |            |

| Transport   |                 |             | **ship**   |            |            |

From Clue 8, the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Therefore, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 5.

|             | **fish**        | **lemonade** | **lizard** | **soy-milk** | **helicopter** |
| Beverage    |                 |             | **water**  |            |              |
| Pet         |                 | **hedgehog** | **lizard** |            |              |
| Transport   |                 |             | **ship**   |            | **van**       |

From Clue 6, the person driving the van is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the owner of the lizard is in position 3, the person driving the van must be in position 4.

|             | **fish**        | **lemonade** | **lizard** | **soy-milk** | **helicopter** |
| Beverage    |                 |             | **water**  |            |              |
| Pet         |                 | **hedgehog** | **lizard** |            |              |
| Transport   |                 |             | **ship**   | **van**     | **helicopter** |

From Clue 10, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 2, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 4.

|             | **fish**        | **lemonade** | **lizard** | **guinea-pig** | **helicopter** |
| Beverage    |                 |             | **water**  |              |              |
| Pet         |                 | **hedgehog** | **lizard** | **guinea-pig** |              |
| Transport   |                 |             | **ship**   | **van**       | **helicopter** |

From Clue 7, the owner of the turtle is the owner of the turtle (redundant, but confirms ownership). Therefore, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1.

|             | **turtle**      | **lemonade** | **lizard** | **guinea-pig** | **helicopter** |
| Beverage    |                 |             | **water**  |              |              |

| Transport   |            |                    |              |            | Van    |
```

**From Clue 3:**
- The person who's sport is sailing is the chef.
- This matches with the chef already being in position 5.

**From Clue 6:**
- The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the chef.
- Since the chef is in position 5, water-polo must be in position 4.

So, we can update:
```
|             |     1      |         2          |      3       |     4      |    5    |

```

**From Clue 2:**
- The software-developer is between the person who's sport is basketball and the person driving the scooter.
- The software-developer is also the person who's sport is rugby (Clue 10).

**From Clue 5:**
- The person who's sport is rugby is between the person who's sport is basketball and the person driving the scooter.
- So, the software-developer (rugby) is in position 3, and basketball and scooter are on either side.

Given the order and positions:
- Software-developer (rugby) is in position 3.
- Basketball is in position 2.
- Scooter is in position 4.

So, we can update:
```
|             |     1      |         2          |      3       |     4      |    5    |

```

**From Clue 7:**
- The person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the scooter.
- Since the person driving the scooter is in position 4, the person driving the bike must be in position 1.

So, we can update:
```
|             | Bike      |         2          |      3       |     4      |    5    |

```

**From Clue 1:**
- The person driving the car is in the middle (position 3).
- But we already placed the software-developer there.

**From Clue 9:**
- The entrepreneur is on the left of the engineer.
- The remaining positions are 1 and 2 for the entrepreneur and engineer.

Since the only job left is ""freelancer"" and ""engineer"":
- The entrepreneur must be in position 1 (since the engineer is to the right).
- The engineer must be in position 2.

So, we can update:
```
|             | Freelancer|         2          |      3       |     4      |    5    |

```

Finally, the remaining job ""engineer"" must go to position 2:
```
|             | Freelancer| Engineer          |      3       |     4      |    5    |

So, the final solution is:

Lv2-3x5-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given clues to fill in the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person whose hobby is reading is on the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
2. The Italian is on the right of the German.
3. The person whose hobby is skydiving is between the person whose hobby is cooking and the Egyptian.
4. The Italian is on the right of the German (repeated from clue 2).
5. The owner of the horse is on the far right.
6. The person whose hobby is cooking is between the Colombian and the Italian.
7. The person whose hobby is photography is on the right of the German.
8. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the dog.
9. The owner of the fish is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the horse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The owner of the horse is on the far right.
   - Position 5: Horse

2. **Clue 2 & 4**: The Italian is on the right of the German.
   - Since the horse is in position 5, the German must be in position 3 or 4, and the Italian must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Given that the horse is in position 5, the Italian must be in position 4.
   - Therefore, the German must be in position 3.

3. **Clue 6**: The person whose hobby is cooking is between the Colombian and the Italian.
   - Since the Italian is in position 4, the person with the cooking hobby must be in positions 2 or 3.
   - But position 3 is occupied by the German, so the person with the cooking hobby must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the Colombian must be in position 1.

4. **Clue 1**: The person whose hobby is reading is on the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
   - This means the person with the magic-tricks hobby must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - But we already know the Colombian is in position 1 and the German is in position 3.
   - So the person with the magic-tricks hobby must be in position 2, and the person with the reading hobby must be in position 3.
   - This conflicts with the German being in position 3, so let's reassess.

5. **Reassessing Clue 1**:
   - If the person with the magic-tricks hobby is in position 2, then the person with the reading hobby must be in position 3.
   - But this conflicts with the German being in position 3.
   - Let’s try the person with the magic-tricks hobby in position 1, and the person with the reading hobby in position 2.
   - This fits better because the German can still be in position 3.

6. **Clue 7**: The person whose hobby is photography is on the right of the German.
   - Since the German is in position 3, the person with the photography hobby must be in position 4 or 5.
   - But the Italian is in position 4, so the person with the photography hobby must be in position 5.
   - This conflicts with the horse being in position 5.
   - Let’s try the person with the photography hobby in position 4.

7. **Clue 7 Revisited**:
   - The person with the photography hobby is in position 4.
   - The German is in position 3.
   - The Italian is in position 5.

8. **Clue 3**: The person whose hobby is skydiving is between the person whose hobby is cooking and the Egyptian.
   - The person with the cooking hobby is in position 2.
