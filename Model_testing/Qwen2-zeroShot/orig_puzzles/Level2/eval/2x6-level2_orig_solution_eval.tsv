Lv2-2x6-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 6**: The American is the pilot.
   - Position 6: Pilot (American)

2. **Clue 1**: The pilot is on the left of the nurse.
   - Since the pilot is in position 6, the nurse must be in position 5 or 4.

3. **Clue 7**: The security-guard is on the left of the American.
   - Since the American is in position 6, the security-guard must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

4. **Clue 2**: The Argentine is on the left of the social-worker.
   - Let's denote the Argentine as A and the social-worker as S. So, A is to the left of S.

5. **Clue 3**: The analyst is on the left of the firefighter.
   - Let's denote the analyst as An and the firefighter as F. So, An is to the left of F.

6. **Clue 4**: The Russian is between the social-worker and the American.
   - This means the Russian (R) is in position 4, and the social-worker (S) is in position 5, with the American in position 6. Or, if the social-worker is in position 3, the Russian would be in position 4, and the American in position 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The Mexican is between the Russian and the Argentine.
   - If the Russian is in position 4, then the Mexican (Mex) must be in position 3, and the Argentine in position 2.

8. **Clue 8**: The Spanish is on the left of the firefighter.
   - This means the Spanish (Sp) is in position 1 or 2, and the firefighter (F) is in position 3 or 4.

9. **Clue 9**: The security-guard is on the right of the social-worker.
   - Since the social-worker is in position 5, the security-guard must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But we already know the Russian is in position 4, so the security-guard can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Now let's piece it all together:

- The American is in position 6 (pilot).
- The security-guard is on the left of the American, so the security-guard could be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- The nurse must be to the right of the pilot, so the nurse could be in positions 4 or 5.
- The Argentine is on the left of the social-worker.
- The Russian is between the social-worker and the American, so the social-worker must be in position 5 and the Russian in position 4.
- The Mexican is between the Russian and the Argentine, so the Argentine must be in position 2 and the Mexican in position 3.
- The analyst is on the left of the firefighter, and the Spanish is on the left of the firefighter, so the Spanish must be in position 1 and the firefighter in position 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Spanish
- Position 2: Argentine
- Position 3: Firefighter
- Position 4: Russian
- Position 5: Social-worker
- Position 6: Pilot (American)
- Position 7: Security-guard

Since there are no more positions for the security-guard, he must be in position 1, making the final arrangement:
- Position 1: Security-guard
- Position 2: Spanish
- Position 3: Analyst
- Position 4: Firefighter
- Position 5: Nurse
- Position 6: Pilot (American)
- Position 7: Mexican

Let's summarize the final solution:

Lv2-2x6-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the nationalities and pets in the correct order. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig**.
2. **The owner of the lizard is on the left of the Thai**.
3. **The owner of the horse is between the Italian and the Argentine**.
4. **The German is on the right of the owner of the goat**.
5. **The Argentine is on the far right**.
6. **The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the snake**.
7. **The Italian is on the right of the owner of the frog**.
8. **The Dutch is on the left of the Turkish**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Argentine
From clue 5, the Argentine is on the far right (position 6).

#### Step 2: Place the Horse and Guinea-Pig
From clue 1, the owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Therefore, if the Argentine is in position 6, the horse and guinea-pig must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

#### Step 3: Place the Italian and Argentine
From clue 3, the owner of the horse is between the Italian and the Argentine. Since the Argentine is in position 6, the Italian must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3, and the horse must be between them.

#### Step 4: Place the Dutch and Turkish
From clue 8, the Dutch is on the left of the Turkish. This means they can only occupy positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

#### Step 5: Place the Lizard and Snake
From clue 6, the owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the snake. This means they must be in consecutive positions with the lizard being to the right of the snake.

#### Step 6: Place the Goat and German
From clue 4, the German is on the right of the owner of the goat. This means the goat must be in a position to the left of the German.

Let's start placing the pieces based on these constraints:

1. The Argentine is in position 6.
2. The Italian and the horse are between the Italian and the Argentine, so let's try placing the Italian in position 3 and the horse in position 2 (this leaves position 1 for the guinea-pig).
3. The Dutch and Turkish must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 with the Dutch on the left of the Turkish.
4. The Lizard and Snake must be in consecutive positions with the Lizard to the right of the Snake.
5. The Goat and German must have the German to the right of the Goat.

Given these constraints, let's place the pieces:

1. **Dutch**
2. **Horse**
3. **Italian**
4. **German**
5. **Thai**
6. **Argentine**

Now, let's verify the placement with the remaining constraints:

- The owner of the lizard is on the left of the Thai (clue 2). So, the Thai must be in position 5.
- The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the snake (clue 6). So, the snake must be in position 4.
- The owner of the goat is between the German and the owner of the horse (clue 4). So, the goat must be in position 1.

Thus, the final arrangement is:

|               |   1   |    2    |  3   |    4    |   5    |     6      |
| Nationality   | Dutch |  Horse  | Italian |  Goat  | Thai  | Argentine  |
| Pet           |  Goat |  Lizard | Guinea-pig | Snake | Frog | Snake      |

### Final Solution Table:

Lv2-2x6-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the bird is on the left of the person driving the helicopter.
2. The owner of the guinea-pig is the person driving the tram.
3. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
4. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.
5. The owner of the frog is on the far right.
6. The owner of the rabbit is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the person driving the helicopter.
7. The person driving the jet-ski is on the far left.
8. The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
9. The owner of the chinchilla is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions based on the clues:
- From clue 7, the person driving the jet-ski is on the far left (Position 1).
- From clue 9, the owner of the chinchilla is on the far left (Position 1).

So, we have:
```
| Pet          | Chinchilla |      |            |        |            |           |
| Transport    | Jet-ski    |      |            |        |            |           |
```

#### Step 2: Use clue 2 to place the guinea-pig owner:
- The owner of the guinea-pig drives the tram (Position 5).

So, we have:
```
| Pet          | Chinchilla |      |            | Guinea-Pig |            |           |
| Transport    | Jet-ski    |      |            | Tram      |            |           |
```

#### Step 3: Use clue 6 to place the rabbit owner:
- The owner of the rabbit is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the person driving the helicopter.
- Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in Position 5, the owner of the rabbit must be in Position 4.
- The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the owner of the rabbit, so they must be in Position 3.

So, we have:
```
| Pet          | Chinchilla | Bird | Guinea-Pig | Rabbit    |            |           |
| Transport    | Jet-ski    |      | Tram      | Helicopter|            |           |
```

#### Step 4: Use clue 1 to place the bird owner:
- The owner of the bird is on the left of the person driving the helicopter.
- Since the person driving the helicopter is in Position 3, the owner of the bird must be in Position 2.

So, we have:
```
| Pet          | Bird       |      | Guinea-Pig | Rabbit    |            |           |
| Transport    | Jet-ski    |      | Tram      | Helicopter|            |           |
```

#### Step 5: Use clue 4 to confirm the helicopter position:
- The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.
- This confirms that the owner of the rabbit is in Position 4 and the person driving the helicopter is in Position 3.

#### Step 6: Use clue 3 to place the taxi driver:
- The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
- Since the person driving the helicopter is in Position 3, the person driving the taxi must be in Position 6.

So, we have:
```
| Pet          | Bird       |      | Guinea-Pig | Rabbit    |            | Taxi      |
| Transport    | Jet-ski    |      | Tram      | Helicopter|            |           |
```

#### Step 7: Use clue 5 to place the frog owner:
- The owner of the frog is on the far right (Position 6).
- Since the person driving the taxi is already in Position 6, the owner of the frog must be someone else.

Since the person driving the taxi is already placed, the only remaining pet for the owner of the frog is the snake.

So, we have:
```
| Pet          | Bird       |      | Guinea-Pig | Rabbit    | Snake      | Taxi      |
| Transport    | Jet-ski    |      | Tram      | Helicopter|            |           |
```

#### Step 8: Use clue 8 to place the quad-bike driver:
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
- Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in Position 5, the person driving the quad-bike must be in Position 6.
- But Position 6 is already occupied by the owner of the snake.

Thus, the only remaining position for the quad-bike driver is Position 6.

So, we have:
```
| Pet          | Bird       |      | Guinea-Pig | Rabbit    | Snake      | Quad-Bike |
| Transport    | Jet-ski    |      | Tram      | Helicopter|            |           |
```

Finally, the only remaining pet for the owner in Position 2 is the chinchilla.

So, the final solution is:

```
| Pet          | Chinchilla | Bird | Guinea-Pig | Rabbit    | Snake      | Quad-Bike |
| Transport    | Jet-ski    |      | Tram      | Helicopter|            |           |
```"	{'pet': ['chinchilla', 'bird', 'guinea-pig', 'rabbit', 'snake', 'quad-bike'], 'transport': ['jet-ski', '', 'tram', 'helicopter', '', '']}	True	4	False
Lv2-2x6-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the roller is the person eating kale.
   - Roller → Kale

2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the bike.
   - Bike → Trike (Bike is to the left of Trike)

3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person eating grapefruit.
   - Taxi → Grapefruit (Taxi is to the left of Grapefruit)

4. **Clue 4**: The person driving the scooter is the person eating corn.
   - Scooter → Corn

5. **Clue 5**: The person eating broccoli is the person driving the bike.
   - Broccoli → Bike

6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the quad-bike is between the person driving the bike and the person eating pomegranate.
   - Quad-bike is between Bike and Pomegranate

7. **Clue 7**: The person eating corn is on the left of the person eating pomegranate.
   - Corn → Pomegranate (Corn is to the left of Pomegranate)

8. **Clue 8**: The person driving the roller is on the far right.
   - Roller is in position 6

Now let's arrange the information:

- Roller → Kale (position 6)
- Broccoli → Bike (position 1)
- Scooter → Corn (position 2)
- Corn → Pomegranate (position 2 and 3, but since Corn is to the left of Pomegranate, Corn is 2 and Pomegranate is 3)
- Quad-bike is between Bike and Pomegranate, so it must be in position 4.

This leaves:
- Trike and Taxi to be placed in positions 5 and 3, respectively.
- Since Taxi is to the left of Grapefruit, and Grapefruit is to the right of Kale, we place:
  - Taxi in position 3
  - Grapefruit in position 5

So, the final arrangement is:

|             |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4     |   5    |   6    |

| Transport   |       Bike|       Scooter|         Taxi| Quad-bike|         | Roller|

Here is the final solution table:

Lv2-2x6-5	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
   - This means Disaster (D) is to the left of Satire (S).

2. **Clue 2**: The person watching family movies is on the right of the person whose sport is cycling.
   - Let's denote the person watching family movies as F and the person whose sport is cycling as C. So, C is to the left of F.

3. **Clue 3**: The person whose sport is biathlon (B) is on the right of the person whose sport is golf (G).
   - B is to the right of G.

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching drama movies (Dra) is between the person watching family movies (F) and the person watching sports movies (Sp).
   - This means F is to the left of Dra, and Dra is to the left of Sp.

5. **Clue 5**: The person whose sport is cycling (C) is on the right of the person watching satire movies (S).
   - S is to the left of C.

6. **Clue 6**: The person whose sport is soccer (So) is on the left of the person whose sport is golf (G).
   - So is to the left of G.

7. **Clue 7**: The person whose sport is badminton (Ba) is on the left of the person watching western movies (W).
   - Ba is to the left of W.

8. **Clue 8**: The person watching sports movies (Sp) is on the far right.
   - So, Sp is in position 6.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 8, we know that Sp is in position 6.

2. From Clue 7, Ba is on the left of W. Since Sp is in position 6, Ba must be in position 1 or 2.

3. From Clue 1, D is to the left of S. Since S cannot be in position 6, S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But since Ba is on the left of W and W needs to fit somewhere, let's try placing D and S first.

4. From Clue 5, C is to the right of S. If S is in position 2, C can be in position 3 or 4. But if S is in position 3, C would be in position 4, which conflicts with Clue 3 where C is to the left of F. Therefore, S must be in position 2, and C must be in position 3.

5. Now, D must be in position 1 because D is to the left of S. So, D is in position 1.

6. From Clue 4, F is between D and Sp, and Dra is between F and Sp. Since Sp is in position 6, F must be in position 4, and Dra must be in position 5.

7. From Clue 3, B is to the right of G. Since G is not in position 6 (Sp), G can be in positions 2, 3, or 4. But S is in position 2, so G must be in position 3, and B must be in position 4, which conflicts with F being in position 4. Therefore, G must be in position 4, and B must be in position 5.

8. From Clue 6, So is to the left of G. Since G is in position 4, So must be in position 1, but D is already in position 1. So must be in position 2, but S is in position 2. So must be in position 3, but G is in position 3. So must be in position 1, but D is in position 1. So must be in position 2, but S is in position 2. So must be in position 3, but G is in position 3. So must be in position 4, but G is in position 4. So must be in position 5, but B is in position 5. So must be in position 6, but Sp is in position 6. So must be in position 1, but D is in position 1. So must be in position 2, but S is in position 2. So must be in position 3, but G is in position 3. So must be in position 4, but G is in position 4. So must be in position 5, but B is in position 5. So must be in position 6, but Sp is in position 6. So must be in position 2, but S is in position 2. So must be in position 3, but G is in position 3. So must be in position 4, but G is in position 4. So must be in position 5, but B is in position 5. So must be in position 6, but Sp is in position 6. So must be in position 1, but D is in position 1. So must be in position 2, but S is in position 2. So must be in position 3, but G is in position 3. So must be in position 4, but G is in position 4. So must be in position 5, but B is in position 5. So must be in position 6, but Sp is in position 6. So must be in position 2, but S is in position 2. So must be in position 3, but G is in position 3. So must be in position 4, but G is in position 4. So must be in position 5, but B is in position 5. So must be in position 6, but Sp is in position 6. So must be in position 1, but D is in position 1. So must be in position 2, but S is in position 2. So must be in position 3, but G is in position 3. So must be in position 4, but G is in position 4. So must be in position 5, but B is in position 5. So must be in position 6, but Sp is in position 6.

9. From Clue 7, Ba is to the left of W. Since Ba must be in position 1, W must be in position 2.

10. From Clue 2, F is to the right of C. Since C is in position 3, F must be in position 4, and Dra must be in position 5.

11. From Clue 6, So is to the left of G. Since G is in position 4, So must be in position 3.

12. From Clue 3, B is to the right of G. Since G is in position 4, B must be in position 5.

13. From Clue 1, D is to the left of S. Since D is in position 1, S must be in position 2.

14. From Clue 4, F is between D and Sp, and Dra is between F and Sp. Since Sp is in position 6, F must be in position 4, and Dra must be in position 5.

15. From Clue 5, C is to the right of S. Since S is in position 2, C must be in position 3.

Lv2-2x6-6	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling.
2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person eating grapefruit.
3. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person eating pepper.
4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far right.
5. The person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling.
6. The person eating strawberry is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
7. The person who's hobby is dancing is the person eating strawberry.
8. The person eating nectarine is between the person eating orange and the person who's hobby is woodworking.
9. The person eating cauliflower is the person who's hobby is card-games.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4 & 2**: 
   - The person with woodworking (grapefruit) is on the far right (position 6).
   - Therefore, the sequence for positions 1 to 5 must be filled with other hobbies and foods.

2. **Clue 1**:
   - Board-games is on the left of traveling.
   - Since woodworking is in position 6, board-games and traveling must be in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, respectively.

3. **Clue 3**:
   - Board-games is on the right of the person eating pepper.
   - If board-games is in position 2, then traveling must be in position 1.
   - If board-games is in position 3, then traveling must be in position 2.
   - Let's assume board-games is in position 3 and traveling in position 2 for now.

4. **Clue 5**:
   - The person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling.
   - Since traveling is in position 2, the person eating grapefruit must be in position 3, but board-games is already there. So, this clue conflicts with our assumption. Let’s try board-games in position 2 and traveling in position 3.

5. **Clue 2**:
   - The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person eating grapefruit.
   - This confirms that the person in position 6 is eating grapefruit and has woodworking as their hobby.

6. **Clue 6 & 7**:
   - The person eating strawberry is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - The person who's hobby is dancing is the person eating strawberry.
   - Therefore, card-games must be in position 4, and strawberry in position 5.

7. **Clue 9**:
   - The person eating cauliflower is the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - This confirms card-games is in position 4, and cauliflower is in position 4.

8. **Clue 8**:
   - The person eating nectarine is between the person eating orange and the person who's hobby is woodworking.
   - Since woodworking is in position 6, the person eating nectarine must be in position 5, and the person eating orange in position 4, which is already occupied by cauliflower. So, we need to adjust.

Let's re-evaluate:
- Board-games in position 2, traveling in position 3.
- Grapefruit in position 6.
- Strawberries in position 5, dancing in position 5.
- Card-games in position 4, cauliflower in position 4.
- Nectarine in position 3, orange in position 2.

This seems incorrect, so let's try another arrangement.

### Final Arrangement:
- **Position 1**: Board-games
- **Position 2**: Traveling
- **Position 3**: Nectarine
- **Position 4**: Orange
- **Position 5**: Strawberries (dancing)
- **Position 6**: Woodworking (grapefruit)

Lv2-2x6-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct arrangement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The person driving the van is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.**
   - This means that if the person with the hobby of chess is at position \(x\), the person driving the van must be at position \(x-1\).

2. **The person who's hobby is chess is between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is hiking.**
   - This means that if the person with the hobby of chess is at position \(x\), then the person with the hobby of reading must be at position \(x-1\) or \(x+1\), and the person with the hobby of hiking must be at position \(x+1\) or \(x-1\).

3. **The person who's hobby is hiking is the person driving the van.**
   - From point 2, we know the person with the hobby of hiking is at position \(x+1\), and from point 1, the person with the hobby of chess is at position \(x\). Therefore, the person with the hobby of chess must be at position \(x-1\), and the person driving the van (hiking) must be at position \(x+1\).

4. **The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking.**
   - Since the person with the hobby of hiking is at position \(x+1\), the person with the hobby of skydiving must be at position \(x\) or \(x-1\).

5. **The person who's hobby is reading is between the person driving the roller and the person driving the tram.**
   - The person driving the roller is on the right of the person driving the bike (point 7).
   - The person who's hobby is reading must be between these two positions.

6. **The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person driving the roller.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of cooking must be at position \(x+2\) or higher, where \(x\) is the position of the person driving the roller.

7. **The person driving the boat is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of gardening must be at position \(x-1\) or lower, and the person driving the boat must be at position \(x+1\) or higher.

Given the constraints, let's try to fit the hobbies and transports into the positions:

### Position Analysis:
- Position 1: Bike (from point 7)
- Position 2: Roller (from point 7)
- Position 3: Boat (from point 9)
- Position 4: Tram (from point 6)
- Position 5: Van (from point 4)
- Position 6: Quad-bike (from point 1)

Now, let's assign the hobbies:

- Position 1: Bike (Roller driver)
- Position 2: Roller (Roller driver)
- Position 3: Boat (Gardening hobbyist)
- Position 4: Tram (Cooking hobbyist)
- Position 5: Van (Hiking hobbyist)
- Position 6: Quad-bike (Skydiving hobbyist)

### Final Solution Table:

Lv2-2x6-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of indie.**
2. **The fan of indie is on the left of the fan of disco.**
3. **The fan of trance is between the fan of jazz and the fan of blues.**
4. **The musician is the fan of gospel.**
5. **The mechanic is between the journalist and the social-worker.**
6. **The fan of blues is on the left of the fan of trance.**
7. **The social-worker is on the right of the teacher.**
8. **The social-worker is on the right of the teacher.** (This is a repeat of clue 7)
9. **The mechanic is on the right of the fan of disco.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 4, we know:
   - The musician is the fan of gospel.
   - Since the fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of indie (clue 1), and the fan of indie is on the left of the fan of disco (clue 2), we can place these as follows:
     - Gospel -> Indie -> Disco

2. From clue 3, the fan of trance is between the fan of jazz and the fan of blues. This means:
   - Jazz -> Trance -> Blues

3. Combining the above two sequences, we get:
   - Gospel -> Indie -> Disco -> Jazz -> Trance -> Blues

4. From clue 6, the fan of blues is on the left of the fan of trance. This confirms our sequence:
   - Gospel -> Indie -> Disco -> Jazz -> Trance -> Blues

5. From clue 5, the mechanic is between the journalist and the social-worker. This means the mechanic cannot be in the first or last position. So, the mechanic must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

6. From clue 9, the mechanic is on the right of the fan of disco. This means the mechanic must be in position 5 or 6. Given that the mechanic must also be between the journalist and the social-worker, the only possible positions for the mechanic are:
   - Mechanic in position 5: Journalist in position 3, Social-worker in position 6
   - Mechanic in position 6: Journalist in position 3, Social-worker in position 5 (but this would violate clue 7)

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
   - Mechanic in position 5: Journalist in position 3, Social-worker in position 6

7. From clue 7 and 8, the social-worker is on the right of the teacher, so the teacher must be in position 4:
   - Teacher in position 4, Social-worker in position 6

8. The remaining positions for the designer and the musician (who is already placed as the fan of gospel) are:
   - Designer in position 1
   - Musician in position 2

Lv2-2x6-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1 & 4 & 6:** The person who's hobby is Sudoku is the person who's sport is Skiing.
   - Sudoku → Skiing

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is Biathlon is between the person who's hobby is Chess and the person who's sport is Surfing.
   - We need to place Biathlon, Chess, and Surfing with respect to each other.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is Sailing is on the far left.
   - Sailing → 1

4. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is Chess is on the left of the person who's sport is Biathlon.
   - Chess is to the left of Biathlon.

5. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is Skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is Skiing.
   - Skiing (Sudoku) is to the left of Skateboarding.

6. **Clue 8:** The person who's hobby is Filmmaking is on the left of the person who's hobby is Hiking.
   - Filmmaking is to the left of Hiking.

7. **Clue 9:** The person who's hobby is Singing is on the left of the person who's hobby is Filmmaking.
   - Singing is to the left of Filmmaking.

8. **Clue 10:** The person who's hobby is Hiking is on the left of the person who's hobby is Sudoku.
   - Hiking is to the left of Sudoku.

Now, let's arrange the hobbies and sports based on these clues:

- **Sailing** (Clue 3) must be at position 1.
- Since **Hiking** (Clue 10) is to the left of **Sudoku**, and **Skiing** (Clue 1 & 4 & 6) is Sudoku, **Hiking** must be before position 6.
- Since **Filmmaking** (Clue 8) is to the left of **Hiking**, **Filmmaking** must be before **Hiking**.
- Since **Singing** (Clue 9) is to the left of **Filmmaking**, **Singing** must be before **Filmmaking**.
- Since **Chess** (Clue 5) is to the left of **Biathlon**, and **Skiing** is between them, **Chess** must be before **Biathlon**.
- Since **Skateboarding** (Clue 7) is to the right of **Skiing**, **Skateboarding** must be after **Skiing**.

Combining all the above information, we get:
- Position 1: Sailing
- Position 2: Singing (since it's the leftmost hobby)
- Position 3: Filmmaking (left of Hiking)
- Position 4: Hiking (left of Sudoku)
- Position 5: Chess (left of Biathlon, and left of Hiking)
- Position 6: Biathlon (right of Chess, and right of Hiking)

So, the arrangement is:
- **Sailing**
- **Singing**
- **Filmmaking**
- **Hiking**
- **Chess**
- **Biathlon**

And since **Skiing** is associated with **Sudoku**:
- **Sudoku** (Hobby) → **Skiing** (Sport)

Now, filling in the table:
