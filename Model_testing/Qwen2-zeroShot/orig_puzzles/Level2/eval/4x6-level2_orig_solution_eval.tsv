We can start placing these in the table:

| Job           | Police Officer |            |            |            |           |               |
| Movie-Genre   |                |            |            |            |           |               |

| Sport         |                |            |            |            |           |               |

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the person whose sport is climbing at position 1:

|               |       1        |     2      |     3      |     4      |     5     |       6       |
| Job           | Police Officer |            |            |            |           |               |

| Job           | Police Officer |            |            |            |           |               |
| Movie-Genre   |                |            |            |            |           |               |
