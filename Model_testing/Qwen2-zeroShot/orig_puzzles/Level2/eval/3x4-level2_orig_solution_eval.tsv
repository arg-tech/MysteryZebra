Lv2-3x4-2	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left.**
   - This means the first column (Hobby 1) is ""drawing"".

2. **The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess.**
   - Let's denote the columns as follows:
     - Column 1: Drawing
     - Column 2: Chess
     - Column 3: ?
     - Column 4: Climbing (Sport)

3. **The person who's sport is sailing is on the far left.**
   - This means the first column (Hobby 1) is also ""sailing"" for the sport. But since we already know the first column is ""drawing"", this must be a different row for the sport.
   - So, the first column (Sport 1) is ""sailing"".

4. **The person who's sport is swimming is between the person watching zombie movies and the person who's hobby is reading.**
   - Let's denote the columns for sport as:
     - Column 1: Sailing
     - Column 2: ?
     - Column 3: Swimming
     - Column 4: Climbing

5. **The person watching zombie movies is the person who's sport is sailing.**
   - This confirms that the first column (Movie-Genre 1) is ""zombie"".

6. **The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.**
   - This means the person watching fantasy movies is in column 2, and the person whose sport is climbing is in column 4.
   - So, the second column (Movie-Genre 2) is ""fantasy"".

7. **The person watching superhero movies is the person who's sport is surfing.**
   - This means the fourth column (Sport 4) is ""surfing"".
   - And the third column (Movie-Genre 3) is ""superhero"".

8. **The person whose hobby is reading is between the person watching zombie movies and the person watching fantasy movies.**
   - Since the first column (Movie-Genre 1) is ""zombie"" and the second column (Movie-Genre 2) is ""fantasy"", the third column (Hobby 3) must be ""reading"".

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |    2     |    3     |      4       |
| Hobby         | drawing | chess    | reading  | magic-tricks |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie  | fantasy  | horror   | zombie       |
| Sport         | sailing | climbing | surfing  | swimming     |
```

### Explanation of Remaining Columns:

- **Hobby 2**: We need to determine the remaining hobby, which is ""chess"" because ""drawing"" and ""reading"" are already placed.
- **Movie-Genre 3**: The only genre left is ""horror"" because ""fantasy"", ""superhero"", and ""zombie"" are already placed.
- **Movie-Genre 4**: The last genre is ""zombie"", but it's already used, so we need to re-evaluate. The correct placement should be ""magic-tricks"" in the last column of hobbies, and ""zombie"" in the last column of movie genres.

### Corrected Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |    2     |    3     |      4       |
| Hobby         | drawing | chess    | reading  | magic-tricks |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie  | fantasy  | horror   | zombie       |
| Sport         | sailing | climbing | surfing  | swimming     |
```

This table now correctly matches all the given conditions."	{'hobby': ['drawing', 'chess', 'reading', 'magic-tricks'], 'movie-genre': ['zombie', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'zombie'], 'sport': ['sailing', 'climbing', 'surfing', 'swimming']}	True	7	False
Lv2-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of folk is between the fan of indie and the person drinking mirinda.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the fan of country.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking sprite is on the far right (position 4).
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is cooking is on the far left (position 1).
6. **Clue 6:** The fan of country is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.
7. **Clue 7:** The fan of house is on the far left (position 1).

From Clue 5, we know:
- Position 1: Cooking

From Clue 4, we know:
- Position 4: Sprite

From Clue 7, we know:
- Position 1: House (since it's the far left and also mentioned as the fan of house)

So now we have:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |     3      |     4     |
| Beverage      |  House  |             |            |   Sprite  |
| Hobby         |  Cooking|             |            |           |
| Music-Genre   |         |             |            |           |
```

From Clue 2, since the person with the hobby of collecting is to the left of the fan of country:
- Position 2 or 3 must be collecting.

From Clue 3, since the person with the hobby of cooking (position 1) is to the left of the person with the hobby of photography:
- Position 3 or 4 must be photography.

Since position 4 is already Sprite, and position 1 is House, position 3 must be photography.

So now we have:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |     3      |     4     |
| Beverage      |  House  |             | Photography|   Sprite  |
| Hobby         |  Cooking|             | Photography|           |
| Music-Genre   |         |             |            |           |
```

From Clue 6, the fan of country is to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since position 3 is photography, the fan of country cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the fan of country must be in position 2 and the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1.

So now we have:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |     3      |     4     |
| Beverage      | Lemonade|             | Photography|   Sprite  |
| Hobby         |  Cooking| Fan of Country| Photography|           |
| Music-Genre   |         |             |            |           |
```

From Clue 1, the fan of folk is between the fan of indie and the person drinking mirinda. Since positions 1 and 2 are taken, the fan of folk and indie must be in positions 3 and 4. But since position 3 is photography and position 4 is sprite, the only possibility is:
- Position 3: Folk
- Position 4: Indie

And the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1.

So now we have:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |     3      |     4     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda |             | Folk       |   Sprite  |
| Hobby         |  Cooking| Fan of Country| Photography|           |
| Music-Genre   |         |             |            |           |
```

Finally, we need to determine the music genre for each position. We know that:
- The fan of folk is between the fan of indie and the person drinking mirinda.
- The fan of house is on the far left (position 1).

So, let's assign the music genres:
- Position 1: House (already assigned)
- Position 2: Folk
- Position 3: Indie
- Position 4: Country

Thus, the final solution is:
```
|               |    1    |      2      |     3      |     4     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda |             | Folk       |   Sprite  |
| Hobby         |  Cooking| Fan of Country| Photography|           |
| Music-Genre   | House   | Folk        | Indie      |   Country |

Lv2-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.
2. The person driving the bus is between the person driving the ship and the polish person.
3. The German is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
4. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
5. The German is on the right of the Australian.
6. The person driving the ship is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person driving the car.

### Initial Setup:

|               |       1       |    2    |     3      |   4    |
| Nationality   |               |         |            |        |
| Sport         |               |         |            |        |
| Transport     | Scooter       |         |            |        |

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the scooter is in position 1.

### Applying Clue 2:
- The person driving the bus is between the person driving the ship and the Polish person.
- This means the Polish person cannot be in position 1 (since the scooter is there) or 4 (since the bus must be between two other positions).

Let's denote the Polish person as P, the person driving the bus as B, the person driving the ship as S, and the remaining nationality as X.

Possible positions for B, S, and P:
- If Polish is in position 2, then B must be in position 3 and S in position 4.
- If Polish is in position 3, then B must be in position 2 and S in position 1 (not possible since the scooter is already in position 1).
- If Polish is in position 4, then B must be in position 3 and S in position 2.

Thus, Polish can only be in position 2 or 4.

### Applying Clue 3:
- The German is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
- This means the German cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the person doing cycling is in position 1 or 2.

### Applying Clue 4:
- The person driving the bus is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
- This means the person with skateboarding cannot be in position 4.

### Applying Clue 5:
- The German is on the right of the Australian.
- This means the Australian cannot be in position 4.

### Applying Clue 6:
- The person driving the ship is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person driving the car.
- This means the person with cricket and the person with the car cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

### Final Solution:

1. **Position 1:** Scooter (from Clue 1)
2. **Position 2:** Polish (from Clue 2, since it fits all constraints)
3. **Position 3:** Bus (from Clue 2)
4. **Position 4:** Ship (from Clue 2)

Now let's fill in the sports and nationalities based on the remaining constraints:

- From Clue 3: The German is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
- From Clue 4: The person driving the bus is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
- From Clue 5: The German is on the right of the Australian.
- From Clue 6: The person driving the ship is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person driving the car.

### Possible assignments:

1. Position 1: Scooter
2. Position 2: Polish
3. Position 3: Bus
4. Position 4: Ship

- Since the German is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling, and the German is on the right of the Australian, the German cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- The Australian cannot be in position 4.
- The person with skateboarding cannot be in position 4.
- The person with cricket is between the person with the car and the person with the ship.

### Assigning Sports and Nationalities:

- Position 1: Scooter (Dutch - Cycling)
- Position 2: Polish (Australian - Skateboarding)
- Position 3: Bus (German - Tennis)
- Position 4: Ship (Polish - Cricket)

7. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is handball is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's hobby is gardening.

From these clues, we can start making deductions:

### Step-by-Step Deductions:
1. From Clue 2, the person with sport = handball drinks tea.
2. From Clue 1, the person drinking tea (handball) is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person drinking fanta.
3. From Clue 4, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. This means the order for beverages must be either tea, almond-milk, fanta, lemonade or tea, almond-milk, lemonade, fanta.
4. From Clue 7, the person with sport = handball (tea) is between the person with sport = golf and the person with hobby = gardening. This means the person with sport = golf must be to the left of handball, and the person with hobby = gardening must be to the right of handball.
5. From Clue 5, the person with sport = basketball is to the right of the person with sport = golf.
6. From Clue 6, the person with sport = golf is to the right of the person with hobby = puzzles.

Now let's place the sports and hobbies based on the above clues:

- **Person with sport = handball (tea)** is in position 2.
- **Person with sport = golf** must be in position 1 (since it is to the left of handball and the person with hobby = puzzles).
- **Person with hobby = puzzles** must be in position 3 (since it is to the left of golf).
- **Person with sport = basketball** must be in position 4 (since it is to the right of golf).

So, the sports are arranged as follows:
- Position 1: Golf
- Position 2: Handball (Tea)
- Position 3: Puzzles
- Position 4: Basketball

Now, let's fill in the hobbies:
- From Clue 3, the person with hobby = sudoku is in position 4.
- Therefore, the person with hobby = gardening must be in position 1 (since it is to the right of handball).

So, the hobbies are arranged as follows:
- Position 1: Gardening
- Position 2: Handball (Tea)
- Position 3: Puzzles
- Position 4: Sudoku

Finally, let's fill in the beverages:
- From Clue 4, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
- From Clue 1, the person drinking tea (handball) is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person drinking fanta.
- Therefore, the order of beverages must be: Almond-milk, Tea, Fanta, Lemonade.

So, the beverages are arranged as follows:
- Position 1: Almond-milk
- Position 2: Tea
- Position 3: Fanta
- Position 4: Lemonade

6. The person eating papaya is between the person watching epic movies and the person watching mystery movies.
7. The person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person watching drama movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning based on Movies
- From clue 3, the person watching mystery movies is on the far left (position 1).
- From clue 4, the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person watching mystery movies, so the person watching spy movies is in position 4.
- Therefore, we have:
  ```
  | Mystery |   ?    |   ?    | Spy   |
  ```

#### Step 2: Sport and Movie Correlation
- From clue 1, the person who's sport is volleyball is the person watching epic movies. Since epic movies are not mystery or spy, they must be in position 2.
- From clue 2, the person who's sport is handball is the person watching drama movies. Since drama movies are not mystery or spy, they must be in position 3.
  ```
  | Mystery | Epic  | Drama | Spy   |
  ```

#### Step 3: Filling in the Food
- From clue 6, the person eating papaya is between the person watching epic movies and the person watching mystery movies. This means the person eating papaya is in position 2.
  ```
  | Mystery | Papaya| Drama | Spy   |

  ```
  | Pomegranate| Papaya| Drama | Spy   |

  ```
  | Pomegranate| Pepper | Drama | Spy   |
  ```

Lv2-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching western movies is on the right of the owner of the hamster.
2. The person watching crime movies is between the owner of the rabbit and the person whose hobby is camping.
3. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
4. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the hamster.
5. The person watching western movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
6. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person watching spy movies.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: 
- The person watching western movies (W) is on the right of the owner of the hamster (H).
- Possible positions: W-H or W-H- (where - indicates other positions).

#### Clue 2: 
- The person watching crime movies (C) is between the owner of the rabbit (R) and the person whose hobby is camping (Camping).
- Possible positions: R-C-Camping or Camping-C-R.

#### Clue 3: 
- The person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) is on the right of the owner of the lizard (Lizard).
- Possible positions: Lizard-Cooking or -Lizard-Cooking.

#### Clue 4: 
- The owner of the lizard (Lizard) is on the right of the owner of the hamster (Hamster).
- Possible positions: Hamster-Lizard or -Hamster-Lizard.

#### Clue 5:

- Possible positions: Sudoku-W or -Sudoku-W.

#### Clue 6: 
- The person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) is on the left of the person watching spy movies (Spy).
- Possible positions: Cooking-Spy or -Cooking-Spy.

### Combining Clues:
From Clue 4, we know that the hamster must be on the left of the lizard, so let's place them first:
- Hamster-Lizard or -Hamster-Lizard.

Since the person watching western movies (W) is on the right of the owner of the hamster (H), and the person watching crime movies (C) is between the owner of the rabbit (R) and the person whose hobby is camping (Camping), we need to fit these clues together.

Given Clue 2 and Clue 4, we can infer:
- If Hamster is at position 1, Lizard must be at position 2, and the person watching western movies (W) must be at position 3 or 4.
- The person watching crime movies (C) must be between the owner of the rabbit (R) and the person whose hobby is camping (Camping).

Let's try to place the hobbies and movies:

1. **Hamster (H) - Lizard (L)**
2. **Owner of Rabbit (R) - Person Watching Crime (C) - Person with Hobby Camping (Camping)**

Now, let's place the movies and hobbies considering Clue 1, 5, and 6:

- Clue 1: Western (W) is on the right of Hamster (H).
- Clue 5: Western (W) is on the right of Sudoku (S).
- Clue 6: Cooking (Cooking) is on the left of Spy (Spy).

Let's try placing the movies and hobbies:

1. **Hamster (H) - Lizard (L) - Sudoku (S) - Western (W)**
2. **Owner of Rabbit (R) - Person Watching Crime (C) - Person with Hobby Camping (Camping)**
3. **Cooking (Cooking) - Spy (Spy)**

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |    2    |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | Sudoku | Lizard | Hamster | Western    |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime  | Camping | Rabbit  | Western    |
| Pet           | Horse  | Lizard | Hamster | Rabbit     |
```

Lv2-3x4-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct arrangement:

### Given Information:
1. The fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of techno.
2. The person who's hobby is photography is the person eating eggplant.
3. The fan of house is on the left of the person eating mango.
4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person eating mango.
5. The person eating eggplant is on the right of the person eating tomato.
6. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far right.
7. The person who's hobby is photography is between the fan of salsa and the person who's hobby is chess.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From clue 6:** The person with the hobby of woodworking is on the far right (position 4). Therefore, we can place:
   ```
   |       |       |       | Woodworking |
   ```

2. **From clue 4:** The person with the hobby of woodworking is the one eating mango. So, we can place:
   ```
   |       |       |       | Mango      |
   ```

3. **From clue 3:** The fan of house is on the left of the person eating mango. Since the person eating mango is in position 4, the fan of house must be in position 3. So, we can place:
   ```
   |       |       | House  | Mango      |
   ```

4. **From clue 1:** The fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of techno. Since positions 3 and 4 are already filled, the only possible positions for the fans of salsa and techno are positions 1 and 2. Therefore, we can place:
   ```
   | Salsa | Techno| House  | Mango      |
   ```

5. **From clue 2:** The person who's hobby is photography is the person eating eggplant. Since the person with photography is between the fan of salsa and the person with chess, and we know that the fan of salsa is in position 1, the person with photography must be in position 2. So, we can place:
   ```
   | Salsa | Photography | House  | Mango      |
   ```

6. **From clue 5:** The person eating eggplant is on the right of the person eating tomato. Since the person with photography (eating eggplant) is in position 2, the person eating tomato must be in position 1. So, we can place:
   ```
   | Tomato| Photography | House  | Mango      |
   ```

7. **From clue 7:** The person who's hobby is photography is between the fan of salsa and the person who's hobby is chess. We already have the person with photography in position 2, so the person with chess must be in position 4. However, since the person with woodworking (chess) is in position 4, this confirms our previous placement.

### Final Table:
```
| Tomato | Photography | House  | Mango      |
| Eggplant |            |        |            |
| Chess   |            |        | Woodworking|
```

### Final Solution:
```
| Tomato | Photography | House  | Mango      |
| Eggplant |            |        |            |
| Chess   |            |        | Woodworking|

Lv2-3x4-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is gardening is on the far left.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating pepper is on the far left.
3. **Clue 3:** The person eating orange is between the person eating lettuce and the person whose hobby is collecting.
4. **Clue 4:** The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person eating pomegranate.
5. **Clue 5:** The person whose hobby is dancing is on the far right.
6. **Clue 6:** The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person eating pomegranate (redundant with Clue 4).
7. **Clue 7:** The person watching time-travel movies is the person whose hobby is gardening.
8. **Clue 8:** The person watching adventure movies is the person eating pomegranate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 1 and Clue 2:
   - The person whose hobby is gardening and eats pepper must be in position 1.
   
2. From Clue 7:
   - The person whose hobby is gardening is also the one who watches time-travel movies.
   
3. From Clue 5:
   - The person whose hobby is dancing is in position 4.

4. From Clue 4 and Clue 6:
   - The person eating pomegranate must be in position 2 or 3 because the person watching comedy movies is to their right.
   - The person watching comedy movies must be in position 3 or 4.

5. From Clue 8:
   - The person eating pomegranate is the one who watches adventure movies.

6. From Clue 3:
   - The person eating orange is between the person eating lettuce and the person whose hobby is collecting.
   - This means the person eating orange cannot be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 1 and 4 are already occupied by gardening and dancing).

### Arrangement:

- Position 1: Gardening, Pepper
- Position 4: Dancing
- Position 2: Pomegranate, Adventure Movies
- Position 3: Orange, Comedy Movies

Since the person eating pomegranate is in position 2 and watching adventure movies, and the person watching comedy movies is in position 3, we can now fill in the rest.
