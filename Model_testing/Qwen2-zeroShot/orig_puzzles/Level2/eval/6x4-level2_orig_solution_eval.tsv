### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Goat
- Clue 2: The owner of the goat is on the far left.
```
|               | Goat |                |              |           |
| Beverage      |      |                |              |           |
| Job           |      |                |              |           |
| Music-Genre   |      |                |              |           |
| Nationality   |      |                |              |           |
| Pet           |      |                |              |           |
| Transport     |      |                |              |           |
```

#### Step 2: Place the Rabbit
- Clue 1: The owner of the rabbit is the entrepreneur.
- Clue 13: The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the cat.
Since the goat is on the far left, the rabbit cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since the owner of the rabbit would then be on the left of the goat). The only logical positions for the rabbit are 3 or 4.

#### Step 3: Place the Chinese
- Clue 6: The person driving the jet-ski is the Chinese.
- Clue 9: The Chinese is between the fan of dubstep and the person drinking iced-tea.
- Clue 7: The person drinking iced-tea is the fan of indie.

We need to place the Chinese in position 4 since it fits all these conditions:
```

| Transport     |      |                |              |          |
```

#### Step 4: Place the Entrepreneur
- Clue 1: The owner of the rabbit is the entrepreneur.
- The entrepreneur must be in position 3 or 4. Since Chinese is in position 4, the entrepreneur must be in position 3.
```
|               | Goat |                | Entrepreneur | Chinese  |
| Beverage      |      |                |              |          |

```

#### Step 5: Place the Goat Owner
- The goat owner is in position 1.
```

| Transport     |      |                |              |          |
```

#### Step 6: Place the Jet-Ski Driver
- Clue 3: The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
- Clue 9: The Chinese is between the fan of dubstep and the person drinking iced-tea.
- The jet-ski driver is in position 4 (Chinese).

Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the jet-ski driver, they must be in position 3:
```
|               | Goat |                | Entrepreneur | Chinese  |
| Beverage      |      |                | Iced-tea     |          |

| Pet           |      |                |              |          |
| Transport     |      |                |              |          |
```

#### Step 7: Place the Fan of Indie
- Clue 7: The person drinking iced-tea is the fan of indie.
- The fan of indie is in position 3.

#### Step 8: Place the Bartender
- Clue 5: The bartender is the Canadian.
- The Canadian must be in position 1 or 2.

Since Goat is in position 1, the Canadian must be in position 2:
```
|               | Canadian |                | Entrepreneur | Chinese  |
| Beverage      |          |                | Iced-tea     |          |
| Job           |          |                |              |          |
