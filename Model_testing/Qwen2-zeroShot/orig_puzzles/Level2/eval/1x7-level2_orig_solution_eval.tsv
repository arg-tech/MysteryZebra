Lv2-1x7-1	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We have the following conditions:
1. The fan of house is on the right of the fan of blues.
2. The fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of d&b.
3. The fan of techno is on the left of the fan of classical.
4. The fan of disco is between the fan of ambient and the fan of classical.
5. The fan of d&b is between the fan of blues and the fan of ambient.

Let's denote the positions as 1 through 7 and the music genres as A (ambient), B (blues), C (classical), D (d&b), E (disco), H (house), T (techno).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Condition 1: House is on the right of Blues
- This means Blues must be to the left of House.

#### Condition 2: Ambient is on the left of D&B
- This means D&B must be to the right of Ambient.

#### Condition 3: Techno is on the left of Classical
- This means Classical must be to the right of Techno.

#### Condition 4: Disco is between Ambient and Classical
- This means the order must be either Ambient - Disco - Classical or Classical - Disco - Ambient.

#### Condition 5: D&B is between Blues and Ambient
- This means the order must be either Blues - D&B - Ambient or Ambient - D&B - Blues.

Let's start by placing the constraints together:

1. Since D&B is between Blues and Ambient, and Ambient is on the left of D&B, we can combine these to get:
   - Blues - D&B - Ambient

2. Now, since Disco is between Ambient and Classical, we can combine this with the previous placement:
   - Blues - D&B - Ambient - Disco - Classical

3. Techno must be to the left of Classical, so Techno must be before Disco:
   - Blues - D&B - Ambient - Techno - Disco - Classical

4. Finally, House must be to the right of Blues, so House must be at position 7:
   - Blues - D&B - Ambient - Techno - Disco - Classical - House

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the final solution is:

```
|               |   1    |     2     |   3   |    4    |  5  |   6   |   7   |
| Music-Genre   | Blues  | D&B       | Ambient| Techno  | Disco| Classical| House |

Lv2-1x7-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to arrange the seven different hobbies (baking, camping, chess, collecting, filmmaking, fishing, skydiving) into the seven positions given the constraints. Let's analyze each clue step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
   - This means fishing must be in position 1 or 2, and skydiving must be in position 3 or 4.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
   - Since skydiving can only be in position 3 or 4, baking must be in position 5, 6, or 7.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This means chess must be in position 6 or 7 if baking is in position 5, or chess must be in position 7 if baking is in position 6.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is chess is between the person who's hobby is collecting and the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This means the sequence must be either collecting, chess, baking or baking, chess, collecting.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - This means collecting must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and camping must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is chess is in the middle.
   - Chess must be in position 4.

Now let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 6, chess is in position 4.
- From Clue 4, since chess is in position 4, it must be between collecting and baking. So, the sequence is either:
  - Collecting, chess, baking
  - Baking, chess, collecting

- From Clue 2, baking must be to the right of skydiving, and from Clue 1, fishing must be to the left of skydiving. So, skydiving can only be in position 3 or 4, but since chess is in position 4, skydiving must be in position 3.

- From Clue 1, fishing must be to the left of skydiving, so fishing must be in position 1 or 2. Since chess is in position 4, fishing cannot be in position 2 (because then skydiving would be in position 3, which conflicts with Clue 1).

- Therefore, fishing must be in position 1, and skydiving must be in position 3.

- Now, from Clue 2, baking must be to the right of skydiving, so baking must be in position 5, 6, or 7.

- From Clue 4, since chess is in position 4, the sequence is:
  - Collecting, chess, baking
  - Baking, chess, collecting

Since baking must be to the right of skydiving (position 3), and chess is in position 4, the only possible sequence for collecting and baking is:
- Collecting, chess, baking

This means collecting must be in position 1, chess in position 4, and baking in position 6.

- From Clue 5, since collecting is in position 1 and camping must be to the right, camping must be in position 5 or 6 or 7. But since baking is in position 6, camping must be in position 7.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Fishing
- Position 2: Collecting
- Position 3: Skydiving
- Position 4: Chess
- Position 5: Camping
- Position 6: Baking
- Position 7: Filmmaking

Here is the final solution table:

Lv2-1x7-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the hobbies in the correct order. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing.
2. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
3. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
4. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
5. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking.
6. The person who's hobby is sudoku is between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person who's hobby is card-games.

From clues 2 and 4, we can deduce that woodworking must be before both hiking and traveling. So, woodworking cannot be in the last two positions (6 or 7).

From clue 1, hiking is after fishing. So, fishing must be before hiking.

From clue 3, fishing is before baking. So, fishing is before both hiking and baking.

From clue 5, card-games is before baking. So, card-games must be before both fishing and hiking.

From clue 6, sudoku is between traveling and card-games. This means traveling is either immediately before or after card-games.

Let's start placing the hobbies based on these deductions:

- Since woodworking must come before both hiking and traveling, it can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Fishing must be before baking, so fishing can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Card-games must be before baking, so card-games can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Traveling must be after woodworking and before sudoku, so traveling can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.
- Hiking must be after fishing, so hiking can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.
- Baking must be after fishing and card-games, so baking can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

Considering all these constraints, let's try to fit them into the slots:

1. Woodworking (since it must be before both hiking and traveling)
2. Fishing (since it must be before baking and card-games)
3. Card-games (since it must be before baking)
4. Baking (since it must be after fishing and card-games)
5. Traveling (since it must be after woodworking and before sudoku)
6. Sudoku (must be between traveling and card-games)

Given these constraints, the only logical arrangement is:

1. Woodworking
2. Fishing
3. Card-games
4. Baking
5. Traveling
6. Sudoku
7. Hiking

So, the final solution is:

```

Lv2-1x7-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is reading.
   - This means the order could be: fishing, woodworking, reading or reading, woodworking, fishing.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
   - This means sudoku must come before chess in the sequence.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
   - This means reading must come before camping in the sequence.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
   - Reiterates Clue 2, so no new information here.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
   - Reiterates Clue 3, so no new information here.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is in the middle.
   - This means woodworking is in position 4 (since there are 7 positions).

7. **Clue 7:** The person who's hobby is dancing is the person who's hobby is dancing.
   - This is just stating that dancing is dancing, which doesn't provide new information.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.
   - This means camping must come before dancing in the sequence.

Now, let's put these clues together:

- From Clue 6, we know woodworking is in position 4.
- From Clue 1, woodworking is between fishing and reading, so the possible sequences are:
  - fishing, woodworking, reading, or
  - reading, woodworking, fishing.
- From Clue 3 and Clue 5, reading comes before camping.
- From Clue 8, camping comes before dancing.

Let's try to fit these into a sequence:

- Since woodworking is in position 4, and it needs to be between fishing and reading, let's consider:
  - fishing, woodworking, reading, _, _, _, dancing
  - reading, woodworking, fishing, _, _, _, dancing

Since camping must be after reading and before dancing, and considering the position of woodworking, we can place them as follows:

- If we use the sequence: fishing, woodworking, reading, _, _, _, dancing
  - We need to fit camping and the other two (sudoku and chess) into the remaining slots while maintaining the order.
  - Sudoku must be before chess, and camping must be before dancing.

So, the sequence might look like:
- fishing, woodworking, reading, camping, sudoku, chess, dancing

This fits all the given clues:
1. woodworking is between fishing and reading.
2. sudoku is before chess.
3. camping is after reading.
4. woodworking is in the middle (position 4).
5. camping is before dancing.

Thus, the final solution is:

Lv2-1x7-5	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to solve the puzzle:

1. **The person watching musical movies is between the person watching family movies and the person watching martial-arts movies.**
2. **The person watching action movies is on the far right (position 7).**
3. **The person watching family movies is the person watching family movies.** (This clue is redundant and doesn't provide new information.)
4. **The person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.**
5. **The person watching zombie movies is on the far left (position 1).**
6. **The person watching drama movies is between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person watching animation movies.**

Now let's place these clues into the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1: Zombie Movies** (Clue 5)
2. **Position 7: Action Movies** (Clue 2)

So far:
```
|               |   1    |   2    |    3    |      4       |   5   |     6     |   7    |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie |        |         |              |       |           | Action |
```

3. **Position 1 is already filled with Zombie, so we need to place Family, Martial-Arts, and Musical.** (Clue 1)
4. **Musical is between Family and Martial-Arts.** (Clue 1)
5. **Animation is on the left of Action.** (Clue 4)

Since Action is at position 7, Animation must be somewhere before that.

6. **Drama is between Martial-Arts and Animation.** (Clue 6)

Now, let's try to fit all the genres:

- **Position 1: Zombie**
- **Position 7: Action**
- **Animation must be on the left of Action, so it can be at positions 2, 3, or 4.**
- **Drama is between Martial-Arts and Animation.**
- **Musical is between Family and Martial-Arts.**

Let's start placing them:

- If Animation is at position 2, then Drama could be at position 3, and Martial-Arts at position 4.
- This would make Musical fit between Family and Martial-Arts.

So, let's place them accordingly:

```
|               |   1    |   2    |    3    |      4       |   5   |     6     |   7    |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie | Animation | Drama | Martial-Arts | Musical | Family   | Action |
```

- **Family must be placed such that Musical is between Family and Martial-Arts.**
- Since Musical is at position 5, Family must be at position 4.

Final arrangement:
```
|               |   1    |   2    |    3    |      4       |   5   |     6     |   7    |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie | Animation | Drama | Martial-Arts | Musical | Family   | Action |
```

This satisfies all the given conditions.

### Final Solution Table:

Lv2-1x7-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and place the hobbies accordingly.

1. **The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.**
   - This means baking cannot be in position 7 (since chess must be to its right).

2. **The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess.**
   - This means chess cannot be in position 6 or 7 (since singing must be to its right).

3. **The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right.**
   - Dancing must be in position 7.

4. **The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person who's hobby is fishing.**
   - This means magic-tricks and fishing must be on either side of rock-climbing, and rock-climbing cannot be in position 1 or 2.

5. **The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.**
   - Since dancing is in position 7, magic-tricks must be in position 6.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- Dancing is in position 7.
- Magic-tricks is in position 6.
- Chess must be to the left of singing.
- Baking must be to the left of chess.
- Rock-climbing is between magic-tricks and fishing.
- Fishing and magic-tricks must be on either side of rock-climbing, with magic-tricks being to the left of rock-climbing.

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining hobbies:

- Position 1: Baking (since it must be to the left of chess)
- Position 2: Chess (since it must be to the left of singing)
- Position 3: Singing (since it must be to the right of chess)
- Position 4: Rock-climbing (since it must be between magic-tricks and fishing)
- Position 5: Fishing (since it must be to the right of rock-climbing)

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Baking
- Position 2: Chess
- Position 3: Singing
- Position 4: Rock-climbing
- Position 5: Fishing
- Position 6: Magic-tricks
- Position 7: Dancing

Lv2-1x7-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Skydiving is on the far right (position 7).**
   - So, \( \text{Hobby at position 7} = \text{skydiving} \).

2. **Dancing is between Traveling and Skydiving.**
   - Since Skydiving is at position 7, Dancing must be at either position 5 or 6.
   - Traveling must be to the left of Dancing.

3. **Singing is on the right of Puzzles.**
   - This means Puzzles must be to the left of Singing.

4. **Singing is on the left of Traveling.**
   - This means Traveling must be to the right of Singing.

5. **Puzzles is on the right of Woodworking.**
   - This means Woodworking must be to the left of Puzzles.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the hobbies:

- From clue 1, Skydiving is at position 7.
- From clue 4, Puzzles must be to the left of Singing, and Singing must be to the left of Traveling.
- From clue 2, Singing is on the right of Puzzles.
- From clue 3, Singing is on the left of Traveling.

Since Traveling cannot be in position 7 (as Dancing is between Traveling and Skydiving), Traveling must be in position 5 or 6.

Let's assume Traveling is at position 5:
- Then Dancing must be at position 6.
- Singing must be at position 4 because it is to the left of Puzzles and Traveling.
- Puzzles must be at position 3 because it is to the left of Singing.

Now we need to place the remaining hobbies (camping and woodworking) in positions 1 and 2:
- Woodworking must be to the left of Puzzles, so it must be at position 2.
- Therefore, Camping must be at position 1.

So the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Camping

- Position 3: Puzzles
- Position 4: Singing
- Position 5: Traveling
- Position 6: Dancing

3. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is cycling is between the person who's sport is skiing and the person who's sport is golf.
4. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
   - This means skiing must be in position 2 and cycling in position 5.
5. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is golf is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
   - Therefore, golf must be in position 6.
6. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is basketball is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - Since baseball is in position 3, basketball must be either in position 2 or 5, but position 2 is already taken by skiing, so basketball must be in position 5.
   - Biathlon must then be in position 7.

Now let's summarize the positions:
- Position 1: We don't have any specific information for this position yet.
- Position 2: Skiing

Lv2-1x7-9	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is woodworking (W) is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking (B).
2. The person who's hobby is baking (B) is between the person who's hobby is woodworking (W) and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (M).
3. The person who's hobby is singing (S) is on the far left.
4. The person who's hobby is photography (P) is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (G).
5. The person who's hobby is gardening (G) is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess (C).
6. The person who's hobby is singing (S) is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess (C).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: Singing (S) is on the far left.
   ```
   S _ _ _ _ _ _
   ```

2. **Clue 6**: Singing (S) is on the left of Chess (C).
   ```
   S C _ _ _ _ _
   ```

3. **Clue 5**: Gardening (G) is on the right of Chess (C).
   ```
   S C G _ _ _ _
   ```

4. **Clue 4**: Photography (P) is on the right of Gardening (G).
   ```
   S C G P _ _ _
   ```

5. **Clue 2**: Baking (B) is between Woodworking (W) and Magic-Tricks (M).
   - This means W, B, M must be in that order somewhere.
   
6. **Clue 1**: Woodworking (W) is on the left of Baking (B).
   - Combining with clue 2, we get W, B, M in that order.

Now let's place W, B, M in the remaining positions while ensuring all conditions are met:

- Since S, C, G, P are already placed, W, B, M must fit into the remaining slots.
- Considering the order, W, B, M can only be in positions 1, 2, 3 or 2, 3, 4 or 3, 4, 5.

Given the positions:
- If W, B, M were in 2, 3, 4, it would not allow for the other clues to fit correctly.
- If W, B, M were in 3, 4, 5, it would also not work as S, C, G, P are already in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

Thus, W, B, M must be in positions 1, 2, 3:
```
S W B M G P _
```

We need to fill the last position with the only remaining hobby, which is woodworking (W), but since it's already in position 2, the last position must be woodworking (W).

So the final arrangement is:
```
S W B M G P W
```

### Conditions Recap:
1. The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
2. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.
3. The person watching martial-arts movies is the person watching martial-arts movies (redundant).
4. The person watching satire movies is between the person watching zombie movies and the person watching martial-arts movies.
5. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
6. The person watching drama movies is between the person watching action movies and the person watching zombie movies.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Condition 1 & 4:
- Adventure is to the right of Martial-Arts.
- Satire is between Zombie and Martial-Arts.
From these two conditions, we can deduce that the sequence must be something like:
\[ \text{Zombie, Satire, Martial-Arts, Adventure} \]

#### Condition 2 & 3:
- Satire is to the right of Zombie.
- Martial-Arts is to the right of Satire.
These conditions confirm the sequence from the previous deduction.

#### Condition 5:
- Action is to the right of Time-Travel.
This means we need to place Action and Time-Travel somewhere to the right of each other.

#### Condition 6:
- Drama is between Action and Zombie.
Given the sequence so far, let's place Drama:
\[ \text{Time-Travel, Action, Drama, Zombie, Satire, Martial-Arts, Adventure} \]
Drama fits perfectly between Action and Zombie.

### Final Order:
\[ \text{Time-Travel, Action, Drama, Zombie, Satire, Martial-Arts, Adventure} \]
