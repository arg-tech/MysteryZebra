Lv2-3x7-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7**: The chef is in the middle (position 4).
   - Chef is in position 4.
   
2. **Clue 13**: The owner of the frog is on the right of the chef.
   - The owner of the frog must be in position 5 or 6.
   - Since the chef is in position 4, the owner of the frog must be in position 5 or 6.

3. **Clue 2**: The security-guard is on the left of the social-worker.
   - Security-guard must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and social-worker must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - Since the chef is in position 4, the security-guard can only be in position 1 or 2, and social-worker in position 2 or 3.

4. **Clue 1**: The owner of the frog is on the left of the security-guard.
   - From Clue 2, the security-guard can only be in position 2, so the owner of the frog must be in position 1.
   - This means the security-guard is in position 2 and the social-worker is in position 3.

5. **Clue 13**: The owner of the frog is on the right of the chef.
   - This conflicts with our previous placement. Recheck:
   - The owner of the frog must be in position 5 or 6, and the security-guard is in position 2, so the social-worker is in position 3.
   - The chef is in position 4, and the owner of the frog must be in position 5 or 6.

6. **Clue 3**: The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
   - The owner of the lizard must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - The person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

7. **Clue 4**: The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the chef.
   - The person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - The chef is in position 4.

8. **Clue 5**: The librarian is the owner of the mouse.
   - The librarian must be in position 4, but the chef is already there.
   - Recheck: The librarian must be in position 6 or 7.

9. **Clue 6**: The owner of the cat is between the dancer and the social-worker.
   - The social-worker is in position 3.
   - The owner of the cat must be in position 2 or 4, but the chef is in position 4.
   - So, the owner of the cat must be in position 2.

10. **Clue 8**: The person drinking water is on the right of the owner of the pony.
    - The owner of the pony is in position 4, so the person drinking water must be in position 5, 6, or 7.

11. **Clue 9**: The owner of the pony is the person drinking coffee.
    - The owner of the pony is in position 4, and the person drinking coffee is also in position 4.
    - This is a contradiction. Recheck: The owner of the pony must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the person drinking coffee must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

12. **Clue 10**: The owner of the mouse is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
    - The owner of the mouse is in position 6 or 7.
    - The person drinking coffee is in position 4.

13. **Clue 11**: The analyst is the owner of the hedgehog.
    - The analyst must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    - The analyst is not in position 4 (chef), 3 (social-worker), or 2 (owner of the cat).

14. **Clue 14**: The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.
    - The person drinking lemonade must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
    - The person drinking 7up must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

15. **Clue 15**: The person drinking coffee is on the left of the librarian.
    - The person drinking coffee is in position 4.
    - The librarian must be in position 6 or 7.

### Final Placement:

- **Position 2**: Owner of the cat
- **Position 3**: Social-worker
- **Position 4**: Chef
- **Position 5**: Owner of the frog
- **Position 6**: Librarian (mouse)
- **Position 7**: Owner of the pony (coffee)

### Beverage Assignments:

3. **From Clue 3:** Woodworking is on the right of Nectarine.
   - Since Woodworking is not in Position 7 (Strawberry), it must be in Positions 5 or 6.
   - Nectarine must be in Position 3 or 4 (but Roller is in Position 4).
   - So, Nectarine is in Position 3 and Woodworking is in Position 5.
