Lv2-1x6-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. **The owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the hamster.**
   - This means that if the pony is at position \(i\), the hamster must be at position \(i+1\).

2. **The owner of the hamster is on the far right.**
   - Therefore, the hamster must be in position 6.

3. **The owner of the cat is on the left of the owner of the pony.**
   - If the pony is in position \(i\), then the cat must be in any position to the left of \(i\).

4. **The owner of the horse is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the rabbit.**
   - This means that the horse cannot be in the first or last position (since there must be one pet on either side of it). Also, the ferret and the rabbit must be on either side of the horse.

5. **The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.**
   - This means that the horse must be in a position to the left of the rabbit.

Let's use these clues to deduce the positions:

- From Clue 2, we know the hamster is in position 6.
- From Clue 1, the pony must be in position 5 because the hamster is in position 6.
- From Clue 3, the cat must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (to the left of the pony).
- From Clue 4, the horse must be between the ferret and the rabbit.
- From Clue 5, the horse is on the left of the rabbit.

Now, let's place the remaining pets (cat, ferret, and rabbit) while satisfying all conditions:

- The cat must be to the left of the pony, so it can only be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The horse must be between the ferret and the rabbit, and also to the left of the rabbit.
- Since the horse is to the left of the rabbit, and the horse must be between the ferret and the rabbit, the only possible arrangement for the horse, ferret, and rabbit is:
  - Ferret in position 2, Horse in position 3, Rabbit in position 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Cat
- Position 2: Ferret
- Position 3: Horse
- Position 4: Rabbit
- Position 5: Pony
- Position 6: Hamster

Here is the final solution table:

```

| Music-Genre   | reggae | trance| electronic | funk       | rock | ambient |
```

### Explanation:

1. **Fan of Ambient on the Far Right (4th Position):**
   - From clue 3, we know that the fan of ambient is on the far right, which is position 6.

2. **Fan of Rock to the Left of Ambient:**
   - Clue 4 states that the fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of rock. Since ambient is in position 6, rock must be in position 5.

3. **Fan of Electronic to the Right of Reggae:**
   - Clue 5 states that the fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of reggae. This means reggae must be in a position to the left of electronic.

4. **Funk Between Trance and Reggae:**
   - Clue 6 states that the fan of funk is between the fan of trance and the fan of reggae. Therefore, funk cannot be at either end and must be in a middle position.

5. **Fan of Rock to the Right of Fan of Electronic:**
   - Clue 1 states that the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of electronic. Since rock is in position 5, electronic must be in a position to the left of rock.

6. **Fan of Funk Between Trance and Reggae:**
   - From clue 6, since funk is between trance and reggae, and considering the positions already filled, the only possible arrangement for these three genres is:
     - Trance in position 2
     - Funk in position 3
     - Reggae in position 4

By placing all the genres according to these clues, we get the final arrangement as shown above."	{'music-genre': ['reggae', 'trance', 'electronic', 'funk', 'rock', 'ambient']}	True	2	False
Lv2-1x6-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating cranberry is between the person eating cabbage and the person eating spinach.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the person eating cabbage.
3. **Clue 3**: The person eating grapefruit is on the far right.
4. **Clue 4**: The person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person eating cauliflower.

Let's denote the positions as 1 to 6 from left to right.

From Clue 3, we know:
- Grapefruit (G) must be in position 6.

From Clue 4, since G is in position 6, the person eating cauliflower (C) must be in one of the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not in 6 because G is already there, and C must be to the left of G.

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- C is on the right of the person eating cabbage (B). So B cannot be in position 6 (Grapefruit), and C cannot be in position 1 (because then B would have no position to its left).

From Clue 1, we know:
- Cranberry (Cr) is between B and S. This means B, Cr, and S must occupy three consecutive positions, with Cr in the middle.

Let's try to place B, Cr, and S in the remaining positions (1 to 5):

Since C is to the right of B and G is in 6, C cannot be in 5 (since G is in 6). Let's test some placements:

### Test 1:
- Place B in position 1, Cr in position 2, and S in position 3.
- Then C must be in position 4 (since it is to the right of B).
- This leaves position 5 for the remaining food, which must be Cauliflower (Cf).

So, we have:
- Position 1: B (cabbage)
- Position 2: Cr (cranberry)
- Position 3: S (spinach)
- Position 4: C (cauliflower)
- Position 5: Cf (cauliflower)
- Position 6: G (grapefruit)

But this placement does not satisfy Clue 2 (C is on the right of B) and Clue 1 (Cr is between B and S).

### Test 2:
- Place B in position 2, Cr in position 3, and S in position 4.
- Then C must be in position 5.
- This leaves position 1 for the remaining food, which must be Cauliflower (Cf).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Cf (cauliflower)
- Position 2: B (cabbage)
- Position 3: Cr (cranberry)
- Position 4: S (spinach)
- Position 5: C (cauliflower)
- Position 6: G (grapefruit)

This satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 1: Cr (cranberry) is between B (cabbage) and S (spinach).
- Clue 2: C (cauliflower) is on the right of B (cabbage).
- Clue 3: G (grapefruit) is on the far right.
- Clue 4: G (grapefruit) is on the right of C (cauliflower).

Therefore, the final solution is:

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
2. The owner of the turtle is on the far right.
3. The owner of the bird is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the goat.
4. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the goat.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The owner of the turtle is on the far right (position 6).
   - So, position 6 is turtle.

   ```
   |       |  1  |   2    |    3     |  4   |  5   |   6    |
   | Pet   |     |        |          |      |      | turtle |
   ```

2. **Clue 4**: The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the goat.
   - This means the goat must be in position 5.

   ```
   |       |  1  |   2    |    3     |  4   |  5   |   6    |
   | Pet   |     |        |          |      | goat | turtle |
   ```

3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the bird is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the goat.
   - Since the goat is in position 5, the bird must be in position 3 or 4. However, since the goldfish must be to the left of the bird, the only possible positions for the bird and goldfish are positions 3 and 4 respectively.

   ```
   |       |  1  |   2    |    3     |  4   |  5   |   6    |
   | Pet   |     |        |  goldfish|  bird | goat | turtle |
   ```

4. **Clue 1**: The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
   - Since the goldfish is in position 3, the lizard must be in position 1.

   ```
   |       |  1  |   2    |    3     |  4   |  5   |   6    |
   | Pet   | lizard|        |  goldfish|  bird | goat | turtle |
   ```

5. **Remaining Pets**:
   - The remaining pet is the rat, which must be in position 2.

   ```
   |       |  1  |   2    |    3     |  4   |  5   |   6    |
   | Pet   | lizard|  rat   |  goldfish|  bird | goat | turtle |
   ```

Lv2-1x6-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step and place the movie genres accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.**
   - This means if martial-arts is at position \(x\), then time-travel must be at position \(x+1\) or further to the right.

2. **The person watching scientific movies is between the person watching time-travel movies and the person watching comedy movies.**
   - This means the order could be either:
     - Time-travel → Scientific → Comedy
     - Comedy → Scientific → Time-travel

3. **The person watching comedy movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching adventure movies.**
   - This means the order could be:
     - Scientific → Comedy → Adventure
     - Adventure → Comedy → Scientific

4. **The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.**
   - This reinforces that the order must be:
     - Time-travel → Scientific → Comedy → Adventure

5. **The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person watching romance movies.**
   - This means if adventure is at position \(y\), then romance must be at position \(y+1\) or further to the left.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

- From clue 1 and 4, we can infer that the order must start with martial-arts (leftmost) and end with romance (rightmost).
- From clue 2 and 3, we can determine the exact placement of the genres based on the given constraints.

Let's place the genres:

1. Martial-arts (1)
2. Time-travel (2) [since it must be to the right of martial-arts]
3. Scientific (3) [must be between time-travel and comedy]
4. Comedy (4) [must be between scientific and adventure]
5. Adventure (5) [must be to the left of romance]
6. Romance (6)

Thus, the final arrangement is:

|               |      1       |      2      |     3      |   4    |     5     |    6    |

2. The entrepreneur is on the left of the analyst.
3. The analyst is on the far right.
4. The journalist is between the electrician and the software-developer.
5. The software-developer is on the right of the journalist.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The lawyer must be in position 1.
- The analyst must be in position 6.
- The entrepreneur must be to the left of the analyst, so it must be in position 2 or 3.
- The journalist must be between the electrician and the software-developer.
- The software-developer must be to the right of the journalist.

Let's start filling in the positions:

1. Lawyer (L)
2. Entrepreneur (E)
3. Analyst (A) - This is the far right, but let's keep this in mind for now.
4. ?
5. ?
6. Analyst (A)

Now, we need to fit the remaining jobs (electrician, journalist, and software-developer) into positions 2, 3, 4, and 5. We know:
- The journalist must be between the electrician and the software-developer.
- The software-developer must be to the right of the journalist.

Given that the analyst is in position 6, the only possible order for the remaining jobs that fits all conditions is:

- Position 2: Entrepreneur (E)

Lv2-1x6-7	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. The Canadian is on the far right.
2. The Russian is on the right of the Colombian.
3. The German is between the Canadian and the Argentine.
4. The Russian is on the left of the Italian.

Let's denote the positions as 1 through 6 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The Canadian (C) is on the far right.
   - Position 6: C

2. **Clue 2**: The Russian (R) is on the right of the Colombian (Co).
   - This means Co cannot be in position 6, and R must be to the right of Co.

3. **Clue 3**: The German (G) is between the Canadian (C) and the Argentine (A).
   - Since C is in position 6, A must be to the left of G, and G must be to the left of C.
   - Therefore, A, G, and C must occupy positions 3, 4, and 6 respectively or some permutation that keeps A to the left of G and G to the left of C.
   - Possible positions for A, G, and C are 3, 4, and 6.

4. **Clue 4**: The Russian (R) is on the left of the Italian (I).
   - This means I must be to the right of R.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit all the nationalities into the positions:

- Since C is in position 6, A and G must be in positions 3 and 4 (in some order), but G must be between A and C.
- The remaining positions (1, 2, and 5) need to be filled with the remaining nationalities: Argentine (A), Colombian (Co), German (G), Russian (R), and Italian (I).

Let's test the possible permutations:

- If A is in position 3 and G is in position 4:
  - Then positions 1, 2, and 5 need to be filled with Co, R, and I.
  - Since R is on the left of I, R must be in position 1 and I in position 5.
  - This leaves Co in position 2.

This fits all the clues:
- A in position 3
- G in position 4
- C in position 6
- R in position 1
- I in position 5
- Co in position 2

So the final arrangement is:

| Nationality   | Argentine | Colombian | German   | Italian  | Russian  | Canadian |

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is fishing is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person who's hobby is drawing.
   - This means the order must be: Skydiving, Fishing, Drawing.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is between the person who's hobby is card-games and the person who's hobby is drawing.
   - Since drawing is mentioned, and it must be to the right of rock-climbing (from Clue 1), rock-climbing must come before drawing. So the order must be: Card-Games, Rock-Climbing, Drawing.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
   - This means skydiving must come before puzzles.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
   - From Clue 1, we know fishing is between skydiving and drawing. So fishing must be on the left of skydiving, which aligns with Clue 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - This confirms the order from Clue 2.

Now let's combine all these clues to find the final order:

- From Clue 1: Skydiving, Fishing, Drawing.
- From Clue 2: Card-Games, Rock-Climbing, Drawing.
- From Clue 3: Skydiving must come before Puzzles.
- From Clue 4: Fishing is on the left of Skydiving.
- From Clue 5: Rock-Climbing is on the right of Card-Games.

Given these constraints, the only way to fit everything together is:

3. **Condition 3:** The writer is between the project-manager and the designer.
4. **Condition 4:** The project-manager is on the right of the engineer.
5. **Condition 5:** The bartender is on the right of the chef.

From these conditions, we can infer the following:

- From Condition 1 and Condition 2, we know that the order must be: chef, designer, writer, bartender.
- From Condition 3, the designer is between the writer and the project-manager, so the sequence must include: writer, designer, project-manager.
- Combining Conditions 1, 2, and 3, we get: chef, designer, writer, project-manager, bartender.
- From Condition 4, the project-manager is on the right of the engineer, which means the engineer must be before the project-manager. So, the sequence becomes: chef, designer, writer, project-manager, engineer, bartender.
