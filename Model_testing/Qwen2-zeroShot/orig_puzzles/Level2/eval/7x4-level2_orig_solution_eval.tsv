### Initial Setup:
We start with the known positions:
- **Manager** (Clue 4) is on the far left.
- **Documentary movie watcher** (Clue 5) is on the far left.

So, we have:
```
| Manager | ?       | ?       | ?       |
| Doc     | ?       | ?       | ?       |
```

### Clue Analysis:
- **Clue 16:** The Russian is on the far left. So, the Russian is the manager.
- **Clue 5:** The person watching documentary movies is on the far left. So, the Russian watches documentaries.

Now we have:
```
| Russian | ?       | ?       | ?       |
| Doc     | ?       | ?       | ?       |
```

- **Clue 3:** The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
- **Clue 8:** The person driving the bus is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.

- **Clue 10:** The nurse is the person who's sport is rowing.
- **Clue 17:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.

- **Clue 12:** The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.

### Positioning:
- The Thai must be on the left of the owner of the horse.
- The person who drives the taxi is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
- The person who drives the bus is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.

### Final Table:
Based on all the clues, we can deduce the following:

```
| Russian | Thai    | Owner of Horse | Person with Writing Hobby |

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues:

#### Step 1: Identify the Indonesian
- **Clue 3:** The Indonesian is the fan of folk.
- **Clue 10:** The fan of folk is the person whose hobby is video-games.
- Therefore, the Indonesian's hobby is video-games.
- **Clue 14:** The Indonesian is the coach.
- Therefore, the Indonesian's job is coach.
- **Clue 1:** The fan of indie is the entrepreneur.
- Since the Indonesian is not the fan of indie, they cannot be the entrepreneur.
- **Clue 13:** The person driving the taxi is the person whose sport is golf.
- Since the Indonesian is the coach, their sport must be something other than golf (as the person driving the taxi has golf as their sport).
- **Clue 12:** The person whose sport is sailing is the Dutch.
- Since the Indonesian is not the Dutch, their sport must be something other than sailing.
- **Clue 6:** The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the Thai.
- Since the Indonesian is not the Thai, their sport must be something other than surfing or golf.
- **Clue 9:** The person whose sport is surfing is on the left of the Thai.
- Since the Indonesian is not the Thai, their sport must be something other than surfing.
- Therefore, the Indonesian's sport is likely to be either rugby or sailing (since they are not golf, surfing, or any other sport mentioned).

#### Step 2: Identify the Fan of Indie
- **Clue 1:** The fan of indie is the entrepreneur.
- **Clue 2:** The fan of indie is between the fan of punk and the project-manager.
- Therefore, the order is: Fan of punk -> Fan of indie -> Project-manager.
- Since the Indonesian is the fan of folk, the fan of punk cannot be the Indonesian.
- Therefore, the fan of punk is likely to be the Dutch (since the Dutch is the only nationality left that could fit this position).

#### Step 3: Identify the Person Driving the Bus
- **Clue 4:** The person driving the bus is the person watching comedy movies.
- **Clue 8:** The person whose hobby is cooking is on the left of the person driving the bus.
- Therefore, the person driving the bus is not the person whose hobby is cooking.
- **Clue 5:** The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person watching scientific movies.
- **Clue 6:** The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the Thai.
- Therefore, the Thai is not the person watching scientific movies.
- **Clue 9:** The person whose sport is surfing is on the left of the Thai.
- Therefore, the Thai is not the person whose sport is surfing.
- Therefore, the Thai's sport is likely to be golf or rugby (since they are not surfing or any other sport mentioned).

#### Step 4: Identify the Person Watching Time-Travel Movies
- **Clue 15:** The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person driving the trike.
- Therefore, the person driving the trike is not the person watching time-travel movies.
- **Clue 7:** The person driving the subway is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing.
- Therefore, the person driving the subway is not the person whose sport is surfing.
- Therefore, the person driving the trike is likely to be the person whose sport is golf (since the person driving the taxi already has golf as their sport).
