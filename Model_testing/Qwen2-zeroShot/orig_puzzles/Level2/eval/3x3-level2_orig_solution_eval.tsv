Lv2-3x3-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The person eating raspberry is the person driving the train.
2. The owner of the cat is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating apple.
3. The person driving the car is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
4. The owner of the cat is on the left of the person eating apple.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- The person eating raspberry is the person driving the train.
  - This means the person who eats raspberry is in the ""Transport"" column for ""Train"".

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the cat is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating apple.
  - Since the person eating raspberry is in the ""Train"" column, the owner of the cat must be in either the ""Apple"" or ""Cabbage"" column (because these are the only two columns to the left of the ""Train"" column).

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the car is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
  - This means the owner of the lizard is in one of the first two columns, and the person driving the car is in the last column (""Car"").

#### Clue 4:
- The owner of the cat is on the left of the person eating apple.
  - This means the owner of the cat cannot be in the ""Apple"" column; it must be in the ""Cabbage"" column.

### Putting the Clues Together:

1. **Owner of the Lizard:**
   - From Clue 3, the owner of the lizard is in either the first or second column.
   - From Clue 4, the owner of the cat is in the second column.
   - Therefore, the owner of the lizard must be in the first column.

2. **Owner of the Cat:**
   - From Clue 4, the owner of the cat is in the second column.
   - From Clue 2, the owner of the cat is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating apple.
   - Since the person eating raspberry is in the ""Train"" column, the person eating apple must be in the third column.

3. **Person Eating Raspberry:**
   - The person eating raspberry is in the ""Train"" column (from Clue 1).
   - The person eating apple is in the ""Apple"" column (from Clue 2 and Clue 4).

4. **Person Eating Cabbage:**
   - The remaining person must be eating cabbage.
   - Therefore, the person eating cabbage is in the ""Cabbage"" column.

5. **Transportation:**
   - The person driving the car is on the right of the owner of the lizard (Clue 3).
   - The owner of the lizard is in the first column, so the person driving the car must be in the third column.

Lv2-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is chess is the lawyer.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking fanta is between the project-manager and the person drinking 7up.

We need to fill the table with the following:
- Beverages: 7up, Fanta, Tea
- Hobbies: Card-games, Chess, Woodworking
- Jobs: Lawyer, Musician, Project-Manager

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1 Analysis:
- The person who likes chess is the lawyer.
- This means the lawyer has chess as a hobby.

#### Clue 2 Analysis:
- The person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
- This implies that if someone's hobby is woodworking, the person drinking tea must be in the next column to their right.

#### Clue 3 Analysis:
- The person drinking fanta is between the project-manager and the person drinking 7up.
- This means there is one person between the fanta drinker and the 7up drinker, and the project-manager is either immediately before or after the fanta drinker.

### Constructing the Table:

Let's denote:
- \( L \) for Lawyer
- \( M \) for Musician
- \( P \) for Project-Manager
- \( C \) for Chess (Hobby)
- \( W \) for Woodworking (Hobby)
- \( K \) for Card-games (Hobby)
- \( T \) for Tea (Beverage)
- \( F \) for Fanta (Beverage)
- \( 7 \) for 7up (Beverage)

From Clue 1, we know:
- \( L \) has \( C \).

From Clue 2, we know:
- If someone's hobby is \( W \), then the person drinking \( T \) is to their right.

From Clue 3, we know:
- \( F \) is between \( P \) and \( 7 \).

Given these constraints, let's try to fit everything into the table:

1. Since \( L \) has \( C \), \( L \) cannot have \( W \) or \( K \). Therefore, \( L \) must be in the first row (Job) and second or third column (Hobby).

2. Since \( T \) is on the right of \( W \), if \( W \) is in column 1, \( T \) must be in column 2. But since \( L \) has \( C \), \( L \) cannot have \( W \). So, \( W \) must be in column 2 or 3.

3. If \( W \) is in column 2, \( T \) must be in column 3. Therefore, the person in column 3 must be drinking \( T \).

4. Since \( F \) is between \( P \) and \( 7 \), and \( P \) and \( 7 \) must be adjacent, \( F \) can only be in column 2 (as \( T \) is already in column 3).

5. Given the positions, let's assign:
   - \( L \) (Lawyer) in column 2 with \( C \) (Chess).
   - \( W \) (Woodworking) in column 1.
   - \( T \) (Tea) in column 3.
   - \( F \) (Fanta) in column 2.
   - \( P \) (Project-Manager) in column 1.
   - \( 7 \) (7up) in column 3.

So, the table looks like this:

```
|            |   1    |      2      |        3        |
| Beverage   |   7up  |     Fanta    |       Tea       |
| Hobby      | Woodwork|     Chess    |       -         |
| Job        | Musician|     Lawyer   |       -         |
```

Since the third column does not have a job, it must be empty.

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|            |   1    |      2      |        3        |
| Beverage   |   7up  |     Fanta    |       Tea       |
| Hobby      | Woodwork|     Chess    |       -         |
| Job        | Musician|     Lawyer   |       -         |

Lv2-3x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to find the correct arrangement.

### Given Information:
1. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the firefighter.
2. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching spy movies.
3. The person watching disaster movies is the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
4. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the mechanic and the person who's sport is sailing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Step 1: Identify the person who watches disaster movies.
From points 1, 2, and 3, we know that the person who watches disaster movies is also the one who plays ice-hockey.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions.
Since the person who watches disaster movies is on the left of the firefighter (point 1) and on the left of the person who watches spy movies (point 2), we can infer that the person who watches disaster movies must be in position 1.

#### Step 3: Identify the sport of the person who watches disaster movies.
From point 3, we know that the person who watches disaster movies plays ice-hockey.

#### Step 4: Identify the job of the person who watches disaster movies.
From point 4, since the person who plays ice-hockey is between the mechanic and the person who plays sailing, and the person who plays ice-hockey is in position 1, the mechanic must be in position 3, and the person who plays sailing must be in position 2.

#### Step 5: Determine the remaining preferences.
- Position 1: Disaster movies, Ice-hockey, Mechanic
- Position 2: Spy movies, Sailing, Person with unknown job
- Position 3: Documentary movies, Parkour, Firefighter

From point 4, the mechanic is between the ice-hockey player (position 1) and the sailing player (position 2). Therefore, the only job left for position 2 is the firefighter, and the only job left for position 3 is the designer.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Disaster movies, Ice-hockey, Mechanic
- Position 2: Spy movies, Sailing, Firefighter
- Position 3: Documentary movies, Parkour, Designer

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |     2      |      3      |

Lv2-3x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person driving the motorbike is on the far right.**
   - This means that the person driving the motorbike is in column 3.

2. **The fan of funk is on the left of the person driving the train.**
   - Since the person driving the motorbike is in column 3, the fan of funk must be in column 1 or 2.
   - The person driving the train cannot be in column 3 (already occupied by the motorbike driver), so they must be in column 2 or 1.

3. **The person driving the train is between the fan of funk and the person watching drama movies.**
   - This implies that the person driving the train is in column 2, and the fan of funk is in column 1, with the person watching drama movies in column 3.
   - Therefore:
     - Column 1: Fan of funk
     - Column 2: Person driving the train
     - Column 3: Person watching drama movies

4. **The fan of pop is on the right of the person watching epic movies.**
   - Since the person watching drama movies is in column 3, the person watching epic movies must be in column 1 or 2.
   - The fan of pop is on the right of the person watching epic movies, which means the fan of pop must be in column 3.

5. **The fan of pop is on the far right.**
   - This confirms that the fan of pop is in column 3, which aligns with our previous deduction.

6. **Determine the remaining positions for the genres and means of transport.**
   - From the above steps, we have:
     - Column 1: Fan of funk
     - Column 2: Person driving the train
     - Column 3: Fan of pop (and person watching drama movies)

7. **Assign the remaining genres and means of transport.**
   - The person watching drama movies is in column 3.
   - The fan of funk is in column 1.
   - The fan of pop is in column 3, but since it’s already assigned to the person watching drama movies, we need to assign the other two genres.
   - The person driving the train is in column 2.
   - The remaining genres are: epic and romance.
   - The remaining means of transport are: helicopter and motorbike.
   - Since the person driving the motorbike is in column 3, the person driving the helicopter must be in column 2.
   - Therefore:
     - Column 1: Fan of funk
     - Column 2: Person driving the helicopter (watching epic movies)
     - Column 3: Fan of pop (watching drama movies)

8. **Final assignment:**
   - Column 1: Fan of funk
   - Column 2: Person driving the helicopter (watching epic movies)
   - Column 3: Fan of pop (watching drama movies)

Lv2-3x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the information into the appropriate cells of the table. Let's go through each clue step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of soul is the owner of the ferret.**
   - This means that the person who likes soul music owns the ferret.
   
2. **The owner of the ferret is on the right of the person driving the bike.**
   - This means if we number the columns as 1, 2, and 3, the person with the ferret is in column 2 or 3, and the person driving the bike is in column 1.

3. **The fan of salsa is the person driving the jet-ski.**
   - This means the person who likes salsa music drives the jet-ski.

4. **The owner of the ferret is between the owner of the frog and the fan of salsa.**
   - Since the owner of the ferret is in column 2 (as per clue 2), the owner of the frog must be in column 1 and the fan of salsa must be in column 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 3:**
   - The fan of salsa is the person driving the jet-ski.
   - So, the third column must have the jet-ski.

2. **From Clue 4:**
   - The owner of the ferret is in the second column.
   - The owner of the frog must be in the first column, and the fan of salsa must be in the third column.

3. **From Clue 1:**
   - The fan of soul is the owner of the ferret.
   - Since the owner of the ferret is in the second column, the fan of soul must also be in the second column.

4. **From Clue 2:**
   - The owner of the ferret is on the right of the person driving the bike.
   - Since the owner of the ferret is in the second column, the person driving the bike must be in the first column.

### Final Table:

Let's fill in the table based on the above deductions:

Lv2-3x3-6	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading.
2. The fan of rock is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
3. The fan of classical is between the person watching horror movies and the fan of rock.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze the first condition
- ""The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading.""
  - This means the person watching sports movies must be in position 1 (leftmost), and the person with the hobby of reading must be in position 3 (rightmost).

  So, we can set up:
  ```
  1. Sports Movies
  2. ?
  3. Reading
  ```

#### Step 2: Analyze the second condition
- ""The fan of rock is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.""
  - Since the fan of rock is on the left of the person with the hobby of photography, the fan of rock cannot be in position 3 (since the person with the hobby of photography would then be to the right, violating the condition).
  - Therefore, the fan of rock must be in position 1 or 2.
  
  Since position 1 is already taken by sports movies, the fan of rock must be in position 2.

  Now our setup looks like:
  ```
  1. Sports Movies
  2. Rock
  3. Reading
  ```

#### Step 3: Analyze the third condition
- ""The fan of classical is between the person watching horror movies and the fan of rock.""
  - This means the fan of classical must be in position 2, but we already have rock in position 2, so there's a contradiction unless we reassess.

Given the conditions, let's re-evaluate:
- If the fan of rock is in position 2, and the fan of classical needs to be between the person watching horror movies and the fan of rock, then the only logical placement for the fan of classical is position 1.
  - But that conflicts with the sports movies being in position 1.

So, let's try another arrangement based on the constraints:
- Position 1: Horror Movies
- Position 2: Rock
- Position 3: Reading

Now we need to place the genres correctly:
- The fan of classical must be between the person watching horror movies and the fan of rock, which fits perfectly in position 2.

So, the correct setup is:
```
1. Horror Movies
2. Rock
3. Reading
```

Lv2-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person whose sport is tennis.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching western movies is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person whose sport is baseball.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- Let D be the person watching documentary movies.
- Let T be the person whose sport is tennis.
- D must be to the right of T.

This gives us two possible positions for D and T:
- T _ D
- _ T D

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- Let S be the person driving the snowmobile.
- Let J be the person driving the jet-ski.
- S must be to the left of J.

This gives us two possible positions for S and J:
- S J _
- _ S J

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Let W be the person watching western movies.
- Let B be the person whose sport is baseball.
- W is between J and B.

This gives us two possible positions for W, J, and B:
- J W B
- B W J

### Combining Clues:
We need to fit all these constraints together. Let's try to place them in the table:

1. **Clue 1 (T _ D):**
   - We can place T and D in the first two columns or the last two columns.
   
2. **Clue 2 (S _ J):**
   - We can place S and J in the first and second columns or the second and third columns.
   
3. **Clue 3 (J W B):**
   - We can place J, W, and B in the second, third, and first columns respectively or in reverse order.

### Trying Possible Arrangements:
Let's try placing T and D first:
- If T is in column 1 and D is in column 3, then the only way to satisfy Clue 3 with J and W is if J is in column 2 and W is in column 3, but D is already in column 3. So, this doesn't work.
  
- If T is in column 2 and D is in column 3, then we can have:
  - T in column 2
  - D in column 3
  
Now, let's place S and J:
- If S is in column 1 and J is in column 2, then we have:
  - S in column 1
  - J in column 2
  - D in column 3

Finally, we need to place W and B such that W is between J and B:
- W must be in column 2, and B must be in column 3, which conflicts with D being in column 3.

So, let's try another arrangement:
- If T is in column 3 and D is in column 1, then:
  - T in column 3
  - D in column 1
  
Now, let's place S and J:
- If S is in column 1 and J is in column 2, then we have:
  - S in column 1
  - J in column 2
  - D in column 3

Finally, we need to place W and B such that W is between J and B:
- W must be in column 2, and B must be in column 3, which conflicts with D being in column 3.

After trying different combinations, we find the following arrangement fits all the clues:
- T in column 1
- D in column 3
- S in column 1
- J in column 2
- W in column 2
- B in column 3

Lv2-3x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The bartender is between the owner of the pony and the analyst.**
   - This implies that the bartender cannot be in position 1 or 3 (since there would be no one to their left or right respectively).

2. **The person driving the ship is between the person driving the bike and the analyst.**
   - This implies that the analyst is not in position 1 or 3 (since there would be no one to their left or right respectively).

3. **The owner of the chinchilla is in the middle.**
   - This means the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 2.

4. **The owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.**
   - Since the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2, the owner of the pony must be in position 1.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1:**
   - The owner of the pony is here.
   
2. **Position 2:**
   - The owner of the chinchilla is here.
   
3. **Position 3:**
   - The owner of the hedgehog is here (since the only pet left is the hedgehog).

Now let's assign the jobs and transportation methods based on the remaining clues.

1. **The bartender is between the owner of the pony and the analyst.**
   - Since the owner of the pony is in position 1 and the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2, the bartender must be in position 3.

2. **The person driving the ship is between the person driving the bike and the analyst.**
   - Since the analyst cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as per clue 2), the analyst must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person driving the bike must be in position 1, and the person driving the ship must be in position 3.

### Final Assignment:

- **Position 1:**
  - **Job:** Bartender
  - **Pet:** Pony
  - **Transport:** Bike

- **Position 2:**
  - **Job:** Analyst
  - **Pet:** Chinchilla
  - **Transport:** Ship

- **Position 3:**
  - **Job:** Manager
  - **Pet:** Hedgehog
  - **Transport:** Scooter

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv2-3x3-10	"Let's break down the information step-by-step to solve the puzzle:

1. **The Egyptian is the person who's sport is handball.**
   - This means the Egyptian is in the ""Sport"" column for Handball.

2. **The fan of indie is between the Indonesian and the fan of r&b.**
   - This implies that the order of the music-genres must be: Indonesian -> Indie -> R&B or R&B -> Indie -> Indonesian.

3. **The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.**
   - Since the Egyptian (handball) is on the right of the person with skateboarding, this means the person with skateboarding must be in position 1 or 2.

4. **The Mexican is on the left of the fan of r&b.**
   - The Mexican cannot be in the last position because they would need to be to the left of someone, so they must be in position 1 or 2. Since the person with skateboarding must be on the left of handball, the Mexican must be in position 1, and the fan of r&b must be in position 3.

Now let's summarize the information:

- The Mexican is in position 1.
- The person with skateboarding is in position 2.
- The Egyptian (handball) is in position 3.

Given these positions, we can start filling out the table:

|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
|---------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| Music-Genre   |            |               |          |
| Nationality   | Mexican    |               | Egyptian |
| Sport         | Skateboarding |             | Handball |

Next, let's fill in the music-genre based on the clues:

- The fan of indie is between the Indonesian and the fan of r&b.
- The Mexican is on the left of the fan of r&b.

Since the Mexican is in position 1, the fan of r&b must be in position 3 (Egyptian). Therefore, the Indonesian must be in position 2.

So the final table looks like this:

|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
|---------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| Music-Genre   | R&B        | Indie         | Jazz     |
| Nationality   | Mexican    | Indonesian    | Egyptian |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Soccer     | Handball |

Now, let's put the final solution table in the requested format:

```
|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
