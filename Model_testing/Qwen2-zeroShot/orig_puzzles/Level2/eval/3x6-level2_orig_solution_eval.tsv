Lv2-3x6-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person driving the airplane is the owner of the horse.**
   - This means the owner of the horse is also the one who drives the airplane.

2. **The person driving the boat is on the far right.**
   - So, the person in seat 6 is driving the boat.

3. **The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the tram.**
   - If the airplane driver is in seat 5, then the tram driver must be in seat 4.
   - If the airplane driver is in seat 4, then the tram driver must be in seat 3, and so on.

4. **The person driving the van is the owner of the snake.**
   - The owner of the snake is also the one who drives the van.

5. **The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the person driving the car.**
   - If the car driver is in seat 3, then the goldfish owner is in seat 4.
   - If the car driver is in seat 2, then the goldfish owner is in seat 3, and so on.

6. **The owner of the lizard is on the left of the Italian.**
   - The Italian cannot be in seat 1 (leftmost).

7. **The owner of the snake is on the right of the person driving the taxi.**
   - If the taxi driver is in seat 2, then the snake owner is in seat 3.
   - If the taxi driver is in seat 1, then the snake owner is in seat 2, and so on.

8. **The Chinese is on the left of the person driving the boat.**
   - Since the boat is driven by someone in seat 6, the Chinese must be in seat 1 or 2.

9. **The Thai is on the left of the Australian.**
   - The Thai cannot be in seat 6, and the Australian cannot be in seat 1.

10. **The Italian is the owner of the goldfish.**
    - The Italian owns the goldfish and is not in seat 6.

11. **The Thai is on the right of the owner of the goldfish.**
    - The Thai is to the right of the Italian.

12. **The Thai is between the person driving the tram and the owner of the goldfish.**
    - This means the Thai is in seat 4, and the owner of the goldfish (Italian) is in seat 5, and the tram driver is in seat 3.

13. **The person driving the airplane is between the Egyptian and the owner of the rat.**
    - This means the airplane driver (who is the owner of the horse) is in seat 5, the Egyptian is in seat 4, and the owner of the rat is in seat 6.

### Final Placement:

- **Seat 1**: Chinese
- **Seat 2**: Thai
- **Seat 3**: Tram Driver
- **Seat 4**: Egyptian
- **Seat 5**: Owner of the Horse (Airplane Driver)
- **Seat 6**: Boat Driver

### Filling in the Pets and Nationalities:

From clue 10, the Italian is the owner of the goldfish. From clue 11, the Thai is on the right of the Italian, meaning the Thai is in seat 2.

From clue 6, the owner of the lizard is on the left of the Italian, so the owner of the lizard must be in seat 1, which is the Chinese.

From clue 12, the Thai is between the person driving the tram and the owner of the goldfish. So the Thai is in seat 2, and the owner of the goldfish (Italian) is in seat 5.

From clue 13, the person driving the airplane (seat 5) is between the Egyptian (seat 4) and the owner of the rat (seat 6).

From clue 3, the person driving the airplane (seat 5) is on the right of the person driving the tram (seat 4). 

So, the final arrangement is:

- **Owner of the Lizard (Chinese)**: Seat 1
- **Thai**: Seat 2
- **Tram Driver**: Seat 3
- **Egyptian**: Seat 4
- **Owner of the Horse (Airplane Driver)**: Seat 5
- **Boat Driver (Australian)**: Seat 6

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1 (leftmost):**
   - From clue 11, the person eating Blueberry is on the far left (position 1).

2. **Position 6 (far right):**
   - From clue 4, the person whose hobby is Baking is on the far right (position 6). According to clue 1, this person also eats Cherry.
   - Therefore, position 6: **Baking, Cherry**

3. **Position 4:**
   - From clue 10, the person drinking Sprite is on the right of the person drinking Fanta. Since position 6 is already occupied by Baking and Cherry, and from clue 3, the person drinking Sprite also eats Eggplant, position 4 must be occupied by Fanta. Therefore, position 5 must be occupied by Sprite.
   - Therefore, position 4: **Fanta, [to be determined]**
   - Position 5: **Sprite, Eggplant**

4. **Position 3:**
   - From clue 2, the person whose hobby is Skydiving is on the left of the person drinking Mirinda. Also, from clue 12, the person whose hobby is Skydiving is the person eating Papaya.
   - Therefore, position 3: **Skydiving, Papaya**
   - Position 2 must be occupied by the person drinking Mirinda.

5. **Position 2:**
   - From clue 2, the person whose hobby is Skydiving (position 3) is on the left of the person drinking Mirinda. Therefore, position 2: **Mirinda, [to be determined]**

6. **Position 8 (right of position 6):**
   - From clue 5, the person whose hobby is Singing is on the right of the person drinking Hot-Chocolate. Also, from clue 6, the person whose hobby is Reading is the person drinking Hot-Chocolate.
   - Therefore, position 6 is already occupied by Baking and Cherry, so position 5 is occupied by Sprite and Eggplant, and position 4 is occupied by Fanta and [to be determined]. Hence, position 3 is occupied by Skydiving and Papaya. Thus, position 2 must be occupied by Mirinda and [to be determined].
   - Therefore, position 1: **Blueberry, [to be determined]**
   - Position 2: **Mirinda, Skydiving**
   - Position 3: **Papaya, Reading**
   - Position 4: **Fanta, Hot-Chocolate**
   - Position 5: **Sprite, Eggplant**
   - Position 6: **Baking, Cherry**

7. **Final Position for Hiking and Tea:**
   - From clue 8, the person drinking Tea is between the person eating Papaya and the person whose hobby is Hiking.
   - Therefore, position 3 is Papaya and Reading, position 4 is Fanta and Hot-Chocolate, position 5 is Sprite and Eggplant, and position 6 is Baking and Cherry.
   - Position 2 is Mirinda and Skydiving.
   - So, the only positions left are 1 and 2.
   - From clue 9, the person eating Cherry is on the right of the person eating Papaya.
   - Therefore, position 1: **Blueberry, Hiking**
   - Position 2: **Mirinda, Skydiving**

Lv2-3x6-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to determine the correct order of food, hobbies, and nationalities for each position (1 through 6). Let's go through the clues step by step:

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the Mexican.
2. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person eating onion.
3. The Malaysian is the person whose hobby is skydiving.
4. The Mexican is on the right of the person eating asparagus.
5. The Mexican is the person eating tomato.
6. The person whose hobby is skydiving is the person eating cabbage.
7. The person eating kale is on the right of the person whose hobby is camping.

11. The person eating kale is on the left of the Thai.
12. The person whose hobby is singing is on the far right.
13. The person eating strawberry is between the person eating cabbage and the person whose hobby is cooking.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Position 1:
- From clue 9, the person with the hobby of skydiving is at position 1.
- From clue 6, the person at position 1 is eating cabbage.
- From clue 3, the Malaysian is at position 1 (since they have the hobby of skydiving).

So, Position 1:
- Food: Cabbage
- Hobby: Skydiving
- Nationality: Malaysian

#### Position 6:
- From clue 12, the person whose hobby is singing is at position 6.

So, Position 6:
- Food: (To be determined)
- Hobby: Singing
- Nationality: (To be determined)

#### Positions 2-5:
- From clue 1, the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the Mexican.
- From clue 2, the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person eating onion.
- This implies that the person eating onion cannot be in positions 1 or 6. Since the Malaysian (skydiving) is in position 1, the person eating onion must be in position 2 or 3.

Let's consider the possibilities:
- If the person eating onion is in position 2, then the person with the hobby of rock-climbing must be in position 3.
- The Mexican must be in position 4 or 5.

Since the Mexican is the person eating tomato (clue 5), and they must be on the right of the person eating asparagus (clue 4), the person eating asparagus must be in position 3 or 4. But since the person with the hobby of rock-climbing is in position 3, the person eating asparagus must be in position 4.

So, we have:
- Position 2: Eating onion
- Position 3: Rock-climbing
- Position 4: Asparagus
- Position 5: Mexican (eating tomato)

Now, we know:
- Position 2: Eating onion
- Position 3: Rock-climbing
- Position 4: Asparagus
- Position 5: Mexican (eating tomato)
- Position 1: Cabbage, Skydiving, Malaysian
- Position 6: Singing

#### Determining the remaining details:
- From clue 8, the person eating asparagus is the Colombian.
- So, Position 4: Asparagus, Colombian

- From clue 7, the person eating kale is on the right of the person whose hobby is camping.
- The person whose hobby is camping must be in position 3 (rock-climbing), so the person eating kale must be in position 5 (Mexican).

So, Position 5: Tomato, Mexican

- From clue 10, the Brazilian is on the left of the Dutch.
- The Brazilian must be in position 2 (onion) and the Dutch must be in position 3 (rock-climbing).

So, Position 2: Onion, Brazilian
Position 3: Rock-climbing, Dutch

- From clue 11, the person eating kale is on the left of the Thai.
- The Thai must be in position 6 (singing).

So, Position 6: Strawberry, Singing, Thai

- From clue 13, the person eating strawberry is between the person eating cabbage and the person whose hobby is cooking.
- The person whose hobby is cooking must be in position 5 (Mexican).

So, Position 3: Cooking, Dutch

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of Motorbike Driver
From clue 12, the person driving the motorbike is on the far left (position 1).

#### Step 2: Position of Turtle Owner
From clue 5, the owner of the turtle is on the far right (position 6).

#### Step 3: Position of Roller Driver
From clue 3, the person driving the roller is the person eating tomato. This person must be in position 2 or 3 (since the roller driver is on the left of the person eating apple, and we need to fit all conditions).

#### Step 4: Position of Van Driver
From clue 2, the person driving the van is on the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the owner of the turtle is in position 6, the van driver must be in position 4 or 5.

#### Step 5: Position of Jet-ski Driver
From clue 6, the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the van. So if the van driver is in position 4, the jet-ski driver is in position 5; if the van driver is in position 5, the jet-ski driver is in position 6, which is not possible because the turtle owner is in position 6.

Thus, the van driver is in position 4, and the jet-ski driver is in position 5.

#### Step 6: Position of Bus Driver
From clue 1, the person driving the bus is on the left of the person eating tomato. Since the person eating tomato is in position 2, the bus driver must be in position 1.

So far, we have:

- Position 2: Tomato Eater (Roller Driver)
- Position 3: Apple Eater
- Position 4: Van Driver
- Position 5: Jet-ski Driver
- Position 6: Turtle Owner

#### Step 8: Position of Goat Owner
From clue 11, the person driving the van is on the right of the owner of the goat. Since the van driver is in position 4, the goat owner must be in position 1.

So now we have:
- Position 1: Goat Owner (Motorbike Driver)
- Position 2: Tomato Eater (Roller Driver)
- Position 3: Apple Eater
- Position 4: Van Driver
- Position 5: Jet-ski Driver
- Position 6: Turtle Owner

#### Step 9: Position of Peach Eater
From clue 13, the person eating peach is on the right of the owner of the goat. Since the goat owner is in position 1, the peach eater must be in position 3. But position 3 is already taken by the apple eater. Thus, the peach eater must be in position 5.

So now we have:
- Position 1: Goat Owner (Motorbike Driver)
- Position 2: Tomato Eater (Roller Driver)
- Position 3: Apple Eater
- Position 4: Van Driver
- Position 5: Peach Eater
- Position 6: Turtle Owner

#### Step 10: Position of Blueberry Eater and Rabbit Owner
From clue 9, the owner of the pony is between the person eating blueberry and the owner of the rabbit. From clue 4, the owner of the pony is also between the owner of the horse and the person driving the roller. From clue 8, the owner of the pony is between the owner of the horse and the person driving the roller. Since the roller driver is in position 2, the owner of the pony must be in position 3 (Apple Eater), which is not possible. Therefore, the owner of the pony must be in position 4 (Van Driver), and the person eating blueberry must be in position 2 (Tomato Eater) and the owner of the rabbit must be in position 5 (Peach Eater).

So now we have:
- Position 1: Goat Owner (Motorbike Driver)
- Position 2: Blueberry Eater (Tomato Eater)
- Position 3: Rabbit Owner
- Position 4: Van Driver
- Position 5: Peach Eater
- Position 6: Turtle Owner

#### Step 11: Final Verification
- The person driving the bus (not yet assigned) must be in position 2 (Blueberry Eater).
- The person eating plum must be in position 4 (Van Driver) since the person eating blueberry is in position 2 and the person eating plum is on the right of the person eating blueberry (clue 10).

So the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Goat Owner (Motorbike Driver)
- Position 2: Blueberry Eater (Tomato Eater)
- Position 3: Rabbit Owner
- Position 4: Plum Eater (Van Driver)
- Position 5: Peach Eater
- Position 6: Turtle Owner
