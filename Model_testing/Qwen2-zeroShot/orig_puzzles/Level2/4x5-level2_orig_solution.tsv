This table satisfies all the given clues."
Lv2-4x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to fill in the table step-by-step.

Let's start with the clues:

2. The person eating orange is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.
3. The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
4. The person drinking lemonade is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person eating apricot.
5. The person eating watermelon is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
6. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person eating orange.
7. The person drinking milk is on the left of the lawyer.
8. The writer is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
9. The person drinking juice is on the far right.
10. The person drinking juice is on the right of the dancer.
11. The person eating apricot is on the left of the person eating lettuce.
12. The social-worker is on the left of the dancer.
13. The person eating lettuce is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

Now, let's place the items step-by-step:

### Step 1: Positioning the Sport and Beverage Clues

From Clue 1:
- Parkour is to the right of Dancer.
- Possible positions for Dancer and Parkour: (Dancer, Parkour) -> (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5).

From Clue 9:
- Juice is on the far right (position 5).
- Juice is also on the right of the Dancer.
- Possible positions for Dancer: 1, 2, 3, 4.

From Clue 10:
- Dancer is to the left of Juice.
- Possible positions for Dancer: 1, 2, 3.

From Clue 1:
- If Dancer is at position 1, Parkour must be at position 2.
- If Dancer is at position 2, Parkour must be at position 3.
- If Dancer is at position 3, Parkour must be at position 4.
- If Dancer is at position 4, Parkour must be at position 5.

Given that Juice is at position 5, Dancer cannot be at position 4 or 5. Therefore:
- Dancer must be at position 1, and Parkour must be at position 2.

### Step 2: Filling in the Sport and Beverage for Dancer and Parkour

- Dancer: Sport = Parkour
- Parkour: Sport = Climbing

### Step 3: Using Clue 4

From Clue 4:
- Lemonade is between Parkour and Apricot.
- Since Parkour is at position 2, Lemonade must be at position 3, and Apricot must be at position 4.

### Step 4: Using Clue 3 and Clue 5

From Clue 3:
- Mirinda is to the right of Volleyball.
- Since Volleyball is not yet determined, let's consider possible positions for Volleyball and Mirinda.

From Clue 5:
- Watermelon is to the left of Skateboarding.
- Since Skateboarding is not yet determined, let's consider possible positions for Watermelon and Skateboarding.

### Step 5: Using Clue 6 and Clue 7

From Clue 6:
- Milk is to the left of Orange.
- From Clue 7:
- Milk is to the left of Lawyer.

Since Milk is to the left of Orange and Lawyer, and considering the positions already taken, Milk can only be at position 1, Orange at position 3, and Lawyer at position 5.

### Step 6: Using Clue 2 and Clue 11

From Clue 2:
- Orange is to the left of Climbing.
- Since Orange is at position 3 and Climbing is at position 2, this is consistent.

From Clue 11:
- Apricot is to the left of Lettuce.
- Since Apricot is at position 4 and Lettuce is at position 5, this is consistent.

### Step 8: Using Clue 8

From Clue 8:
- Writer is to the left of Skateboarding.
- Since Writer cannot be at position 5 (Lettuce is there), Writer must be at position 4, and Skateboarding must be at position 5.

### Step 9: Filling in the Remaining Positions

From Clue 13:
- Almond-milk is to the left of Lettuce.
- Since Lettuce is at position 5, Almond-milk must be at position 4.

Lv2-4x5-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
2. The person driving the ship is on the far left.
3. The owner of the rat is the person driving the roller.
4. The owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the egyptian.
5. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the roller.
6. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in the middle.
7. The turkish is on the right of the colombian.
8. The mexican is on the far right.
9. The owner of the pony is the turkish.
10. The owner of the dog is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
11. The owner of the pony is on the right of the colombian.
12. The owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is fishing.
13. The owner of the horse is on the left of the mexican.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of Ship and Photography
From Clue 2, the person driving the ship is on the far left.
From Clue 1, this person is also to the left of the person with the hobby of photography. Therefore, the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 3 or 4.

#### Step 2: Position of Roller and Rat
From Clue 3, the owner of the rat is the person driving the roller.
From Clue 5, the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the roller. This means the person driving the roller cannot be in position 1 (since there is no position to the left).

#### Step 3: Position of Horse, Magic-Tricks, and Egyptian
From Clue 4, the owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the egyptian.
From Clue 13, the owner of the horse is on the left of the mexican. This implies the mexican cannot be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Position of Skydiving
From Clue 6, the person who's hobby is skydiving is in the middle, which is position 3.

#### Step 5: Position of Turkish and Colombian
From Clue 7, the turkish is on the right of the colombian.
From Clue 8, the mexican is on the far right (position 5).
From Clue 9, the owner of the pony is the turkish, so the turkish must be in position 4 and the colombian in position 3.

#### Step 6: Position of Dog, Fishing, and Taxi
From Clue 12, the owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is fishing.
From Clue 10, the owner of the dog is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
From Clue 11, the owner of the pony is on the right of the colombian, which we already know is position 3, so the pony owner (turkish) is in position 4.

#### Step 7: Position of Remaining People
From Clue 1, the person driving the ship (position 1) is to the left of the person with the hobby of photography (position 3). Since the skydiver is in position 3, the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 4.

From Clue 5, the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the roller. The roller is driven by the owner of the rat (position 4), so the skateboard driver must be in position 2.

From Clue 4, the owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the egyptian. Since the mexican is in position 5, the egyptian must be in position 2 (skateboard) or 3 (skydiving). But the owner of the horse must be in position 2 (skateboard) since the egyptian cannot be in position 3 (skydiving).

From Clue 4, the owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the egyptian. Since the egyptian is in position 2, the magic-tricks owner must be in position 1 (ship) and the person with the hobby of skydiving must be in position 3.

Lv2-4x5-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The accountant is on the left of the person drinking tea.**
2. **The person driving the bus is on the far left.**
3. **The person driving the roller is on the far right.**
4. **The person drinking sprite is the accountant.**
5. **The journalist is in the middle (position 3).**
6. **The person drinking water is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski.**
7. **The videographer is the owner of the turtle.**
8. **The person drinking tea is between the owner of the goldfish and the person driving the car.**
9. **The owner of the frog is on the left of the owner of the bird.**
10. **The person driving the car is the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
11. **The owner of the frog is the doctor.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1 (Bus Driver):** The bus driver is on the far left.
2. **Position 5 (Roller Driver):** The roller driver is on the far right.

So, we can set up the initial positions as:
```
|             |      1       |     2      |     3      |       4       |     5     |
| Beverage    |              |            |            |               |           |
| Job         | Bus Driver   |            |            |               | Roller Driver |
| Pet         |              |            |            |               |           |
| Transport   | Bus          |            |            |               | Jet-Ski    |
```

3. **Sprite Accountant:** The accountant drinks sprite.
4. **Journalist in Position 3:** The journalist is in position 3.
5. **Hot-Chocolate Car Driver:** The car driver drinks hot-chocolate.

Now, let's place these:
```
|             |      1       |     2      |     3      |       4       |     5     |
| Beverage    |              |            | Sprite     |               |           |
| Job         | Bus Driver   |            | Journalist |               | Roller Driver |
| Pet         |              |            |            |               |           |
| Transport   | Bus          |            | Hot-Chocolate |               | Jet-Ski    |
```

6. **Accountant is Left of Tea Drinker:** The accountant is on the left of the person drinking tea.
7. **Tea Drinker is Between Goldfish Owner and Car Driver:** The tea drinker is between the goldfish owner and the car driver (hot-chocolate drinker).

Since the car driver is in position 4, the tea drinker must be in position 3 (journalist) or position 2. But since the journalist is already in position 3, the tea drinker must be in position 2.

So, the tea drinker is in position 2, and the goldfish owner must be in position 1 or 4. Since the bus driver is in position 1, the goldfish owner must be in position 4.

```
|             |      1       |     2      |     3      |       4       |     5     |
| Beverage    |              | Tea        | Sprite     |               |           |
| Job         | Bus Driver   | Tea        | Journalist |               | Roller Driver |
| Pet         |              |            |            | Goldfish     |           |
| Transport   | Bus          | Hot-Chocolate | Hot-Chocolate | Jet-Ski    | Jet-Ski    |
```

8. **Water is Left of Jet-Ski Driver:** The person drinking water is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. This means the water drinker is in position 2, which conflicts with the tea drinker. Therefore, the water drinker must be in position 1.

So, the water drinker is in position 1, and the tea drinker is in position 3.

```
|             |      1       |     2      |     3      |       4       |     5     |
| Beverage    | Water        | Tea        | Sprite     |               |           |
| Job         | Bus Driver   | Tea        | Journalist |               | Roller Driver |
| Pet         |              |            |            | Goldfish     |           |
| Transport   | Bus          | Hot-Chocolate | Hot-Chocolate | Jet-Ski    | Jet-Ski    |
```

9. **Videographer Owns Turtle:** The videographer owns the turtle. Since the videographer is not yet assigned, and the owner of the bird must be to the right of the owner of the frog, the only logical positions for the owner of the bird and the owner of the frog are positions 2 and 3 respectively.

Since the owner of the frog is the doctor and the owner of the bird is the librarian, we assign these:

```
|             |      1       |     2      |     3      |       4       |     5     |
| Beverage    | Water        | Tea        | Sprite     |               |           |
| Job         | Bus Driver   | Tea        | Journalist | Librarian    | Roller Driver |
| Pet         |              |            |            | Goldfish     | Bird      |
| Transport   | Bus          | Hot-Chocolate | Hot-Chocolate | Jet-Ski    | Jet-Ski    |
```

10. **Owner of Frog is Doctor:** The owner of the frog is the doctor, and the owner of the bird is the librarian.

Finally, we need to assign the remaining beverages and pets:

- **Beverage Assignment:**
  - Position 1: Water
  - Position 2: Tea
  - Position 3: Sprite
  - Position 4: Juice
  - Position 5: Hot-Chocolate

- **Pet Assignment:**
  - Position 1: Water
  - Position 2: Tea
  - Position 3: Sprite
  - Position 4: Goldfish
  - Position 5: Bird

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|             |      1       |     2      |     3      |       4       |     5     |
| Beverage    | Water        | Tea        | Sprite     | Juice        | Hot-Chocolate |
| Job         | Bus Driver   | Tea        | Journalist | Librarian    | Roller Driver |
| Pet         |              |            |            | Goldfish     | Bird      |
| Transport   | Bus          | Hot-Chocolate | Hot-Chocolate | Jet-Ski    | Jet-Ski    |
```"
Lv2-4x5-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step-by-step. Let's go through the clues one by one.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The bartender is between the owner of the lizard and the chef.**
   - This means the bartender cannot be in position 1 or 5. The bartender must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the van.**
   - This means the person driving the trike cannot be in position 1, and the person driving the van cannot be in position 5.

3. **The Turkish is on the right of the person driving the van.**
   - This means the Turkish person cannot be in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the van cannot be in position 5.

4. **The person driving the airplane is in the middle (position 3).**
   - This fixes the person driving the airplane in position 3.

5. **The dancer is the Dutch.**
   - This fixes the nationality of the dancer as Dutch.

6. **The Argentine is between the owner of the hedgehog and the manager.**
   - This means the Argentine cannot be in position 1 or 5, and the owner of the hedgehog and the manager must be on either side of the Argentine.

7. **The Australian is on the right of the Dutch.**
   - Since the Dutch is the dancer, the Australian must be in position 4 or 5.

8. **The Dutch is the person driving the snowmobile.**
   - This fixes the nationality of the person driving the snowmobile as Dutch.

9. **The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the bartender.**
   - This means the owner of the hedgehog cannot be in position 1 or 2, and the bartender must be to the left of the owner of the hedgehog.

10. **The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person driving the airplane.**
    - Since the person driving the airplane is in position 3, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 4 or 5.

11. **The dancer is on the left of the bartender.**
    - Since the dancer is the Dutch and is in position 3, the bartender must be in position 4 or 5.

12. **The owner of the cat is on the far right.**
    - This fixes the owner of the cat in position 5.

### Placing the Information:

- **Position 3**: Person driving the airplane (clue 4)
- **Position 5**: Owner of the cat (clue 12)

Let's start placing the other pieces:

- **Dancer (Dutch)**: Position 3 (clue 5 and 8)
- **Owner of the cat**: Position 5 (clue 12)
- **Person driving the snowmobile**: Position 3 (clue 8)

Since the person driving the airplane is in position 3, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 4 (clue 10).

Now, let's place the Argentine:

- **Argentine**: Between the owner of the hedgehog and the manager (clue 6)
- Since the Argentine cannot be in position 1 or 5, and the owner of the rabbit is in position 4, the Argentine must be in position 2.

This leaves the bartender and the owner of the hedgehog to be placed in positions 1 and 4. Since the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the bartender (clue 9), the bartender must be in position 1 and the owner of the hedgehog in position 4.

Finally, the Turkish must be in position 2 because it is on the right of the person driving the van (clue 3) and the Argentine is in position 2.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |    5    |
| Job           | Bartender  | Argentine  | Airplane | Owner of Hedgehog | Owner of Cat |
| Nationality   | Turkish    | Dutch      | Dutch    | Argentine   | Australian |
| Pet           | Rabbit     | Dog        | Snowmobile | Lizard | Cat      |
| Transport     | Airplane  | Scooter   | Airplane | Trike  | Van      |
```

This is the final solution based on the given clues."
