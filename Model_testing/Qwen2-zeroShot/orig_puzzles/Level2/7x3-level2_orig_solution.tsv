10. The Malaysian is on the left of the Egyptian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2 & 7:
- The person drinking almond-milk is the Malaysian.
- The fan of country is the person whose hobby is sudoku.

Since the Malaysian drinks almond-milk, the Malaysian's row will be filled with ""almond-milk"" under Beverage.

#### Clue 7 & 10:
- The Malaysian (row 2) is on the left of the Egyptian (row 3).

So, we can place the Malaysian and the Egyptian in rows 2 and 3 respectively.

#### Clue 8:
- The musician is the owner of the mouse.

Since the musician owns the mouse, the musician's row will have ""mouse"" under Pet.

#### Clue 9:
- The person drinking milk is between the musician and the social worker.

Given that the musician owns the mouse and is on one side, and the social worker is on the other side, the person drinking milk must be in the middle.

#### Clue 6:
- The person drinking milk is on the right of the person whose hobby is chess.

This means the person whose hobby is chess must be to the left of the person drinking milk.

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person watching sports movies.

Since the musician owns the mouse, the person watching sports movies must be on the right of the musician.

- The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person drinking milk.

Since the person drinking milk is on the right of the person whose hobby is chess, and the person drinking milk is on the right of the person owning the lizard, the lizard owner must be in the middle.

#### Clue 4:
- The fan of jazz is on the right of the fan of country.

Since the fan of country is between the person watching disaster movies and the person drinking almond-milk, and the fan of jazz is on the right of the fan of country, we can determine their positions.

#### Clue 5:
- The fan of country is between the person watching disaster movies and the person drinking almond-milk.

Since the Malaysian drinks almond-milk, the person watching disaster movies must be on the left of the Malaysian.

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating onion is on the far left.
   - This means:
     - Position 1: Onion

2. **Clue 6**: The software-developer is the person eating pepper.
   - This means:
     - Position 3: Pepper (Software-developer)

3. **Clue 7**: The person eating onion is on the left of the fan of rock.
   - Since Position 1 is onion, the fan of rock must be in position 3 or 2.
   - But we already know position 3 is pepper, so the fan of rock must be in position 2.
   - Therefore:
     - Position 2: Rock (Fan of rock)
     - Position 3: Pepper (Software-developer)

4. **Clue 1 & 7**: Confirm that the person eating onion is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Onion

5. **Clue 2**: The analyst is on the left of the fan of indie.
   - Since position 2 is rock, the analyst must be in position 1.
   - Therefore:
     - Position 1: Onion (Analyst)

6. **Clue 3**: The Thai is between the person whose hobby is woodworking and the fan of pop.
   - Since position 1 is onion and position 2 is rock, the Thai cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - Therefore, the Thai must be in position 3.
   - Position 3: Pepper (Thai)
   - So, the Thai is in position 3.

7. **Clue 4**: The owner of the goat is the person whose hobby is skydiving.
   - Since the Thai is in position 3, the owner of the goat and the person whose hobby is skydiving must be in positions 1 or 2.

   - Therefore:
     - Position 2: Rock (Skydiving)
     - The owner of the goat is in position 1.

8. **Clue 5**: The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the owner of the dog.
   - Since the analyst is in position 1 and the Thai is in position 3, the person watching fantasy movies and the owner of the dog must be in positions 2 or 3.
   - The only remaining position for fantasy movies is position 1.
   - Therefore:
     - Position 1: Onion (Analyst, watching fantasy movies)
     - The owner of the dog is in position 3.

9. **Clue 8**: The Italian is on the left of the person watching sports movies.
   - Since the Thai is in position 3 and the Italian is not in position 3, the Italian must be in position 1 or 2.
   - The only remaining position for the Italian is position 2.
   - Therefore:
     - Position 2: Rock (Italian, watching sports movies)
     - The owner of the dog is in position 3.

10. **Clue 3**: The Thai is between the person whose hobby is woodworking and the fan of pop.
    - Since the Thai is in position 3, the person whose hobby is woodworking must be in position 1 or 2.
    - The only remaining position for woodworking is position 1.
    - Therefore:
      - Position 1: Onion (Woodworking)
      - The person watching fantasy movies is in position 1 (Analyst).
      - The Thai is in position 3 (Pop fan).

- The person watching **satire** movies is on the left of the person whose sport is **climbing**.
- Since the person whose sport is tennis is in position 1, the person watching satire movies must be in position 2 and the person whose sport is climbing must be in position 3.

So, we can fill in:

```

#### Clue 4:
- The Paramedic is on the right of the person drinking **soy milk**.
- The person drinking juice (in position 3) cannot be the Paramedic, so the Paramedic must be in position 2 or 3. But since the person in position 3 is already determined to drink juice, the Paramedic must be in position 2.

So, we can fill in:

- The person drinking **coffee** is between the owner of the **ferret** and the person watching **drama** movies.
- The person drinking juice is Argentine, so the person drinking coffee cannot be Argentine. The person drinking juice (Malaysian) drinks juice, so the person drinking coffee cannot be Malaysian. The person drinking soy milk (Paramedic) is not drinking juice, so the person drinking coffee cannot be Paramedic. Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1 or 2, but since position 1 is tennis, it must be in position 2.

So, we can fill in:

10. **Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is gardening is on the far left.
11. **Clue 11:** The Egyptian is between the person driving the bus and the Italian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions based on Clue 10 and Clue 5:
- The person with the hobby of gardening is on the far left (position 1).
- The Italian is on the far right (position 3) because the person driving the bike (Italian) is also on the far right.

#### Step 2: Use Clue 1 to place the scientist and the person driving the bike:
- The scientist is on the left of the person driving the bike.
- Since the Italian is on position 3, the scientist must be on position 1 (garden hobby) or 2. But since the garden hobbyist is on position 1, the scientist must be on position 2.
- Therefore, the person driving the bike is the Italian, which is confirmed by Clue 5.

#### Step 3: Use Clue 3 to place the photographer:
- The Italian is the photographer, so position 3 is the photographer.

#### Step 4: Use Clue 4 to place the fan of rock:
- The person driving the bike is the fan of rock, so position 3 (Italian) is the fan of rock.

#### Step 5: Use Clue 2 to place the fan of classical and the ferret owner:
- The fan of classical is the owner of the ferret.
- The fan of rock (Italian) cannot be the fan of classical, so the fan of classical must be in position 1 (gardening hobby).

#### Step 6: Use Clue 6 to place the board-game hobbyist and the romance movie watcher:
- The person whose hobby is board-games is the person watching romance movies.
- The person watching romance movies is on the right of the owner of the pony.
- Therefore, the board-game hobbyist (position 1) watches romance movies, and the owner of the pony (position 2) is on the right of the board-game hobbyist.

#### Step 7: Use Clue 7 to place the blues and classical fans:
- The fan of blues is on the right of the fan of classical.
- Since the fan of classical is in position 1, the fan of blues must be in position 2.

#### Step 8: Use Clue 8 to place the rock and satire fans:
- The fan of rock is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
- Since the person watching satire movies must be in position 2 (board-games hobbyist), the person in position 3 (Italian) is the fan of rock, which is consistent with Clue 4.

#### Step 9: Use Clue 9 to confirm the satire movie watcher:
- The fan of rock is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
- Since the Italian (position 3) is the fan of rock, the person in position 2 (board-games hobbyist) is the person watching satire movies.

#### Step 10: Use Clue 11 to place the Egyptian:
- The Egyptian is between the person driving the bus and the Italian.
- Since the Italian is in position 3, the person driving the bus must be in position 1 (gardening hobbyist), making the Egyptian in position 2.
