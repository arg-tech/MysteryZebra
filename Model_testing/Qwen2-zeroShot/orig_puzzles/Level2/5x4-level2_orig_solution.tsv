3. **From Clue 9:** The person watching drama movies is on the left of the person driving the tram (position 4). Since the Tram Driver is in position 4, the person watching drama movies must be in position 3.

   | Transport     | freelancer |          |                    | tram     |

4. **From Clue 1:** The person driving the car is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the Tram Driver (Freelancer) is in position 4, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 3 (but we already know that position 3 is for drama), so the person watching disaster movies must be in position 2.

5. **From Clue 5:** The person driving the car is between the dancer and the fan of reggae. Since the Tram Driver (Freelancer) is in position 4, the person driving the car must be in position 2 or 3. But since position 3 is already taken by the person watching drama, the person driving the car must be in position 2.

6. **From Clue 2:** The fan of rock is between the dancer and the person driving the tram. Since the Tram Driver (Freelancer) is in position 4, the fan of rock must be in position 3, which is already taken by the person watching drama. Therefore, the fan of rock must be in position 1, and the dancer must be in position 3.

7. **From Clue 8:** The software-developer is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since the person watching superhero movies is in position 3, the software-developer must be in position 1.

Lv2-5x4-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Identify Direct Clues
1. **Clue 1**: The police-officer is on the right of the person eating lemon.
2. **Clue 2**: The fan of gospel is on the right of the person eating blueberry.
3. **Clue 3**: The freelancer is between the person eating pineapple and the owner of the goat.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan of techno is the person who's sport is handball.
5. **Clue 5**: The owner of the hamster is the freelancer.
6. **Clue 6**: The police-officer is on the left of the electrician.

10. **Clue 10**: The police-officer is on the left of the owner of the snake.
11. **Clue 12**: The person eating blueberry is the police-officer.

### Step 2: Determine Positions Based on Clues
From **Clue 12**, we know:
- The police-officer eats blueberry.

From **Clue 1**, since the police-officer (blueberry) is on the right of the person eating lemon, the person eating lemon must be in position 1 or 2. Let's denote this as:
- Position 1: Lemon
- Position 2: Blueberry (police-officer)

From **Clue 6**, since the police-officer is on the left of the electrician, the electrician must be in position 3 or 4:
- Position 3: Electrician
- Position 4: Unknown

From **Clue 8**, the person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the police-officer. Since the police-officer is in position 2, the person with sailing must be in position 1:
- Position 1: Sailing

From **Clue 9**, the person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the electrician. Since the electrician is in position 3, the person with tennis must be in position 2:
- Position 2: Tennis (police-officer)

From **Clue 4**, the fan of techno is the person who's sport is handball. Therefore, the person with handball must be in position 4:
- Position 4: Handball

From **Clue 10**, the police-officer is on the left of the owner of the snake. Since the police-officer is in position 2, the owner of the snake must be in position 3:
- Position 3: Snake

From **Clue 7**, the project-manager is on the left of the fan of punk. Since the fan of punk cannot be in position 1 (sailing), 2 (police-officer), or 3 (snake), the project-manager must be in position 1:
- Position 1: Project-manager (sailing)

From **Clue 5**, the owner of the hamster is the freelancer. The freelancer must be in position 2, but we already have the police-officer there, so the freelancer must be in position 3:
- Position 3: Freelancer (snake)

From **Clue 3**, the freelancer is between the person eating pineapple and the owner of the goat. Since the freelancer is in position 3, the person eating pineapple must be in position 1 or 2, and the owner of the goat must be in position 4:
- Position 1: Pineapple
- Position 2: Lemon
- Position 4: Goat

From **Clue 2**, the fan of gospel is on the right of the person eating blueberry. Since the person eating blueberry is the police-officer in position 2, the fan of gospel must be in position 3:
- Position 3: Gospel (freelancer, snake)

Lv2-5x4-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the appropriate categories. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The fan of indie is the person who's hobby is writing.
2. The person driving the ship is on the far right (position 4).
3. The person drinking water is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
4. The person watching thriller movies is the person drinking soy-milk.
5. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
6. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.
7. The person who's hobby is writing is between the person watching sports movies and the person drinking water.
8. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the fan of indie.
9. The person driving the motorbike is the fan of country.
10. The person driving the motorbike is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the ship.
11. The person who's hobby is photography is on the far right (position 4).
12. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person watching drama movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11**: The person with the hobby of photography is on the far right (position 4). This means:
   - Photography → 4
   - Hiking → 1 (since hiking is on the left of the person watching drama movies, and photography is on the far right)

2. **Clue 8**: The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the fan of indie. Since the fan of indie is the person who's hobby is writing, and the person with the hobby of photography is on position 4, the person with the hobby of writing must be in position 3. Therefore:
   - Writing → 3
   - Indie → 3 (fan of indie)
   - Photography → 4

3. **Clue 6**: The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person with the hobby of writing is in position 3, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2. Therefore:
   - Hip-hop → 2
   - Writing → 3

4. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is writing is between the person watching sports movies and the person drinking water. Since the person with the hobby of writing is in position 3, the person watching sports movies must be in position 2 or 4, but since position 2 is already occupied by hip-hop, it must be in position 4, and the person drinking water must be in position 2. Therefore:
   - Sports → 4
   - Water → 2
   - Thriller → 3 (since the person drinking water is on the left of the person watching thriller movies, and the person watching thriller movies is drinking soy-milk)

5. **Clue 4**: The person watching thriller movies is the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person watching thriller movies is in position 3, the person drinking soy-milk is also in position 3. Therefore:
   - Soy-milk → 3

6. **Clue 3**: The person drinking water is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. We already know that the person drinking water is in position 2 and the person watching thriller movies is in position 3. Therefore, this is consistent.

7. **Clue 5**: The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking water is in position 2, the person drinking 7up must be in position 1 and the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3. However, we already have someone in position 3, so the person drinking 7up must be in position 1 and the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 4. Therefore:
   - 7up → 1
   - Almond-milk → 4

8. **Clue 2**: The person driving the ship is on the far right. Since the person with the hobby of photography is in position 4, the person driving the ship must be in position 4. Therefore:

- The owner of the frog is in position 3.
- The owner of the horse is in position 2.
- The person watching superhero movies is in position 4.
