Lv2-1x3-1	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

We have three nationalities: Indian (I), Japanese (J), and Thai (T).

The clues given are:
1. The Thai is on the left of the Japanese.
2. The Thai is between the Indian and the Japanese.

Let's analyze these clues:

1. ""The Thai is on the left of the Japanese"" means T must be to the left of J.
2. ""The Thai is between the Indian and the Japanese"" means I, T, J or J, T, I.

Given these two pieces of information, the only possible arrangement that satisfies both conditions is:
- Indian (I) is on the right.
- Thai (T) is in the middle.
- Japanese (J) is on the left.

So, the correct order from left to right is: **Japanese, Thai, Indian**.

Now, let's put this into the table format you provided:

```
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |
| Nationality   |   J    |   T  |    I     |
```

This satisfies both given conditions:
- The Thai is on the left of the Japanese.
- The Thai is between the Indian and the Japanese.

Here is the final solution table:

```
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |
| Nationality   |   J    |   T  |    I     |

Lv2-1x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step:

1. The person watching disaster movies is between the person watching horror movies and the person watching sports movies.
2. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:
- The person watching horror movies cannot be the first one because they must be to the right of the person watching disaster movies.
- The person watching disaster movies cannot be the last one because they must be between the person watching horror movies and the person watching sports movies.

Given these constraints, the only possible order is:
- Horror movies (2)
- Disaster movies (1)
- Sports movies (3)

So, the final arrangement would look like this:

```
|               |   1    |    2     |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Horror   | Disaster|

Lv2-1x3-3	"Sure, let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. The fan of folk is between the fan of ambient and the fan of metal.
2. The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of ambient.

From these clues, we can deduce the following order:
- The fan of folk must be in position 1 because it is on the left of the fan of ambient.
- Since the fan of folk is between the fan of ambient and the fan of metal, the fan of ambient must be in position 2 and the fan of metal must be in position 3.

So, the order from left to right is:
1. Folk
2. Ambient
3. Metal

Now, let's place this information into the table:

```
|               |   1   |  2   |    3    |
| Music-Genre   |  Folk | Ambient | Metal  |

Lv2-1x3-4	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

Given:
- Three pets: ferret, guinea-pig, snake.
- The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
- The owner of the snake is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the ferret.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
2. The owner of the snake is also between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the ferret.

This means the order must be:
- Snake (owner 1)
- Guinea-pig (owner 2)
- Ferret (owner 3)

So, the final arrangement is:
- Owner 1 has the snake.
- Owner 2 has the guinea-pig.
- Owner 3 has the ferret.

Now, let's fill in the table with this information:

```
|       |   1    |   2   |     3      |
| Pet   | Snake  | Guinea-pig | Ferret    |
```

Here is the final solution table:

Lv2-1x3-5	"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Given:
1. The person drinking cola is between the person drinking milk and the person drinking juice.
2. The person drinking milk is on the far right.

We need to place the beverages in the given positions (1, 2, 3).

Let's denote:
- Cola as C
- Juice as J
- Milk as M

From the second clue, we know:
- M is in position 3.

So, the table looks like this so far:

```
|            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Beverage   |       |      | M    |
```

From the first clue, we know that the person drinking cola (C) is between the person drinking milk (M) and the person drinking juice (J). Since M is in position 3, C must be in position 1 and J must be in position 2.

So, the final arrangement is:

```
|            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Beverage   | C     | J    | M    |
```

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Beverage   | C     | J    | M    |

Lv2-1x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the given clues step by step:

1. The person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking almond-milk.
2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.

From clue 1, we can deduce that the order must be either:
- Juice, Mirinda, Almond-Milk
- Almond-Milk, Mirinda, Juice

However, clue 2 states that the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. This eliminates the possibility of ""Almond-Milk, Mirinda, Juice"" because almond-milk would not be to the right of mirinda in this order.

Therefore, the only possible order is:
- Juice, Mirinda, Almond-Milk

Now, let's place these beverages into the table:

```
|            |   1   |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage   | Juice | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |
```

So, the final solution table is:

```
|            |   1   |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage   | Juice | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |

Lv2-1x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the positions of the pet owners.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The owner of the cat is between the owner of the hedgehog and the owner of the frog.**
   - This means if we have the order as Hedgehog, Cat, Frog or Frog, Cat, Hedgehog, the cat owner must be in the middle.
   
2. **The owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.**
   - This means the order cannot be Hedgehog, Cat, Frog because the cat owner would not be to the right of the hedgehog owner. Therefore, the only possible order is Frog, Cat, Hedgehog.

### Deduction:
- Given the second clue, the only valid order for the pets is Frog, Cat, Hedgehog.
- This places the owner of the cat in the middle position (position 2).

### Final Solution Table:
```
|       |    1     |  2  |  3   |
| Pet   |  Frog    | Cat | Hedgehog |

### Conditions:
1. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
2. The person who's hobby is gardening is between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is drawing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

From condition 1, we know:
- Drawing (D) is to the left of Gardening (G).

From condition 2, we know:
- Gardening (G) is between Reading (R) and Drawing (D).
- This implies that the order must be Reading (R), Gardening (G), Drawing (D).

Given the above conditions, the only possible order for the hobbies is:
- **Reading (R)**
- **Gardening (G)**
- **Drawing (D)**
