### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The person driving the van is on the far left.**
   - This means the van is in position 1.
   
2. **The photographer is between the owner of the bird and the person driving the van.**
   - Since the person driving the van is in position 1, the photographer must be in position 2 (since there is no one in position 3 yet).
   
3. **The person eating pear is in the middle.**
   - This means the person eating pear is in position 2.
   
4. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the fan of salsa.**
   - Since the person eating peas is the fan of salsa (from clue 7), the person driving the trike must be in position 3.
   
5. **The videographer is on the right of the owner of the horse.**
   - The videographer must be in position 3, so the owner of the horse must be in position 2.
   
6. **The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of electronic.**
   - This means the fan of rock is in position 1 and the fan of electronic is in position 2 or 3.
   
7. **The fan of salsa is the person eating peas.**
   - From clue 7, we know the person eating peas is the fan of salsa.
   
8. **The fan of salsa is the person driving the van.**

Lv2-5x3-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking milk is the scientist.
2. The person whose sport is rugby is on the left of the firefighter.
3. The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person eating mango.
4. The person whose sport is surfing is on the left of the person eating mango.
5. The person drinking 7up is between the person whose hobby is magic-tricks and the person whose hobby is puzzles.
6. The person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating mango.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The person drinking milk is the scientist.
- Scientist drinks milk.
- So, row 5 (Sport) for column 3 must be ""milk"" and row 4 (Job) for column 3 must be ""scientist"".

```
|            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage   |              |              |     milk    |
| Food       |              |              |             |
| Hobby      |              |              |             |
| Job        |              |              |    scientist|
| Sport      |              |              |     rugby   |
```

#### Clue 2: The person whose sport is rugby is on the left of the firefighter.
- Rugby is in column 2, so firefighter must be in column 3.
- So, row 4 (Job) for column 2 must be ""firefighter"".

```
|            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage   |              |              |     milk    |
| Food       |              |              |             |
| Hobby      |              |              |             |
| Job        |              | firefighter  |    scientist|
| Sport      |              |     rugby    |     milk    |
```

#### Clue 3: The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person eating mango.
- Magic-tricks must be in column 1 or 2, and mango must be in column 2 or 3.
- Since rugby is in column 2, magic-tricks cannot be in column 2. Therefore, it must be in column 1.
- Mango must then be in column 2 or 3, but since firefighter is in column 3, mango must be in column 2.

```
|            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage   |              |              |     milk    |
| Food       |              |    mango     |             |
| Hobby      | magic-tricks |              |             |
| Job        |              | firefighter  |    scientist|
| Sport      |              |     rugby    |     milk    |
```

#### Clue 4: The person whose sport is surfing is on the left of the person eating mango.
- Surfing must be in column 1 or 2, and mango is in column 2.
- Since magic-tricks is in column 1, surfing must be in column 1.

```
|            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage   |              |              |     milk    |
| Food       |    surf      |    mango     |             |
| Hobby      | magic-tricks |              |             |
| Job        |              | firefighter  |    scientist|
| Sport      |     surfing  |     rugby    |     milk    |
```

#### Clue 5: The person drinking 7up is between the person whose hobby is magic-tricks and the person whose hobby is puzzles.
- Magic-tricks is in column 1, so puzzles must be in column 3.
- 7up must be in column 2.

```
|            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage   |     7up      |              |     milk    |
| Food       |    surf      |    mango     |             |
| Hobby      | magic-tricks | puzzles      |             |
| Job        |              | firefighter  |    scientist|
| Sport      |     surfing  |     rugby    |     milk    |
```

#### Clue 6: The person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating mango.
- Papaya must be in column 1, and mango is in column 2.

```
|            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage   |     7up      |              |     milk    |
| Food       |    papaya    |    mango     |             |
| Hobby      | magic-tricks | puzzles      |             |
| Job        |              | firefighter  |    scientist|
| Sport      |     surfing  |     rugby    |     milk    |
```

Now we need to assign the remaining items to the rows:

- The person drinking 7up is between the person whose hobby is magic-tricks and the person whose hobby is puzzles. This means the person drinking 7up must be the photographer.
- The person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating mango, which is already assigned. The only job left is the firefighter.

So, the final solution is:

```
|            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage   |     7up      |              |     milk    |
| Food       |    papaya    |    mango     |             |
| Hobby      | magic-tricks | puzzles      |             |
| Job        |    photographer | firefighter  |    scientist|
| Sport      |     surfing  |     rugby    |     milk    |

Lv2-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The owner of the cat is the person watching comedy movies.
2. **Clue 2**: The person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
3. **Clue 3**: The fan of d&b is on the left of the person watching comedy movies.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan of d&b is the owner of the turtle.
5. **Clue 5**: The German is between the Egyptian and the Russian.
6. **Clue 6**: The Chef is on the left of the fan of r&b.
7. **Clue 7**: The fan of indie is the project-manager.
8. **Clue 8**: The owner of the turtle is on the right of the Russian.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**From Clue 1 and Clue 3:**
- The owner of the cat (Clue 1) watches comedy movies (Clue 3).
- Therefore, the owner of the cat is to the left of the fan of d&b (who owns the turtle).

**From Clue 2:**
- Western is to the right of Documentary.
- So, the order for movie preferences could be: Documentary, Western, Comedy or Documentary, Comedy, Western.

**From Clue 4:**
- The fan of d&b owns the turtle.
- The fan of d&b is also to the left of the person watching comedy movies.

**From Clue 5:**
- The German is between the Egyptian and the Russian.
- This means the order could be: Egyptian, German, Russian or Russian, German, Egyptian.

**From Clue 6:**
- The Chef is on the left of the fan of r&b.
- So, the order could be: Chef, Fan of r&b or Fan of r&b, Chef.

**From Clue 7:**
- The fan of indie is the project-manager.

**From Clue 8:**
- The owner of the turtle (Clue 4) is on the right of the Russian.

### Putting it all together:

1. From Clue 2, we know:
   - Documentary, Western, Comedy or Documentary, Comedy, Western.
   
2. From Clue 4, we know:
   - The fan of d&b owns the turtle and is to the left of the person watching comedy.
   - So, the person watching comedy must be in the third position.
   
3. From Clue 1, we know:
   - The owner of the cat watches comedy.
   - Therefore, the owner of the cat is in the third position.

4. From Clue 8, we know:
   - The owner of the turtle (the fan of d&b) is on the right of the Russian.
   - Therefore, the Russian cannot be in the third position (where the owner of the cat is).

5. From Clue 5, we know:
   - The German is between the Egyptian and the Russian.
   - If the Russian is not in the third position, the only possible positions for the Russian are 1st or 2nd.
   - Since the German must be between the Egyptian and the Russian, if the Russian is in the 2nd position, the German must be in the 1st position and the Egyptian in the 3rd position.
   - But since the Egyptian is in the 3rd position, the Russian must be in the 2nd position, and the German in the 1st position.

6. From Clue 6, we know:
   - The Chef is on the left of the fan of r&b.
   - Since the fan of r&b cannot be in the first position (German), the Chef must be in the first position.

7. From Clue 7, we know:
   - The fan of indie is the project-manager.
   - The project-manager cannot be in the first position (Chef) or the second position (German), so the project-manager must be in the third position.
   - Since the owner of the cat (watching comedy) is in the third position, the project-manager must be the owner of the cat.

8. From Clue 4, we know:
   - The fan of d&b is the owner of the turtle and is in the first position.
   - Therefore, the German is the owner of the horse (since the German is in the 1st position and the Russian in the 2nd position).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |        1        |    2    |    3     |
| Job           | Chef           | Designer| Project-Manager |
| Movie-Genre   | Western        | Comedy  | Documentary    |

- The person drinking sprite watches epic movies.
- Therefore, the person drinking sprite is in the middle (Job 2).

#### Step 2: Identify the person drinking Lemonade (Clue 1 and Clue 5)
- The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the accountant.
- The person drinking lemonade is also between the person eating mango and the person drinking sprite.

- Given that the person drinking sprite is in Job 2, the journalist must be in Job 1 or Job 3.

#### Step 6: Assign the remaining roles based on clues

Lv2-5x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to fill in the table step-by-step. Let's break down each clue and apply it systematically.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person watching western movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is card-games is the doctor.
3. **Clue 3:** The fan of disco is on the far left.
4. **Clue 4:** The person watching crime movies is between the person whose sport is skateboarding and the fisherman.
5. **Clue 5:** The fan of disco is the person whose sport is badminton.
6. **Clue 6:** The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is the fisherman.
7. **Clue 7:** The paramedic is on the right of the fan of hip-hop.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 3:** The fan of disco is on the far left (position 1). Therefore, the person in position 1 prefers disco.
2. **From Clue 5:** The fan of disco is the person whose sport is badminton. So, position 1 has the sport ""badminton"" and the music genre ""disco"".
3. **From Clue 6:** The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is the fisherman. Since the fisherman is the hobby for rock-climbing, the fisherman must be in position 3 (since the fisherman cannot be in position 1 or 2 based on other clues).
4. **From Clue 4:** The person watching crime movies is between the person whose sport is skateboarding and the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in position 3, the person watching crime movies must be in position 2, and the person whose sport is skateboarding must be in position 1.
5. **From Clue 1:** The person watching crime movies (position 2) is on the left of the person watching western movies. This aligns with our current setup where the person in position 2 watches crime movies and the person in position 3 watches western movies.
6. **From Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is card-games is the doctor. Since the fisherman is already in position 3, the doctor must be in position 1.
7. **From Clue 7:** The paramedic is on the right of the fan of hip-hop. Since the fan of hip-hop cannot be in position 3 (the fisherman), and the fan of hip-hop cannot be in position 1 (the doctor), the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2. Therefore, the paramedic must be in position 3.
8. **From Clue 4 again:** We know the person in position 2 (doctor) watches crime movies, and the person in position 3 (fisherman) watches western movies. This fits with Clue 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the lizard is the person eating orange.
6. **Clue 6:** The person whose hobby is drawing is between the person eating blueberry and the Polish.

### Step-by-Step Solution

**Clue 4:** The person drinking sprite is on the far left.
- So, Beverage for position 1 is Sprite.

**Clue 5:** The owner of the lizard is the person eating orange.
- Therefore, the person eating orange is in position 2 or 3.
- Since the person eating orange is on the left of the British (Clue 1), the British must be in position 3.
- Thus, the person eating orange is in position 2 and the British is in position 3.

**Clue 1:** The person eating orange is on the left of the British.
- This confirms that the person eating orange is in position 2 and the British is in position 3.

**Clue 2:** The owner of the snake is between the person eating orange and the person drinking coffee.
- The person eating orange is in position 2, so the owner of the snake must be in position 3.
- Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1.

**Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is traveling is on the right of the owner of the snake.
- The owner of the snake is in position 3, so the person whose hobby is traveling must be in position 3.
- This conflicts with the British being in position 3, so we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Given the conflict, let's correct our assumptions:
- The person drinking coffee must be in position 2 (orange eater).
- The British must be in position 3.
- The owner of the snake is in position 1.

**Revised Clues:**
- The person drinking coffee is in position 2 (orange eater).
- The British is in position 3.
- The owner of the snake is in position 1.

**Clue 5:** The owner of the lizard is the person eating orange.
- The person eating orange is in position 2.
- The owner of the lizard is in position 2.

**Clue 6:** The person whose hobby is drawing is between the person eating blueberry and the Polish.
- The person eating orange (lizard owner) is in position 2.
- The British is in position 3.
- The owner of the snake (position 1) must be the Polish.
- The person whose hobby is drawing must be in position 2 (orange eater).
