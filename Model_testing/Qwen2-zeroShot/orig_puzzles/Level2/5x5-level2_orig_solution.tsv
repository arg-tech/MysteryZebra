Lv2-5x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to fill in the table step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 13**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far right.
   - Volleyball is in position 5.

2. **Clue 12**: The pilot is on the right of the firefighter.
   - Since the person who's sport is volleyball is on the far right (position 5), the pilot cannot be in position 5.
   - Therefore, the firefighter must be in position 4 and the pilot in position 5.
   - So, position 5 is occupied by the pilot.

3. **Clue 11**: The firefighter is between the person drinking milk and the person drinking tea.
   - This means the firefighter (position 4) is between the person drinking milk and the person drinking tea.
   - Possible positions for the person drinking milk and tea are 2 and 3 or 3 and 2.

4. **Clue 10**: The person eating onion is the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - So, the person watching martial-arts movies is eating onion.

5. **Clue 6**: The person eating onion is between the person watching drama movies and the firefighter.
   - The firefighter is in position 4.
   - Therefore, the person eating onion must be in position 3, and the person watching drama movies must be in position 2.

6. **Clue 9**: The person drinking sprite is between the person who's sport is golf and the person eating grapes.
   - The person eating onion is in position 3, so the person eating grapes must be in position 2 or 4.
   - Since the person watching drama movies is in position 2, the person eating grapes must be in position 4.
   - The person drinking sprite is in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person who's sport is golf is in position 2.

7. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person eating cauliflower.
   - The person eating onion is in position 3, and the person eating grapes is in position 4.
   - Therefore, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 2.
   - The person eating cauliflower is in position 4.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is skiing is between the person watching martial-arts movies and the writer.
   - The person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person who's sport is skiing is in position 2, and the writer is in position 4.
   - But we already assigned the person who's sport is water-polo to position 2, so the writer must be in position 5.

9. **Clue 4**: The person watching western movies is on the left of the person drinking tea.
   - The person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3.
   - Therefore, the person watching western movies is in position 2, and the person drinking tea is in position 4.
   - But we already assigned the person who's sport is water-polo to position 2, so the person drinking tea must be in position 5, which contradicts our previous assignment. Let's correct this:
     - The person who's sport is water-polo is in position 2.

Lv2-5x5-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11:** The firefighter is on the far left.
2. **Clue 13:** The person eating cherry is on the far left.
3. **Clue 14:** The owner of the turtle is on the far right.

Since the firefighter is on the far left and the person eating cherry is also on the far left, we can place both of them in position 1:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |        4        |       5        |
| Food          | cherry      |           |            |                 |                |

| Job           | firefighter |           |            | project-manager |                |
| Movie-Genre   |             |           |            |                 |                |
| Pet           |             |           |            |                 |                |
```

4. **Clue 12:** The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person watching western movies.
5. **Clue 16:** The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.

Since the person eating cherry is in position 1, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 5 (since they are to the right of the person watching western movies). Let's denote the person watching western movies as W, and the person eating pomegranate as P. We need to figure out where W and P are located relative to each other.

6. **Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is the person eating pomegranate.
7. **Clue 5:** The person eating tomato is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
8. **Clue 15:** The owner of the hamster is between the project-manager and the person eating tomato.
9. **Clue 17:** The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.

From Clue 15, since the owner of the hamster is between the project-manager and the person eating tomato, and the project-manager is in position 4, the hamster owner must be in position 3, and the person eating tomato must be in position 5 (but we already know that position 5 is for pomegranate). Therefore, the tomato eater must be in position 4.

Now let's fill in the known positions:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |        4        |       5        |
| Food          | cherry      |           |            | tomato          | pomegranate    |
| Hobby         |             |           | hamster    | writing         | puzzles        |
| Job           | firefighter |           |            | project-manager |                |
| Movie-Genre   |             |           |            |                 |                |
| Pet           |             |           |            |                 |                |
```

10. **Clue 7:** The owner of the hamster is on the left of the project-manager.
11. **Clue 9:** The manager is the owner of the rat.
12. **Clue 3:** The owner of the rat is the person eating tomato.
13. **Clue 8:** The owner of the rat is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.
14. **Clue 2:** The person watching disaster movies is the owner of the pony.
15. **Clue 1:** The project-manager is between the person watching western movies and the person watching documentary movies.
16. **Clue 6:** The owner of the hamster is on the left of the project-manager.
17. **Clue 4:** The person eating tomato is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
18. **Clue 12:** The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person watching western movies.

Based on these clues, we can determine:
- The person watching disaster movies is in position 2 (since the owner of the pony is in position 2).
- The person watching western movies is in position 4 (since the person eating pomegranate is in position 5).

Thus, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 3 (since the project-manager is in position 4 and the person watching western movies is in position 4).

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |        4        |       5        |
| Food          | cherry      |           |            | tomato          | pomegranate    |
| Hobby         |             | disaster  | hamster    | writing         | puzzles        |
| Job           | firefighter |           | manager    | project-manager |                |
| Movie-Genre   |             |           |            |                 |                |
| Pet           |             | pony      | rat        |                 |                |
```

19. **Clue 16:** The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
20. **Clue 17:** The person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person eating radish.

Since the person eating pomegranate is in position 5, the person eating radish must be in position 6 (which is not possible since there are only 5 positions). Therefore, the person eating radish must be in position 4, and the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 3.

Finally, we can fill in the last details:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |        4        |       5        |
| Food          | cherry      |           | baking     | tomato          | pomegranate    |
| Hobby         |             | disaster  | writing    | baking          | puzzles        |

| Pet           |             | pony      | rat        |                 |                |
```

21. **Clue 18:** The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person watching western movies.

We have all the information filled in. Now, we just need to assign the remaining jobs and movie genres based on the available options.

The final solution is:
