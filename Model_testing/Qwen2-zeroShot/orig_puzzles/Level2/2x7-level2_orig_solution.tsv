Lv2-2x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each nationality and their corresponding sport in the correct positions based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The Australian is between the Italian and the Turkish.
2. The French is in the middle (position 4).
3. The person who's sport is Parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is Volleyball.
4. The Japanese is between the person who's sport is Biathlon and the person who's sport is Parkour.
5. The person who's sport is Baseball is on the right of the person who's sport is Skiing.
6. The person who's sport is Baseball is on the right of the Italian.
7. The person who's sport is Badminton is between the person who's sport is Cycling and the person who's sport is Biathlon.
8. The person who's sport is Baseball is on the left of the Turkish.
9. The Japanese is on the left of the Thai.
10. The Japanese is on the right of the person who's sport is Biathlon.
11. The Thai is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 4 is occupied by the French** (Clue 2).

2. **The Australian is between the Italian and the Turkish** (Clue 1). This means:
   - If A = Australian, I = Italian, T = Turkish, then the order must be I-A-T or T-A-I.

3. **The Japanese is on the left of the Thai** (Clue 9) and on the right of the person who's sport is Biathlon (Clue 10). Therefore, the Japanese cannot be in position 7 (Thai), and it must be before the Thai. Also, the Japanese must be after the person with Biathlon.

4. **The Thai is on the far right** (Clue 11), so Thai is in position 7.

5. **The person who's sport is Parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is Volleyball** (Clue 3). So if V = Volleyball, P = Parkour, then V must be in a position to the left of P.

6. **The person who's sport is Baseball is on the right of the person who's sport is Skiing** (Clue 5) and on the right of the Italian (Clue 6). So if S = Skiing, B = Baseball, then S must be to the left of B, and B must be to the right of the Italian.

7. **The person who's sport is Baseball is on the left of the Turkish** (Clue 8). So B must be to the left of T.

8. **The person who's sport is Badminton is between the person who's sport is Cycling and the person who's sport is Biathlon** (Clue 7). So if C = Cycling, B = Biathlon, and M = Badminton, then C must be to the left of M, and M must be to the left of B.

### Arranging the Sports:

- From Clue 3, Parkour (P) is on the right of Volleyball (V).
- From Clue 5, Baseball (B) is on the right of Skiing (S).
- From Clue 6, Baseball (B) is on the right of the Italian (I).
- From Clue 8, Baseball (B) is on the left of the Turkish (T).
- From Clue 7, Badminton (M) is between Cycling (C) and Biathlon (B).

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the sports:

- B must be between S and P.
- M must be between C and B.
- B must be to the left of T.
- S must be to the left of B.

Let's start placing them:

- Since B is on the right of S and T is on the right of B, and T is in position 7, B must be in position 6.
- S must be in position 5.
- M must be in position 4 (between C and B), but since B is in 6, M must be in 3 and C in 2.
- P must be in position 1 (since P is to the left of B and V must be to the left of P).

So the order of sports could be: P, V, M, C, S, B, T.

### Arranging the Nationalities:

- The Japanese is on the left of the Thai (Clue 9).
- The Japanese is on the right of the person with Biathlon (Clue 10).
- The Japanese is between the Italian and the Turkish (Clue 1).
- The Italian is to the left of the Japanese.
- The Turkish is to the right of the Japanese.
- The person with Baseball is to the right of the Italian (Clue 6).
- The person with Baseball is to the left of the Turkish (Clue 8).

From the above, the only way to fit all these constraints is:

- Position 1: Indonesian (Nationality)
- Position 2: Italian (Nationality)
- Position 3: Japanese (Nationality)
- Position 4: French (Nationality)
- Position 5: Thai (Nationality)
- Position 6: Turkish (Nationality)
- Position 7: Australian (Nationality)

Lv2-2x7-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the given table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the ship is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the skateboard is the fan of disco.
3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the bike is between the fan of rock and the fan of classical.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan of punk is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the bike is in the middle (position 4).
6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the train is on the left of the fan of classical.
7. **Clue 7**: The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the skateboard.
8. **Clue 8**: The person driving the helicopter is the fan of house.
9. **Clue 9**: The fan of metal is the person driving the train.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From **Clue 2** and **Clue 4**, we know:
   - The person driving the skateboard is in position 2 and is the fan of disco.
   - The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the fan of punk, so the fan of punk must be in position 3 or 4.

2. From **Clue 5**, the person driving the bike is in position 4. So, the fan of rock and the fan of classical must be in positions 2 and 3, respectively, because the person driving the bike is in the middle.

3. From **Clue 3**, the person driving the bike is between the fan of rock and the fan of classical. Since the person driving the bike is in position 4, the fan of rock must be in position 3 and the fan of classical must be in position 2. This conflicts with our previous assignment from Clue 2 and 4, so let's reassign:
   - The fan of rock is in position 3.
   - The fan of classical is in position 5.
   - The person driving the skateboard is in position 2 and is the fan of disco.
   - The fan of punk is in position 4 (right of the skateboard).

4. From **Clue 7**, the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. So, the person driving the motorbike is in position 1.

5. From **Clue 1**, the person driving the ship is on the right of the person driving the skateboard. So, the person driving the ship is in position 6.

6. From **Clue 6**, the person driving the train is on the left of the fan of classical. Since the fan of classical is in position 5, the person driving the train must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is already occupied by the person driving the motorbike. So, the person driving the train must be in position 3, which is the fan of rock.

7. From **Clue 8**, the person driving the helicopter is the fan of house. So, the person driving the helicopter is in position 7.

8. From **Clue 9**, the fan of metal is the person driving the train. So, the person driving the train is the fan of metal, which is in position 3.

4. **The paramedic is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.**
   - Paramedic comes before the person with badminton.

5. **The videographer is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.**
   - Snowboarding comes before the videographer.

6. **The person who's sport is snowboarding is between the person who's sport is parkour and the firefighter.**
   - Parkour, snowboarding, and firefighter form a sequence where snowboarding is in the middle.

7. **The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.**
   - Parkour comes before climbing.

8. **The videographer is in the middle (position 4).**
   - Videographer is in position 4.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 4 is occupied by the videographer.**
   - Position 4: Videographer

2. **The videographer is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.**
   - Therefore, the person with snowboarding must be in position 3.
   - Position 3: Snowboarding

3. **The person who's sport is snowboarding is between the person who's sport is parkour and the firefighter.**
   - This means parkour is in position 2 and firefighter is in position 5.
   - Position 2: Parkour
   - Position 5: Firefighter

4. **The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.**
   - Therefore, the person with climbing must be in position 6.
   - Position 6: Climbing

5. **The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing.**
   - Since the paramedic is on the left of the person with badminton, and considering the positions already filled, the only possible positions for badminton and rowing are 1 and 7 respectively.
   - Position 1: Badminton
   - Position 7: Rowing

6. **The pilot is on the left of the writer.**
   - The only positions left are 2 and 3, but since 2 is already occupied by parkour, the pilot must be in position 1 and the writer in position 7.
   - Position 1: Pilot
   - Position 7: Writer

7. **The person who's sport is cycling is the scientist.**
   - The only remaining position is 6, which is already occupied by climbing. So, the scientist must be in position 6.
   - Position 6: Scientist (cycling)

8. **Paramedic is in position 3 as determined earlier.**

1. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is rowing is the person drinking coffee.
   - Rowing -> Coffee (7)

2. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is surfing is the person drinking iced-tea.
   - Surfing -> Iced-tea (5)

3. **Clue 8**: The person who's sport is rugby is drinking lemonade.
   - Rugby -> Lemonade (6)

4. **Clue 9**: The person who's sport is parkour is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person drinking iced-tea.
   - Parkour -> Between Rugby and Surfing
   - Parkour -> 4 (since Rugby is 6 and Surfing is 5)

5. **Clue 2**: The person drinking cola is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.
   - Let's denote the person drinking cola as \( C \) and the person whose sport is volleyball as \( V \).
   - \( C \) is to the left of \( V \).

6. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is cycling is in the middle.
   - Cycling -> 4 (since 3 and 5 are already taken by Parkour and Surfing respectively)

7. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - Cricket -> Left of Hot-Chocolate

8. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - Since Cricket is on the left of Hot-Chocolate, and we have 4 as Cycling, 6 as Surfing, and 5 as Parkour, the only possible positions for Cricket and Hot-Chocolate are 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

9. **Clue 10**: The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
   - Fanta -> Left of Lemonade (Lemonade is 6)
   - So, Fanta must be in position 3.

Given the positions:
- 1: Cricket
- 2: Hot-Chocolate
- 3: Fanta
- 4: Cycling
- 5: Parkour
- 6: Surfing (Iced-tea)
- 7: Rugby (Lemonade)

Now, we need to place the sports and beverages correctly:
- Cricket -> Coffee (from Clue 7)
- Hot-Chocolate -> (Not yet assigned)
- Fanta -> (Not yet assigned)
- Cycling -> (Not yet assigned)
- Parkour -> (Not yet assigned)
- Surfing -> Iced-tea (from Clue 1)
- Rugby -> Lemonade (from Clue 8)

From Clue 2, since \( C \) (cola) is on the left of \( V \) (volleyball), and from Clue 10, Fanta is on the left of Lemonade, the only possible positions for cola and volleyball are 1 and 2.

Since Cricket is on the left of Hot-Chocolate, and Cricket is 1, Hot-Chocolate must be 2.

Thus:
- 1: Cricket -> Coffee
- 2: Hot-Chocolate -> (Not yet assigned)
- 3: Fanta -> (Not yet assigned)
- 4: Cycling -> (Not yet assigned)
- 5: Parkour -> (Not yet assigned)
- 6: Surfing -> Iced-tea
- 7: Rugby -> Lemonade

Since Fanta is on the left of Lemonade, and we have 6 as Surfing (Iced-tea) and 7 as Rugby (Lemonade), Fanta must be 3.

Thus:
- 1: Cricket -> Coffee
- 2: Hot-Chocolate -> (Not yet assigned)
- 3: Fanta -> (Not yet assigned)
- 4: Cycling -> (Not yet assigned)
- 5: Parkour -> (Not yet assigned)
- 6: Surfing -> Iced-tea
- 7: Rugby -> Lemonade

Since Cricket is on the left of Hot-Chocolate, and Cricket is 1, Hot-Chocolate must be 2.

So the final arrangement is:
- 1: Cricket -> Coffee
- 2: Hot-Chocolate -> (Not yet assigned)
- 3: Fanta -> (Not yet assigned)
- 4: Cycling -> (Not yet assigned)
- 5: Parkour -> (Not yet assigned)
- 6: Surfing -> Iced-tea
- 7: Rugby -> Lemonade

Now, we assign the remaining sports and beverages:
- 1: Cricket -> Coffee
- 2: Hot-Chocolate -> Cola
- 3: Fanta -> Rugby
- 4: Cycling -> Parkour
- 5: Parkour -> Fanta
- 6: Surfing -> Iced-tea
- 7: Rugby -> Lemonade

| Job            |                |            |              |           |                    |            |           |
```

From clue 5, the photographer must be to the left of the person drinking fanta. From clue 1, the photographer is on the left of the librarian. Therefore, the photographer cannot be in positions 6 or 7, and must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 7, the dressmaker is on the right of the police-officer, so the dressmaker must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

From clue 8, the accountant is on the right of the person drinking water, so the person drinking water must be in a position to the left of the accountant.

From clue 9, the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking cola, and from clue 10, the person drinking fanta is between the person drinking water and the person drinking cola. This means the order for these three drinks is cola -> fanta -> water.

From clue 4, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking water. So we can place the fanta and water in positions where this condition is met.

Let's try placing the photographer in position 2:
```
| Police-officer | Photographer |       2        |      3       |     4     |         5          |     6      |     7     |
| Beverage       |             |                |              |           |                    |            |           |
| Job            |             |                |              |           |                    |            |           |
```

Since the photographer is in position 2, the librarian must be in position 3 or 4. The accountant is on the left of the fisherman, so they must be in positions 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

From clue 6, the person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking water. So we need to place mirinda, juice, and water in such a way that mirinda is in the middle.

From clue 8, the accountant is on the right of the person drinking water, so the person drinking water must be in a position to the left of the accountant.

Let's try placing the librarian in position 3 and the fisherman in position 4:
```
| Police-officer | Photographer | Librarian |       3       | Fisherman |         5          |     6      |     7     |
| Beverage       |             |          |               |           |                    |            |           |
| Job            |             |          |               |           |                    |            |           |
```

Now, the accountant must be in position 5, 6, or 7, and the fisherman is in position 4. The person drinking water must be to the left of the accountant, so let's place the person drinking water in position 5:
```
| Police-officer | Photographer | Librarian |       3       | Water     |         5          |     6      |     7     |
| Beverage       |             |          |               |           |                    |            |           |
| Job            |             |          |               |           |                    |            |           |
```

This means the person drinking cola must be in position 6 and the person drinking fanta in position 7. Now we need to assign the remaining beverages and jobs.

From clue 11, the photographer is on the right of the person drinking lemonade, so the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1, which is already taken by the police-officer.

So, the only remaining positions for the remaining beverages and jobs are:
```
| Police-officer | Photographer | Librarian |       3       | Water     | Lemonade | Juice     | Mirinda   |
| Beverage       |             |          |               |           |          |          |           |
| Job            |             |          |               |           |          |          |           |
```

Now we need to assign the remaining jobs:
- The dressmaker is in position 7.
- The accountant is in position 6.
- The fisherman is in position 4.
- The librarian is in position 3.

Finally, we assign the beverages:
- The person drinking cola is in position 6.
- The person drinking lemonade is in position 7.
- The person drinking juice is in position 5.
- The person drinking mirinda is in position 4.

Thus, the final solution is:
```
| Police-officer | Photographer | Librarian |       3       | Water     | Lemonade | Juice     | Mirinda   |
| Beverage       |             |          |               |           |          |          |           |
| Job            |             |          |               |           |          |          | Dressmaker|
```

Assigning the beverages:
- Position 1: Hot-Chocolate
- Position 2: Fanta
- Position 3: Juice
- Position 4: Mirinda
- Position 5: Water
- Position 6: Cola
- Position 7: Lemonade

Final Solution Table:
```
| Police-officer | Photographer | Librarian |       3       | Water     | Lemonade | Juice     | Mirinda   |
| Beverage       | Hot-Chocolate| Fanta     | Juice         | Water     | Cola     | Mirinda   | Lemonade  |
| Job            |             |          |              |           |          |          | Dressmaker|

5. The person driving the bus is in the middle.
6. The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
7. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
8. The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
9. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching romance movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching action movies is the person driving the tram.
   - Action → Tram

2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person watching action movies.
   - Motorbike → 1 (leftmost position)
   - Action → 7 (rightmost position)

3. **Clue 5:** The person driving the bus is in the middle.
   - Bus → 4

4. **Clue 7:** The person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching romance movies.
   - Trike → 7 or 6 (since Romance is to its left)

5. **Clue 3:** The person watching romance movies is between the person driving the trike and the person driving the taxi.
   - If Romance is at 5, then Trike must be at 6 and Taxi at 4 (but Bus is already at 4).
   - If Romance is at 4, then Trike must be at 5 and Taxi at 3.
   - Since Bus is at 4, Romance can only be at 3 and Trike at 4, but that conflicts with Bus.
   - Therefore, Romance must be at 5, Trike at 6, and Taxi at 3.

6. **Clue 8:** The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
   - Satire → 2 (left of Romance)

7. **Clue 9:** The person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching romance movies.
   - This is consistent with Trike being at 6 and Romance at 5.

8. **Clue 6:** The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
   - Disaster → 7 (rightmost position, consistent with Romance at 5)

9. **Clue 4:** The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
   - Adventure and Horror can be placed in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, but since Motorbike is at 1 and Satire is at 2, Adventure and Horror must be at 2 and 3 respectively.

10. **Clue 7:** The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
    - Skateboard → 1 (leftmost, already assigned)
    - Taxi → 3 (consistent with Romance at 5 and Disaster at 7)

11. **Final Verification:**
    - Motorbike → 1
    - Skateboard → 1
    - Bus → 4
    - Trike → 6
    - Taxi → 3
    - Romance → 5
    - Disaster → 7
    - Adventure → 2
    - Horror → 3
