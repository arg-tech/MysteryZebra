### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Positioning the Movie-Genres:
- Western movies are on the far left (Position 1).
- Musical movies are on the right of Adventure movies (Positions 2 and 3).

Thus, the order for movie genres is:
- Position 1: Western
- Position 2: Adventure

#### 2. Positioning Nationalities:
- Mexican is on the far right (Position 3).
- Indian is to the right of the person drinking tea (Tea is to the left of Indian).

#### 3. Positioning Beverages:
- Tea is to the left of the Indian.
- Milk is to the left of Fanta.

Thus, the order for beverages is:

- Position 2: Tea
- Position 3: Fanta

#### 4. Positioning Food:
- Cabbage is between the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating mango.
- Mango is to the left of the person driving the train.

From clue 3, we know the person eating mango is not in position 1 or 3 (since the person eating mango is to the left of the person driving the train). Therefore, the person eating mango must be in position 2.

Thus, the order for food is:
- Position 1: Chinchilla
- Position 2: Mango
- Position 3: Peas

#### 5. Positioning Transport:
- The person driving the bus is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
- The person eating cabbage is between the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating mango.

- Position 2: Train
- Position 3: Subway

#### 6. Positioning Pets:
- The person eating cabbage is between the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating mango.
- Thus, the order for pets is:

This table satisfies all the given clues."
Lv2-6x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize the information step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions and relationships:**

   - The person whose hobby is writing is between the Mexican and the owner of the cat.
   - The French is on the left of the Egyptian.
   - The Egyptian is the Egyptian (this doesn't provide new information).
   - The owner of the snake prefers folk.
   - The French is on the left of the fan of classical.
   - The person whose hobby is writing is between the person whose hobby is traveling and the person eating nectarine.
   - The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the van.
   - The fan of folk is on the left of the person eating pumpkin.
   - The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the fan of folk.

2. **Start filling the table based on the given clues:**

   - Since the French is on the left of the Egyptian, and the Egyptian is the Egyptian, we can place them as follows:
     ```
     |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
     | Food          |            |         |           |
     | Hobby         |            |         |           |
     | Music-Genre   |            |         |           |
     | Nationality   | French     | Egyptian|           |
     | Pet           |            |         |           |
     | Transport     | Car        | Van     |           |
     ```

   - The person whose hobby is writing is between the Mexican and the owner of the cat. This means the Mexican and the owner of the cat must be in positions 1 and 3, and the person with the hobby of writing must be in position 2.
     ```
     |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
     | Food          |            |         |           |
     | Hobby         | Writing    |         |           |
     | Music-Genre   |            |         |           |
     | Nationality   | Mexican    | Egyptian|           |
     | Pet           |            | Cat     |           |
     | Transport     | Car        | Van     |           |
     ```

   - The French is on the left of the fan of classical, so the fan of classical cannot be in position 1 (since the French is already there). Also, since the person with the hobby of writing is in position 2, the fan of classical must be in position 3.
     ```
     |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
     | Food          |            |         |           |
     | Hobby         | Writing    | Classical|           |
     | Music-Genre   |            |         |           |
     | Nationality   | Mexican    | Egyptian|           |
     | Pet           |            | Cat     |           |
     | Transport     | Car        | Van     |           |
     ```

   - The owner of the snake prefers folk, and the fan of folk is on the left of the person eating pumpkin. So, the person eating pumpkin must be in position 3, and the owner of the snake must be in position 1.
     ```
     |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
     | Food          | Pumpkin    |         | Nectarine |
     | Hobby         | Writing    | Classical|           |
     | Music-Genre   | Folk       |         |           |
     | Nationality   | Mexican    | Egyptian|           |
     | Pet           | Snake      | Cat     |           |
     | Transport     | Car        | Van     |           |
     ```

   - The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the van, which is already true in our current setup.
   - The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the fan of folk, but since the fan of folk is already in position 3, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 1.
     ```
     |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
     | Food          | Pumpkin    |         | Nectarine |
     | Hobby         | Writing    | Classical|           |
     | Music-Genre   | Folk       |         |           |
     | Nationality   | Mexican    | Egyptian|           |
     | Pet           | Snake      | Cat     |           |
     | Transport     | Snowmobile | Van     | Car       |
     ```

   - Finally, the only food left is nectarine for the person with the hobby of traveling, and the only music genre left is classical for the person with the nationality of Mexican.
     ```
     |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
     | Food          | Pumpkin    | Plum    | Nectarine |
     | Hobby         | Writing    | Classical| Traveling |
     | Music-Genre   | Folk       | Punk    |           |
     | Nationality   | Mexican    | Egyptian| French    |
     | Pet           | Snake      | Cat     |           |
     | Transport     | Snowmobile | Van     | Car       |
     ```

Lv2-6x3-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The fan of indie is on the left of the fan of country.**
2. **The owner of the guinea-pig is the person eating banana.**
3. **The person watching animation movies is on the far left.**
4. **The Japanese is on the far right.**
5. **The fan of country is the owner of the dog.**
6. **The bartender is between the person eating pumpkin and the owner of the goat.**
7. **The Egyptian is on the right of the person eating kiwi.**
8. **The social-worker is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the person watching animation movies (Clue 3)
- The person watching animation movies is on the far left.
  - Animation -> Position 1

#### Step 2: Place the Japanese (Clue 4)
- The Japanese is on the far right.
  - Japanese -> Position 3

#### Step 3: Determine the fan preferences (Clues 1 and 2)
- The fan of indie is on the left of the fan of country.
- The fan of country is the owner of the dog.
  - Let's assume the fan of country is in position 2.
  - Then the fan of indie must be in position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is already taken by the person watching animation movies, the fan of indie must be in position 3.
  - Therefore:
    - Indie fan -> Position 3
    - Country fan -> Position 2

#### Step 4: Determine the nationality of the fan of indie and country (Clue 5)
- The fan of country is the owner of the dog.
  - Since the Japanese is on the far right, the fan of country cannot be Japanese.
  - Therefore, the fan of indie must be Japanese.
  - So:
    - Japanese -> Fan of indie
    - Position 3 -> Japanese
    - Position 2 -> Fan of country

#### Step 5: Determine the pet and food preferences (Clue 2)
- The owner of the guinea-pig is the person eating banana.
  - Since the Japanese is on the right, the Japanese cannot own the guinea-pig.
  - Therefore, the person eating banana must be in position 1 or 2.
  - But since position 1 is already taken by the person watching animation movies, the person eating banana must be in position 2.
  - So:
    - Position 2 -> Eating banana
    - Position 2 -> Fan of country
    - Therefore, the person eating banana is the fan of country.
    - This means the fan of country is not the owner of the dog, so the owner of the dog must be in position 1.
    - Therefore:
      - Position 1 -> Dog owner
      - Position 2 -> Banana eater (fan of country)

#### Step 6: Determine the remaining positions for food and job (Clue 6)
- The bartender is between the person eating pumpkin and the owner of the goat.
  - Since the person eating banana is in position 2, the person eating pumpkin and the owner of the goat must be in positions 1 and 3.
  - Since position 1 is the dog owner and position 3 is the Japanese (fan of indie), the person eating pumpkin must be in position 1 and the owner of the goat must be in position 3.
  - So:
    - Position 1 -> Pumpkin eater
    - Position 3 -> Goat owner (Japanese)
    - Therefore, the person eating pumpkin is the bartender.
    - And the person owning the goat is the social-worker.

#### Step 7: Determine the remaining job and movie preferences (Clues 7 and 8)
- The Egyptian is on the right of the person eating kiwi.
  - Since the Japanese is on the right, the Egyptian must be in position 2.
  - Therefore, the person eating kiwi must be in position 1.
  - So:
    - Position 1 -> Kiwi eater
    - Position 2 -> Egyptian
    - The remaining person must be the security-guard.
  - The social-worker is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
  - Since the Japanese is on the right, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 2.
  - Therefore, the social-worker must be in position 1.
  - And the remaining job is the bartender.
  - So:
    - Position 1 -> Security-guard (eating pumpkin)
    - Position 2 -> Social-worker (watching martial-arts, eating kiwi)
    - Position 3 -> Bartender (eating banana, watching animation, Japanese)

#### Final Table:

```
|               |       1        |      2       |       3       |

| Sport         |   Tram    |              |   Handball    |
```

| Transport     |   Tram    |              |   Trike       |
```

From clue 6, the person watching martial-arts movies is between the person who's sport is badminton and the person eating apple. Therefore, we can deduce:
- Martial-arts must be in column 2.
- Apple must be in column 1.

So, we update our table:

| Transport     |   Tram    |              |   Trike       |
```

From clue 3, the fan of metal is on the right of the person who's sport is handball. This is already satisfied.

#### Final Table:

   - Mystery < Skydiving
   
8. **The person whose sport is skiing is on the right of the journalist.**
   - Skiing is on the right of the journalist, so if the journalist is in column 1, then skiing is in column 3.
   - If the journalist is in column 2, then skiing is in column 3.
   - If the journalist is in column 3, then there's no room for skiing on the right.

Let's summarize what we know so far:
- **Column 3:**
  - Hot-Chocolate (Writer)
  - Epic Movies
  - Iced-Tea
  - Skiing
  - Skydiving

Given these constraints, let's fill in the table:
