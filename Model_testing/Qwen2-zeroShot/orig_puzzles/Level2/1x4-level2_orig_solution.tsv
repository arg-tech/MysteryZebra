Lv2-1x4-1	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The fan of hip-hop is on the far left.
2. The fan of jazz is between the fan of metal and the fan of soul.
3. The fan of jazz is on the left of the fan of metal.

Given these clues, let's deduce the order:

1. From clue 1, we know that the fan of hip-hop (H) must be in position 1.
2. Clue 2 tells us that the fan of jazz (J) is between the fan of metal (M) and the fan of soul (S).
3. Clue 3 states that the fan of jazz (J) is to the left of the fan of metal (M).

Let's combine these clues:
- Since J is between M and S, and J is to the left of M, the order must be J, M, S.
- Given that H is in position 1, we can place the remaining positions as follows:
  
  - Position 1: H (Hip-hop)
  - Position 2: J (Jazz)
  - Position 3: M (Metal)
  - Position 4: S (Soul)

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |    1    |  2   |  3   |   4   |
| Music-Genre   | Hip-hop | Jazz | Metal | Soul  |

Lv2-1x4-2	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking cola.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking cola.

From Clue 3, we can deduce that the sequence must be:
- Person 1 (leftmost) -> Hot-chocolate
- Person 2 -> Mirinda
- Person 3 -> Cola
- Person 4 (rightmost) -> Iced-tea

This is because mirinda is between hot-chocolate and cola, and mirinda is also to the right of hot-chocolate.

Now let's fill in the table with these beverages:

```
|            |       1       |    2    |  3   |    4     |
| Beverage   | hot-chocolate | mirinda | cola | iced-tea |
```

So, the final solution table is:

```
|            |       1       |    2    |  3   |    4     |

Lv2-1x4-3	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step.

Given:
1. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the bird.
2. The owner of the pony is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the turtle.
3. The owner of the bird is on the far left.

We need to place the four pets (bird, ferret, pony, turtle) into positions 1 through 4 while satisfying all the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Owner of the bird is on the far left**:
   - This means position 1 must be the bird.
   - So, we have: `B _ _ _`

2. **The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the bird**:
   - Since the bird is in position 1, the turtle must be in either position 2, 3, or 4.
   - However, because the turtle is on the right of the bird, it cannot be in position 1. Thus, possible positions for the turtle are 2, 3, or 4.

3. **The owner of the pony is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the turtle**:
   - This implies that the pony, ferret, and turtle must be in three consecutive positions.
   - Given that the bird is in position 1, the only way to fit three pets consecutively with the turtle being on the right of the bird is if the turtle is in position 3 or 4.

Let's consider the two cases for the turtle's position:

#### Case 1: Turtle in position 3
- If the turtle is in position 3, then the sequence must be: `B _ T _`
- The remaining pets are ferret and pony.
- The pony must be between the ferret and the turtle, so the only valid arrangement is: `B F P T`

#### Case 2: Turtle in position 4
- If the turtle is in position 4, then the sequence must be: `B _ _ T`
- The remaining pets are ferret and pony.
- The pony must be between the ferret and the turtle, but there isn't enough space for this to fit without breaking the sequence. Therefore, this case is invalid.

So, the only valid solution is:

```
|       |  1   |   2    |  3   |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird | Ferret | Pony | Turtle |
```

### Final Solution:
```
|       |  1   |   2    |  3   |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird | Ferret | Pony | Turtle |

Lv2-1x4-4	"Let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step to determine the correct order of the foods.

### Conditions Recap:
1. The person eating papaya is between the person eating nectarine and the person eating asparagus.
2. The person eating asparagus is on the right of the person eating papaya.
3. The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating strawberry.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Condition 1:
- Papaya (P) is between Nectarine (N) and Asparagus (A).
- This means the sequence involving P, N, and A must be either N-P-A or A-P-N.

#### Condition 2:
- Asparagus (A) is on the right of Papaya (P).
- This eliminates the possibility of A-P-N from Condition 1, leaving us with N-P-A.

#### Condition 3:
- Nectarine (N) is on the right of Strawberry (S).
- This means S must come before N in the sequence.

### Combining All Conditions:
- From Condition 2, we have N-P-A.
- From Condition 3, we know S must come before N, so S must be on the left of N.

Given these constraints, the only possible sequence that fits all conditions is:
- S (Strawberry)
- N (Nectarine)
- P (Papaya)
- A (Asparagus)

### Final Solution Table:
```
|        |     1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
| Food   | Strawberry | Nectarine | Papaya | Asparagus |

Lv2-1x4-5	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person eating onion is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating carrot.
2. The person eating broccoli is on the left of the person eating carrot.
3. The person eating broccoli is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The person eating broccoli is on the far left. This means Broccoli (B) must be in position 1.
   ```
   | Broccoli |        |        |        |
   ```

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating broccoli is on the left of the person eating carrot (C). Since Broccoli is in position 1, Carrot must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   ```
   | Broccoli | Carrot |        |        |
   ```

3. **Clue 1**: The person eating onion (O) is between the person eating raspberry (R) and the person eating carrot (C).
   - Since Carrot is in position 2, 3, or 4, and Onion must be between Raspberry and Carrot, let's analyze the possible positions for Onion and Raspberry:
     - If Carrot is in position 2, then Onion must be in position 1 (but position 1 is already occupied by Broccoli), so this is not possible.
     - If Carrot is in position 3, then Onion must be in position 2, and Raspberry must be in position 1, but position 1 is already occupied by Broccoli, so this is not possible.
     - Therefore, Carrot must be in position 4, and Onion must be in position 3, with Raspberry in position 2.
   ```
   | Broccoli | Raspberry | Onion | Carrot |
   ```

So, the final arrangement is:

```
| Broccoli | Raspberry | Onion | Carrot |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Broccoli | Raspberry | Onion | Carrot |

Lv2-1x4-6	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We know:
1. The lawyer is between the engineer and the fisherman.
2. The fisherman is on the far right.

Given these clues, we can deduce the positions of the other jobs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Fisherman Position**: Since the fisherman is on the far right (position 4), we can write:
   ```
   |       |     1      |    2     |   3    |     4     |
   | Job   |            |          |        | Fisherman |
   ```

2. **Lawyer and Engineer Positions**: The lawyer is between the engineer and the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in position 4, the only possible positions for the engineer and the lawyer are positions 1 and 2 or positions 2 and 3. We need to determine which one fits the clue correctly.

   - If the engineer is in position 1 and the lawyer is in position 2, then the fisherman would be in position 4, which fits our clue.
   - If the engineer is in position 2 and the lawyer is in position 3, then the fisherman would be in position 4, but this does not fit because the lawyer would not be between the engineer and the fisherman.

   Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
   ```
   |       |     1      |    2     |   3    |     4     |
   | Job   | Engineer   | Lawyer   |        | Fisherman |
   ```

3. **Remaining Job**: The only job left is the accountant, which must be in position 3.

So, the final solution is:

```
|       |     1      |    2     |   3    |     4     |
| Job   | Engineer   | Lawyer   | Accountant | Fisherman |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1 & 2:
From clue 1 and 2, we can infer that the order must be:
- Lemonade -> Juice -> Fanta

#### Clue 3:
Clue 3 states that the person drinking fanta is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking juice. This means the order must be:
- Soy-milk -> Juice -> Fanta

Combining both pieces of information, the only way to satisfy all clues is:
- Lemonade -> Soy-milk -> Juice -> Fanta

### Clues:
1. The person driving the airplane is on the far left.
2. The person driving the scooter is between the person driving the airplane and the person driving the subway.

Given these clues, we can start filling out the table:

1. Since the person driving the airplane is on the far left, we place ""airplane"" in position 1.
2. The person driving the scooter must be in position 2 (between the person driving the airplane and the person driving the subway).

This leaves positions 3 and 4 for the quad-bike and the subway. However, since the person driving the scooter is between the airplane and the subway, the subway cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the subway must be in position 4, and the quad-bike must be in position 3.

So, the final arrangement is:

|             |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4     |
|-------------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
2. The person watching fantasy movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching time-travel movies.
3. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 2 Analysis:
- The person watching fantasy movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching time-travel movies.
- This means that the sequence must be: Comedy -> Fantasy -> Time-Travel.

#### Clue 1 Analysis:
- The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
- This aligns with the sequence from Clue 2: Comedy -> Fantasy -> Time-Travel.

#### Clue 3 Analysis:
- The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
- Since we already have Comedy -> Fantasy -> Time-Travel from Clue 2, and Comedy needs to be on the left of Disaster, we can place Disaster at the rightmost position.

### Final Sequence:
Combining all the clues, we get:
- Comedy (leftmost)
- Fantasy (middle)
- Time-Travel (second from the right)
- Disaster (rightmost)

So, the final order is:
- Comedy
- Fantasy
- Time-Travel
- Disaster

Lv2-1x4-10	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

We have four sports: parkour, skiing, volleyball, and weightlifting. The clues provided are:

1. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left.
2. The person who's sport is parkour is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person who's sport is volleyball.

From clue 1, we know:
- Position 1 must be volleyball.

From clue 2, we need to place parkour such that it is between weightlifting and volleyball. Since volleyball is already in position 1, parkour must be in position 2 or 3. However, if parkour were in position 3, there would not be enough space for weightlifting before it. Therefore, parkour must be in position 2.

This means:
- Position 1 is volleyball.
- Position 2 is parkour.

Now, weightlifting must be in position 3 because it needs to be before parkour (position 2).

This leaves weightlifting in position 3 and the only remaining sport, skiing, in position 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Volleyball
- Position 2: Parkour
- Position 3: Weightlifting
- Position 4: Skiing

Here is the final solution table:
