9. **Clue 9:** The person watching comedy movies is on the far left.

Let's fill in the table with the information we have so far:

|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4     |
|---------------|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy |          |            | Fantasy  |
| Music-Genre   |        |          |            | Techno   |
| Nationality   |        |          | Indonesian | Polish   |
| Transport     | Trike  | Bus       |            | Tram     |

From Clue 1:
- The Colombian (Col) is the fan of techno.
- So, we can place the Colombian in position 1 for Music-Genre.

From Clue 3:
- The Colombian is driving the bus.
- So, we can place the Colombian in position 1 for Transport.

From Clue 4:
- The person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the bus.
- Since the Colombian is in position 1 for Transport, the person driving the trike must be in position 2 for Transport.

From Clue 5:
- The fan of metal is on the left of the Canadian.
- Since the Colombian is in position 1 for Music-Genre, the fan of metal must be in position 2 for Music-Genre.
- The Canadian is on the far right (position 4), so the fan of metal must be in position 2 for Music-Genre.

From Clue 6:
- The person driving the tram is the person watching fantasy movies.
- So, we can place the person watching fantasy movies in position 3 for Movie-Genre.

From Clue 7:
- The fan of R&B is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.
- Since the person watching fantasy movies is in position 3 for Movie-Genre, the fan of R&B must be in position 2 for Music-Genre.
- The person watching mystery movies must be in position 4 for Movie-Genre.

From Clue 8:
- The Canadian is on the far right.
- So, the Canadian is in position 4 for Nationality.

From Clue 9:
- The person watching comedy movies is on the far left.
- So, the person watching comedy movies is in position 1 for Movie-Genre.

Now, let's update the table with all this information:

| Nationality   | Colombian | Polish  | Indonesian | Polish   |
| Transport     | Trike  | Bus       | Jet-ski    | Tram     |

However, there is an inconsistency because the Polish nationality appears twice. Let's correct it:

- The Indonesian is between the person watching fantasy movies and the person watching mystery movies.
- The person watching comedy movies is on the far left.

So, the correct table should be:

|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4     |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person whose hobby is cooking is on the far right.
- The owner of the bird is on the far right (conflict with Clue 2).

This means there must be an error or misinterpretation. Let's assume Clue 7 is correct and the owner of the bird is on the far right, and we will resolve the conflict later.

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the lizard is the person whose sport is lacrosse.

#### Clue 1:
- The person whose sport is water-polo is to the right of the person whose hobby is woodworking.

#### Clue 4:
- The person whose hobby is singing is to the right of the person whose hobby is drawing.

#### Clue 8:
- The person watching adventure movies is to the left of the person whose hobby is singing.

#### Clue 9:

### Solving the Table:

1. **Person 4 (far right)**:
   - From Clue 2 and Clue 7, let's assume the owner of the bird is Person 4.
   - Therefore, Person 4's sport is water-polo (from Clue 3).

2. **Person 3**:
   - From Clue 1, the person whose sport is water-polo (Person 4) is to the right of the person whose hobby is woodworking.
   - Thus, Person 3's hobby is woodworking.

3. **Person 2**:
   - From Clue 4, the person whose hobby is singing is to the right of the person whose hobby is drawing.
   - Therefore, Person 2's hobby is drawing.

4. **Person 1**:
   - From Clue 8, the person watching adventure movies is to the left of the person whose hobby is singing.
   - Therefore, Person 1's hobby is singing.

5. **Person 1's sport**:
   - From Clue 9, the person watching scientific movies is to the right of the owner of the dog.
   - Since Person 1's hobby is singing, Person 1 cannot be the one watching scientific movies.
   - Therefore, Person 1's sport is swimming.

6. **Person 2's sport**:
   - From Clue 5, the person watching western movies is between the owner of the frog and the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
   - Person 2's hobby is drawing, so they are not the one watching western movies.
   - Therefore, Person 2's sport is ice-hockey.

7. **Person 3's sport**:
   - From Clue 6, the person whose sport is water-polo (Person 4) is between the person watching western movies and the owner of the lizard.
   - Therefore, Person 3's sport is lacrosse.

8. **Person 3's pet**:
   - From Clue 3, the owner of the lizard is the person whose sport is lacrosse.
   - Therefore, Person 3 keeps the lizard.

9. **Person 2's pet**:
   - The owner of the frog is to the left of the person watching western movies.
   - Therefore, Person 2 keeps the frog.

10. **Person 1's pet**:
    - The owner of the dog is to the right of the person watching scientific movies.
    - Therefore, Person 1 keeps the dog.

11. **Person 4's pet**:
    - The owner of the bird is on the far right.
    - Therefore, Person 4 keeps the bird.

Lv2-4x4-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching disaster movies is on the far right.
2. **Clue 2:** The person watching scientific movies is the fisherman.
3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the bird is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left.
5. **Clue 5:** The person watching scientific movies is the owner of the frog.
6. **Clue 6:** The owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
7. **Clue 7:** The person watching disaster movies is the police-officer.
8. **Clue 8:** The person watching action movies is on the right of the person watching scientific movies.
9. **Clue 9:** The fisherman is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
10. **Clue 10:** The mechanic is between the owner of the bird and the teacher.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1:** From Clue 1, we know that the person watching disaster movies is in position 4.

**Step 2:** From Clue 2, the fisherman watches scientific movies. Therefore, the fisherman cannot be in position 4 (since the person in position 4 is the police-officer).

**Step 3:** From Clue 7, the police-officer watches disaster movies and is in position 4. So, the fisherman cannot be in position 4.

**Step 4:** From Clue 5, the fisherman owns the frog, and from Clue 2, the fisherman watches scientific movies. Therefore, the fisherman is not in position 4 (disaster) or position 3 (scientific).

**Step 5:** From Clue 6, the owner of the pony is in position 4. Since the police-officer is in position 4, the owner of the pony must be the police-officer. Thus, the police-officer watches disaster movies and owns the pony.

**Step 6:** From Clue 8, the person watching action movies is in position 3 because the person in position 4 (police-officer) is watching disaster movies.

**Step 7:** From Clue 2, the fisherman watches scientific movies and owns the frog. Since the fisherman is not in position 4 (police-officer), and he is not in position 3 (action), the fisherman must be in position 2 or 1.

**Step 8:** From Clue 9, the fisherman is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. If the fisherman is in position 1, then the person in position 2 must be the person whose sport is rugby.

**Step 9:** From Clue 4, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 1. Therefore, the fisherman must be in position 2.

**Step 10:** From Clue 3, the owner of the bird is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the fisherman is in position 2 and the person in position 1 is the one with ice-hockey, the owner of the bird must be in position 3.

**Step 11:** From Clue 6, the owner of the pony (police-officer) is in position 4.

**Step 12:** From Clue 10, the mechanic is between the owner of the bird and the teacher. Since the owner of the bird is in position 3 and the police-officer (owner of the pony) is in position 4, the mechanic must be in position 2, which contradicts the fisherman being in position 2. Therefore, the teacher must be in position 2, and the mechanic in position 3.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |    2    |      3       |       4        |

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv2-4x4-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 2**: The person whose sport is basketball is on the far left.
   - This means position 1 is occupied by someone whose sport is basketball.

2. **Clue 3**: The security-guard is the person eating garlic.
   - The security-guard eats garlic.

3. **Clue 4**: The security-guard is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
   - Since the security-guard (who eats garlic) is in position 2 or 3, the person who plays sailing must be in position 3 or 4.

4. **Clue 10**: The person watching romance movies is the person who's sport is sailing.
   - The person who plays sailing watches romance movies.

5. **Clue 5**: The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person eating peach.
   - This means the person watching scientific movies is in position 1, 2, or 3, and the person eating peach is to their right.

6. **Clue 6**: The person eating lemon is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.
   - If the person watching scientific movies is in position 2, then the person eating lemon must be in position 1. If they are in position 3, then the person eating lemon must be in position 2, and so on.

7. **Clue 7**: The social-worker is on the left of the person eating asparagus.
   - The social-worker is in position 1 or 2, and the person eating asparagus is to their right.

8. **Clue 8**: The lawyer is the person watching epic movies.
   - The lawyer watches epic movies.

9. **Clue 9**: The person eating lemon is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person watching adventure movies.
   - Let's denote the positions for clarity:
     - Position 1: Basketball
     - Position 2: Garlic (security-guard)
     - Position 3: Sailing (romance movies)
     - Position 4: Remaining

From Clue 5 and Clue 6, we can deduce that the person watching scientific movies cannot be in position 1 (because the person eating lemon would need to be in position 1, which is already taken by basketball). Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Since the person eating lemon is on the left of the person watching scientific movies, and considering the positions:

- If the person watching scientific movies is in position 3, the person eating lemon must be in position 2 (but position 2 is already taken by the security-guard).
- Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 4, and the person eating lemon must be in position 3.

Now let's summarize:

- Position 1: Basketball
- Position 2: Garlic (security-guard)
- Position 3: Lemon
- Position 4: Scientific movies (sailing)

Next, we need to place the remaining items:

- The social-worker is on the left of the person eating asparagus.
- The lawyer watches epic movies.

Given the positions:

- Position 1: Basketball (social-worker)
- Position 2: Garlic (security-guard)
- Position 3: Lemon
- Position 4: Scientific movies (sailing)

The only remaining food is peach, and it must be in position 4 (since position 4 is the only one left).

- Position 1: Peach
- Position 2: Garlic (security-guard)
- Position 3: Lemon
- Position 4: Scientific movies (sailing)

Finally, the remaining job is the lawyer, who watches epic movies, and the remaining genre is adventure.

- Position 1: Peach (social-worker)
- Position 2: Garlic (security-guard)
- Position 3: Lemon
- Position 4: Scientific movies (sailing, watching adventure movies)

Thus, the final solution is:

Lv2-4x4-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of folk is between the person who's sport is sailing and the fan of jazz.
2. **Clue 2:** The freelancer is between the fan of folk and the turkish.
3. **Clue 3:** The polish is between the person who's sport is cricket and the dutch.
4. **Clue 4:** The librarian is on the left of the dutch.
5. **Clue 5:** The polish is the polish (redundant, but confirms the nationality).
6. **Clue 6:** The dutch is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
7. **Clue 7:** The dutch is on the left of the analyst.
8. **Clue 8:** The fan of jazz is on the far right.
9. **Clue 9:** The fan of funk is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Fan of Funk and Jazz
- From Clue 9, the fan of funk is on the far left.
- From Clue 8, the fan of jazz is on the far right.

So, we can place:
```
|     |     |     |     |
| Funk|     |     | Jazz|
```

#### Step 2: Placing the Polish
- From Clue 5, the polish is the polish, so the polish must be in one of the positions.
- From Clue 3, the polish is between the person who's sport is cricket and the dutch.
- From Clue 6, the dutch is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
- From Clue 7, the dutch is on the left of the analyst.

Given these constraints, let's assume:
- The dutch cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- The analyst must be to the right of the dutch.

This means the dutch must be in position 2, and the analyst in position 3.

So, the layout becomes:
```
|     | Dutch| Analyst| Jazz |
| Funk|      |        |
```

#### Step 3: Placing the Polish
- The polish must be in position 1 (leftmost) or 4 (rightmost), but since the fan of funk is already in position 1, the polish must be in position 4.

So, the layout becomes:
```
| Polish| Dutch| Analyst| Jazz |
| Funk  |      |        |
```

#### Step 4: Placing the Freelancer
- From Clue 2, the freelancer is between the fan of folk and the turkish.
- From Clue 1, the fan of folk is between the person who's sport is sailing and the fan of jazz.

Since the fan of jazz is in position 4, the fan of folk must be in position 2, and the freelancer in position 3.

So, the layout becomes:
```
| Polish| Dutch| Freelancer| Jazz |
| Funk  | Folk |          |
```

#### Step 5: Placing the Librarian
- From Clue 4, the librarian is on the left of the dutch.
- This confirms the librarian is in position 1.

So, the layout becomes:
```
| Librarian| Dutch| Freelancer| Jazz |
| Funk     | Folk |          |
```

#### Step 6: Determining Sports and Jobs
- From Clue 3, the polish is between the person who's sport is cricket and the dutch.
- The dutch is in position 2, so the person with cricket must be in position 1.

So, the layout becomes:
```
| Polish| Dutch| Freelancer| Jazz |
| Cricket| Folk |          |
```

- The person with sailing must be in position 3 (Freelancer).

So, the layout becomes:
```
| Polish| Dutch| Sailing | Jazz |
| Cricket| Folk | Analyst |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Job           |     1     |     2      |    3     |     4     |

1. **Clue 4**: The fan of metal is the person driving the train.
2. **Clue 10**: The Dutch is the person driving the train.
   - From Clue 4 and Clue 10, we can conclude that the Dutch is the fan of metal and drives the train.

3. **Clue 2**: The person watching fantasy movies is the Dutch.
   - This contradicts Clue 10. Let's correct it to:
     - The Dutch is not the fan of metal or the one driving the train.
     - The Dutch watches fantasy movies.

4. **Clue 6**: The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person driving the bike.
   - Since the Dutch watches fantasy movies, the Dutch is on the left of the person driving the bike.

5. **Clue 7**: The Argentine is the person driving the airplane.
   - So, the Argentine is not the Dutch, as the Dutch watches fantasy movies.

6. **Clue 3**: The fan of dubstep is between the Dutch and the person driving the subway.
   - The Dutch is on the left of the person driving the bike, so the person driving the bike cannot be the Dutch.
   - Therefore, the Dutch must be between the fan of dubstep and the person driving the subway.
   - The person driving the bike is not the Dutch, so the person driving the bike must be either the fan of dubstep or the person driving the subway.

7. **Clue 5**: The Russian is on the left of the person watching zombie movies.
   - The Russian is not the Dutch, and the Dutch is the fan of fantasy movies.

8. **Clue 9**: The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
   - The Dutch is the fan of fantasy movies, so the person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the Dutch.

9. **Clue 8**: The fan of soul is on the far right.
   - The fan of soul is in position 4.

### Positioning Based on Clues:

- **Position 4 (far right)**: Fan of soul.
- **Position 3**: The person watching time-travel movies (since the Dutch is on the right of this person).
- **Position 2**: The Dutch (watching fantasy movies).
- **Position 1**: The person watching time-travel movies.

Now, let's assign the remaining information:

- **Dutch (Position 2)**: Watches fantasy movies.
- **Russian (left of the person watching zombie movies)**: The Russian must be in Position 1 or 3.
- **Argentine (driving the airplane)**: Not the Dutch, so must be in Position 1 or 3.
- **Train driver (Position 4)**: Must be the Dutch (from Clue 10), but since the Dutch is in Position 2, the train driver is not the Dutch. It must be someone else who drives the train (clue 4).

Since the Dutch is the fan of fantasy movies, and the person driving the train is not the Dutch, the train driver must be someone else. Let's consider the remaining positions for the train driver:

- **Subway driver (Position 3)**: Must be the fan of dubstep.
- **Bike driver (Position 2)**: Must be the Dutch.
- **Train driver (Position 4)**: Must be the fan of metal.
- **Airplane driver (Position 1)**: Must be the Argentine.

Lv2-4x4-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating lettuce is the fisherman.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating tomato is the person who's sport is parkour.
3. **Clue 3**: The fisherman is the person who's sport is handball (from Clues 1 and 3).
4. **Clue 4**: The person eating spinach is on the right of the person eating tomato.
5. **Clue 5**: The fan of metal is the person eating grapefruit.
6. **Clue 6**: The fan of indie is on the far left.
7. **Clue 7**: The designer is on the left of the fisherman.
8. **Clue 8**: The fan of house is on the far right.
9. **Clue 9**: The accountant is between the social-worker and the person who's sport is cycling.
10. **Clue 10**: The person eating tomato is on the left of the person eating spinach.

Now let's organize the information:

- **Far left**: The fan of indie (Clue 6)
- **Far right**: The fan of house (Clue 8)

From Clue 1, the fisherman eats lettuce and does handball (Clue 3). Since the fisherman is on the right of the social-worker and the designer (Clue 7), and considering Clue 10, the fisherman must be in position 4.

From Clue 2, the person eating tomato does parkour. From Clue 4, the person eating spinach is to the right of the person eating tomato. Therefore, the person eating tomato is in position 1, and the person eating spinach is in position 2.

From Clue 5, the fan of metal is the person eating grapefruit. Since the fan of indie is on the far left, the fan of metal cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the fan of metal must be in position 3.

From Clue 9, the accountant is between the social-worker and the person who's sport is cycling. Given the positions, the accountant can only be in position 2 or 3. But since position 3 is occupied by the fan of metal, the accountant must be in position 2, and the social-worker must be in position 1. This means the person eating tomato (Clue 2) is the social-worker, and the person eating spinach (Clue 4) is the accountant.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Social-worker (tomato)
- Position 2: Accountant (spinach)
- Position 3: Fan of metal (grapefruit)
- Position 4: Fisherman (lettuce, handball)

Finally, from Clue 10, the person eating tomato (social-worker) is on the left of the person eating spinach (accountant).

Let's fill in the table:
