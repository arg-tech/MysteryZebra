Lv2-6x5-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will organize the given clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 11**: The librarian is the person driving the helicopter.
   - Transport: Helicopter -> Librarian

2. **Clue 10**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in the middle (position 3).
   - Hobby: Rock-climbing -> Position 3

3. **Clue 16**: The fan of rock is on the left of the person driving the tram.
   - Since rock-climbing is in position 3, the fan of rock must be in position 2 or 1.
   - Clue 15: The fan of rock is on the left of the owner of the goat.
     - If rock is in position 2, goat must be in position 4 or 5.
     - If rock is in position 1, goat must be in position 3, but that conflicts with rock-climbing being in position 3.
   - Therefore, rock is in position 2, and goat is in position 4.
   - Transport: Tram -> Position 3 (rock-climbing)
   - Pet: Goat -> Position 4

4. **Clue 14**: The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
   - Fishing is in position 3, so collecting must be in position 1 or 2.

15. **Clue 18**: The person drinking milk is on the far right.
    - Beverage: Milk -> Position 5 (social-worker is already in position 5)

Lv2-6x5-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6**: The Canadian is driving the taxi.
2. **Clue 7**: The dressmaker is driving the train.
3. **Clue 1**: The Canadian is on the right of the manager.
4. **Clue 11**: The manager is drinking iced-tea.
5. **Clue 15**: The person who's sport is biathlon is in the middle (position 3).
6. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
   - Therefore, the person with biathlon is in position 2, and the Canadian (driving the taxi) is in position 5.
7. **Clue 13**: The person who's sport is biathlon is in the middle (position 3), which contradicts the previous placement. This must be re-evaluated.
8. **Clue 16**: The dressmaker is Polish.
9. **Clue 17**: The Canadian is the entrepreneur.
10. **Clue 10**: The entrepreneur is on the left of the person driving the van.
    - Since the Canadian (entrepreneur) is in position 5, the person driving the van must be in position 4.
11. **Clue 9**: The person drinking iced-tea is the manager.
12. **Clue 11**: The manager is drinking iced-tea, so the manager is in position 1.
13. **Clue 12**: The owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the turtle.
14. **Clue 5**: The manager is the owner of the mouse.
15. **Clue 14**: The person drinking milk is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.

21. **Clue 1**: The Canadian is on the right of the manager.
22. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
    - Re-evaluating, since the Canadian is in position 5 and the person with biathlon is in position 3, the person with biathlon cannot be the Canadian.

### Final Placement:

1. **Position 1**: Manager (drinking iced-tea)
2. **Position 2**: Biathlon
3. **Position 3**: Handball (Spanish is between Handball and Malaysian)
4. **Position 4**: Van (entrepreneur is on the left of the person driving the van)
5. **Position 5**: Canadian (driving the taxi)

### Re-evaluation for Consistency:
- The Canadian (entrepreneur) is in position 5.
- The person with biathlon is in position 3.
- The person with handball is in position 2 (Spanish is between Handball and Malaysian).
- The manager is in position 1 (drinking iced-tea).

Now let's assign the remaining roles and sports:

17. **Clue 17**: The analyst is in the middle.
18. **Clue 18**: The fan of dubstep is on the left of the security-guard.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1 & 7**: Peach is eaten by Social-Worker, so Social-Worker is at position 1.
2. **Clue 2 & 8**: Snowboarding is the sport of the ferret owner, and the person watching zombie movies has snowboarding as their sport. So, the person watching zombie movies is also the ferret owner and is at position 5.
3. **Clue 10**: The person watching zombie movies (ferret owner) is on the right of the analyst, so the analyst is at position 4.
4. **Clue 3**: The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the architect, and since the analyst is at position 4, the person watching martial-arts must be at position 3 (because the architect cannot be at position 2 or 1).
5. **Clue 4**: The analyst (at position 4) is on the right of the bird owner, so the bird owner is at position 3 (same as the martial-arts watcher).
6. **Clue 5**: The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of pop. Let's place these accordingly.
7. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person watching romance movies. The person watching romance movies is not at position 5 (zombie), so they could be at position 2 or 3. Since the tennis person is on the right, let's try position 3 for romance and 4 for tennis.
8. **Clue 11**: The person eating lettuce is between the fan of pop and the person who's sport is golf. This means the person eating lettuce is at position 3 (since the fan of pop and the person who's sport is golf must be at positions 2 and 4 or 4 and 2).
9. **Clue 12**: The person watching spy movies is between the owner of the goat and the owner of the hedgehog. This means the spy watcher is at position 3 (since the goat and hedgehog owners are at positions 2 and 4 or 4 and 2).
10. **Clue 13 & 14**: The fan of punk is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing, and the person eating radish is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing. This means the person eating radish is at position 3 (since the person who's sport is skiing is at position 4 or 5).
