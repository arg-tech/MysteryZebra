Lv2-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The fan of soul is on the left of the owner of the goat.
2. The pakistani is on the left of the fan of soul.
3. The person eating raspberry is the pakistani.
4. The person eating kale is the japanese.
5. The owner of the frog is between the fan of gospel and the person eating tomato.
6. The person eating tomato is the owner of the goat.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Pakistani
From clue 3, the person eating raspberry is the pakistani.
So, the pakistani eats raspberry.

#### Step 2: Determine the Japanese
From clue 4, the person eating kale is the japanese.
So, the japanese eats kale.

#### Step 3: Determine the Goat Owner
From clue 6, the person eating tomato is the owner of the goat.
So, the goat owner eats tomato.

#### Step 4: Determine the Soul Fan and Goat Owner Position
From clue 1, the fan of soul is on the left of the owner of the goat.
From clue 2, the pakistani is on the left of the fan of soul.
From clue 6, the goat owner eats tomato.
Combining these, we can infer that the pakistani cannot be the fan of soul or the goat owner because they would violate the order (pakistani is on the left of the fan of soul, and the goat owner eats tomato).

Thus, the pakistani must be in position 1 (leftmost), and the fan of soul must be in position 2.
So, the pakistani eats raspberry, and the fan of soul eats something other than kale, tomato, or raspberry (must be blues or gospel).

#### Step 5: Determine the Remaining Foods and Music Genres
Since the pakistani is in position 1, the fan of soul is in position 2, and the goat owner is in position 3, we need to place the remaining foods and music genres.

- The pakistani eats raspberry.
- The fan of soul (position 2) cannot eat kale, tomato, or raspberry. So, it must be either blues or gospel.
- The goat owner (position 3) eats tomato.
- The remaining food for the first position is either kale or tomato (but since the pakistani already eats tomato, it must be kale).

So, the pakistani in position 1 eats kale, the fan of soul in position 2 eats either blues or gospel, and the goat owner in position 3 eats tomato.

#### Step 6: Determine the Remaining Music Genres
- Since the pakistani is in position 1, the fan of soul is in position 2, and the goat owner is in position 3, the only remaining music genre for the pakistani is gospel (since the fan of soul is on the left of the goat owner, and the pakistani is on the left of the fan of soul).
- Therefore, the fan of soul in position 2 must be the blues fan.

#### Final Table:
|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
| Food          | kale       |          | tomato    |
| Music-Genre   | gospel     | blues    |           |
| Nationality   | pakistani  |          |           |
| Pet           | frog       | goat     | guinea-pig |

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:
- The pakistani in position 1 eats kale and is the owner of the frog.
- The fan of soul in position 2 eats blues and owns the goat.
- The goat owner in position 3 eats tomato and owns the guinea-pig.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
| Food          | kale       |          | tomato    |
| Music-Genre   | gospel     | blues    |           |

Lv2-4x3-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The bartender is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
2. The owner of the chinchilla is between the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies.
3. The person eating eggplant is on the far left.
4. The owner of the goldfish is the person eating kale.
5. The owner of the chinchilla is the person watching mystery movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions based on the given clues.

1. **Clue 3**: The person eating eggplant is on the far left.
   - So, position 1 (far left) must be ""eggplant"".

2. **Clue 4**: The owner of the goldfish is the person eating kale.
   - So, the person in position 3 (far right) must be eating kale and owning a goldfish.

3. **Clue 5**: The owner of the chinchilla is the person watching mystery movies.
   - So, the person in position 2 must be watching mystery movies and owning a chinchilla.

Now we have:
```
| Food          | Job          | Movie-Genre | Pet           |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| eggplant      |              |             |               |
| ?             |              | mystery     | chinchilla    |
| kale          |              |             | goldfish      |
```

4. **Clue 1**: The bartender is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
   - Since the person watching mystery movies is in position 2, the bartender must be in position 1 or 2. But since position 1 is already taken by the person eating eggplant, the bartender must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 2**: The owner of the chinchilla is between the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies.
   - We know the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2 and is watching mystery movies. Therefore, the paramedic must be in position 3 (since the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3).

So, we now have:
```
| Food          | Job          | Movie-Genre | Pet           |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| eggplant      | bartender    |             |               |
| bartender     | paramedic    | mystery     | chinchilla    |
| kale          |              |             | goldfish      |
```

6. **Determine the remaining job for position 1**:
   - Position 1 is already filled with ""eggplant"" and ""bartender"".
   - Position 2 is ""paramedic"" and watching ""mystery"".
   - Position 3 is ""kale"" and has a ""goldfish"".

Therefore, the only job left is ""doctor"", which must be in position 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
```
| Food          | Job          | Movie-Genre | Pet           |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| eggplant      | doctor       |             |               |
| bartender     | paramedic    | mystery     | chinchilla    |
| kale          |             |             | goldfish      |
```

7. **Determine the movie genre for each person**:
   - The person in position 1 (eating eggplant) cannot watch thriller movies because the bartender (position 2) is to the right of them and is watching thriller movies.
   - The person in position 2 (watching mystery) cannot watch disaster movies because they own the chinchilla.
   - Therefore, the person in position 3 (watching thriller) must be the one who is not watching mystery or disaster, so it must be watching thriller movies.

So, the final solution is:
```
| Food          | Job          | Movie-Genre | Pet           |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| eggplant      | doctor       | disaster    |               |
| bartender     | paramedic    | mystery     | chinchilla    |
| kale          |             | thriller    | goldfish      |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Food          | Job          | Movie-Genre | Pet           |

| eggplant      | doctor       | disaster    |               |
| bartender     | paramedic    | mystery     | chinchilla    |

Lv2-4x3-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person whose sport is rowing is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
2. The person eating cucumber is on the right of the scientist.
3. The person eating raspberry is between the paramedic and the owner of the cat.
4. The person eating cucumber is the person who's sport is rugby.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4:
- The person eating cucumber is the person who's sport is rugby.
- This means rowing and rugby cannot be in the same column for any person.

#### Clue 2:
- The person eating cucumber is on the right of the scientist.
- This means the scientist must be in one of the first two columns (since cucumber is in the third column).

#### Clue 3:
- The person eating raspberry is between the paramedic and the owner of the cat.
- This means the paramedic and the owner of the cat must be on either side of the person eating raspberry.

#### Clue 1:
- The person whose sport is rowing is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
- This means the owner of the chinchilla must be in one of the first two columns (since rowing is in the third column).

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues.

### Initial Setup:
|         |      1       |     2      |     3      |
| Food    |              |            |            |
| Job     |              |            |            |
| Pet     |              |            |            |
| Sport   |              |            | Rugby     |

Since the person eating cucumber is on the right of the scientist, and cucumber is in the third column, the scientist must be in the first or second column. Let's denote the scientist as S1 or S2.

Since the person eating raspberry is between the paramedic and the owner of the cat, the paramedic and the owner of the cat must be on either side of the person eating raspberry. Let's denote the paramedic as P and the owner of the cat as C.

The person whose sport is rowing is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the first or second column. Let's denote the owner of the chinchilla as Ch1 or Ch2.

### Assigning Values:
1. **Cucumber and Rugby:**
   - Cucumber is in column 3.
   - Rugby is in column 3.
   - Scientist is in column 1 or 2.

2. **Raspberry:**
   - Raspberry is between the paramedic and the owner of the cat.
   - Paramedic and the owner of the cat are on either side of the raspberry.

3. **Rowing and Chinchilla:**
   - Rowing is in column 3.
   - Owner of the chinchilla is in column 1 or 2.

Given the constraints, let's assign values:

- Scientist in column 1: S1
- Paramedic in column 2: P2
- Owner of the cat in column 3: C3
- Chinchilla in column 1 or 2: Ch1 or Ch2

Since rowing is in column 3 and the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of it, the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 1.

So, we have:
- Ch1 in column 1
- S1 in column 1
- P2 in column 2
- C3 in column 3

### Final Table:

Lv2-4x3-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The owner of the horse is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.**
   - This means if the person with the hobby of sudoku is in column 1 or 2, the owner of the horse must be in column 2 or 3 respectively.

2. **The person eating pumpkin is the person who's hobby is filmmaking.**
   - Pumpkin is eaten by the person whose hobby is filmmaking.

3. **The fan of country is between the person eating pineapple and the owner of the horse.**
   - This means the fan of country is in the middle (column 2) when the person eating pineapple and the owner of the horse are on either side.

4. **The fan of d&b is on the far right.**
   - D&b is the music genre for the person in column 3.

5. **The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the fish.**
   - This means if the owner of the fish is in column 1, the person eating cauliflower is in column 2; if the owner of the fish is in column 2, the person eating cauliflower is in column 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Music Genre:**
   - From clue 4, the person in column 3 prefers d&b.
   - So, we can fill in the third column:
     ```
     |               |     1     |      2      |     3      |
     | Food          |           |             |            |

     | Pet           |           |             |            |

   - Filmmaker: Pumpkin
   - Sudoku: Column 1 or 2
   - Country Fan: Middle (Column 2)

3. **Determine the Pets and Foods:**
   - From clue 5, the person eating cauliflower is to the right of the owner of the fish.
   - From clue 3, the fan of country is between the person eating pineapple and the owner of the horse.

   Let's start placing these:
   - Since the fan of country is in column 2, and it is between the person eating pineapple and the owner of the horse, we need to place the horse owner and the person eating pineapple accordingly.
   - The person eating cauliflower must be in column 2 or 3, but since the horse owner is to the right of the person with the hobby of sudoku, and the fan of country is in column 2, the horse owner must be in column 3, and the person eating cauliflower must be in column 2.

   So, we can place:
   - Sudoku: Column 1
   - Horse Owner: Column 3
   - Fan of Country: Column 2
   - Person Eating Pineapple: Column 1 (since the horse owner is in column 3)

   Now we have:
     ```

1. **Clue 4:** The person driving the car is on the far right.
   - This means the person driving the car is in position 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is fishing is between the person eating radish and the person driving the car.
   - Since the person driving the car is in position 3, the person whose hobby is fishing must be in position 2 (because they are between the person eating radish and the person driving the car).
   - Therefore, the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 2.

3. **Clue 5:** The person whose hobby is fishing is between the person whose hobby is skydiving and the person watching comedy movies.
   - We know the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 2.

   - However, we already know from Clue 4 that the person watching comedy movies is in position 3.
   - So, the person with the hobby of skydiving must be in position 1, and the person watching comedy movies is in position 3.

4. **Clue 1:** The person driving the roller is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.
   - The person watching comedy movies is in position 3.
   - The person driving the roller must be in position 3 or to the right of position 3, but since position 3 is taken by the person watching comedy movies, the person driving the roller must also be in position 3.

5. **Clue 3:** The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person eating peach.
   - Since the person watching comedy movies is in position 3, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 2 or 3. But since position 3 is taken by the person watching comedy movies, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person eating peach must be in position 1.

6. **Assigning the remaining elements:**
   - The person eating artichoke must be in position 3 (since peach is in position 1 and radish is in position 2).

Now, let's assign the food, hobbies, movie genres, and transport to each position:

- **Position 1:**
  - Eating Peach
  - Hobby: Skydiving
  - Movie Genre: Fantasy
  - Transport: Car

- **Position 2:**
  - Eating Radish
  - Hobby: Fishing
  - Movie Genre: Comedy
  - Transport: Roller

- **Position 3:**
  - Eating Artichoke
  - Hobby: Skydiving (repeated, but this is the person watching comedy movies)
  - Movie Genre: Comedy
  - Transport: Car (repeated, but this is the person driving the roller)

Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |    2    |     3     |
| Food          | Peach       | Radish  | Artichoke |

Lv2-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **The journalist is on the far left**:
   - Journalist is in position 1.

2. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the fan of gospel**:
   - If the fan of gospel is in position 2 or 3, then the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 3.

3. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess**:
   - This means the person with the hobby of chess cannot be in position 1 (because the journalist is there) and cannot be in position 2 (because the person drinking soy-milk is to its left). Therefore, the person with the hobby of chess must be in position 3, and the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2.

4. **The architect is between the person who's hobby is cooking and the person drinking water**:
   - This means the architect cannot be in position 1 or 3 because they would not have neighbors. So, the architect must be in position 2, which is occupied by the person drinking soy-milk. This creates a contradiction unless we re-evaluate. Given the previous clue, the architect must be in position 2, and the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1.

5. **The person drinking soy-milk is the fan of rock**:
   - This confirms that the person in position 1 is both drinking soy-milk and listening to rock music.

Given these constraints, let's assign the positions:

- Position 1: The person drinking soy-milk and listening to rock.
- Position 2: The architect.
- Position 3: The person with the hobby of chess, drinking water.

Now, let's fill in the remaining details based on the given information:

- Since the journalist is in position 1, the person in position 1 is the journalist.
- The person in position 2 is the architect.
- The person in position 3 is the person with the hobby of chess, drinking water.

Finally, we need to match the remaining details for each column:

- **Beverage**: Soy-milk (position 1), Water (position 3)
- **Hobby**: Chess (position 3), Cooking (must be in position 2 since the architect is in position 2)
- **Job**: Architect (position 2), Journalist (position 1), and the remaining job is the journalist.
- **Music-Genre**: Rock (position 1), Gospel (must be in position 3 since the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the fan of gospel).

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |     1      |       2       |     3      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk   | Water         |            |
| Hobby         | Chess      | Cooking       | Rock      |
| Job           | Journalist | Architect     |           |
| Music-Genre   | Rock       | Gospel        | Folk      |
```

Note: The last job (journalist) and the last music genre (folk) are determined by elimination."
Lv2-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the taxi is between the nigerian and the russian.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking 7up is on the far left.
4. **Clue 4**: The person eating papaya is on the far left.
5. **Clue 5**: The indian is on the left of the person driving the bike.
6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the bike is the nigerian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3 & 4:
- From Clue 3: The person drinking 7up is on the far left.
- From Clue 4: The person eating papaya is on the far left.
  - This creates a conflict because there can only be one person on the far left. Hence, the person eating papaya must be the one drinking 7up.
  - Therefore, **Person 1** drinks 7up and eats papaya.

#### Clue 6:
- From Clue 6: The person driving the bike is the nigerian.
  - So, **Person 3** drives the bike and is the nigerian.

#### Clue 5:
- From Clue 5: The indian is on the left of the person driving the bike (nigerian).
  - Since Person 3 is the nigerian and drives the bike, **Person 1** must be the indian.

#### Clue 1:
- From Clue 1: The person driving the taxi is between the nigerian and the russian.
  - Since Person 3 (nigerian) is on the far right, the person driving the taxi must be Person 2.
  - Therefore, **Person 2** drives the taxi and is the russian.

#### Clue 2:
- From Clue 2: The person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
  - We know from Clue 3 that **Person 1** drinks 7up and eats papaya.
  - The remaining beverages are almond-milk and cola, and the remaining foods are carrot and peas.
  - Since **Person 2** is the russian and drives the taxi, and **Person 3** is the nigerian and drives the bike, we need to determine what **Person 1** is eating.
  - Given that **Person 2** (russian) is not eating peas (as **Person 1** eats papaya), and **Person 3** (nigerian) is also not eating peas, **Person 1** must be eating peas.
  - Therefore, **Person 2** must be drinking almond-milk and eating carrot (the remaining food).

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |    3     |
| Beverage      |    7up   | almond-milk |    cola  |
| Food          |  papaya  |   carrot    |   peas   |
| Nationality   |   indian |    russian  |  nigerian|
| Transport     |    bike  |    taxi     | airplane |
```

#### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |      2      |    3     |
| Beverage      |    7up   | almond-milk |    cola  |
| Food          |  papaya  |   carrot    |   peas   |
| Nationality   |   indian |    russian  |  nigerian|
