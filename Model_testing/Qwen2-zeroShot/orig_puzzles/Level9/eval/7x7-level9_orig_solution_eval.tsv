Lv9-7x7-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct information into the table. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Position Clues:
1. The person driving the motorbike is not the fan of gospel (Clue 1).
2. The person driving the motorbike is somewhere between the Italian and the person driving the van (Clue 2).

5. The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball (Clue 32).
6. The person driving the train is in the middle (Clue 46).

From these clues, we can infer that:
- The person driving the tram is in the 4th position (since it must be in the middle if there are 7 positions).
- The person driving the motorbike is between the Italian and the person driving the van.
- The person driving the van cannot be in the 1st or 7th position because the motorbike driver must be between them.

Given the constraints, let's assume:
- The Italian is in the 2nd position.
- The person driving the van is in the 5th position.
- The motorbike driver is in the 3rd position.

#### 2. Food Clues:
