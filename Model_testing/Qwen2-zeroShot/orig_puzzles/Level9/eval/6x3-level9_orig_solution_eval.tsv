12. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
13. The fan of metal is not to the left of the person driving the scooter.

### Step 2: Deduce Positions
1. From clue 10, the scooter (S) must be in position 1 or 2, and the subway (Sub) must be in position 3.
2. From clue 9, the person driving the scooter (S) is on the left of the person driving the subway (Sub), so S must be in position 1 and Sub in position 3.
3. From clue 4, the person driving the subway (Sub) is the person whose hobby is writing (W).
4. Therefore, the hobby of W is in position 3, and Sub is in position 3.
5. From clue 11, the fan of metal (M) and the person eating carrot (C) have the same parity positions. Since Sub is in position 3, M and C must be in even positions (2 or 4).
6. From clue 12, the person eating carrot (C) is to the left of the person whose hobby is writing (W). Since W is in position 3, C must be in position 1 or 2.
7. From clue 13, the fan of metal (M) is not to the left of the person driving the scooter (S). Since S is in position 1, M must be in position 2.
8. From clue 11, the fan of metal (M) is in position 2 and the person eating carrot (C) is in position 1.
9. From clue 1, the person driving the scooter (S) is in position 1, and the person eating pumpkin (P) must be in position 2 or 3. But since P is to the right of S, P must be in position 2.
10. From clue 2, the person drinking sprite (Sp) is on the right of the person whose hobby is cooking (Co). Since Co cannot be in position 1 or 2 (as they are taken by S and P), Co must be in position 3.
11. From clue 7, the person drinking sprite (Sp) is to the right of the person drinking lemonade (Lm). Since Co is in position 3, Sp must be in position 3, and Lm must be in position 1 or 2. But since S is in position 1 and P is in position 2, Lm must be in position 2.
12. From clue 6, the person drinking lemonade (Lm) is not to the left of the person driving the scooter (S). This is already satisfied.
13. From clue 3, the fan of classical (Cl) and the lawyer (Lw) have the same parity positions. Since W is in position 3, Cl and Lw must be in position 1 or 3. Since S is in position 1 and P is in position 2, Cl and Lw must be in position 3.
14. From clue 5, the fan of classical (Cl) is not to the left of the lawyer (Lw). So, Cl must be in position 1 and Lw must be in position 3.
15. From clue 9, the person eating pumpkin (P) is not to the left of the coach (Ch). Since S is in position 1 and P is in position 2, Ch must be in position 3.
16. From clue 12, the person eating carrot (C) is to the left of the person whose hobby is writing (W). This is already satisfied.
17. From clue 8, the person eating pumpkin (P) is not to the left of the coach (Ch). This is already satisfied.
18. From clue 1, the person driving the scooter (S) is in position 1, and the person eating pumpkin (P) is in position 2.

23. From clue 11, the fan of metal (M) is in position 2, and the person eating carrot (C) is in position 1.
24. From clue 12, the person eating carrot (C) is in position 1, and the person whose hobby is writing (W) is in position 3.
25. From clue 13, the fan of metal (M) is in position 2, and the person whose hobby is writing (W) is in position 3.

Lv9-6x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Summary:
1. The person watching drama movies is between the person driving the airplane and the fan of blues.
2. The person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the person drinking juice.
3. The fan of metal is not to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.

13. The fan of blues is to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
14. The person with board-games as a hobby is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of Hobbies and Transport
- From clue 4, the person driving the subway is in an even position (2).
- From clue 10, the person driving the airplane is to the left of the person watching drama movies.
- From clue 9, the person with skydiving as a hobby is not to the left of the person driving the subway. Since the subway driver is at position 2, the skydiver can only be in position 3.
- From clue 14, the person with board-games as a hobby is on the far left or far right. This leaves positions 1 and 3 for board-games.
- From clue 6, the Polish person has singing as a hobby and is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since the skydiver is in position 3, the singer must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
Hobby: 1 - Singing (Polish)
       2 - ?
       3 - Skydiving
```

#### Step 2: Transport and Drama Movies
- From clue 10, the person driving the airplane is to the left of the person watching drama movies.
- From clue 1, the person watching drama movies is between the person driving the airplane and the fan of blues.
- From clue 13, the fan of blues is to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
- From clue 3, the fan of metal is not to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
- From clue 2, the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the person drinking juice.
- From clue 11, the person drinking almond-milk is not to the right of the person watching crime movies.
- From clue 8, the fan of salsa is to the left of the fan of blues.
- From clue 5, the Polish person is to the left of the person drinking juice.
- From clue 12, the Thai and the person driving the tram have different parity positions.

Given these constraints, let's fill in the positions:
```
Transport: 1 - Airplane
           2 - Subway
           3 - Tram
```
Since the drama watcher is between the airplane and the blues fan, and the blues fan is to the right of the time-travel movie watcher, the only logical order is:
```
Movie-Genre: 1 - Time-travel
             2 - Drama
             3 - Blues
```

#### Step 3: Filling in the Remaining Positions
- From clue 1, the drama watcher (position 2) is between the airplane (position 1) and the blues fan (position 3).
- From clue 2, the almond-milk drinker is to the right of the juice drinker.
- From clue 11, the almond-milk drinker is not to the right of the crime movie watcher, so the crime movie watcher must be in position 1.
- From clue 5, the Polish person is to the left of the juice drinker, so the Polish person is in position 1, and the juice drinker is in position 3.
- From clue 6, the Polish person is the singer.
- From clue 8, the salsa fan is to the left of the blues fan, so the salsa fan is in position 1.
- From clue 3, the metal fan is not to the right of the time-travel movie watcher, so the metal fan is in position 1.
- From clue 12, the Thai and the tram driver have different parity positions. Since the tram driver is in position 3, the Thai must be in position 1.
- From clue 7, the skydiver is in position 3.
- From clue 14, the board-games person is on the far left or far right. Since the board-games person cannot be in position 3 (skydiver), they must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
Beverage: 1 - Almond-milk
          2 - Fanta
          3 - Juice
```

#### Final Table:
```
|               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Fanta     | Juice       |

| Transport     | Airplane   | Subway    | Tram        |
```

Lv9-6x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Constraint 4:** The Italian is the librarian.
   - Nationality: Italian -> Job: Librarian

2. **Constraint 12:** The Italian is not to the left of the French.
   - This means the Italian must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **Constraint 1:** The French is not to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
   - This means the French cannot be in position 1.

4. **Constraint 9:** The Italian is on the right of the fan country.
   - This means the fan country must be in position 1 or 2, and the Italian must be in position 2 or 3.

Given that the Italian is the librarian (from Constraint 4) and the Italian must be in position 2 or 3 (from Constraints 1 and 12), the fan country must be in position 1.

So far:

```

5. **Constraint 5:** The person drinking Mirinda and the fan country have the same parity positions.
   - The fan country is in position 1, which is odd, so the person drinking Mirinda must also be in an odd position (1 or 3).

6. **Constraint 2:** The person whose sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person drinking Mirinda.
   - If the person drinking Mirinda is in position 3, then the person whose sport is skateboarding must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the fan country is in position 1 and the person drinking Mirinda must be in an odd position, the person drinking Mirinda must be in position 3. Therefore, the person whose sport is skateboarding must be in position 1.

So far:
```
|               |       1       |    2     |     3     |

7. **Constraint 6:** The dressmaker and the person whose sport is skateboarding have the same parity positions.
   - The person whose sport is skateboarding is in position 1, which is odd, so the dressmaker must also be in an odd position (1 or 3). Since position 1 is already taken by the person whose sport is skateboarding, the dressmaker must be in position 3.

So far:

Lv9-6x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each attribute (beverage, job, movie genre, music genre, pet, and sport) into the corresponding columns for each person (1, 2, and 3) based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the person watching adventure movies.**
2. **The owner of the cat is on the left of the nurse.**
3. **The owner of the rabbit is the owner of the rabbit.** (This is redundant and can be ignored.)
4. **The dancer is somewhere between the fan disco and the person who's sport is cycling.**
5. **The fan ambient is not to the left of the fan rock.**
6. **The person watching disaster movies is not the person drinking soy-milk.**
7. **The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.**
8. **The owner of the rabbit is the fan rock.**
9. **The dancer is not the fan disco.**
10. **The person who's sport is surfing is the person drinking sprite.**
11. **The person watching disaster movies and the fan disco have the same parity positions.**
12. **The person drinking sprite and the fan disco have the same parity positions.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From clue 8:**
   - The owner of the rabbit is the fan rock.
   - Therefore, column 3 has ""rabbit"" and ""fan rock"".

2. **From clue 10:**
   - The person who's sport is surfing is the person drinking sprite.
   - Therefore, column 3 has ""sport: surfing"" and ""beverage: sprite"".

3. **From clue 12:**
   - The person drinking sprite and the fan disco have the same parity positions.
   - Since column 3 already has ""sprite"", it must be ""fan disco"".
   - Therefore, column 3 has ""sport: surfing"" and ""beverage: sprite"" and ""music genre: disco"".

4. **From clue 6:**
   - The person watching disaster movies is not the person drinking soy-milk.
   - Since column 3 already has ""sprite"" (which is not soy-milk), the person drinking soy-milk must be in column 1 or 2.

5. **From clue 7:**
   - The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - Since column 3 already has ""sprite"" (not soy-milk), the person drinking soy-milk must be in column 1 or 2.
   - Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk must be in column 1 and the person watching mystery movies must be in column 2 or 3.

6. **From clue 11:**
   - The person watching disaster movies and the fan disco have the same parity positions.
   - Since column 3 is even (disco), the person watching disaster movies must be in an even position (column 2).

7. **From clue 4:**
   - The dancer is somewhere between the fan disco and the person who's sport is cycling.
   - Since column 3 is ""disco"" and column 2 is even, the dancer must be in column 1.

8. **From clue 2:**
   - The owner of the cat is on the left of the nurse.
   - Since the dancer is in column 1, the owner of the cat must be in column 1 and the nurse must be in column 2 or 3.

9. **From clue 5:**
   - The fan ambient is not to the left of the fan rock.
   - Since column 3 is ""rock"", the fan ambient cannot be in column 1 or 2.

10. **From clue 1:**
    - The owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the person watching adventure movies.
    - Since the owner of the rabbit is in column 3, the person watching adventure movies must be in column 2.

11. **From clue 9:**
    - The dancer is not the fan disco.
    - Since the dancer is in column 1 and the fan disco is in column 3, the fan ambient must be in column 2.

```
|               |     1     |    2     |    3     |
