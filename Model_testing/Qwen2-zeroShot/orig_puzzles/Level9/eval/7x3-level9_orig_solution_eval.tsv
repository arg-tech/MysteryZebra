Lv9-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the given clues and constraints.

1. The person driving the car and the person drinking milk have different parity positions.
2. The person eating corn is not to the right of the fan of rock.
3. The person drinking milk is not to the right of the fan of d&b.
4. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far right.
5. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake.
6. The owner of the bird is on the left or right of the turkish.
7. The malaysian is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
8. The turkish is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi.
9. The australian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
10. The person who's sport is parkour is in an even position.
11. The person who's sport is sailing is not to the right of the fan of classical.
12. The person eating mango is on the left or right of the owner of the snake.

### Step 2: Deduce from the clues.

1. From clue 4, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3 (the far right).
2. From clue 10, the person who's sport is parkour must be in an even position (positions 2 or 4).

### Step 3: Fill in the positions based on the above deductions.

|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |            |           | almond-milk |
| Food          |            |           |             |
| Music-Genre   |            |           |             |
| Nationality   |            |           |             |
| Pet           |            |           |             |
| Sport         |            | parkour   |             |
| Transport     |            |           | taxi        |

### Step 4: Continue filling in based on other clues.

1. From clue 7, the malaysian is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person with parkour is in position 2, the malaysian cannot be in position 2. The only possible position for the malaysian is 3, which is already occupied by almond-milk. Therefore, the person with cycling must be in position 1.
2. From clue 9, the australian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski. The jet-ski must be in position 3 (already occupied) or 4. If it were in position 4, the australian would have no valid position to the left. So, the jet-ski must be in position 3, and the australian must be in position 1 or 2.
3. From clue 8, the turkish is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. The taxi is in position 3, so the turkish can be in position 1 or 2.
4. From clue 6, the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the turkish. If the turkish is in position 1, the bird can be in position 2. If the turkish is in position 2, the bird can be in position 1.
5. From clue 5, the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake. The jet-ski is in position 3, so the snake must be in position 1 or 2.
6. From clue 12, the person eating mango is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. This means the snake must be in position 1 or 2, and the mango can be in position 1 or 2 accordingly.
7. From clue 2, the person eating corn is not to the right of the fan of rock. The fan of rock cannot be in position 3 (occupied by almond-milk), so the fan of rock must be in position 1 or 2. If the fan of rock is in position 1, the person eating corn must be in position 2. If the fan of rock is in position 2, the person eating corn must be in position 1.
8. From clue 3, the person drinking milk is not to the right of the fan of d&b. The fan of d&b cannot be in position 3 (occupied by almond-milk), so the fan of d&b must be in position 1 or 2. If the fan of d&b is in position 1, the person drinking milk must be in position 2. If the fan of d&b is in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 1.
9. From clue 1, the person driving the car and the person drinking milk have different parity positions. This means if the person drinking milk is in position 1, the person driving the car must be in position 3. If the person drinking milk is in position 2, the person driving the car must be in position 1.

### Step 5: Finalize the solution.

Based on all the above constraints, we can deduce the following:

|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | water      |           | almond-milk |
| Food          | mango     | cauliflower |             |

| Sport         | parkour   |           | sailing    |
| Transport     | car       | jet-ski   | taxi       |

This configuration satisfies all the given conditions. Here is the final solution:

17. **Clue 17:** The owner of the guinea-pig and the person watching fantasy movies have different parity positions.

### Initial Placement:
Let's start placing some initial clues:

- **Clue 11:** The software-developer watches adventure movies.
- **Clue 5:** The person eating cabbage watches adventure movies (so, it must be the software-developer).

Thus, we can place:
```
|               |      1       |       2       |         3          |
| Beverage      |              |               |                    |
| Food          | cabbage      |               |                    |
| Job           | software     |               |                    |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure    |               |                    |
| Nationality   |              |               |                    |
| Pet           |              |               |                    |
| Sport         |              |               |                    |
```

- **Clue 8:** The person eating cherry is in the middle (position 2).
- **Clue 14:** The journalist is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies (software-developer).

Thus, we can place:
```
|               |      1       |       2       |         3          |
| Beverage      |              |               |                    |
| Food          | cabbage      | cherry        |                    |
| Job           | software     | journalist    |                    |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure    |               |                    |
| Nationality   |              |               |                    |
| Pet           |              |               |                    |
| Sport         |              |               |                    |
```

- **Clue 15:** The person eating papaya is on the left of the person whose sport is rowing.
- **Clue 1:** The Colombian is not to the right of the person whose sport is rowing.
- **Clue 7:** The Pakistani is not to the right of the Chinese.

From these, we can infer that the person whose sport is rowing cannot be in position 3, and the Pakistani and Chinese cannot be in consecutive positions with the Pakistani to the right.

### Detailed Placement:
- **Clue 3:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the Pakistani.
- **Clue 12:** The person drinking mirinda is not the Colombian.
- **Clue 9:** The Colombian is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the entrepreneur.

From these, we can deduce:
- The person drinking mirinda must be in position 1 or 2 (since the Colombian is not in position 3 and the person drinking mirinda is not the Colombian).
- The person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2 or 3 (since the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the Pakistani and the Pakistani cannot be in position 3).

### Final Placement:
By trial and error, let's place:
- **Person 1 (Beverage):** Hot-Chocolate
- **Person 2 (Beverage):** Mirinda
- **Person 3 (Beverage):** Milk

Thus:
```
|               |      1       |       2       |         3          |

- **Clue 6:** The person whose sport is cricket and the owner of the guinea-pig have the same parity positions.
- **Clue 10:** The owner of the cat is on the left of the person whose sport is swimming.
- **Clue 13:** The owner of the cat is not the person whose sport is cricket.

By process of elimination and ensuring all constraints are met, we can place:
- **Person 1 (Sport):** Cricket
- **Person 2 (Pet):** Guinea-pig
