29. **Clue 30:** The person watching action movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies.
30. **Clue 31:** The person watching western movies is not to the left of the egyptian.
31. **Clue 32:** The person who's sport is baseball is not the person watching time-travel movies.

35. **Clue 36:** The person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the owner of the hedgehog.

### Filling in the Table:

Let's start with the known positions and work through the clues:

1. **Clue 14:** The person watching horror movies is on the far left (position 1).
2. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is cricket and the egyptian have different parity positions.
3. **Clue 26:** The russian is the person who's sport is soccer.
4. **Clue 25:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the software-developer.
5. **Clue 27:** The british is not to the left of the person who's sport is golf.
6. **Clue 28:** The british is somewhere to the right of the software-developer.
7. **Clue 20:** The egyptian is on the far left or far right (position 1 or 5). Since position 1 is already taken by horror movies, the egyptian must be in position 5.
8. **Clue 6:** The pilot is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5). Since position 1 is taken by horror movies and position 5 by the egyptian, the pilot must be in position 3.
9. **Clue 10:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the pilot (position 3). So, the person who's hobby is filmmaking can only be in position 4 or 5. Since position 5 is taken by the egyptian, it must be in position 4.
10. **Clue 17:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the manager. So, the manager must be in position 5, which is already taken by the egyptian. This means the manager must be in position 6 (if there were more columns).

Given the above, let's fill in the table:
