Lv9-4x7-1	"Let's systematically solve this puzzle step by step:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Fixed Positions:**
   - The manager is either on the far left or far right (1 or 7) and also the fan of folk music (21 and 31).
   - The person driving the ship is the journalist (29 and 32).

2. **Use the Journalist's Position:**
   - Since the journalist drives the ship (29), they must be in position 1 or 7.
   - If the journalist were in position 1, the manager would need to be in position 7, but this conflicts with other constraints (e.g., the manager being the fan of folk music and the manager not being in position 1). So, the journalist must be in position 7.

3. **Manager's Position:**
   - Since the journalist is in position 7, the manager must be in position 1 (21 and 32).

4. **Determine Parity for Certain People:**
   - The Russian and the person driving the tram have different parity positions (13 and 28). Since the Russian cannot be in an even position (as it would conflict with the manager being in an odd position), the Russian must be in an odd position.
   - The fan ambient and the Russian have different parity positions (17 and 28). This reinforces that the Russian is in an odd position.

5. **Position Constraints:**
   - The person driving the car is not to the right of the fan country (14 and 34).
   - The person driving the car is on the right of the fan country (12 and 33). This means the person driving the car and the fan country must be adjacent.
   - The person driving the car is in an odd position (14 and 34).
   - The person driving the car is the fan of d&b (24 and 30). So, the fan of d&b is in an odd position and is the person driving the car.
   - The person driving the car is the fan of d&b, and since the car driver is in an odd position, the fan of d&b must be in an odd position as well.

6. **Fan of Ambient:**
   - The fan of ambient is not to the left of the security guard (6 and 8). Since the security guard must be in an even position, the fan of ambient is in an odd position.
   - The fan of ambient and the Russian have different parity positions (17 and 28). This confirms the Russian is in an odd position.

7. **Manager and Folk:**
   - The manager (1) is the fan of folk (21 and 31). So, the person in position 1 is the manager and the fan of folk.

8. **Security Guard:**
   - The security guard is not to the left of the person driving the ship (22 and 32). Since the journalist is in position 7, the security guard must be in an even position to the right of position 7.
   - The security guard is on the right of the person driving the ship (22 and 32). So, the security guard is in position 6.

9. **Person Driving the Car:**
   - The person driving the car is the fan of d&b and is in an odd position (24 and 30). So, the fan of d&b is in position 3.

10. **Person Driving the Tram:**
    - The person driving the tram is in an even position (13 and 28). Since the Russian is in an odd position, the person driving the tram is the Russian.

11. **Person Driving the Bike:**
    - The person driving the bike is on the left of the person driving the tram (15 and 27). Since the Russian is in position 4, the person driving the bike is in position 3 (but we already have the fan of d&b there, so this must be resolved later).

12. **Person Driving the Helicopter:**
    - The egyptian is between the person driving the helicopter and the fan of ambient (38 and 43). The fan of ambient is in an odd position, so the egyptian is in an even position.

13. **Person Driving the Jet Ski:**
    - The person driving the jet ski is on the right of the person driving the car (16 and 26). Since the car driver is in position 3, the jet ski driver is in position 5.

14. **Person Driving the Submarine:**
    - The person driving the submarine is on the left of the fan of pop (31 and 33). The fan of pop is in an even position, so the submarine driver is in an odd position.

15. **Person Driving the Ship:**
    - The journalist is in position 7 (29).

16. **Person Driving the Tram:**
    - The person driving the tram is the Russian (13 and 28).
