### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 9**: The person eating plum is on the far left.
2. **Clue 16**: The person watching western movies is on the far left.
3. **Clue 17**: The fan hip-hop is on the far left or far right. Since the person eating plum is on the far left, the fan hip-hop must be on the far right.
4. **Clue 10**: The British is not to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
5. **Clue 28**: The Colombian and the person who's sport is sailing have different parity positions.
6. **Clue 30**: The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
7. **Clue 33**: The fan gospel and the Pakistani have different parity positions.
8. **Clue 36**: The Pakistani is not to the left of the person watching thriller movies.
9. **Clue 37**: The person eating potato is on the far right.

Let's start with the far left and far right positions:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |       5       |     6      |
| Food          | Plum     |           |           |           |               | Potato    |
| Movie-Genre   | Western  |           |           |           |               |            |
| Music-Genre   | Hip-Hop  |           |           |           |               |            |
| Nationality   |          |           |           |           |               |            |
| Sport         |          |           |           |           |               |            |
```

Next, let's use the information about the far left and far right positions for other clues:

10. **Clue 29**: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the fan pop.
11. **Clue 30**: The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
12. **Clue 31**: The person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
13. **Clue 35**: The fan d&b is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5).

Since the person eating plum is on the far left and the person watching western movies is also on the far left, the person watching western movies cannot be the fan hip-hop (Clue 17). Therefore, the person watching western movies must be in position 2.

| Food          | Plum     | Western  |           |           |               | Potato    |

```

Using Clue 28 and Clue 33, we can determine the positions for the Colombian and the person who's sport is sailing:

14. **Clue 28**: The Colombian and the person who's sport is sailing have different parity positions. Since the person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling (Clue 30), and the Colombian cannot be in an even position (since it would conflict with Clue 28), the Colombian must be in position 3 and the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 2.

```
|               |     1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |       5       |     6      |
| Food          | Plum     | Sailing  | Colombian |           |               | Potato    |
| Movie-Genre   | Hip-Hop  | Western  |          |           |               |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |          |           |               |            |
| Nationality   |          |          |          |           |               |            |

```

Now, using Clue 30, the person who's sport is cycling must be in position 4.

### Explanation:
1. **Positioning the Australian and the Owner of the Cat:** Since the Australian must be on the far left or right, and the owner of the cat must also be on the far left or right, the only way to satisfy both conditions is if the Australian is at position 1 and the owner of the cat is at position 6.
2. **Dutch, 7up, and Mirinda:** The Dutch is between the person drinking 7up and the person drinking mirinda. This means the Dutch cannot be at positions 1 or 6. Given the previous placement, the Dutch must be at position 3.
3. **Owner of the Goldfish and Japanese:** The Japanese and the owner of the goldfish have different parity positions. The Japanese cannot be at positions 1 or 6 (since the Australian is there), so the Japanese must be at position 2. Therefore, the owner of the goldfish must be at position 4.
4. **Hamster and American:** The owner of the hamster is on the left of the American. The only possible positions for the hamster and American are positions 2 and 3 respectively.
5. **Fish and Hamster:** The owner of the fish is not the person whose sport is badminton, and the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the owner of the fish. The only possible positions for the fish and the owner of the fish are positions 5 and 6 respectively.
