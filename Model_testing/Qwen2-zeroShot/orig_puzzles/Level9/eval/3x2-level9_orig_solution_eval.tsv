Lv9-3x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue provided and place the information into the table accordingly.

### Clues:
1. **The person driving the roller is on the right of the malaysian.**
2. **The person driving the jet-ski and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions.**

Let's start by breaking down the clues:

#### Clue 1: The person driving the roller is on the right of the malaysian.
- This means that if the Malaysian is in position 1, the person driving the roller must be in position 2.
- If the Malaysian is in position 2, the person driving the roller must be in position 1.

#### Clue 2: The person driving the jet-ski and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions.
- Parity positions mean even or odd positions. Since there are only two columns, the parity positions are 1 (odd) and 2 (even).
- Therefore, either both are in position 1 or both are in position 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the positions for the Malaysian and roller:**
   - If the Malaysian is in position 1, then the roller driver must be in position 2.
   - If the Malaysian is in position 2, then the roller driver must be in position 1.

2. **Determine the positions for the jet-ski and epic movie watcher:**
   - Both must be in the same parity position (both in 1 or both in 2).

Given these constraints, let's test the possibilities:

- **Case 1: Malaysian in position 1**
  - Roller driver must be in position 2.
  - Jet-ski and epic movie watcher must both be in position 1 or both in position 2.
  - If they are both in position 1, it contradicts the Malaysian being in position 1.
  - Therefore, they must both be in position 2.

- **Case 2: Malaysian in position 2**
  - Roller driver must be in position 1.
  - Jet-ski and epic movie watcher must both be in position 1 or both in position 2.
  - If they are both in position 1, it contradicts the roller driver being in position 1.
  - Therefore, they must both be in position 2.

Since both cases lead to the same conclusion, we can use either case. Let's use the first case for simplicity:

- Malaysian in position 1.
- Roller driver in position 2.
- Jet-ski and epic movie watcher both in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the remaining details based on the movie genres and nationalities:

- We have two movie genres: epic, superhero.
- We have two nationalities: australian, malaysian.
- The Malaysian is already placed in position 1, so the other nationality (australian) must be in position 2.

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Epic      |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Australian |
| Transport     | Roller    | Jet-ski   |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Epic      |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Australian |
| Transport     | Roller    | Jet-ski   |

Lv9-3x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The owner of the dog and the person watching martial-arts movies have the same parity positions.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking tea and the owner of the dog have different parity positions.
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left (position 1).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Martial-Arts Movie Watcher:**
   - From Clue 3, the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 1.

2. **Determining the Owner of the Dog:**
   - Since the owner of the dog and the person watching martial-arts movies have the same parity positions, the owner of the dog must be in position 1 as well.

3. **Beverage Preference for the Dog Owner:**
   - From Clue 2, the person drinking tea and the owner of the dog have different parity positions.
   - Since the owner of the dog is in position 1, the person drinking tea must be in position 2.

4. **Movie Genre for the Tea Drinker:**
   - Since the owner of the dog is in position 1 and watching martial-arts movies, the person in position 2 cannot be watching martial-arts movies.
   - Therefore, the person in position 2 must be watching sports movies.

5. **Beverage for the Sports Movie Watcher:**
   - Since the person in position 2 is watching sports movies, they cannot be drinking tea (as the person drinking tea is in position 2).
   - Therefore, the person in position 2 must be drinking hot chocolate.

6. **Final Configuration:**
   - Position 1: Dog owner, watching martial-arts movies, drinking tea.
   - Position 2: Sports movie watcher, drinking hot chocolate.

Now, let's fill in the table with the final solution:

```
|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      |     Tea      | Hot-Chocolate |

Lv9-3x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and use logical reasoning to fill in the table.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is hiking and the person drinking milk have the same parity positions.
2. The person who's hobby is hiking is not to the left of the person drinking milk.
3. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking.

### Initial Setup:

|            |    1     |   2    |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Beverage   | soy-milk |        |
| Hobby      |          |        |
| Pet        |          |        |

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Clue 1: Parity Positions
- If the person with the hobby ""hiking"" is in position 1, the person drinking milk must be in position 1 as well (both having odd parity).
- If the person with the hobby ""hiking"" is in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 2 as well (both having even parity).

#### Clue 2: Positional Constraint
- The person with the hobby ""hiking"" cannot be to the left of the person drinking milk. This means if the person with the hobby ""hiking"" is in position 1, the person drinking milk must be in position 2. Conversely, if the person with the hobby ""hiking"" is in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 1.

#### Clue 3: Frog Owner Position
- The owner of the frog is to the left of the person with the hobby ""hiking"".

### Applying the Clues:

1. **Clue 1 and 2 Together:**
   - Since the person with the hobby ""hiking"" cannot be to the left of the person drinking milk, and they must have the same parity, the only possible arrangement is:
     - Hiking in position 2 and Milk in position 1.
     - Or,
     - Hiking in position 1 and Milk in position 2.
   
2. **Clue 3: Frog Owner Position:**
   - If Hiking is in position 1, the frog owner must be in position 2.
   - If Hiking is in position 2, the frog owner must be in position 1.

### Conclusion:
Given these constraints, let's place the elements step-by-step:

- If Hiking is in position 1, then Milk must be in position 2.
- The frog owner must be in position 2 (left of Hiking).

So, we get:

|            |    1     |   2    |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Beverage   | soy-milk | milk   |
| Hobby      | hiking   |        |
| Pet        | frog     |        |

Now, we need to assign the remaining pet (ferret) to the remaining position (position 2 for the pet column):

|            |    1     |   2    |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Beverage   | soy-milk | milk   |
| Hobby      | hiking   |        |
| Pet        | frog     | ferret |

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|            |    1     |   2    |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Beverage   | soy-milk | milk   |
| Hobby      | hiking   |        |

Lv9-3x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information step-by-step into the table.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking cola and the person watching romance movies have the same parity positions.
2. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.

### Initial Setup:

|               |      1       |    2    |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Beverage      | Cola        | Milk    |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance     | Martial-Arts |
| Pet           | Frog        | Turtle  |

Let's analyze the clues:

#### Clue 1:
- The person drinking cola (1) and the person watching romance movies (2) have the same parity positions.
- This means that if the cola drinker is in an odd position, the romance movie watcher must also be in an odd position, and vice versa.

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the frog (Frog) is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk (Milk).
- This means the person with the frog cannot be in position 1, but must be in position 2.

Given these clues, we can fill in the table as follows:

1. From Clue 2, the owner of the frog must be in position 2. Therefore, the pet column for position 2 should be ""Frog"".
2. Since the person drinking cola and the person watching romance movies have the same parity positions, and the only odd position left is 1, the cola drinker must be in position 1 and the romance movie watcher must be in position 2.
3. The remaining beverage for position 2 must be milk, and the remaining movie genre for position 1 must be martial-arts.

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |      1       |    2    |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Beverage      | Cola        | Milk    |

Lv9-3x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the information step-by-step:

### Given Information:
1. The people have 2 different hobbies: card-games, writing.
2. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: animation, mystery.
3. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: cycling, ice-hockey.
4. The person whose hobby is writing and the person whose sport is ice-hockey have different parity positions (one is in an odd position, and the other is in an even position).
5. The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Hobbies and Sports:**
   - Person 1: Card-games or Writing
   - Person 2: Card-games or Writing
   - Person 1: Cycling or Ice-hockey
   - Person 2: Cycling or Ice-hockey

2. **Parity Positions:**
   - If the person with the hobby ""writing"" is in an odd position, the person with the sport ""ice-hockey"" must be in an even position.
   - If the person with the hobby ""writing"" is in an even position, the person with the sport ""ice-hockey"" must be in an odd position.

3. **Movie Genre and Position:**
   - The person watching mystery movies is to the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.

### Possible Assignments:

Let's test the possible scenarios:

#### Scenario 1:
- Assume Person 1 has the hobby ""writing"" and is in an odd position (1), then Person 2 must have the hobby ""card-games"" and be in an even position (2).
- Since Person 1 (writing) is in an odd position, Person 2 (card-games) must be in an even position.
- Now, we need to assign sports such that one is in an odd position and the other is in an even position.
- Let's assume Person 1 (writing) has the sport ""cycling"" (odd position) and Person 2 (card-games) has the sport ""ice-hockey"" (even position).

This satisfies the first condition (different parity positions for writing and ice-hockey).

Now, we need to place the movie genres:
- The person watching mystery movies must be to the right of the person with ice-hockey. So, Person 2 (card-games) must be watching mystery movies.

Thus, the final assignments are:
- Person 1 (Hobby: Writing, Sport: Cycling)
- Person 2 (Hobby: Card-games, Sport: Ice-hockey, Movie-Genre: Mystery)

#### Scenario 2:
- Assume Person 1 has the hobby ""card-games"" and is in an odd position (1), then Person 2 must have the hobby ""writing"" and be in an even position (2).
- Since Person 2 (writing) is in an even position, Person 1 (card-games) must be in an odd position.
- Now, we need to assign sports such that one is in an odd position and the other is in an even position.
- Let's assume Person 1 (card-games) has the sport ""ice-hockey"" (odd position) and Person 2 (writing) has the sport ""cycling"" (even position).

This also satisfies the first condition (different parity positions for writing and ice-hockey).

Now, we need to place the movie genres:
- The person watching mystery movies must be to the right of the person with ice-hockey. So, Person 2 (writing) must be watching mystery movies.

Thus, the final assignments are:
- Person 1 (Hobby: Card-games, Sport: Ice-hockey)
- Person 2 (Hobby: Writing, Sport: Cycling, Movie-Genre: Mystery)

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | Writing    | Card-games |

Lv9-3x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person eating raspberry and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions.
2. The Turkish person is on the right of the person eating raspberry.

### Table Setup:
|               |     1     |    2    |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| **Food**      |           |         |
| **Nationality**|           |         |
| **Sport**     |           |         |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: Parity Positions
- If the person eating raspberry is in position 1, then the person doing badminton must be in position 1 (same parity).
- If the person eating raspberry is in position 2, then the person doing badminton must be in position 2 (same parity).

Since both positions are distinct, the only way to satisfy this clue is if one of them is in position 1 and the other is in position 2.

#### Clue 2: Turkish Person Position
- The Turkish person must be in position 2 (right of the person eating raspberry).

Given that the Turkish person is in position 2, the person eating raspberry must be in position 1.

#### Conclusion:
- The person eating raspberry is in position 1.
- The person doing badminton is in position 2.
- The Turkish person is in position 2.

Now, we need to assign the remaining values (tomato, French, and skiing) to the remaining cells.

Since the person eating raspberry is in position 1, the person in position 1 eats raspberry. The person in position 2 eats tomato (the other type of food).

Since the Turkish person is in position 2, the nationality for position 2 is Turkish. Therefore, the nationality for position 1 is French.

Finally, since the person in position 1 does not do badminton (as it is done by the person in position 2), the sport for position 1 is skiing. The sport for position 2 is badminton.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |    2    |

Lv9-3x2-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is camping and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions.
   - This means one is in an odd position (1) and the other is in an even position (2).

2. **Clue 2**: The owner of the frog is on the left of the fan of classical.
   - This means the owner of the frog must be in position 1, and the fan of classical must be in position 2.

Now let's fill in the table based on these clues:

|               |    1    |      2       |
| Hobby         | Camping | Magic-Tricks |
| Music-Genre   | Classical | R&B          |
| Pet           | Rabbit  | Frog         |

### Explanation:
- From Clue 2, we know that the owner of the frog is in position 1, so the pet in position 1 is Rabbit.
- Therefore, the pet in position 2 must be Frog.
- From Clue 1, the person with the hobby of camping and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions. Since the rabbit is in position 1, the person with camping as their hobby must be in position 2.
- Thus, the person in position 1 has Magic-Tricks as their hobby.
- The fan of classical is in position 2, so the music genre in position 1 must be R&B.
- Finally, since the music genre in position 2 is Classical, it matches the owner of the frog in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |    1    |      2       |
| Hobby         | Magic-Tricks | Camping     |

Lv9-3x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues:
1. The fan of country and the person who's sport is baseball have the same parity positions.
2. The fan of metal is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.
3. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is baseball.

### Initial Table Setup:

|               |     1      |     2      |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Music-Genre   |            |            |
| Sport         |            |            |
| Transport     |            |            |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The fan of country and the person who's sport is baseball have the same parity positions.
- This means that if one is in position 1, the other must be in position 1; if one is in position 2, the other must be in position 2.

#### Clue 2: The fan of metal is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.
- This means the fan of metal cannot be in position 2 if the person driving the scooter is in position 1. Therefore, the fan of metal must be in position 1 if the person driving the scooter is in position 1, or the fan of metal must be in position 2 if the person driving the scooter is in position 2.

#### Clue 3: The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is baseball.
- This means the person driving the scooter cannot be in position 1 if the person whose sport is baseball is in position 1. The person driving the scooter can only be in position 2 if the person whose sport is baseball is in position 1, or the person driving the scooter can be in position 1 if the person whose sport is baseball is in position 2.

### Applying the Clues:

1. Let's assume the person whose sport is baseball is in position 1 (since it's easier to start with an assumption).
2. Then, the person driving the scooter must be in position 2 based on Clue 3.
3. Based on Clue 2, the fan of metal cannot be in position 2, so the fan of metal must be in position 1.
4. Since the fan of country and the person who's sport is baseball have the same parity positions (Clue 1), the fan of country must also be in position 1.
5. Now we have:
   - Position 1: Fan of country, fan of metal, and person whose sport is baseball.
   - Position 2: Person driving the scooter.

6. We need to assign the remaining values:
   - The remaining music genre is ""metal"" (since country and metal are the two genres).
   - The remaining sport is ""ice-hockey"" (since baseball and ice-hockey are the two sports).
   - The remaining transport is ""snowmobile"" (since scooter and snowmobile are the two transports).

So the final table looks like this:

Lv9-3x2-9	"Let's break down the information provided and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. **Food**:
   - There are two types of food: lime and spinach.
   - The person eating spinach is on the left of the person eating lime.

2. **Movie-Genre**:
   - There are two movie genres: time-travel and zombie.
   - The person watching time-travel movies and the person whose sport is lacrosse have different parity positions (i.e., one is in an odd position and the other is in an even position).

3. **Sport**:
   - There are two sports: lacrosse and surfing.
   - The person whose sport is lacrosse is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the order of sports.
Since the person whose sport is lacrosse is on the far right, we can place ""lacrosse"" in position 2.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Food          |             |          |
| Movie-Genre   |             | lacrosse |
| Sport         |             | surfing  |

#### Step 2: Determine the order of food.
We know that the person eating spinach is on the left of the person eating lime. Therefore, we can place ""spinach"" in position 1 and ""lime"" in position 2.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Food          | spinach     | lime     |
| Movie-Genre   |             | lacrosse |
| Sport         |             | surfing  |

#### Step 3: Determine the order of movie-genres.
We need to ensure that the person watching time-travel movies and the person whose sport is lacrosse have different parity positions. Since the person whose sport is lacrosse is in position 2 (an even position), the person watching time-travel movies must be in an odd position (position 1).

Therefore, we can place ""time-travel"" in position 1 for movie-genre.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Food          | spinach     | lime     |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel | lacrosse |
| Sport         |             | surfing  |

Now, we need to fill in the remaining cell with ""zombie"".

|               |      1      |    2     |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Food          | spinach     | lime     |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel | zombie   |
| Sport         |             | surfing  |

Finally, we fill in the last cell with ""zombie"" for the movie genre.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Food          | spinach     | lime     |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel | zombie   |
| Sport         | lacrosse    | surfing  |

Lv9-3x2-10	"Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two movie genres: **mystery** and **romance**.
2. There are two nationalities: **american** and **colombian**.
3. There are two means of transport: **bus** and **quad-bike**.
4. The person watching **romance** movies is on the left of the person driving the bus.
5. The **american** and the person watching **romance** movies have different parity positions (one is in an odd position and the other is in an even position).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Positioning
- Since the person watching **romance** movies is on the left of the person driving the bus, we can deduce that the person watching **romance** movies must be in position 1 and the person driving the bus must be in position 2.

#### Step 2: Analyze Parity Positions
- The **american** and the person watching **romance** movies have different parity positions.
- If the person watching **romance** movies is in position 1 (odd), then the **american** must be in position 2 (even).
- Conversely, if the person watching **romance** movies is in position 2 (even), then the **american** must be in position 1 (odd).

#### Step 3: Determine Nationality and Movie Genre
- If the person watching **romance** movies is in position 1 (odd) and is **american**, then the person in position 2 (even) must be **colombian** and watching **mystery** movies.
- If the person watching **romance** movies is in position 2 (even) and is **colombian**, then the person in position 1 (odd) must be **american** and watching **mystery** movies.

#### Step 4: Determine Transport
- The person driving the bus is in position 2, so they must be using the **bus**.
- The person using the **quad-bike** must be in position 1.

### Final Table:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation:
- Position 1 (odd): **American** watching **Mystery** movies, using **Quad-bike**
- Position 2 (even): **Colombian** watching **Romance** movies, using **Bus**

Thus, the final solution is:
