### Step 2: Fill in the table based on constraints

Let's start filling in the table:

|               |         1          |     2      |       3       |      4      |
|---------------|--------------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Beverage      |                    |            |               |             |
| Food          |                    |            |               |             |
| Job           |                    |            |               |             |
| Movie-Genre   |                    |            |               |             |
| Sport         |                    |            | quad-         |             |
| Transport     |                    |            | bike          |             |

#### Constraints Analysis:
1. **Tram and Cabbage**: The person driving the tram cannot be in position 4 if the person eating cabbage is in position 4.
2. **Cauliflower Position**: The person eating cauliflower must be in position 4.
3. **Bike Position**: The person driving the bike must be in position 2 or 4.
4. **Cycling and Rowing**: The person whose sport is cycling must be to the right of the person whose sport is rowing.
5. **Pomegranate Position**: The person eating pomegranate must be in position 4.

From these constraints, we can start placing items:

|               |         1          |     2      |       3       |      4      |
|---------------|--------------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Beverage      |                    |            |               |             |
| Food          |                    |            |               | pomegranate |
| Job           |                    |            |               |             |
| Movie-Genre   |                    |            |               |             |
| Sport         |                    | cycling    | rowing        | bike        |
| Transport     |                    |            | bike          |             |

Now, let's place the remaining items:

1. **Cauliflower in 4th**: The person eating cauliflower is in position 4.
2. **Cabbage in 2nd or 3rd**: Since the person driving the tram cannot be in position 4, and the person eating cabbage is not the person driving the quad-bike, the person eating cabbage must be in position 2 or 3.
3. **Tram in 1st or 3rd**: The person driving the tram must be in position 1 or 3.

Given that the person eating pomegranate is in position 4, the person eating cabbage cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 2 or 3.

Since the person driving the bike is in position 2 or 4, and the person driving the bike is not to the left of the person drinking tea, the person drinking tea must be in position 3 or 4. But since the person eating pomegranate is in position 4, the person drinking tea must be in position 3.

Let's place these:

|               |         1          |     2      |       3       |      4      |

| Food          | cabbage            |            |               | pomegranate |
| Job           |                    |            |               |             |
| Movie-Genre   |                    |            |               |             |
| Sport         |                    | cycling    | rowing        | bike        |
| Transport     |                    |            | bike          |             |

Now, let's fill in the remaining items:

1. **Cycling and Rowing**: The person whose sport is cycling is to the right of the person whose sport is rowing.
2. **Tram and Cabbage**: The person driving the tram is not to the right of the person eating cabbage.
3. **Bike and Tea**: The person driving the bike is not to the left of the person drinking tea.
4. **Cabbage and Coffee**: The person eating cabbage is not the person driving the quad-bike.
5. **Cabbage and Hot-Chocolate**: The person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
6. **Cabbage and Juice**: The person eating cabbage is not the person drinking juice.
7. **Cauliflower and Animation**: The person eating cauliflower is between the scientist and the person watching animation movies.
8. **Ice-Hockey and Pilot**: The person whose sport is ice-hockey is to the left of the pilot.
9. **Software-Developer and Ice-Hockey**: The software-developer is to the left of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
10. **Tea and Documentary**: The person drinking tea and the person watching documentary movies have the same parity positions.
11. **Tea and Bike**: The person drinking tea is not to the right of the person driving the bike.
12. **Ice-Hockey and Hot-Chocolate**: The person whose sport is ice-hockey is not to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
13. **Tea and Documentary**: The person drinking tea and the person watching documentary movies have the same parity positions.
14. **Climbing and Animation**: The person whose sport is climbing is to the right of the person watching animation movies.
15. **Ice-Hockey, Hot-Chocolate, and Sports**: The person whose sport is ice-hockey is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person watching sports movies.
16. **Tram and Software-Developer**: The person driving the tram is to the left or right of the software-developer.
17. **Pomegranate and Hot-Chocolate**: The person eating pomegranate is to the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
18. **Paramedic and Coffee**: The paramedic is not the person drinking coffee.

By analyzing all the constraints, we can deduce the final solution:

|               |         1          |     2      |       3       |      4      |

26. **Clue 26:** The Indonesian and the person drinking almond-milk have the same parity positions.
27. **Clue 27:** The person whose sport is rugby is on the far left.

### Solving the Puzzle:

Let's start by placing some definite positions based on the clues:

1. **Clue 27:** The person whose sport is rugby is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Rugby

2. **Clue 26:** The Indonesian and the person drinking almond-milk have the same parity positions.
   - Since Rugby is in position 1, Indonesian must be in an odd position.
   - Possible positions for Indonesian: 3 or 5

3. **Clue 22:** The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the airplane.
   - If Indonesian is in position 3, the person driving the airplane can be in position 1 or 2.
   - If Indonesian is in position 5, the person driving the airplane can be in position 3 or 4.

4. **Clue 23:** The owner of the chinchilla and the person driving the train have different parity positions.
   - If Indonesian is in position 3, the person driving the train can be in position 2 or 4.
   - If Indonesian is in position 5, the person driving the train can be in position 4.

5. **Clue 20:** The lawyer is not to the right of the lawyer.
   - This means the lawyer must be in one position only, which is a contradiction unless the lawyer is in position 1 or 2.

6. **Clue 24:** The project-manager is on the left or right of the lawyer.
   - If the lawyer is in position 1, the project-manager can be in position 2.
   - If the lawyer is in position 2, the project-manager can be in position 1 or 3.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can fill in the rest of the positions:

- **Position 1:** Rugby (from Clue 27)
- **Position 2:** Lawyer (since it's the only position left for the lawyer and project-manager to fit with Clue 24)
- **Position 3:** Indonesian (since it's the only odd position left and fits with Clue 22 and 23)
- **Position 4:** Project-manager (since it's the only position left and fits with Clue 24)
- **Position 5:** Train (since it's the only position left and fits with Clue 1)

Now let's fill in the remaining details based on the remaining clues:

- **Clue 1:** Software-developer and train driver have the same parity positions (both in position 5).
- **Clue 6:** Person whose sport is swimming is in an even position (position 4).
- **Clue 10:** Person whose sport is swimming is not drinking juice.
- **Clue 11:** Nigerian and person drinking coffee have different parity positions.
- **Clue 14:** Person whose sport is rugby is somewhere to the left of the project-manager (already placed in position 2).
- **Clue 16:** Owner of guinea-pig and person driving helicopter have the same parity positions.
- **Clue 17:** Project-manager is somewhere to the left of the owner of guinea-pig.
- **Clue 18:** Project-manager is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is climbing.
- **Clue 21:** Spanish is on the left of the owner of fish.
- **Clue 25:** Person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking coffee.

After filling all these details, we get the following table:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 14
- The person watching family movies is the person whose hobby is woodworking.
- This means that the person whose hobby is woodworking is in position 4 (Family Movies).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 15
- The person whose hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person watching family movies.
- Since the person watching family movies is in position 4, the person whose hobby is baking can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 7 and Clue 26
- The person whose hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the fan of R&B.
- The fan of dubstep and the person whose hobby is woodworking have the same parity positions.
- Since the person whose hobby is woodworking is in position 4, the fan of R&B must be in an even position (2 or 4), but since it can't be in 4, it must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is woodworking is in position 4, and the fan of R&B is in position 2.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 13
- The person whose hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the fan of R&B.

- The person watching zombie movies and the person whose hobby is baking have different parity positions.
- Since the person whose hobby is woodworking is in position 4, the person watching zombie movies must be in an odd position (1 or 3).
- The person whose hobby is board-games must be in an odd position as well.
- The person whose hobby is baking must be in an even position (2 or 4), but since the fan of R&B is in position 2, the person whose hobby is baking must be in position 4.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 17
- The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the Chinese.
- The person watching zombie movies is in position 1 or 3, and the Chinese is in an even position (2 or 4).

#### Step 7: Analyze Clue 9
- The Chinese is between the fan of blues and the fan of dubstep.
- The Chinese cannot be in position 4 because the fan of R&B is there.
- Therefore, the Chinese must be in position 2, and the fan of blues and the fan of dubstep must be in positions 1 and 3.

#### Step 8: Analyze Clue 6 and Clue 10
- The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is gardening.
