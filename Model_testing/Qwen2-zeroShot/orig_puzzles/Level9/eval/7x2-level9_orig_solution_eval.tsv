Lv9-7x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given clues to fill in the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking lemonade and the German have the same parity positions.
2. The person watching superhero movies is on the far left.
3. The fan of reggae is not to the left of the firefighter.
4. The firefighter and the Dutch have different parity positions.
5. The person eating radish is not to the right of the fan of reggae.
6. The person whose hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person watching superhero movies is on the far left (position 1).
   - This means the person in position 1 watches superhero movies.

2. **Clue 1**: The person drinking lemonade and the German have the same parity positions.
   - Since the person in position 1 is watching superhero movies, the German cannot be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the German must be in an even position (2).

3. **Clue 4**: The firefighter and the Dutch have different parity positions.
   - Since the German is in position 2, the Dutch must be in an odd position (1 or 3 or 5 or 7).
   - The firefighter must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6), but not 2 (since it's the German).

4. **Clue 3**: The fan of reggae is not to the left of the firefighter.
   - This means the firefighter cannot be in position 1 or 3 if the fan of reggae is in position 1 or 3, respectively.
   - The firefighter can only be in position 4, 6, or 2 (but not 2 since it's the German).

5. **Clue 5**: The person eating radish is not to the right of the fan of reggae.
   - If the fan of reggae is in position 1, the person eating radish can only be in position 2, which is the German.
   - If the fan of reggae is in position 3, the person eating radish can only be in position 2 or 1, but position 1 is taken by the superhero movie watcher, so it must be in position 2, which is the German.
   - Therefore, the fan of reggae cannot be in position 1 or 3.

6. **Clue 6**: The person whose hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep.
   - This means the fan of dubstep cannot be in position 1 (superhero movie watcher) or 2 (German).

### Possible Assignments:
- Position 1: Superhero movie watcher (lemonade drinker)
- Position 2: German (soy milk drinker)
- Position 3: Baking hobbyist (radish eater)
- Position 4: Firefighter (reggae fan)
- Position 5: Dutch (dubstep fan)
- Position 6: Architect (family movie genre)

Now, let's place the mystery movie watcher and the german:
- If the person watching mystery movies is in position 1, the german must be in position 2. But the owner of the ferret is already in position 2, so this is not possible.
- Therefore, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2, and the german must be in position 1.

Next, place the soy milk drinker:
- The owner of the ferret is in position 2, which is even, so the person drinking soy milk must also be in position 2.

Now, place the fish and reggae fan:
- The owner of the fish cannot be in position 4, so they must be in position 1 or 2. But position 2 is taken by the owner of the ferret, so the owner of the fish must be in position 1.
- The fan of reggae must be to the right of the owner of the fish, so the fan of reggae must be in position 2.

Finally, place the remaining items:
- The person eating apple must be in position 2 (since the person eating garlic is in position 1).
- The job of photographer must be in position 1 (since the pilot is in position 1 and the owner of the fish is in position 1).
- The job of pilot must be in position 1.

Lv9-7x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The Indonesian is not to the right of the fan of disco.**
   - This means the Indonesian must be either to the left of the fan of disco or in the same position as the fan of disco.

2. **The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left.**
   - This places snowboarding in position 1 (leftmost).

3. **The Canadian is not to the left of the person drinking cola.**
   - This means the Canadian cannot be in position 1 if the person drinking cola is in position 2.

4. **The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person drinking cola.**
   - This means the skateboard driver is in position 1 and the person drinking cola is in position 2.

7. **The fan of hip-hop is on the right of the person eating onion.**
   - This means the fan of hip-hop is in position 2 and the person eating onion is in position 1.

### Deductions:

From Clue 2:
- Snowboarding is in position 1.
- The person driving the skateboard is in position 1 (from Clue 4), so the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

From Clue 7:
- The person eating onion is in position 1.
- The fan of hip-hop is in position 2.

From Clue 4:
- The person drinking cola is in position 2.
- The person driving the skateboard is in position 1.

From Clue 5:
- The owner of the mouse and the person eating onion have different parity positions.
- Since the person eating onion is in position 1 (odd), the owner of the mouse must be in position 2 (even).

From Clue 6:
- The owner of the pony is on the left or right of the Canadian.
- Since the Canadian cannot be in position 1 (from Clue 3) and the owner of the mouse is in position 2, the Canadian must be in position 2 and the owner of the pony in position 1.

From Clue 3:
- The Canadian is not to the left of the person drinking cola.
- Since the Canadian is in position 2 and the person drinking cola is in position 2, this condition is satisfied.

From Clue 1:
- The Indonesian is not to the right of the fan of disco.
- Since the fan of hip-hop is in position 2, the Indonesian cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the Indonesian must be in position 1.

Lv9-7x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to fill in the table step by step. Let's break down each clue and see how it helps us fill in the table.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **The electrician is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is tennis.**
2. **The person drinking sprite and the person watching horror movies have the same parity positions.**
3. **The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person whose sport is tennis.**
4. **The owner of the hedgehog is not the fan of rock.**
5. **The Japanese is not to the right of the owner of the snake.**
6. **The person watching disaster movies and the owner of the hedgehog have the same parity positions.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and 3
Clue 1 and Clue 3 both mention the position of the person whose sport is tennis and the person watching disaster movies. We can infer that these two positions are adjacent or the person watching disaster movies is to the right of the person whose sport is tennis.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1 (left) and Position 2 (right)

If the sport is tennis at Position 1, then the disaster movie must be at Position 2.
If the sport is tennis at Position 2, then the disaster movie must be at Position 1.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2 and 6
Clue 2 and Clue 6 both mention the parity positions of the sprite drinker and the disaster movie watcher. Parity means even or odd positions.

- If the sprite drinker is at an even position, the disaster movie watcher must also be at an even position.
- If the sprite drinker is at an odd position, the disaster movie watcher must also be at an odd position.

Given that the disaster movie watcher is to the right of the tennis sport person, let's consider the possible configurations:
- If tennis is at Position 1, disaster is at Position 2, and both have the same parity.
- If tennis is at Position 2, disaster is at Position 1, and both have the same parity.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 4 and 5
Clue 4 states that the owner of the hedgehog is not the fan of rock.
Clue 5 states that the Japanese is not to the right of the owner of the snake.

These clues help us narrow down the possibilities for nationality and pet ownership.

#### Step 4: Combine All Clues
Let's try to fit all clues together:

1. If tennis is at Position 1 and disaster is at Position 2, and they have the same parity:
   - Sprite and horror must also have the same parity, which means they must both be in even or both in odd positions.
   - The sprite drinker cannot be the owner of the hedgehog, and the disaster movie watcher cannot be the Japanese.

Let's assume:
- Tennis is at Position 1, and disaster is at Position 2.
- Sprite and horror are in the same parity (even or odd).

Since the sprite drinker and the disaster movie watcher have the same parity:
- If sprite is in an even position, horror must be in an even position.
- If sprite is in an odd position, horror must be in an odd position.

Given the positions:
- Position 1: Tennis
- Position 2: Disaster

If sprite is in an even position, horror must be in an even position. This means:
- Sprite could be in Position 2 (disaster), but this conflicts with disaster being in Position 2. So, sprite must be in Position 4 or 6.
- Horror must be in Position 6 if sprite is in Position 4, or vice versa.

Let's place the sprite and horror:
- Sprite in Position 4, Horror in Position 6 (or vice versa).

Now, we need to place the rest:
- Electrician is to the right of tennis, so electrician must be in Position 2.
- Japanese is not to the right of the snake owner, so snake owner must be in Position 1 or 2 (but electrician is in Position 2).
- Owner of the hedgehog is not a rock fan, so rock fan must be in Position 1 or 3.

   - This means if the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 1, the person eating peas must be in position 2. If the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 2, the person eating peas must be in position 1.

4. **The Dutch is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.**
   - This means the Dutch person cannot be in position 1, and the person drinking cola must be in position 1 or 2, with the Dutch person being in position 2 or 3.

5. **The person who's hobby is video-games and the person who's sport is handball have different parity positions.**
   - This means if the person with the hobby of video-games is in an odd position (1), the person with the sport of handball must be in an even position (2), and vice versa.

6. **The person drinking soy-milk is the person watching zombie movies.**
   - This directly links the beverage and movie genre.

Let's start placing the information step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person eating peas.
   - This means:
     - If hamster is in position 1, peas is in position 2.
     - If hamster is in position 2, peas is in position 1.

2. **Clue 6:** The person drinking soy-milk is the person watching zombie movies.
   - This means:
     - Soy-milk is in the same row as ""zombie"" under ""Movie-Genre"".

3. **Clue 2 & 3:** The person drinking soy-milk and the person who's hobby is video-games have the same parity positions, and the person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person eating peas.
   - This means if soy-milk is in position 1, video-games must be in position 1 (same parity).
   - If soy-milk is in position 2, video-games must be in position 2 (same parity).

4. **Clue 4:** The Dutch is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - This means:
     - Cola can only be in position 1, and Dutch can be in position 2 or 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is video-games and the person who's sport is handball have different parity positions.
   - This means if video-games is in position 1, handball must be in position 2, and vice versa.

### Final Placement:

Given all the constraints, let's place the items:

- **Beverage:**
  - Soy-milk (zombie movies) must be in position 1 (since it needs to match the same parity with video-games and video-games cannot be to the right of peas).
  - Cola must be in position 1 (to satisfy clue 4).
  - Hamster must be in position 2 (to satisfy clue 1).
  - Peas must be in position 1 (to satisfy clue 1).

- **Food:**
  - Broccoli (must be in position 2 since peas is in position 1).

- **Hobby:**
  - Video-games (must be in position 1 to match soy-milk and not be to the right of peas).
  - Drawing (must be in position 2 since video-games is in position 1).

- **Movie-Genre:**
  - Zombie (must be in position 1 since soy-milk is in position 1).

- **Nationality:**
  - Dutch (must be in position 2 to satisfy clue 4).

- **Pet:**
  - Ferret (must be in position 2 since hamster is in position 1).

- **Sport:**
  - Handball (must be in position 2 to satisfy clue 5).

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | Cola     | Soy-milk    |

This is the final solution based on the given clues."	{'beverage': ['cola', 'soy-milk'], 'food': ['broccoli', 'peas'], 'hobby': ['video-games', 'drawing'], 'movie-genre': ['zombie', ''], 'nationality': ['dutch', ''], 'pet': ['ferret', 'hamster'], 'sport': ['handball', 'parkour']}	True	6	False
Lv9-7x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the horse and the person who's sport is climbing have the same parity positions (both are in odd or both are in even).
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the motorbike is not to the right of the fan of pop.
4. **Clue 4:** The analyst is somewhere to the left of the Dutch.
5. **Clue 5:** The fan of pop is on the left of the fan of salsa.
6. **Clue 6:** The fan of pop is not to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
7. **Clue 7:** The person drinking soy-milk and the owner of the horse have the same parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - If we denote the person drinking soy-milk as S and the person driving the quad-bike as Q, then S must be in an odd position and Q must be in an even position.

2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the horse and the person who's sport is climbing have the same parity positions.
   - This means they are either both in odd positions or both in even positions.

3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the motorbike is not to the right of the fan of pop.
   - If we denote the fan of pop as P and the person driving the motorbike as M, then P must be in a position to the left of M.

4. **Clue 4:** The analyst is somewhere to the left of the Dutch.
   - If we denote the analyst as A and the Dutch as D, then A must be in a position to the left of D.

5. **Clue 5:** The fan of pop is on the left of the fan of salsa.
   - If we denote the fan of salsa as Sa, then P must be in a position to the left of Sa.

6. **Clue 6:** The fan of pop is not to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
   - If we denote the person whose sport is volleyball as V, then P must be in a position to the left of V.

7. **Clue 7:** The person drinking soy-milk and the owner of the horse have the same parity positions.
   - This means S and the owner of the horse (H) are either both in odd positions or both in even positions.

### Placement Based on Clues:

Let's start placing the information:

- **Beverage**: Soy-milk (S) and Water (W)
- **Job**: Analyst (A), Teacher (T)
- **Music-Genre**: Pop (P), Salsa (Sa)
- **Nationality**: Dutch (D), Turkish (Tr)
- **Pet**: Chinchilla (C), Horse (H)
- **Sport**: Climbing (Cl), Volleyball (V)
- **Transport**: Motorbike (M), Quad-bike (Q)

From Clue 1, S is in an odd position and Q is in an even position. Let's assume:
- S is in Position 1
- Q is in Position 2

From Clue 7, S and H have the same parity positions, so H must also be in Position 1.

From Clue 2, H and Cl must have the same parity positions. Since H is in Position 1, Cl must also be in Position 1.

From Clue 4, A is to the left of D. Since S is in Position 1, A cannot be in Position 1. Therefore, A must be in Position 2.

From Clue 3, M is not to the right of P. Since A is in Position 2, M must be in Position 1.

From Clue 5, P is on the left of Sa. Since A is in Position 2, Sa must be in Position 3.

From Clue 6, P is not to the right of V. Since A is in Position 2, V must be in Position 1.

From Clue 2, since H is in Position 1 and Cl is in Position 1, H and Cl must be in the same row.

From Clue 4, A is to the left of D. Since A is in Position 2, D must be in Position 3.

### Final Table:
```
