### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The person eating strawberry is the police-officer.
   - This means the police-officer eats strawberry.
   - Let's denote it as (Police-officer, Strawberry).

2. **Clue 6**: The person eating papaya is on the right of the police-officer.
   - Since the police-officer eats strawberry, the person eating papaya must be in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6.
   - Let's denote it as (Position X, Papaya), where X > 1.

3. **Clue 10**: The person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person eating pumpkin.
   - This means the radish eater is to the left of the pumpkin eater.
   - Let's denote it as (Radish, Position Y) and (Pumpkin, Position Z), where Y < Z.

4. **Clue 8**: The engineer is on the left of the person eating radish.
   - This means the engineer is in position 1, and the radish eater is in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
   - Let's denote it as (Engineer, Position A) and (Radish, Position B), where A < B.

5. **Clue 9**: The police-officer is not the person eating radish.
   - From Clue 3, the police-officer eats strawberry, so they cannot eat radish.
   - Therefore, (Radish, Position B) is not the police-officer.

6. **Clue 1**: The engineer is not to the right of the person eating pumpkin.
   - This means the engineer is either in position 1 or 2 (if the pumpkin eater is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6).
   - From Clue 8, the engineer is in position 1, and the radish eater is in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
   - Therefore, the engineer must be in position 1, and the radish eater must be in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.

7. **Clue 4**: The lawyer is on the left of the person eating pumpkin.
   - This means the lawyer is in position 1, 2, or 3, and the pumpkin eater is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - From Clue 8, the engineer is in position 1, and the radish eater is in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
   - Therefore, the lawyer must be in position 2, and the pumpkin eater must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

8. **Clue 12**: The person eating cauliflower is not to the right of the engineer.
   - This means the engineer is in position 1, and the cauliflower eater is in position 1 or 2.
   - From Clue 8, the engineer is in position 1, and the radish eater is in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
   - Therefore, the cauliflower eater must be in position 2.

9. **Clue 11**: The person eating apple is on the right of the freelancer.
   - This means the freelancer is in position 1, 2, or 3, and the apple eater is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - From Clue 8, the engineer is in position 1, and the radish eater is in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
   - Therefore, the freelancer must be in position 2, and the apple eater must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

10. **Clue 7**: The person eating strawberry is on the left of the lawyer.
    - From Clue 3, the police-officer eats strawberry.
    - From Clue 4, the lawyer is in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6.
    - Therefore, the lawyer must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

11. **Clue 5**: The freelancer and the person eating apple have different parity positions.
    - This means if the freelancer is in an odd position, the apple eater must be in an even position, and vice versa.
    - From Clue 11, the freelancer is in position 2, which is even.
    - Therefore, the apple eater must be in position 3, 5, or 6, which are odd positions.

12. **Clue 13**: The person eating apple is on the right of the freelancer.
    - From Clue 11, the freelancer is in position 2, and the apple eater must be in position 3, 5, or 6.
    - Therefore, the apple eater must be in position 3, 5, or 6, and the pumpkin eater must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

Combining all the information, we can place the elements as follows:

- Position 1: Engineer (not eating radish)
- Position 2: Freelancer (eating cauliflower)
- Position 3: Lawyer (eating apple)
- Position 4: Police-officer (eating strawberry)
- Position 5: Radish eater (must be before pumpkin)
- Position 6: Pumpkin eater (must be after radish)

Given the constraints, the only valid placement for the radish and pumpkin is:
- Position 5: Radish
- Position 6: Pumpkin

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|        |      1      |   2    |       3        |   4    |     5      |      6       |

```

This configuration satisfies all the given clues."	{'food': ['engineer', 'cauliflower', 'lawyer (apple)', 'police-officer (strawberry)', 'radish', 'pumpkin'], 'job': ['freelancer', '', '', '', '', '']}	True	0	False
Lv9-2x6-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the jobs and nationalities accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. The coach is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).
2. The Italian is on the right of the dressmaker.
3. The Bartender is somewhere to the right of the Italian (implying the Italian is not in position 6).
4. The Dressmaker is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
5. The Paramedic is not to the left of the Turkish.
6. The Journalist is not to the right of the Coach.
7. The Bartender is somewhere between the Paramedic and the Accountant.
8. The Indian is on the left or right of the Italian.
9. The Coach is not to the right of the Bartender.
10. The Turkish is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).
11. The Coach is somewhere to the right of the British.
12. The Bartender and the Italian have different parity positions.
13. The Dressmaker is on the right of the Journalist.
14. The Italian is not to the right of the Bartender.
15. The Dressmaker is the Indian.
16. The Journalist and the Pakistani have different parity positions.
17. The Journalist is on the left or right of the Pakistani.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Coach is in an even position (2, 4, 6)**
2. **Italian is on the right of the Dressmaker (so Dressmaker is in an odd position, and Italian is in an even position)**
3. **Bartender is somewhere to the right of the Italian (so Italian can't be in position 6)**
4. **Dressmaker is in an odd position (1, 3, 5)**
5. **Paramedic is not to the left of the Turkish**
6. **Journalist is not to the right of the Coach**
7. **Bartender is between the Paramedic and the Accountant**
8. **Indian is on the left or right of the Italian**
9. **Coach is not to the right of the Bartender**
10. **Turkish is in an even position (2, 4, 6)**
11. **Coach is somewhere to the right of the British**
12. **Bartender and the Italian have different parity positions**
13. **Dressmaker is on the right of the Journalist**
14. **Italian is not to the right of the Bartender**
15. **Dressmaker is the Indian**
16. **Journalist and the Pakistani have different parity positions**
17. **Journalist is on the left or right of the Pakistani**

From clue 15, we know:
- **Dressmaker (Indian)** is in an odd position (1, 3, 5).

From clue 14, since the Italian is not to the right of the Bartender, and they must have different parity positions, the Italian must be in an even position (2, 4, 6), and the Bartender must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5).

From clue 12, since the Italian is on the right of the Dressmaker, and they have different parity positions, the Italian cannot be in position 6. Therefore, the Italian is in position 2 or 4, and the Dressmaker is in position 1 or 3.

Since the Italian is in an even position, and the Coach is also in an even position (clue 1), the Italian cannot be in the same position as the Coach. Thus, the Italian is in position 4, and the Coach is in position 6.

From clue 11, the Coach is somewhere to the right of the British, so the British must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

From clue 8, the Indian (Dressmaker) is on the left or right of the Italian, which means the Indian is in position 1 or 3. Since the Dressmaker is the Indian, the Indian is in position 1 or 3.

From clue 13, the Dressmaker (Indian) is on the right of the Journalist, so the Journalist must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Italian is in position 4, the Journalist cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the Journalist is in position 1, and the Indian is in position 3.

From clue 16, the Journalist and the Pakistani have different parity positions. Since the Journalist is in position 1 (odd), the Pakistani must be in an even position (2, 4, 6). Since the Italian is in position 4, the Pakistani must be in position 2 or 6.

From clue 17, the Journalist is on the left or right of the Pakistani, so the Pakistani must be in position 2. This leaves position 6 for the British, who must be the Coach.

From clue 7, the Bartender is between the Paramedic and the Accountant, and from clue 12, the Bartender and the Italian have different parity positions. Since the Italian is in position 4 (even), the Bartender must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5). Since the Journalist is in position 1 and the Indian is in position 3, the Bartender must be in position 5. Therefore, the Paramedic and the Accountant must be in positions 2 and 4, but since the Italian is in position 4, the Paramedic must be in position 2 and the Accountant in position 4.

From clue 6, the Journalist is not to the right of the Coach, which is already satisfied.

From clue 10, the Turkish is in an even position (2, 4, 6), and from clue 5, the Paramedic is not to the left of the Turkish, so the Turkish must be in position 6, and the Paramedic in position 2.

Finally, we have:
- Position 1: Journalist (British)
- Position 2: Paramedic (Turkish)
- Position 3: Indian (Dressmaker)
- Position 4: Italian
- Position 5: Bartender
- Position 6: Coach (British)

Lv9-2x6-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate values in the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of disco and the owner of the bird have the same parity positions.
2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the snake.
3. **Clue 3:** The fan of metal is not to the left of the owner of the turtle.
4. **Clue 4:** The fan of jazz is somewhere to the left of the owner of the mouse.
5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla.
6. **Clue 6:** The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the fan of trance.
7. **Clue 7:** The fan of metal is not to the left of the owner of the snake.
8. **Clue 8:** The owner of the turtle is not to the left of the fan of metal.
9. **Clue 9:** The fan of disco and the owner of the hedgehog have different parity positions.
10. **Clue 10:** The fan of disco and the owner of the bird have the same parity positions.
11. **Clue 11:** The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.
12. **Clue 12:** The fan of jazz is not the owner of the bird.
13. **Clue 13:** The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
14. **Clue 14:** The owner of the snake is on the far left or far right.
15. **Clue 15:** The fan of trance is not the owner of the bird.
16. **Clue 16:** The owner of the hedgehog is between the fan of disco and the fan of hip-hop.
17. **Clue 17:** The fan of jazz is on the left of the fan of metal.

Let's start placing the values based on these clues:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clues 1 and 10
- Fan of disco and owner of bird have the same parity (both even or both odd).
- Fan of disco and owner of hedgehog have different parity.

This means:
- If the fan of disco is in an even position, the owner of the bird must be in an even position, and the owner of the hedgehog must be in an odd position.
- If the fan of disco is in an odd position, the owner of the bird must be in an odd position, and the owner of the hedgehog must be in an even position.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 14
- Owner of the snake is on the far left or far right.

Since there are only two options for the far left or right, let's assume the owner of the snake is in position 1 (far left).

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 12
- Fan of jazz is not the owner of the bird.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 11
- Fan of folk is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 13
- Owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 16
- Owner of the hedgehog is between the fan of disco and the fan of hip-hop.

#### Step 7: Analyze Clue 17
- Fan of jazz is on the left of the fan of metal.

Now, let's try to place the values based on these deductions:

1. Owner of the snake: Position 1 (far left)
2. Since the owner of the snake is in position 1, the owner of the hedgehog must be in an even position (since the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog).
3. Since the fan of disco and the owner of bird have the same parity, and the fan of disco and the owner of hedgehog have different parity, the fan of disco can be in an even position and the owner of the bird in an even position, or vice versa.
4. The fan of jazz cannot be the owner of the bird, so it must be in an even position if the fan of disco is in an odd position.
5. The fan of folk must be to the left of the fan of hip-hop.
6. The owner of the chinchilla must be to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
7. The owner of the turtle must be to the right of the owner of the snake (position 1), so it can be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
8. The fan of metal cannot be to the left of the owner of the turtle.
9. The fan of metal cannot be to the left of the owner of the snake.
10. The owner of the turtle cannot be to the left of the fan of metal.

After analyzing all the clues and trying different placements, we can determine the following:

|               |   1   |   2    |   3   |    4     |     5      |   6    |

Lv9-2x6-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Puzzle:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person eating corn.
2. **Singing vs Dancing:** The person who's hobby is singing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.
3. **Asparagus:** The person eating asparagus is between the person eating artichoke and the person eating corn.
4. **Traveling:** The person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right.
5. **Puzzles:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person eating corn (redundant with clue 1).
6. **Dancing & Broccoli:** The person who's hobby is dancing is between the person who's hobby is camping and the person eating broccoli.
7. **Camping:** The person who's hobby is camping is the person who's hobby is camping (redundant).
8. **Dancing & Artichoke:** The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person eating artichoke.
9. **Corn & Pumpkin:** The person eating corn is somewhere to the left of the person eating pumpkin.
10. **Broccoli & Camping:** The person eating broccoli is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
11. **Drawing & Peas:** The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the person eating peas.
12. **Drawing & Artichoke:** The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the person eating artichoke.
13. **Parity:** The person eating peas and the person who's hobby is dancing have the same parity positions.
14. **Drawing & Artichoke (again):** The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the person eating artichoke (redundant with clue 12).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position Traveling:** Since the person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right, we can place ""traveling"" in position 6.
   
   ```
   |         |    1     |    2    |     3     |     4     |    5    |     6     |
   | Food    |          |         |           |           |         | traveling |
   | Hobby   |          |         |           |           |         |   traveling   |
   ```

2. **Corn & Asparagus:** From clue 3, the person eating asparagus is between the person eating artichoke and the person eating corn. Also, from clue 9, the person eating corn is to the left of the person eating pumpkin. Therefore, corn must be in position 1 or 2, and pumpkin in position 4 or 5. Let's assume corn is in position 1 for now.

   ```
   |         |    1     |    2    |     3     |     4     |    5    |     6     |
   | Food    |  corn    |         |           |           |         | traveling |
   | Hobby   |          |         |           |           |         |   traveling   |
   ```

3. **Artichoke & Asparagus:** Asparagus must be between artichoke and corn. So, if corn is in position 1, then artichoke must be in position 2, and asparagus in position 3.

   ```
   |         |    1     |    2    |     3     |     4     |    5    |     6     |
   | Food    |  corn    | artichoke| asparagus |           |         | traveling |
   | Hobby   |          |         |           |           |         |   traveling   |
   ```

4. **Dancing & Broccoli:** From clue 6, the person who's hobby is dancing is between the person who's hobby is camping and the person eating broccoli. Since the person who's hobby is camping is the person who's hobby is camping, we need to place camping and dancing correctly.

5. **Singing & Dancing:** From clue 2, the person who's hobby is singing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. This means singing must be before dancing.

6. **Drawing & Peas:** From clue 11, the person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the person eating peas. Also, from clue 12, drawing is to the right of artichoke.

7. **Parity:** From clue 13, the person eating peas and the person who's hobby is dancing have the same parity positions. Since we assumed corn is in position 1 (odd), and asparagus in position 3 (odd), the only way to satisfy this is if peas is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and dancing in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

Given these constraints, let's try to fit everything:

```
|         |    1     |    2    |     3     |     4     |    5    |     6     |
| Food    |  corn    | artichoke| asparagus |  peas    | drawing | traveling |
| Hobby   |  camping |  dancing |   drawing |   singing |   puzzles|   traveling   |
```

### Verification:
- Corn (1) is to the left of pumpkin (6).
- Puzzles (5) is on the left or right of corn (1).
- Asparagus (3) is between artichoke (2) and corn (1).
- Dancing (2) is between camping (1) and broccoli (4).
- Singing (4) is not to the right of dancing (2).
- Drawing (5) is to the right of peas (3).
- Dancing (2) and drawing (5) have the same parity (both are even).
- Drawing (5) is to the right of artichoke (2).

Lv9-2x6-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The software-developer and the person watching horror movies have different parity positions.
2. **Clue 2:** The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere between the person watching horror movies and the person watching action movies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the fisherman.
4. **Clue 4:** The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere between the firefighter and the coach.
5. **Clue 5:** The person watching fantasy movies is not to the left of the coach.
6. **Clue 6:** The person watching fantasy movies and the software-developer have the same parity positions.
7. **Clue 7:** The firefighter is somewhere to the right of the software-developer.
8. **Clue 8:** The person watching scientific movies is in an even position.
9. **Clue 9:** The firefighter is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.
10. **Clue 10:** The software-developer is on the right of the pilot.
11. **Clue 11:** The person watching horror movies and the coach have different parity positions.
12. **Clue 12:** The fisherman is on the left or right of the firefighter.
13. **Clue 13:** The software-developer is not to the left of the software-developer (redundant).
14. **Clue 14:** The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the firefighter.
15. **Clue 15:** The person watching action movies is between the person watching fantasy movies and the person watching crime movies.
16. **Clue 16:** The pilot is on the right of the coach.
17. **Clue 17:** The fisherman is not to the left of the person watching family movies.

#### Positioning Based on Clues:
- From **Clue 8**, the person watching scientific movies must be in an even position: 2, 4, or 6.
- From **Clue 3**, the fisherman must be on the right of the person watching scientific movies, so if the scientific movie watcher is in position 2, the fisherman must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. If in position 4, the fisherman can be in 5 or 6. If in position 6, the fisherman can only be in position 7 (which is impossible).

Thus, the scientific movie watcher must be in position 2 and the fisherman in position 3, 4, or 5. Let’s test with the fisherman in position 4.

- From **Clue 12**, the fisherman is either to the left or right of the firefighter. Since the fisherman is in position 4, the firefighter could be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- From **Clue 14**, the person watching fantasy movies is to the left of the firefighter. So, the firefighter cannot be in position 2.
- From **Clue 10**, the software-developer is to the right of the pilot. So, the pilot must be in position 1 and the software-developer in position 5 or 6.

- From **Clue 7**, the firefighter is to the right of the software-developer, so the software-developer cannot be in position 5 if the firefighter is in position 6. Thus, the software-developer must be in position 5 and the firefighter in position 6.

- From **Clue 6**, the person watching fantasy movies and the software-developer have the same parity positions, so the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 4 (even) and the software-developer in position 5 (odd).

- From **Clue 15**, the person watching action movies is between the person watching fantasy movies and the person watching crime movies. So, the person watching action movies must be in position 3 and the person watching crime movies in position 2.

- From **Clue 1**, the software-developer (position 5) and the person watching horror movies have different parity positions, so the person watching horror movies must be in position 1.

- From **Clue 11**, the person watching horror movies (position 1) and the coach have different parity positions, so the coach must be in position 2.

- From **Clue 9**, the firefighter (position 6) is to the left of the person watching family movies, so the person watching family movies must be in position 4.

- From **Clue 16**, the pilot is to the right of the coach, so the pilot must be in position 3.

So, the final solution is:

Lv9-2x6-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate movie genre and pet in the correct cells of the table. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching satire movies is not to the left of the person watching zombie movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the person watching zombie movies (redundant, but implies only one person watches zombie movies).
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching animation movies is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).
4. **Clue 4:** The person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person watching satire movies.
5. **Clue 5:** The person watching action movies is not the owner of the cat.
6. **Clue 6:** The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.
7. **Clue 7:** The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the owner of the hamster.
8. **Clue 8:** The owner of the frog is somewhere between the person watching animation movies and the person watching satire movies.
9. **Clue 9:** The person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret.
10. **Clue 10:** The person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the owner of the dog.
11. **Clue 11:** The owner of the bird is between the person watching action movies and the person watching time-travel movies.
12. **Clue 12:** The owner of the frog is not to the right of the owner of the cat.
13. **Clue 13:** The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
14. **Clue 14:** The owner of the ferret is the person watching time-travel movies.
15. **Clue 15:** The person watching zombie movies and the owner of the hamster have the same parity positions.
16. **Clue 16:** The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies.
17. **Clue 17:** The owner of the bird is in an odd position.
18. **Clue 18:** The owner of the bird is not the person watching time-travel movies.
19. **Clue 19:** The person watching animation movies is not to the right of the owner of the bird.
20. **Clue 20:** The owner of the bird and the person watching animation movies have the same parity positions.
21. **Clue 21:** The person watching animation movies is not to the right of the person watching zombie movies.

### Initial Placements:
- From Clue 14, the owner of the ferret is the person watching time-travel movies. So, let's place ""time-travel"" in cell 4 for now.
- From Clue 17, the owner of the bird must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Let's try position 3 for now.
- From Clue 11, the owner of the bird is between the person watching action movies and the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person watching time-travel movies is in position 4, the person watching action movies must be in position 1 or 5.
- From Clue 18, the owner of the bird is not the person watching time-travel movies, so the owner of the bird cannot be in position 4.
- From Clue 12, the owner of the frog is not to the right of the owner of the cat. This means the owner of the cat must be to the left of the owner of the frog.
- From Clue 13, the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the owner of the ferret is in position 4, the owner of the hamster must be in position 2 or 6.

### Detailed Placement:
- Position 4: Time-travel (from Clue 14)
- Position 3: Bird (from Clue 17 and Clue 11)
- Position 1: Action (since the owner of the bird is between action and time-travel, and action can't be in 4)
- Position 6: Frog (since the owner of the bird is in 3 and the owner of the frog is not to the right of the owner of the cat)
- Position 2: Cat (since the owner of the cat is to the left of the owner of the frog)
- Position 5: Zombie (since the owner of the ferret is in 4 and the person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the owner of the dog, and from Clue 10)

Now, we need to place the remaining genres and pets:

- Animation: Must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), and not to the right of the person watching time-travel movies. So, it can be in position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is already occupied by action, it must be in position 3 (but 3 is already bird, so it must be in 5).
- Musical: Must be to the left of the owner of the ferret (position 4) and not to the right of the person watching animation movies. So, it can be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is action and 2 is cat, it must be in position 1.
- Satire: Must be to the left of the person watching zombie movies (position 6) and not to the right of the person watching satire movies. So, it can be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since position 1 is musical and 2 is cat, it must be in position 3 (but 3 is already bird, so it must be in 2).

So, the final placement is:

```
|               |    1    |      2      |     3     |   4    |   5    |   6    |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical | Satire      | Animation | Time-travel | Zombie | Frog   |
| Pet           | Bird   | Cat         | Dog      | Ferret    | Hamster|       |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```

   - Let's assume Water-polo is at position 1 for now.

2. **Swimming must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5)**:
   - Since Water-polo is at 1, Swimming must be at 3 or 5.

3. **Rugby must be to the right of Swimming**:
   - If Swimming is at 3, Rugby must be at 5 or 6.
   - If Swimming is at 5, Rugby must be at 6.

4. **Rugby cannot be to the right of Weightlifting**:
   - This means if Swimming is at 3, Rugby must be at 5.
   - If Swimming is at 5, Rugby must be at 6.

5. **Ice-hockey and Rat have the same parity positions**:
   - Ice-hockey can only be at 2, 4, or 6.

### Final Table Configuration

Based on these constraints, let's place the items:

1. **Water-polo**: 1
2. **Swimming**: 3
3. **Rugby**: 5
4. **Weightlifting**: 4 (since it has to be to the right of Swimming and different from Frog)
5. **Baseball**: 2 (since it has to be to the right of Fish and Lizard)
6. **Lizard**: 4 (since it has to be between Fish and Baseball, and also between Dog and Dog's adjacent pet)
7. **Fish**: 3 (since it has to be to the left of Lizard)
8. **Dog**: 2 (since it has to be to the left of Lizard)
9. **Frog**: 6 (since it has to be to the right of Fish and have a different parity from Weightlifting)
10. **Bird**: 5 (since it has to be to the right of Ice-hockey)

Thus, the final configuration is:
