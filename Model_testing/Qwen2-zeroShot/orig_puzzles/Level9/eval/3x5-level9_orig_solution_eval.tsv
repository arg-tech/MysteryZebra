Lv9-3x5-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items in their respective positions. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clues:
1. The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
2. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
3. The person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
4. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat.
5. The person drinking coffee and the person driving the quad-bike have different parity positions (odd/even).
6. The person drinking coffee is not to the left of the owner of the cat.
7. The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.
8. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
9. The person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda.
10. The person drinking sprite is not to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
11. The person driving the scooter is not to the left of the person driving the trike.
12. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the person driving the trike.
13. The person drinking sprite is in an odd position.
14. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the owner of the cat.

18. The person drinking coffee and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions.
19. The owner of the rat and the person driving the quad-bike have different parity positions.

#### Initial Setup:
|             |    1     |    2    |     3      |    4    |    5     |
| Beverage    |          |         |            |         |          |
| Pet         |          |         |            |         |          |
| Transport   |          |         |            |         |          |

### Deductions:
1. **Sprite in an odd position**: Sprite must be in position 1 or 3.
2. **Coffee and Quad-bike have different parity positions**: Coffee cannot be in position 2, 4 (since it would make both even), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
3. **Owner of the Rabbit to the right of Scooter**: If Rabbit is in an even position, Scooter must be to its right in an odd position.
4. **Subway to the right of Quad-bike**: This places Subway in an even position if Quad-bike is in an odd position.
5. **Owner of the Rat to the left or right of Sprite**: Since Sprite is in an odd position, Rat can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
6. **Guinea-pig to the left or right of Rat**: This gives us more flexibility for Guinea-pig's position.
7. **Train to the right of Mirinda**: Train must be in an even position if Mirinda is in an odd position.
8. **Iced-tea to the left of Cat**: Cat must be in an even position if Iced-tea is in an odd position.
9. **Sprite not to the left of Guinea-pig**: Sprite cannot be in position 1 if Guinea-pig is in position 2.
10. **Scooter not to the left of Trike**: Scooter must be in an even position if Trike is in an odd position.
11. **Iced-tea not to the left of Trike**: Trike must be in an even position if Iced-tea is in an odd position.

### Positioning:
- **Sprite in position 1**: 
  - Coffee in position 3 (since it must be in an odd position and not with Quad-bike)
  - Quad-bike in position 2 (since it must be to the left of Coffee and have different parity)
  - Scooter in position 4 (since it must be to the right of Rabbit)
  - Subway in position 5 (since it must be to the right of Quad-bike)
  - Train in position 3 (since it must be to the right of Mirinda and not conflicting with other positions)

- **Rabbit in position 2**:
  - Guinea-pig in position 4 (since it must be to the left or right of Rat and not conflicting with other positions)
  - Rat in position 5 (since it must be to the left or right of Sprite and not conflicting with other positions)
  - Mirinda in position 1 (since it must be to the left of Train and not conflicting with other positions)
  - Iced-tea in position 3 (since it must be to the left of Cat and not conflicting with other positions)

- **Cat in position 5**:
  - Lemonade in position 2 (since it must be to the left of Cat and not conflicting with other positions)

### Final Solution Table:

Lv9-3x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will systematically analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 12**: The person driving the snowmobile is the coach.
   - Coach: Snowmobile

2. **Clue 13**: The person driving the subway is on the far left.
   - Subway: 1

3. **Clue 15**: The chef is on the right of the person driving the subway.
   - Chef: 5 (since the person driving the subway is in position 1)

4. **Clue 17**: The lawyer is somewhere to the left of the chef.
   - Lawyer: 2 or 3

5. **Clue 16**: The person driving the train and the lawyer have different parity positions.
   - Since the lawyer can be in position 2 or 3, the person driving the train must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

6. **Clue 14**: The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the bird.
   - This means the bird owner cannot be in position 5, and the rat owner must be in a position to the right of the bird owner.

7. **Clue 5**: The lawyer is not the owner of the horse.
   - This means the lawyer cannot be in position 3 if the horse is there.

8. **Clue 6**: The person driving the motorbike is not the owner of the turtle.
   - This means the person driving the motorbike cannot be in position 2 or 4 if the turtle is there.

9. **Clue 7**: The owner of the turtle is on the left of the owner of the mouse.
   - This means the turtle owner must be in position 1 or 2, and the mouse owner must be in position 2 or 3.

10. **Clue 3**: The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person driving the motorbike.
    - Since the snowmobile is in position 5, the motorbike must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

11. **Clue 8**: The librarian and the person driving the motorbike have different parity positions.
    - If the motorbike is in position 1 (odd), the librarian must be in position 2 or 4 (even).

    - If the motorbike is in position 3 (odd), the librarian must be in position 2 or 4 (even).

12. **Clue 9**: The owner of the bird is not to the left of the owner of the mouse.
    - This means the bird owner cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the mouse owner is in position 2 or 3.

13. **Clue 10**: The doctor is not to the left of the person driving the train.
    - This means the doctor must be in position 3 or 4 if the train is in position 1 or 2, or in position 4 or 5 if the train is in position 3 or 4.

14. **Clue 11**: The person driving the snowmobile is the coach.
    - We already know this from Clue 12.

15. **Clue 18**: The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway.
    - This means the mouse owner must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

### Final Deduction:

Let's place the information in the table:

|             |   1    |   2   |     3     |     4     |     5      |

| Transport   | Subway |       |           |           | Snowmobile |

- **Subway** is at position 1.
- **Coach** is at position 5.
- **Librarian** must be in an even position (position 2 or 4) and cannot be in position 2 (since the lawyer is there). Therefore, the librarian is in position 4.
- **Lawyer** is in position 2.
- **Train** must be in position 3 because it is an odd position and the lawyer is in an even position.
- **Doctor** must be in position 4 (since the train is in position 3 and they have different parity positions).

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:

- **Turtle** owner must be in position 1 or 2, and the mouse owner must be in position 2 or 3. Since the lawyer is in position 2, the mouse owner must be in position 3. Therefore, the turtle owner is in position 1.
- **Bird** owner must be in position 4 or 5. Since the rat owner must be to the right of the bird owner, the bird owner must be in position 4, and the rat owner is in position 5.
- **Horse** owner cannot be the lawyer, so the horse owner must be in position 3 (the only remaining position for the horse).

From Clue 11, let's assume:
- Freelancer (Family Movies) is in position 2.
- Fan Jazz is in position 1.
- Fan d&b is in position 3.

So, the table now looks like:
```

```

3. **The person watching family movies is not to the left of the project-manager** (Clue 9). Since Freelancer (Family Movies) is in position 2, the project-manager must be in position 4 or 5.

4. **The fan d&b is not to the left of the fan techno** (Clue 10). Since fan d&b is in position 3, fan techno must be in position 4 or 5.

5. **The fan techno is in an odd position** (Clue 1). So, fan techno must be in position 3 or 5. But since fan d&b is in position 3, fan techno must be in position 5.

So, the table now looks like:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3     |    4     |        5        |

```

7. **The fan gospel and the person watching animation movies have different parity positions** (Clue 4). Since the dancer is in position 4, the person watching animation movies must be in an even position (2 or 4). But dancer is in position 4, so it must be in position 2.

So, the table now looks like:
```

```

12. **The freelancer is the person watching family movies** (Clue 12). This is already placed correctly.

13. **The person watching musical movies is not to the left of the project-manager** (Clue 9). Since the person watching musical movies is in position 3, the project-manager must be in position 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of Time-Travel and Drama Movies:**
   - Clue 1 and Clue 9: Time-travel must be in an odd position (1 or 3), and Drama must be to its right.
   - Since Adventure is in an even position (Clue 4), Drama cannot be in position 4. Thus, Time-travel is in position 1 and Drama is in position 2.
   
2. **Position of Adventure Movies:**
   - Clue 4: Adventure is in position 2 or 4.
   - Clue 10: Adventure is either to the left or right of Skydiving.
   - Clue 5: Drawing is between Skydiving and Time-travel. Since Time-travel is in position 1, Drawing must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, Adventure must be in position 4.

3. **Position of Skydiving and Musical Movies:**
   - Clue 7: Skydiving is on the right of Musical.
   - Clue 5: Drawing (position 3) is between Skydiving and Time-travel (position 1). So, Skydiving must be in position 5.

Lv9-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step 1: List the constraints and deduce possible positions

1. **Paramedic is not the person eating mango**.
2. **Avocado and Scientific have the same parity positions** (even or odd).
3. **Western is to the right of Mango**.
4. **Animation is to the right of Paramedic**.
5. **Superhero is on the far right (position 5)**.
6. **Action is to the left of Cabbage**.
7. **Superhero is Garlic**.
8. **Artichoke is not to the left of Paramedic**.
9. **Mechanic and Scientific have different parity positions**.
10. **Avocado is not Action**.
11. **Project-manager is to the right of Mechanic**.
12. **Cabbage is to the right of Scientific**.
13. **Paramedic is to the left or right of Mango**.
14. **Artichoke is to the left or right of Teacher**.
15. **Project-manager is in the middle (position 3)**.
16. **Action is not to the left of Artichoke**.
17. **Avocado is not to the right of Mechanic**.
18. **Action is not to the left of Avocado**.
19. **Cabbage is not to the left of Animation**.

### Step 2: Deduce positions

From constraint 5:
- Superhero is in position 5.

From constraint 15:
- Project-manager is in position 3.

From constraint 4:
- Animation must be to the right of Paramedic.

From constraint 13:
- Paramedic is to the left or right of Mango.

From constraint 2:
- Avocado and Scientific have the same parity positions. So they can either both be in even positions (2, 4) or both in odd positions (1, 3, 5).

From constraint 3:
- Western is to the right of Mango. So if Mango is in 1, Western can only be in 2, 3, 4, or 5. If Mango is in 2, Western can only be in 3, 4, or 5. And so on.

From constraint 6:
- Action is to the left of Cabbage.

From constraint 12:
- Cabbage is to the right of Scientific.

From constraint 10:
- Avocado is not Action.

From constraint 17:
- Avocado is not to the right of Mechanic.

From constraint 18:
- Action is not to the left of Avocado.

From constraint 19:
- Cabbage is not to the left of Animation.

### Step 3: Solve the puzzle

Let's start placing values based on these constraints:

1. Since Project-manager is in position 3, we place ""Project-manager"" in position 3.
2. Superhero is in position 5.
3. Paramedic cannot be in position 5 (since Superhero is there), so Paramedic could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But Mango cannot be in 5 (from constraint 3). So Paramedic can be in 1, 2, or 4.
4. Let's assume Paramedic is in 1 (we will check consistency later).
5. Mango can be in 2, 4, or 5 (but not 5 as Western is to the right of Mango and Western is in 5). So Mango can be in 2 or 4.
6. Since Paramedic is in 1 and Mango is not in 1, Mango can be in 2 or 4.
7. If Mango is in 2, Western must be in 3 or 4 (but 3 is occupied by Project-manager). So Mango must be in 4.
8. Paramedic is in 1, Mango is in 4, and Western must be in 5.
9. Since Paramedic is in 1, and Mango is in 4, Paramedic cannot be Mango, so Paramedic is in 1.
10. Since Paramedic is in 1, Mango is in 4, and Western is in 5, Avocado and Scientific must be in 2 and 3 (or 3 and 2).
11. Since Mechanic and Scientific have different parity positions, if Scientific is in 2, Mechanic must be in 3 (which is already occupied by Project-manager), so Scientific must be in 3 and Mechanic in 2.
12. Animation must be to the right of Paramedic, so Animation can be in 2 or 4 (but 2 is occupied by Mechanic). So Animation is in 4.
13. Action is to the left of Cabbage, and Cabbage is to the right of Scientific, so Cabbage must be in 5 (but it's already occupied by Western).
14. Therefore, Cabbage must be in 3, and Action must be in 2.
15. Artichoke is to the left or right of Teacher, and since Artichoke is not to the left of Paramedic (1), and Paramedic is in 1, Artichoke must be in 2 or 4 (but 2 is occupied by Mechanic). So Artichoke is in 4.
16. Teacher must be in 5 (since Cabbage is in 3 and Action is in 2).

So, let's place all the values:

|               |     1      |     2     |        3        |    4    |     5     |
| Food          | Paramedic  | Mechanic  | Project-manager | Artichoke | Teacher  |
| Job           | Mango      | Avocado   | Cabbage         | Garlic   | Superhero |
