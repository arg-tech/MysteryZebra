Lv9-3x3-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The Dutch is on the far left or far right.
   - This means the Dutch person can be either in position 1 or 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating artichoke is between the fan of jazz and the person eating cucumber.
   - This means if we denote the positions as 1, 2, and 3, and let A be the person eating artichoke, J be the fan of jazz, and C be the person eating cucumber, then the sequence must be J-A-C or C-A-J.

3. **Clue 3:** The fan of house and the Brazilian have different parity positions.
   - This means if one is in an odd position (1 or 3), the other must be in an even position (2).

4. **Clue 4:** The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the Dutch.
   - If the Dutch is in position 1, the artichoke eater cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The fan of pop is on the right of the fan of jazz.
   - This means if P is the fan of pop and J is the fan of jazz, then P must be in a position to the right of J.

Now, let's analyze these clues together:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Dutch Position:**
   - From Clue 1, the Dutch can be in position 1 or 3.
   
2. **Artichoke Eater:**
   - From Clue 2, the artichoke eater must be between the jazz fan and the cucumber eater.
   - From Clue 4, the artichoke eater must be to the right of the Dutch.

3. **House Fan and Brazilian:**
   - From Clue 3, the house fan and Brazilian must be in different parity positions.

4. **Pop and Jazz Fans:**
   - From Clue 5, the pop fan must be to the right of the jazz fan.

### Possible Arrangements:

#### Case 1: Dutch in Position 1
- If the Dutch is in position 1, the artichoke eater must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the artichoke eater is to the right of the Dutch, the artichoke eater must be in position 2 or 3.
- Let's assume the artichoke eater is in position 2 (the only feasible position since it must be between the jazz fan and cucumber eater).

- Now, the jazz fan and cucumber eater must be in positions 1 and 3 (since the artichoke eater is in position 2).
- Since the Dutch is in position 1, the jazz fan must be in position 3 (to satisfy the parity condition with the Brazilian).

- This leaves the Brazilian in position 2 (since the jazz fan is in position 3).

- Now, we need to assign the foods and music genres:
  - The person in position 1 (Dutch) cannot eat artichoke (since the artichoke eater is in position 2).
  - The person in position 3 (jazz fan) cannot eat cucumber (since the cucumber eater is in position 2).
  - The person in position 2 (Brazilian) can eat artichoke (since it's the only remaining option).

- Assigning the remaining foods and music genres:
  - The Brazilian (position 2) eats artichoke.
  - The jazz fan (position 3) could eat cranberry or cucumber.
  - The Dutch (position 1) could eat cranberry or cucumber.
  - The pop fan must be to the right of the jazz fan, so the pop fan must be in position 3.

This results in a contradiction because the jazz fan and pop fan cannot both be in position 3.

#### Case 2: Dutch in Position 3
- If the Dutch is in position 3, the artichoke eater must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the artichoke eater is to the right of the Dutch, the artichoke eater must be in position 2.

- Now, the jazz fan and cucumber eater must be in positions 1 and 3 (since the artichoke eater is in position 2).
- Since the Dutch is in position 3, the jazz fan must be in position 1 (to satisfy the parity condition with the Brazilian).

- This leaves the Brazilian in position 2 (since the jazz fan is in position 1).

- Now, we need to assign the foods and music genres:
  - The person in position 1 (jazz fan) cannot eat artichoke (since the artichoke eater is in position 2).
  - The person in position 2 (Brazilian) can eat artichoke (since it's the only remaining option).
  - The person in position 3 (Dutch) can eat cranberry or cucumber.
  - The pop fan must be to the right of the jazz fan, so the pop fan must be in position 3.

This results in a valid arrangement:
- Position 1: Jazz fan, eats cranberry or cucumber
- Position 2: Brazilian, eats artichoke
- Position 3: Dutch, eats cranberry or cucumber

Lv9-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The Mexican is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
2. The Egyptian is the person watching documentary movies.
3. The Egyptian is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies.
4. The Egyptian and the person driving the scooter have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
5. The person driving the roller is the person driving the roller (this clue is tautological and doesn't provide new information).
6. The Chinese is somewhere between the Egyptian and the person driving the scooter.
7. The person watching romance movies and the person driving the roller have different parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Egyptian's Position and Genre
- From Clue 2, the Egyptian watches documentary movies.
- From Clue 3, the Egyptian is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies.
- From Clue 4, the Egyptian and the person driving the scooter have the same parity positions.

Since there are only three positions, let's place the Egyptian in one of them and see if it fits all clues.

**Assume the Egyptian is in position 1:**
- The Egyptian watches documentary movies.
- The Egyptian and the person driving the scooter must have the same parity (both odd or both even).

**If the Egyptian is in position 1:**
- The person driving the scooter must be in position 3 (same parity as 1).
- The person watching fantasy movies cannot be in position 1 (Clue 1), so they must be in position 2 or 3.
- If the person watching fantasy movies is in position 2, then the person watching romance movies must be in position 3 (Clue 7).

This configuration does not fit all clues since we need the Chinese to be between the Egyptian and the person driving the scooter, and the person watching romance movies and the person driving the roller must have different parity positions.

**Assume the Egyptian is in position 2:**
- The Egyptian watches documentary movies.
- The person driving the scooter must be in position 1 or 3 (same parity as 2, which is even).

**If the Egyptian is in position 2 and the person driving the scooter is in position 3:**
- The person watching fantasy movies cannot be in position 2 (Clue 1), so they must be in position 1 or 3.
- Since the person driving the scooter is in position 3, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 1.
- The person watching romance movies must be in position 3 (Clue 7).

Now, the Chinese must be between the Egyptian and the person driving the scooter, which is already satisfied with the positions.

**Final Configuration:**
- Position 1: Person driving the scooter (same parity as Egyptian, so even)
- Position 2: Egyptian (documentary movies)
- Position 3: Person watching romance movies (different parity from scooter, so odd)

### Final Table:

Lv9-3x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given clues to fill in the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The mechanic is on the right of the scientist.
2. The owner of the goldfish and the mechanic have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
3. The owner of the ferret is in the middle.
4. The scientist is not to the left of the scientist (which is redundant as it just means the scientist can be in any position).
5. The person watching epic movies is between the owner of the rat and the person watching romance movies.
6. The person watching epic movies is not to the right of the owner of the rat.
7. The scientist is not to the right of the owner of the rat.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Positioning the Scientist:
From clue 1, we know the scientist must be in position 1 or 2 (since the mechanic must be to the right). Let's try placing the scientist in position 1 first and see if it works.

#### Positioning the Mechanic:
If the scientist is in position 1, then the mechanic must be in position 2 or 3. But from clue 7, the scientist cannot be to the right of the owner of the rat. So, the scientist cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the scientist must be in position 2.

#### Placing the Mechanic:
Since the scientist is in position 2, the mechanic must be in position 3.

#### Positioning the Ferret Owner:
From clue 3, the owner of the ferret is in the middle. So, the owner of the ferret must be in position 2, which conflicts with the scientist. Thus, the scientist must be in position 3, and the owner of the ferret must be in position 1.

#### Parity Check:
From clue 2, the owner of the goldfish and the mechanic have the same parity positions. Since the mechanic is in position 3 (odd), the owner of the goldfish must also be in an odd position. The only available odd position is 1, so the owner of the goldfish must be in position 1.

#### Remaining Positions:
- Position 1: Owner of the goldfish
- Position 2: Scientist
- Position 3: Mechanic

Now, let's place the jobs, movie genres, and pets.

#### Jobs:
- From clue 4, the scientist is not to the left of the scientist, so the scientist can be in any position but must be in position 2.
- From clue 1, the mechanic is to the right of the scientist, so the mechanic must be in position 3.
- The only job left for position 1 is the photographer.

So:
- Position 1: Photographer
- Position 2: Scientist
- Position 3: Mechanic

#### Movie Genres:
- From clue 5, the person watching epic movies is between the owner of the rat and the person watching romance movies.
- From clue 6, the person watching epic movies is not to the right of the owner of the rat.
- From clue 7, the scientist is not to the right of the owner of the rat.

Given these constraints, the only logical placement is:
- Position 1: Romantic movies (owner of the goldfish)
- Position 2: Epic movies (scientist)
- Position 3: Romance movies (mechanic)

#### Pets:
- The owner of the ferret is in the middle (position 1), so the ferret is owned by the photographer.
- The owner of the rat must be in position 3, so the rat is owned by the mechanic.
- The goldfish is owned by the owner of the goldfish (position 1).

So, the final solution is:

```

Lv9-3x3-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the three types of food, movie genres, and modes of transport into their respective columns while satisfying all the given conditions. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Conditions Recap:
1. The person watching disaster movies and the person eating pear have the same parity positions.
2. The person watching scientific movies is not to the right of the person driving the van.
3. The person eating kale is on the right of the person driving the van.
4. The person driving the subway and the person watching scientific movies have different parity positions.
5. The person driving the subway is somewhere between the person eating pear and the person driving the van.
6. The person watching disaster movies is not to the right of the person driving the ship.
7. The person watching drama movies and the person driving the van have different parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Condition 3 and Condition 5
- From condition 3: The person eating kale must be on the right of the person driving the van.
- From condition 5: The person driving the subway is between the person eating pear and the person driving the van.

This means:
- The person driving the van cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no space for the person driving the subway).
- The person driving the van must be in position 3 (since the person eating kale must be on the right of the person driving the van).

So, we have:
- Van (V) in position 3.
- Kale (K) in position 4 or 5 (but since there's no position 4 or 5, K must be in position 3 as well).

This conflicts with our earlier deduction that Van is in position 3. So, let's correct this and place:
- Van (V) in position 3.
- Kale (K) in position 2.

#### Step 2: Analyze Condition 2 and Condition 4
- From condition 2: The person watching scientific movies is not to the right of the person driving the van.
- From condition 4: The person driving the subway and the person watching scientific movies have different parity positions.

Since Van is in position 3, the person watching scientific movies cannot be in position 4 (position 4 does not exist, so it can't be in 3 or 4).

Let's assume:
- Scientific (S) is in position 1.
- Disaster (D) is in position 2 (since D and pear have the same parity positions, and K is in position 2, D must be in position 2).

Now, we have:
- Disaster (D) in position 2.
- Scientific (S) in position 1.
- Van (V) in position 3.
- Kale (K) in position 2 (conflict, so re-evaluate).

Re-evaluating:
- Scientific (S) in position 2.
- Disaster (D) in position 1.
- Van (V) in position 3.
- Kale (K) in position 2.

#### Step 3: Analyze Condition 6 and Condition 7
- From condition 6: The person watching disaster movies is not to the right of the person driving the ship.
- From condition 7: The person watching drama movies and the person driving the van have different parity positions.

Since Disaster (D) is in position 1, the person driving the ship cannot be in position 2 (right of position 1).

Let's assume:
- Ship (Sh) in position 1.
- Subway (Su) in position 2.
- Van (V) in position 3.
- Kale (K) in position 4 (no conflict).

Now, we have:
- Ship (Sh) in position 1.
- Subway (Su) in position 2.
- Van (V) in position 3.
- Kale (K) in position 4.

Finally, we assign the remaining:
- Drama (Dr) in position 1.
- Scientific (S) in position 2.
- Disaster (D) in position 3.
- Pear (P) in position 4.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |   2    |    3     |
| Food          |    Pear    |  Kale  |  Spinach |
| Movie-Genre   |   Drama    |Scientific|Disaster  |
| Transport     |   Ship     | Subway |   Van    |
```

This configuration satisfies all the given conditions."	{'food': ['pear', 'kale', 'spinach'], 'movie-genre': ['drama', 'scientific', 'disaster'], 'transport': ['ship', 'subway', 'van']}	True	3	False
Lv9-3x3-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The Dutch and the social-worker have different parity positions.
2. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the bus.
3. The person driving the bus is on the right of the Pakistani.
4. The social-worker is not to the left of the Pakistani.
5. The person driving the roller is on the right of the electrician.
6. The person driving the bus is the Nigerian.
7. The Pakistani and the pilot have different parity positions.
8. The person driving the bus and the Nigerian have the same parity positions.
9. The person driving the bus is not the electrician.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 6: The person driving the bus is the Nigerian.
This means the Nigerian drives the bus.

#### Clue 8: The person driving the bus and the Nigerian have the same parity positions.
Since the Nigerian drives the bus, this means the Nigerian is in position 2 (middle).

#### Clue 3: The person driving the bus is on the right of the Pakistani.
Since the Nigerian is in position 2, the Pakistani must be in position 1, and the bus driver (Nigerian) is in position 2.

#### Clue 4: The social-worker is not to the left of the Pakistani.
Since the Pakistani is in position 1, the social-worker cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the social-worker must be in position 3.

#### Clue 7: The Pakistani and the pilot have different parity positions.
Since the Pakistani is in position 1 (odd), the pilot must be in position 3 (odd). This means the social-worker, who is in position 3, is the pilot.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Pakistani
- Position 2: Nigerian (driving the bus)
- Position 3: Social-worker (pilot)

#### Clue 2: The person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the bus.
Since the person driving the bus is in position 2, the person driving the roller must be in position 1, which is the Pakistani. This contradicts our earlier placement, so let's re-evaluate.

Given the Pakistani is in position 1, the roller must be in position 1, and the bus in position 2. The only job left for the Pakistani is the social-worker (since it can't be the electrician or the pilot).

#### Re-evaluating:
- Position 1: Pakistani (social-worker)
- Position 2: Nigerian (driving the bus)
- Position 3: Electrician

#### Clue 5: The person driving the roller is on the right of the electrician.
Since the roller is driven by the Pakistani (position 1), and the electrician is in position 3, this clue is satisfied.

#### Clue 9: The person driving the bus is not the electrician.
This is already satisfied since the bus is driven by the Nigerian, and the electrician is in position 3.

#### Final Table:
| Job            | Electrician  | Social-worker | Pilot         |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Nationality    | Pakistani    | Dutch         | Nigerian      |

Lv9-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The owner of the chinchilla and the person who's hobby is hiking have the same parity positions.
   - This means that if the chinchilla owner is in an odd position, the hobbyist for hiking must also be in an odd position (1 or 3), and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is between the owner of the dog and the person eating cauliflower.
   - This implies that the person with the hobby of filmmaking is in the middle position when the owner of the dog and the person eating cauliflower are placed.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is not the person eating cauliflower.
   - So, the person with the hobby of filmmaking cannot be the one eating cauliflower.

4. **Clue 4:** The person eating broccoli is not to the right of the person eating asparagus.
   - This means the person eating asparagus must be to the right of the person eating broccoli.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is dancing is not the person eating cauliflower.
   - This means the person with the hobby of dancing cannot be the one eating cauliflower.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli.
   - This means the person with the hobby of dancing must be either immediately to the left or immediately to the right of the person eating broccoli.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
- From Clue 2, we know that the person with the hobby of filmmaking is in the middle position.
- From Clue 4, we know that the person eating asparagus must be to the right of the person eating broccoli.

This gives us two possible scenarios:
1. Broccoli (B) - Asparagus (A) - Filmmaking (F)
2. Asparagus (A) - Broccoli (B) - Filmmaking (F)

#### Step 2: Use Clue 1
- The chinchilla owner and the hiking person must be in the same parity position.

#### Step 3: Use Clue 6
- The person with the hobby of dancing must be next to the person eating broccoli.

Let's test both scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Broccoli - Asparagus - Filmmaking**
- Dancing must be next to broccoli, so it can only be in position 1 or 3.
- If dancing is in position 1, then the chinchilla owner and the hiking person must be in position 3 (both odd).
- If dancing is in position 3, then the chinchilla owner and the hiking person must be in position 1 (both even).

Testing these:
- If dancing is in position 1, then the chinchilla owner and the hiking person are in position 3. But this would place the person eating cauliflower in position 2, which contradicts Clue 3 (the person with the hobby of filmmaking is not the person eating cauliflower).
- If dancing is in position 3, then the chinchilla owner and the hiking person are in position 1. This places the person eating cauliflower in position 2, which satisfies Clue 3.

So, Scenario 1 works:
- Position 1: Dancing
- Position 2: Filmmaking
- Position 3: Chinchilla

Now, we need to assign the remaining food and pet:
- Asparagus (A) - Broccoli (B) - Filmmaking (F)
- Chinchilla (C) - Dog (D) - Goat (G)

Since the person with the hobby of dancing is not eating cauliflower, and the person with the hobby of filmmaking is not eating cauliflower, we can assign the foods:
- Position 1 (Dancing): Asparagus (A)
- Position 2 (Filmmaking): Broccoli (B)
- Position 3 (Chinchilla): Cauliflower (C)

Finally, we assign the pets:
- Position 1 (Dancing): Dog (D)
- Position 2 (Filmmaking): Goat (G)
- Position 3 (Chinchilla): Chinchilla (C)

Lv9-3x3-7	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill out the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The British and the person driving the car have the same parity positions.**
   - This means if the British person is in an odd position, the driver of the car must be in an odd position, and vice versa.

2. **The person driving the car is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is badminton.**
   - The person who drives the car cannot be in position 1 (leftmost), and the person who plays badminton cannot be in position 3 (rightmost).

3. **The Japanese is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.**
   - This means the Japanese person is not in position 1, and the person who plays soccer is not in position 3.

4. **The person driving the bus is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the person driving the bus is either in position 1 or position 3.

5. **The Indonesian is in an even position.**
   - The Indonesian person can only be in position 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 2 is even, so the Indonesian is in position 2.**

   |               |     1     |     2      |      3       |
   | Nationality   |           | Indonesian |              |

   | Transport     |           |            |              |

2. **The person driving the bus is on the far left or far right.**

   - Since the Indonesian is in position 2, the bus driver cannot be there.
   - Therefore, the bus driver must be in position 1 or 3.

3. **The British and the person driving the car have the same parity positions.**

   - If the British person is in an odd position, the car driver must also be in an odd position.
   - If the British person is in an even position, the car driver must also be in an even position.

4. **The person driving the car is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is badminton.**

   - The person who drives the car cannot be in position 1.
   - The person who plays badminton cannot be in position 3.

5. **The Japanese is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.**

   - The Japanese person is not in position 1, and the person who plays soccer is not in position 3.

### Possible Configurations:

- Let's assume the bus driver is in position 1:
  - The car driver must be in position 3 (since it has to be an odd position and not position 1).
  - The British person must be in position 1 (to match the same parity with the car driver).

  | Transport     | Bus       |            | Car          |

- The Japanese person cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 3.
- The person playing soccer cannot be in position 3, so they must be in position 2.

Lv9-3x3-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

### Step 1: Analyze and Place the Person Eating Pepper
- Constraint 7: The person eating pepper is in the middle.
- This means the person eating pepper is in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
| Food          |             |   Pepper      |                 |
| Job           |             |               |                 |
| Music-Genre   |             |               |                 |
```

### Step 2: Analyze and Place the Fan Gospel and the Person Eating Lettuce
- Constraint 5: The fan gospel and the person eating lettuce have the same parity positions (both are either in odd or even positions).
- Since position 2 is occupied by the person eating pepper, the person eating lettuce must be in position 1 or 3.
- Constraint 8: The fan house is somewhere to the right of the fan gospel.
- Constraint 4: The fan house is not to the left of the person eating lettuce.
- Constraint 2: The person eating lettuce is not to the right of the electrician.
- Constraint 6: The fan house is somewhere between the fan indie and the electrician.
- From these, we can deduce that the fan gospel cannot be in position 1 (since it would force the fan house to be in an invalid position).

So, the fan gospel must be in position 3, and the person eating lettuce must be in position 1.

Thus, we have:
```
|               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
| Food          |  Lettuce    |   Pepper      |                 |
| Job           |             |               |                 |
| Music-Genre   |             |               |                 |
```

### Step 3: Determine the Fan Gospel and Fan Indie
- Since the fan gospel is in position 3, the fan indie must be in position 1 (same parity as position 1).
- From constraint 6, the fan house must be between the fan indie and the electrician. Therefore, the fan house must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
| Food          |  Lettuce    |   Pepper      |                 |
| Job           |             |               |                 |
| Music-Genre   |  Indie      |   House       |  Gospel         |
```

### Step 4: Determine the Remaining Jobs and Foods
- The remaining job for position 1 is the electrician.
- The remaining job for position 3 is the social worker.
- The remaining food for position 3 is the peach.
- The remaining food for position 1 is the pepper.
- The remaining food for position 2 is the lettuce.

So, we have:
```
|               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
| Food          |  Pepper     |   Lettuce     |   Peach         |
| Job           |  Electrician|  Project-Manager| Social-Worker  |
| Music-Genre   |  Indie      |   House       |  Gospel         |
```

### Final Solution Table:

Lv9-3x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the information into the table.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking cola.**
   - This means if cola is in position 1, soy-milk must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If cola is in position 2, soy-milk must be in position 3.

2. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person eating kiwi.**
   - This means if kiwi is in position 1, soy-milk must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If kiwi is in position 2, soy-milk must be in position 3.

3. **The person eating pineapple is not to the left of the owner of the goldfish.**
   - This means the owner of the goldfish cannot be in position 1 if pineapple is in position 1, or in position 2 if pineapple is in position 2.

4. **The owner of the guinea-pig and the person drinking cola have the same parity positions.**
   - If cola is in an odd position (1), the guinea-pig owner must also be in an odd position.
   - If cola is in an even position (2 or 3), the guinea-pig owner must also be in an even position.

5. **The person drinking cola is on the right of the person eating pineapple.**
   - This means if pineapple is in position 1, cola must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If pineapple is in position 2, cola must be in position 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The person drinking cola is on the right of the person eating pineapple.
   - Possible pairs: (Pineapple, Cola) = (1, 2) or (1, 3) or (2, 3)

2. **Clue 1 & 5:** Combining with Clue 5:
   - If cola is in position 3, then soy-milk must be in position 2.
   - So, the pair (Pineapple, Cola) = (1, 3).

3. **Clue 2:** The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person eating kiwi.
   - Since cola is in position 3, soy-milk must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, kiwi must be in position 1.

4. **Clue 3:** The person eating pineapple is not to the left of the owner of the goldfish.
   - With pineapple in position 1, the goldfish owner cannot be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the goldfish owner must be in position 2 or 3.

5. **Clue 4:** The owner of the guinea-pig and the person drinking cola have the same parity positions.
   - Since cola is in position 3 (odd), the guinea-pig owner must also be in an odd position.
   - Therefore, the guinea-pig owner must be in position 1 or 3.
   - Since pineapple is in position 1, the guinea-pig owner cannot be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the guinea-pig owner must be in position 3.

6. **Final Placement:**
   - Position 1: Kiwi
   - Position 2: Soy-milk
   - Position 3: Cola
   - Goldfish owner in position 3 (guinea-pig owner)
   - Pineapple in position 1
   - Remaining pet: Pony in position 2

### Final Table:

```
|            |     1     |     2      |    3     |

Lv9-3x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the scooter is on the left of the owner of the bird.
   - This means the scooter driver cannot be in position 3 (rightmost), and the bird owner must be to the right of the scooter driver.

2. **Clue 2**: The person watching animation movies and the owner of the bird have different parity positions.
   - Animation watcher and bird owner have different positions (one is odd, one is even).

3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the ship is between the person driving the boat and the person driving the scooter.
   - This implies that the order of drivers is: Boat, Ship, Scooter or Scooter, Ship, Boat.

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching superhero movies and the owner of the goldfish have the same parity positions.
   - Superhero watcher and goldfish owner have the same positions (both odd or both even).

5. **Clue 5**: The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish.
   - This means the superhero watcher is in a position to the right of the goldfish owner.

### Analyzing and Placing Information:

1. **Driver Order**:
   - From Clue 3, the order of drivers is Boat, Ship, Scooter or Scooter, Ship, Boat.

2. **Scooter Driver Position**:
   - From Clue 1, the scooter driver cannot be in position 3. So, the scooter driver can only be in position 1 or 2.

3. **Bird Owner Position**:
   - If the scooter driver is in position 1, the bird owner must be in position 2 or 3. If the scooter driver is in position 2, the bird owner must be in position 1 or 3.

4. **Animation and Bird Owner Parity**:
   - If the bird owner is in an odd position (1 or 3), the animation watcher must be in an even position (2). If the bird owner is in an even position (2), the animation watcher must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

5. **Ship Driver Position**:
   - The ship driver must be between the boat and scooter drivers. This restricts the possible positions for the ship driver based on the driver order.

6. **Superhero and Goldfish Parity**:
   - The superhero watcher and goldfish owner must have the same parity. If the superhero watcher is in an odd position, the goldfish owner must also be in an odd position. If the superhero watcher is in an even position, the goldfish owner must also be in an even position.

7. **Superhero Watcher Position**:
   - The superhero watcher is to the right of the goldfish owner.

### Final Placement:

- Let's assume the order of drivers is Boat, Ship, Scooter.
  - The scooter driver must be in position 1 or 2.
  - If the scooter driver is in position 1, the bird owner must be in position 2 (since the scooter driver is on the left of the bird owner).
  - The bird owner being in position 2 means the animation watcher must be in position 3 (since they have different parity positions).
  - The ship driver must be in position 2 (between the boat and scooter drivers), which conflicts with the bird owner being in position 2.
  - Therefore, the scooter driver must be in position 2, and the bird owner must be in position 3.

- Now, the order is Boat, Ship, Scooter.
  - The ship driver is in position 2.
  - The bird owner is in position 3.
  - The bird owner having different parity from the animation watcher means the animation watcher must be in position 1.
  - The superhero watcher and goldfish owner must have the same parity. Since the superhero watcher is to the right of the goldfish owner, the goldfish owner must be in position 1 (even) and the superhero watcher in position 3 (odd).
