Lv9-2x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. **The owner of the rabbit is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.**
   - This means that the rabbit and the horse cannot be in the middle position (position 2).

2. **The Mexican is not to the left of the German.**
   - This means the German must be at least as far right as the Mexican.

3. **The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.**
   - This confirms that the rabbit and the horse cannot be in the middle position, and the rabbit must be to the right of the horse.

4. **The owner of the hamster and the German have the same parity positions.**
   - If the German is in an even position, the hamster must also be in an even position. If the German is in an odd position, the hamster must also be in an odd position.

5. **The owner of the hamster is not to the left of the Mexican.**
   - This means the Mexican must be at least as far right as the hamster.

6. **The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the Egyptian.**
   - The rabbit must be in position 1 or 2, and the Egyptian must be in position 3 if the rabbit is in position 1, or in position 2 if the rabbit is in position 2.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- From clue 1, the rabbit and the horse cannot be in position 2.
- From clue 2, the German cannot be in position 1, and the Mexican cannot be in position 1 either.
- From clue 3, the rabbit must be to the right of the horse, so the only possible positions for the rabbit and the horse are (1, 3) or (2, 3).
- From clue 4, the German and the hamster must have the same parity positions.
- From clue 5, the Mexican must be to the right of the hamster.
- From clue 6, the rabbit must be to the left of the Egyptian.

Let's start placing the elements based on these constraints:

- Since the rabbit must be to the right of the horse, and the Egyptian must be on the right of the rabbit, the only possible configuration is:
  - Rabbit in position 3
  - Horse in position 2
  - Egyptian in position 3 (but this conflicts with the rabbit being in position 3). Therefore, the rabbit must be in position 2 and the horse in position 1.

Now, let's place the nationalities and pets:

- The German must be in position 2 because the rabbit is in position 2.
- The Mexican cannot be in position 1 (clue 2), so he must be in position 3.
- The hamster must be in position 1 because the Mexican is in position 3 and the hamster and German have the same parity (both in even positions).

So, the final configuration is:

| Nationality   | Egyptian | German  | Mexican  |
|---------------|----------|---------|----------|
| Pet           | Hamster  | Rabbit  | Horse    |

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
| Nationality   | Egyptian | German  | Mexican  |
|---------------|----------|---------|----------|
| Pet           | Hamster  | Rabbit  | Horse    |

Lv9-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step and place the information into the table.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person whose hobby is cooking is in the middle (position 2).
2. The person driving the airplane and the person who's hobby is hiking have different parity positions.
3. The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
4. The person driving the airplane is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the ship.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- The person with the hobby of cooking is in position 2.

| Hobby       | 1      | 2      | 3      |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Cooking     |        | X      |        |

#### Clue 2:
- The person driving the airplane and the person who's hobby is hiking have different parity positions.

Since the person with the hobby of cooking is in position 2 (even), the person driving the airplane must be in an odd position (1 or 3) and the person with the hobby of hiking must be in an even position (2).

#### Clue 3:
- The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.

This means that if the person driving the quad-bike is in position 2, then the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 1.

#### Clue 4:
- The person driving the airplane is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the ship.

If the person driving the airplane is in position 2, then the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 3 and the person driving the ship must be in position 1.

### Combining all clues:
- Position 1: The person driving the ship.
- Position 2: The person with the hobby of cooking.
- Position 3: The person driving the quad-bike.

From Clue 2, since the person driving the airplane is in an odd position (must be position 1 or 3), and considering Clue 4, the person driving the airplane must be in position 1, and the person driving the ship must be in position 3. This leaves position 2 for the person with the hobby of cooking.

From Clue 3, the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 1, which conflicts with the person driving the ship. Therefore, the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 3, and the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 2.

From Clue 2 again, the person driving the airplane must be in position 1, and the person with the hobby of hiking must be in position 3.

So, we can fill in the table as follows:

| Hobby       | 1      | 2      | 3      |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Dancing     | X      | Cooking| Hiking |
| Ship        | Airplane| Quad-bike|        |

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Hobby       | 1      | 2      | 3      |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Dancing     | X      | Cooking| Hiking |
| Transport   | Ship   | Airplane| Quad-bike|

Lv9-2x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and place the information systematically into the table.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **The person eating cucumber is not to the left of the owner of the horse.**
   - This means the owner of the horse cannot be to the immediate left of the person eating cucumber.

2. **The person eating cucumber is between the owner of the fish and the person eating carrot.**
   - This places the person eating cucumber in the middle position between the owner of the fish and the person eating carrot.

3. **The owner of the horse is not to the right of the person eating carrot.**
   - This means the owner of the horse must be to the left of the person eating carrot.

4. **The person eating carrot is the owner of the guinea-pig.**
   - The person eating carrot owns the guinea-pig.

5. **The person eating carrot and the owner of the fish have the same parity positions.**
   - If the person eating carrot is in an odd or even position, the owner of the fish must be in the same type of position (odd or even).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person eating carrot is the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - Let's denote the person eating carrot as C and the owner of the guinea-pig as G.

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating cucumber (C) is between the owner of the fish (F) and the person eating carrot (C).
   - This gives us the sequence: F-C-G or G-C-F. But since the person eating carrot (C) owns the guinea-pig (G), it must be G-C-F.

3. **Clue 1**: The person eating cucumber (C) is not to the left of the owner of the horse (H).
   - From G-C-F, we know that the owner of the horse (H) must be to the right of C, so H must be in position 3.

4. **Clue 3**: The owner of the horse (H) is not to the right of the person eating carrot (C).
   - Since H is in position 3, C is in position 2, and G is in position 1, this condition is satisfied.

5. **Clue 5**: The person eating carrot (C) and the owner of the fish (F) have the same parity positions.
   - Since C is in position 2 (even), F must also be in an even position. Given the only even position left is 2, F must be in position 2, which contradicts our previous setup. Therefore, F must be in position 4, but since we only have 3 positions, we need to re-evaluate the initial placement.

Given the constraints, let's re-evaluate the positions:
- C (carrot) must be in position 2.
- G (guinea-pig) must be in position 1.
- H (horse) must be in position 3.

Thus, the correct arrangement is:
- Position 1: G (guinea-pig)
- Position 2: C (carrot)
- Position 3: H (horse)

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|        |     1     |    2     |     3      |
| Food   | cucumber  | carrot   | blueberry  |

Lv9-2x3-4	"Let's break down the clues step by step and use logical deduction to fill out the table.

### Clue Breakdown:
1. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person watching romance movies.
2. The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog.
3. The person watching documentary movies is on the far left or far right.
4. The person watching documentary movies and the owner of the lizard have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 3:
- The person watching documentary movies is either in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 4:
- If the person watching documentary movies is in position 1, then the owner of the lizard must also be in an odd position (1). This means the owner of the lizard cannot be in position 2.
- If the person watching documentary movies is in position 3, then the owner of the lizard must also be in an odd position (1). This means the owner of the lizard cannot be in position 2.

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person watching romance movies.
- Since the person watching documentary movies can only be in position 1 or 3, let's consider both cases.

#### Clue 2:
- The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog.

### Case Analysis:

#### Case 1: Person watching documentary movies is in position 1
- If the person watching documentary movies is in position 1, then the owner of the lizard must be in position 1 as well.
- The owner of the lizard cannot be in position 2 (Clue 1), so the person watching romance movies must be in position 2.
- The person watching documentary movies is to the left of the owner of the frog (Clue 2), so the owner of the frog must be in position 3.

This gives us:
- Position 1: Documentary movies, Lizard
- Position 2: Romance movies
- Position 3: Frog

#### Case 2: Person watching documentary movies is in position 3
- If the person watching documentary movies is in position 3, then the owner of the lizard must be in position 1 (same parity).
- The owner of the lizard cannot be in position 2 (Clue 1), so the person watching romance movies must be in position 2.
- The person watching documentary movies is to the right of the owner of the frog (Clue 2), so the owner of the frog must be in position 1.

This gives us:
- Position 1: Frog
- Position 2: Romance movies
- Position 3: Documentary movies, Lizard

### Conclusion:
Both cases are valid, but we need to ensure all conditions are met. Let's choose the first case for simplicity and consistency.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |    2    |      3      |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentaries | Romance | Western     |
| Pet           | Lizard       | Frog    | Mouse       |
```

This satisfies all the given clues:
1. The owner of the lizard (Lizard) is on the left of the person watching romance movies (Frog).
2. The person watching documentary movies (Documentaries) is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog (Frog).
3. The person watching documentary movies (Documentaries) is on the far left (Position 1).
4. The person watching documentary movies (Documentaries) and the owner of the lizard (Lizard) have the same parity positions (both in position 1).

Lv9-2x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and determine the correct arrangement.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person drinking water is the person drinking water**: This is just a tautology and doesn't provide new information.
2. **The person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola**: This means that if someone is drinking cola, the person drinking tea must be in a position to the right (either 2 or 3).
3. **The person drinking water and the fan of country have the same parity positions**: This means if the person drinking water is in an odd position (1), then the fan of country is also in an odd position (1). If the person drinking water is in an even position (2), then the fan of country is also in an even position (2).
4. **The person drinking water is on the left of the fan of metal**: This means the person drinking water must be in position 1, and the fan of metal must be in position 2 or 3.
5. **The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water**: This means the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2 or 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 4, we know the person drinking water must be in position 1 because they must be on the left of the fan of metal.
2. From clue 2, since the person drinking water is in position 1, the person drinking tea must be in position 2 or 3.
3. From clue 3, since the person drinking water is in position 1 (an odd position), the fan of country must also be in position 1 (but we already know the person drinking water is in position 1, so the fan of country cannot be in position 1). Therefore, the fan of country must be in position 2 or 3.
4. From clue 5, the fan of hip-hop must be to the right of the person drinking water, so it must be in position 2 or 3.
5. From clue 4 again, the person drinking water is on the left of the fan of metal, so the fan of metal must be in position 2 or 3.

### Positioning:

- The person drinking water is in position 1.
- The fan of country must be in position 2 or 3 (but not 1).
- The fan of hip-hop must be in position 2 or 3 (and cannot be in the same position as the fan of country).

Given these constraints:
- If the fan of country is in position 2, then the fan of hip-hop must be in position 3.
- If the fan of country is in position 3, then the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2.

Since the fan of metal must be to the right of the person drinking water (position 1) and can only be in position 2 or 3, and the fan of hip-hop must also be to the right of the person drinking water, the only logical positions are:
- Fan of country in position 2.
- Fan of hip-hop in position 3.
- Fan of metal in position 2 (which contradicts the above, thus rechecking, we see fan of metal must be in position 3).

### Final Arrangement:

- Position 1: Water (drinking)
- Position 2: Country (listening)
- Position 3: Metal (listening)

Now, let's place the beverages:

- Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the beverage in position 1 is Water.
- The person drinking tea must be in position 2 or 3. Since the fan of country is in position 2, the person drinking tea must be in position 3.
- The person drinking cola must be in position 2.

So, the final solution is:

|               |    1    |   2   |    3    |
| Beverage      |  Water  |  Cola |  Tea    |
| Music-Genre   |  Country| Metal | Hip-Hop |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |   2   |    3    |
| Beverage      |  Water  |  Cola |  Tea    |

Lv9-2x3-6	"Let's break down the clues step by step to find the correct arrangement:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The Chinese is somewhere to the left of the Nigerian**:
   - This means the Chinese cannot be in position 3 if the Nigerian is in position 1 or 2.

2. **The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the French**:
   - This means the person with surfing is not at either end (positions 1 or 3) and must be between the person with skateboarding and the French.

3. **The Chinese and the person who's sport is parkour have different parity positions**:
   - This means if one is in an odd position (1 or 3), the other must be in an even position (2).

4. **The person who's sport is surfing is not to the left of the person who's sport is surfing**:
   - This is redundant information as it just reiterates that the same person cannot be in two different positions.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **From clue 2**: The person with surfing is between skateboarding and French.
   - Possible arrangements for this are: French, Surfing, Skateboarding or Skateboarding, Surfing, French.

2. **From clue 1**: Chinese is to the left of Nigerian.
   - This restricts their possible positions.

3. **From clue 3**: Chinese and parkour have different parity positions.
   - If Chinese is in position 1, parkour must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If Chinese is in position 2, parkour must be in position 1 or 3.
   - If Chinese is in position 3, parkour must be in position 1 or 2.

### Testing Arrangements:

Let's test the arrangement based on the above deductions:

#### Attempt 1:
- Assume Chinese is in position 1.
  - Then parkour must be in position 2 (since Chinese and parkour have different parity).
  - Now we need to place the French, skateboarding, and surfing.
  - Since the person with surfing is between skateboarding and French, the only valid arrangement is: French, Surfing, Skateboarding.
  - This fits all the clues:
    - Chinese (position 1) is to the left of Nigerian (position 3).
    - Surfing (position 2) is between skateboarding (position 3) and French (position 1).
    - Chinese (position 1) and parkour (position 2) have different parity.

So, the arrangement is:
- Position 1: Chinese, Parkour
- Position 2: French, Surfing
- Position 3: Nigerian, Skateboarding

### Final Solution Table:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The Japanese is on the left of the Entrepreneur.**
   - This means if the Japanese is in position 1, the Entrepreneur must be in position 2.
   - If the Japanese is in position 2, the Entrepreneur must be in position 3.

2. **The Pilot is not to the left of the Brazilian.**
   - This means the Brazilian cannot be in position 2 if the Pilot is in position 1, and the Brazilian cannot be in position 3 if the Pilot is in position 2.

3. **The Pilot and the Brazilian have different parity positions.**
   - This means one is in an odd-numbered position (1 or 3) and the other is in an even-numbered position (2).

4. **The Pilot is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the Pilot can only be in position 1 or position 3.

5. **The Brazilian is on the left or right of the Pakistani.**
   - This means if the Brazilian is in position 1, the Pakistani must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the Brazilian is in position 2, the Pakistani must be in position 1 or 3.
   - If the Brazilian is in position 3, the Pakistani must be in position 1 or 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Pilot
Since the Pilot is on the far left or far right, let's start with the possibilities:

- **Pilot in Position 1**: 
  - The Brazilian cannot be in position 2 (clue 2).
  - The Brazilian can be in position 3 (clue 3 and 5).

- **Pilot in Position 3**:
  - The Brazilian cannot be in position 2 (clue 2).
  - The Brazilian can be in position 1 (clue 3 and 5).

Let's test both scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Pilot in Position 1**

1. Pilot (1)
2. (TBD)
3. (TBD)

- Since the Brazilian is not in position 2, he must be in position 3.
- The Japanese must be in position 2 (clue 1).
- The Entrepreneur must be in position 3, but that's already taken by the Brazilian.

This scenario is invalid because it violates the rule that the Entrepreneur must be next to the Japanese.

**Scenario 2: Pilot in Position 3**

1. (TBD)
2. (TBD)
3. Pilot

- The Brazilian can be in position 1 or 2 (clue 5).
- If the Brazilian is in position 1, the Pakistani must be in position 2 (clue 5).
- The Japanese must be in position 2 (clue 1).
- The Entrepreneur must be in position 1.

Let's check if this fits all clues:
- The Japanese (1) is to the left of the Entrepreneur (2) - valid.
- The Pilot (3) is not to the left of the Brazilian (1) - valid.
- The Pilot and the Brazilian have different parity positions - valid.
- The Pilot is on the far right - valid.
- The Brazilian is on the left or right of the Pakistani - valid.

So, this scenario works.

Lv9-2x3-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person eating lemon is the journalist.**
2. **The journalist is not to the right of the dancer.**
3. **The dancer and the person eating kale have the same parity positions.**
4. **The person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the designer.**
5. **The person eating pear is between the journalist and the dancer.**
6. **The person eating kale and the dancer have the same parity positions.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the position of the journalist.
- From clue 1, the person eating lemon is the journalist.
- From clue 5, the person eating pear is between the journalist and the dancer.
- This means the journalist cannot be in position 3 because there would be no space for the person eating pear to be between them and the dancer.

Thus, the journalist must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 2: Determine the position of the dancer.
- From clue 2, the journalist is not to the right of the dancer.
- From clue 5, the person eating pear is between the journalist and the dancer.

If the journalist is in position 1, the only way to place the dancer such that the journalist is not to the right of the dancer is if the dancer is in position 2 or 3. However, since the journalist is in position 1, the person eating pear must be in position 3 (between the journalist and the dancer).

This means the dancer must be in position 2, and the person eating pear is in position 3.

#### Step 3: Determine the food and job for each position.
- The journalist is in position 1 and eats lemon.
- The dancer is in position 2.
- The person eating pear is in position 3.

From clue 4, the person eating kale is to the right of the designer. Since the designer cannot be in position 3 (the person eating pear), the designer must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is occupied by the journalist, so the designer must be in position 2. Thus, the person eating kale must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Designer, eats kale
- Position 2: Dancer, eats pear
- Position 3: Journalist, eats lemon

Now, let's assign the jobs:
- The person eating pear (position 2) is the dancer.
- The person eating lemon (position 3) is the journalist.
- The person eating kale (position 1) must be the designer.

### Final Solution Table:

```

Lv9-2x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The fisherman is not to the left of the doctor.
   - This means the doctor must be either in position 1 or 2, and the fisherman must be in position 2 or 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking sprite and the fisherman have different parity positions.
   - If the fisherman is in an odd position (1 or 3), the person drinking sprite must be in an even position (2).
   - If the fisherman is in an even position (2), the person drinking sprite must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

3. **Clue 3:** The doctor is between the fisherman and the person drinking milk.
   - This implies that the doctor cannot be in position 1 or 3 because there would be no room for both the fisherman and the person drinking milk on either side.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **From Clue 1:**
   - The doctor can only be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the fisherman must be in position 3.

2. **From Clue 3:**
   - Since the doctor is in position 2, the fisherman (position 3) and the person drinking milk must be on either side of the doctor.
   - Thus, the person drinking milk must be in position 1.

3. **From Clue 2:**
   - The fisherman (in position 3) has an odd position, so the person drinking sprite must be in an even position (position 2).
   - Since the doctor is in position 2, the person drinking sprite cannot be the doctor, so the person drinking sprite must be the fisherman’s neighbor, which is the person drinking milk in position 1.

Now we need to assign the beverages based on the remaining positions and clues:

- **Position 1:** Person drinking milk (doctor)
- **Position 2:** Person drinking sprite (fisherman)
- **Position 3:** Person drinking tea (chef)

Lv9-2x3-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan punk is on the left of the fan soul.
2. **Clue 2:** The fan indie and the coach have the same parity positions (both are either both in odd positions or both in even positions).
3. **Clue 3:** The paramedic is the fan punk.
4. **Clue 4:** The fan indie is on the right of the fan soul.
5. **Clue 5:** The paramedic is somewhere to the left of the coach.

Given these clues, we can start placing the information in the table:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- From Clue 3, we know that the paramedic is the fan punk.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, since the fan punk is on the left of the fan soul and the fan indie is on the right of the fan soul, the only possible order for the positions of the fans is:
  - Fan punk (leftmost)
  - Fan soul (middle)
  - Fan indie (rightmost)

- From Clue 5, the paramedic (who is the fan punk) must be to the left of the coach. Therefore, the coach cannot be in position 1 (since the paramedic is already there).

- From Clue 2, the fan indie and the coach must have the same parity positions. Since the fan indie is in position 3 (odd), the coach must also be in an odd position (either 1 or 3). However, since the coach cannot be in position 1 (where the paramedic is), the coach must be in position 3.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Paramedic (fan punk)
- Position 2: Fan soul
- Position 3: Coach (fan indie)

Now, let's assign the jobs:

- The paramedic is in position 1, so the job for position 1 must be either coach, paramedic, or writer. Since the paramedic is already in position 1, it must be the paramedic.
- The coach is in position 3, so the job for position 3 must be either coach, paramedic, or writer. Since the coach is already in position 3, it must be the coach.
- The remaining job for position 2 must be the writer.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Paramedic (fan punk)
- Position 2: Writer (fan soul)
- Position 3: Coach (fan indie)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |   2    |   3   |
| Job           | Paramedic | Writer | Coach |
| Music-Genre   | Punk      | Soul   | Indie |
