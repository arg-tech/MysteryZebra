### Solution Process:

#### Step 1: Identify the Software-Developer's Position
- Clue 10: The software-developer is on the far left or far right.
- Clue 16: The person watching zombie movies is on the far left or far right.
- Since the software-developer and the person watching zombie movies must be in different positions (clue 10 and clue 16), one must be in position 1 and the other in position 5.

#### Step 2: Determine the Fan Dubstep's Position
- Clue 21: The person driving the jet-ski is the fan dubstep.
- This means the fan dubstep is in position 1 or 5.
- From Clue 10, the software-developer is in position 1 or 5.
- Therefore, the fan dubstep is in position 5 and the software-developer is in position 1.

#### Step 3: Determine the Police-Officer's Position
- Clue 20: The police-officer is in the middle.
- This means the police-officer is in position 3.

#### Step 4: Determine the Doctor's Position
- Clue 16: The person watching zombie movies is on the far left or far right.
- Since the software-developer is in position 1, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 5.
- Clue 6: The doctor and the person watching zombie movies have the same parity positions.
- The person watching zombie movies is in an odd position (5), so the doctor must also be in an odd position.
- Since the police-officer is in position 3 and the software-developer is in position 1, the doctor must be in position 5 (which is already taken by the person watching zombie movies) or position 3 (which is taken by the police-officer).
- Therefore, the doctor must be in position 1.

#### Step 5: Determine the Entrepreneur's Position
- Clue 1: The entrepreneur is not to the left of the fan jazz.
- The fan jazz cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- The only remaining position for the fan jazz is position 4.
- The entrepreneur cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since the doctor is there and the entrepreneur is not to the left of the fan jazz).
- The only remaining position for the entrepreneur is position 4.

#### Step 6: Determine the Freelancer's Position
- Clue 4: The freelancer is somewhere to the left of the software-developer.
- The software-developer is in position 1.
- The only remaining position for the freelancer is position 2.

#### Step 7: Determine the Remaining Positions
- Clue 2: The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the person driving the subway.
- The person driving the subway is in position 4 (entrepreneur).
- The person watching animation movies must be in position 2 or 3.
- Clue 11: The person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies.
- The person watching sports movies must be in position 2 or 1.
- Since the freelancer is in position 2, the person watching sports movies must be in position 1.
- The person watching animation movies must be in position 3.

- Clue 3: The fan salsa is somewhere between the person watching horror movies and the fan ambient.
- The fan ambient is in position 5 (family movies).
- The person watching horror movies must be in position 2 or 4.
- Since the person watching sports movies is in position 1 and the person watching animation movies is in position 3, the person watching horror movies must be in position 4.
- The fan salsa must be in position 2.

- Clue 5: The fan ambient is the person watching family movies.
- The fan ambient is in position 5 (family movies).

- Clue 9: The fan pop is not to the left of the entrepreneur.
- The fan pop must be in position 4 (animation movies).

- Clue 7: The person driving the taxi is not the police-officer.
- The person driving the taxi must be in position 2 (salsa).

- Clue 8: The freelancer and the person driving the subway have different parity positions.
- The freelancer is in position 2 (even) and the person driving the subway is in position 4 (even), which contradicts the clue. Therefore, the person driving the subway must be in position 2 and the freelancer in position 4.

- Clue 12: The fan dubstep is not the person watching horror movies.

4. The person who's sport is basketball is the person who's hobby is dancing.
5. The person who's hobby is cooking is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the fan of reggae.
6. The person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
7. The person who's sport is skiing is between the owner of the snake and the person who's hobby is baking.
8. The owner of the rat and the person who's hobby is dancing have the same parity positions.
9. The owner of the ferret is not to the left of the fan of metal.
10. The fan of d&b is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.
11. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the fan of pop.

14. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
15. The owner of the rat is not to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.
16. The fan of d&b is on the far left.
17. The fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hamster.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of Video-Games**: Since the person with the hobby of video-games is in an odd position, they can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

2. **Fan of Pop and Ferret Owner**: The fan of pop must be next to the owner of the ferret. This means the fan of pop could be in positions 2 or 4 if the owner of the ferret is in position 1 or 3, respectively.

3. **Snake and Jazz Parity**: The owner of the snake and the fan of jazz have the same parity positions. This means if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an odd position; if one is in an even position, the other must be in an even position.

4. **Basketball and Dancing**: The person whose hobby is basketball is also the person whose hobby is dancing. So, these two must be in the same position.

5. **Cooking and Reggae**: The person whose hobby is cooking is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the fan of reggae. This means the positions for cooking, guinea-pig, and reggae must be consecutive, with cooking in the middle.

6. **Baking and Video-Games**: The person whose hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is video-games.

7. **Skiing and Baking**: The person whose sport is skiing is between the owner of the snake and the person whose hobby is baking.

8. **Rat and Dancing Parity**: The owner of the rat and the person whose hobby is dancing have the same parity positions.

9. **Ferret and Metal Fan**: The owner of the ferret cannot be to the left of the fan of metal.

10. **d&b Fan and Surfing**: The fan of d&b is on the left or right of the person whose sport is surfing.

11. **Basketball and Pop Fan**: The person whose sport is basketball is on the left or right of the fan of pop.

12. **Ferret and Basketball**: The owner of the ferret cannot be to the left of the person whose sport is basketball.

13. **Guinea-Pig and Snake**: The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the snake.

14. **Snake and Skydiving**: The owner of the snake is to the right of the person whose hobby is skydiving.

15. **Rat and Climbing**: The owner of the rat is not to the right of the person whose sport is climbing.

16. **d&b Fan Position**: The fan of d&b is on the far left.

17. **Reggae and Hamster**: The fan of reggae is to the left of the owner of the hamster.

### Final Arrangement:

Given all the constraints, we can deduce the following:

1. **d&b Fan is in position 1**.
2. **Video-Games is in position 3** (since it's an odd position and not 1, which is taken by d&b).
3. **Basketball and Dancing are in the same position, let's assume position 4**.
4. **Owner of the ferret is in position 2** (since the fan of pop must be next to them, and position 1 is taken by d&b).
5. **Owner of the guinea-pig is in position 1**, since the owner of the snake must be to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
6. **Owner of the snake is in position 5** (since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 1 and the owner of the snake is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig).
7. **Owner of the rat is in position 2**, as the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 1.
8. **Owner of the hamster is in position 4** (since the fan of reggae is to the left of the owner of the hamster).

Thus, the final arrangement is:

```
| Hobby         | 1          | 2          | 3          | 4          | 5          |
