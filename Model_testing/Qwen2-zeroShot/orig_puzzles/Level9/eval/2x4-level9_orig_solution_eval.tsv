Lv9-2x4-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the nationalities and pets accordingly. Let's break down the clues step by step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The owner of the rat is not to the right of the owner of the ferret.
2. The owner of the rat is on the right of the Brazilian.
3. The Chinese is on the left or right of the German.
4. The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
5. The Mexican is not to the left of the owner of the rat.
6. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the Chinese.
7. The Chinese is somewhere between the Brazilian and the owner of the guinea-pig.
8. The Chinese and the owner of the rat have the same parity positions (both are in odd or even positions).
9. The German and the owner of the ferret have different parity positions (one is in an odd position, the other in an even position).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Rat Owner
From clue 2, the owner of the rat must be in position 2 or 4 since the Brazilian is in position 1 or 3, and the rat cannot be in position 4 if the Brazilian is in position 3.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Brazilian
From clue 2, if the Brazilian is in position 1, the rat owner must be in position 2 or 3 (but not 4). If the Brazilian is in position 3, the rat owner must be in position 4. Let's test both scenarios:

- **Scenario 1: Brazilian in position 1**
  - Rat owner must be in position 2 or 3.
- **Scenario 2: Brazilian in position 3**
  - Rat owner must be in position 4.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Chinese and German
From clue 3, the Chinese is either in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, but the German is in one of these positions as well, and they must be next to each other.

#### Step 4: Positioning the Mexican and Guinea-Pig
From clue 4, the Mexican is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. From clue 5, the Mexican is not to the left of the rat owner.

#### Step 5: Positioning the Hamster
From clue 6, the owner of the hamster is to the left of the Chinese.

#### Step 6: Parity Clues
From clue 8, the Chinese and the rat owner have the same parity (both odd or both even).
From clue 9, the German and the ferret owner have different parity (one odd, one even).

Let's start with Scenario 1: Brazilian in position 1.

1. **Brazilian in position 1**: 
   - Rat owner can be in position 2 or 3.
   - If Rat owner is in position 2, then Chinese must be in position 3 or 4 (since Chinese is between Brazilian and guinea-pig owner).
   - If Rat owner is in position 3, then Chinese must be in position 2 or 4.

#### Testing Rat Owner in Position 2:
- Rat owner in position 2: 
  - Chinese must be in position 3 or 4.
  - If Chinese is in position 3, then German must be in position 4 (since they are next to each other).
  - If Chinese is in position 4, then German must be in position 3.

#### Testing Rat Owner in Position 3:
- Rat owner in position 3:
  - Chinese must be in position 2 or 4.
  - If Chinese is in position 2, then German must be in position 1 (since they are next to each other), which contradicts the Brazilian being in position 1.
  - If Chinese is in position 4, then German must be in position 3, which contradicts the Chinese being in position 4.

Thus, the only valid scenario is:

- Brazilian in position 1
- Rat owner in position 2
- Chinese in position 3
- German in position 4

Now, let's fill in the remaining clues:

- From clue 4, the Mexican must be in position 5 (guinea-pig owner) and in position 6 (hamster owner).
- From clue 6, the hamster owner must be in position 1 (Chinese).
- From clue 7, the Chinese must be between the Brazilian and the guinea-pig owner, which is already satisfied.
- From clue 8, the Chinese (position 3) and the rat owner (position 2) have the same parity.
- From clue 9, the German (position 4) and the ferret owner (position 1) have different parity.

### Final Table:

Lv9-2x4-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the beverages and hobbies accordingly. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left or far right.
   - This means the person with the hobby of dancing is either in position 1 or 4.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is traveling and the person drinking coffee have the same parity positions.
   - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must also be in an odd position; if one is in an even position, the other must also be in an even position.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is drawing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
   - This means the person with the hobby of drawing must be to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is dancing is not to the right of the person drinking tea.
   - If the person with the hobby of dancing is in position 1, then the person drinking tea can be in any position (1, 2, 3, or 4). However, if the person with the hobby of dancing is in position 4, then the person drinking tea must be in position 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
   - This means the person with the hobby of dancing cannot be in the last position (position 4) because the person drinking almond milk must be to the right of them.

6. **Clue 6:** The person drinking almond milk is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
   - This means the person drinking almond milk must be in a position to the right of the person with the hobby of drawing.

7. **Clue 7:** The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond milk.
   - This means the person drinking coffee must be in a position to the right of the person drinking almond milk.

8. **Clue 8:** The person drinking tea is on the far left or far right.
   - This means the person drinking tea must be in position 1 or 4.

### Solving the Puzzle

Let's start placing the information:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, since the person drinking tea is on the far left or far right, and the person with the hobby of dancing is also on the far left or far right, we can deduce:
  - If the person with the hobby of dancing is in position 1, then the person drinking tea must be in position 4.
  - If the person with the hobby of dancing is in position 4, then the person drinking tea must be in position 1.

Since the person with the hobby of dancing cannot be in position 4 (from Clue 4), the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 1, and the person drinking tea must be in position 4.

Now let's fill in the rest based on the remaining clues:

- Clue 2 tells us that the person with the hobby of traveling and the person drinking coffee must have the same parity. Since the person with the hobby of dancing is in position 1, the person drinking coffee must be in position 3 (since it must be an odd position).
- Clue 3 and Clue 6 tell us that the person with the hobby of drawing must be to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku, and the person drinking almond milk must be to the right of the person with the hobby of drawing. This means the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 2, and the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 3.
- Finally, the person with the hobby of traveling must be in position 3, and the person drinking coffee must be in position 3 as well, which contradicts our previous placement. Therefore, the only valid placement for the person with the hobby of traveling is in position 2, and the person drinking coffee must be in position 4.

### Final Solution Table

Lv9-2x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and place the information into the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person eating mango.**
2. **The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta.**
3. **The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking fanta.**
4. **The person drinking cola is on the far left.**
5. **The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking fanta.**
6. **The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person eating artichoke.**
7. **The person eating artichoke is not to the left of the person eating avocado.**
8. **The person drinking cola and the person eating avocado have the same parity positions.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person drinking cola is on the far left.
   - This means the beverage for position 1 is cola.

2. **Clue 3**: The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
   - Since cola is in position 1, fanta must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 1**: The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person eating mango.
   - Since fanta can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4, and cola is in position 1, fanta cannot be in position 1 (which we already know).

4. **Clue 6**: The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person eating artichoke.
   - This means artichoke must be in a position to the right of fanta.

5. **Clue 2**: The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta.
   - This reinforces that fanta is to the left of artichoke.

6. **Clue 5**: The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
   - Coffee must be in a position to the right of fanta.

7. **Clue 7**: The person eating artichoke is not to the left of the person eating avocado.
   - This means artichoke cannot be in position 2 if avocado is in position 1 or 2.

8. **Clue 8**: The person drinking cola and the person eating avocado have the same parity positions.
   - Since cola is in position 1 (odd), avocado must also be in an odd position (positions 1 or 3).

Given these clues, let's construct the solution:

- **Position 1**: Cola (from Clue 4)
- **Position 2**: Fanta (since it needs to be to the right of cola and left of artichoke, and it can't be in position 1)
- **Position 3**: Artichoke (since it needs to be to the right of fanta and not to the left of avocado)
- **Position 4**: Coffee (since it needs to be to the right of fanta)

Now, we need to place the food items:
- **Avocado** must be in position 3 because it has the same parity as cola (both in odd positions) and it cannot be in position 2 (left of artichoke).

So, the final arrangement is:

|            |    1    |    2    |     3     |   4   |
| Beverage   |   Cola  |  Fanta  |  Coffee  | Avocado |
| Food       |  Mango  | Avocado | Artichoke|  -----  |

The final solution table is:

```
|            |    1    |    2    |     3     |   4   |
| Beverage   |   Cola  |  Fanta  |  Coffee  | Avocado |
| Food       |  Mango  | Avocado | Artichoke|  -----  |

Lv9-2x4-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The fan of hip-hop is the dressmaker.
2. The fan of indie is on the right of the fan of reggae.
3. The fan of indie is somewhere to the left of the dressmaker.
4. The fan of trance is on the left or right of the security-guard.
5. The fan of indie is on the left of the coach.
6. The software-developer and the fan of trance have the same parity positions (both are either in even or odd positions).
7. The security-guard is on the left or right of the coach.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From clue 1**: The dressmaker is the fan of hip-hop. So, we can place ""dressmaker"" in column 1 and ""hip-hop"" in row 2 for now.
   ```
   |               |         1          |       2        |   3    |     4      |
   | Job           | dressmaker         |                |        |            |
   | Music-Genre   | hip-hop            |                |        |            |
   ```

2. **From clue 2**: The fan of indie is on the right of the fan of reggae. This means that the fan of reggae must be in an earlier column than the fan of indie.
   
3. **From clue 3**: The fan of indie is somewhere to the left of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in column 1, the fan of indie cannot be in column 1. Also, from clue 2, the fan of reggae must be in an earlier column than the fan of indie, so the fan of reggae cannot be in column 4. Let's denote the fan of reggae as R and the fan of indie as I. Possible placements for R and I could be:
   - R in 1 and I in 2, 3, or 4.
   - R in 2 and I in 3 or 4.
   - R in 3 and I in 4.
   
   However, since the fan of indie is to the left of the dressmaker, R and I cannot both be in columns 3 and 4. So, the only possible placement is:
   - R in 1 and I in 2, 3, or 4.
   - R in 2 and I in 3 or 4.
   
   But since the fan of indie is to the left of the dressmaker, R cannot be in column 2. Thus, R must be in column 1 and I in column 2 or 3.
   
4. **From clue 5**: The fan of indie is on the left of the coach. This means the coach cannot be in column 1 or 2 if the fan of indie is in column 2 or 3. Therefore, the coach must be in column 3 or 4.
   
5. **From clue 6**: The software-developer and the fan of trance have the same parity positions. This means they are either both in even positions (2 and 4) or both in odd positions (1 and 3). Since the dressmaker (hip-hop) is in column 1, the software-developer and the fan of trance must be in column 3 or 4.
   
6. **From clue 4**: The fan of trance is on the left or right of the security-guard. This means the security-guard must be in column 2 or 3 if the fan of trance is in column 1 or 4.
   
7. **From clue 7**: The security-guard is on the left or right of the coach. This means the coach and security-guard must be in adjacent columns.
   
### Combining all clues:
- From clue 1, the dressmaker is in column 1.
- From clue 2 and 3, the fan of reggae must be in column 1 and the fan of indie in column 2.
- From clue 5, the coach must be in column 3 or 4.
- From clue 6, the software-developer and the fan of trance must be in column 3 or 4.
- From clue 4, the fan of trance is on the left or right of the security-guard.
- From clue 7, the security-guard and coach are in adjacent columns.

Given these constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:
- Fan of reggae in column 1.
- Fan of indie in column 2.
- Coach in column 3.
- Security-guard in column 4.
- Software-developer in column 4 (since it must be with the same parity as the fan of trance).

Thus, the final solution is:
```
|               |         1          |       2        |   3    |     4      |

Lv9-2x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate music genre and pet in their respective positions. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of country is not the owner of the hedgehog.**
   - This means the owner of the hedgehog cannot be the fan of country.

2. **The owner of the cat and the fan of blues have different parity positions.**
   - If the owner of the cat is in an odd position (1 or 3), the fan of blues must be in an even position (2 or 4).
   - If the owner of the cat is in an even position (2 or 4), the fan of blues must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

3. **The owner of the dog and the fan of classical have different parity positions.**
   - Similar to the previous clue, if the owner of the dog is in an odd position, the fan of classical must be in an even position.
   - If the owner of the dog is in an even position, the fan of classical must be in an odd position.

4. **The owner of the dog is somewhere to the left of the fan of country.**
   - The owner of the dog cannot be in the same position as the fan of country and must be to the left of them.

5. **The owner of the cat is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.**
   - The owner of the cat must be in a position to the left of the fan of hip-hop.

6. **The fan of classical is not the owner of the dog.**
   - This means the fan of classical cannot own the dog.

7. **The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical.**
   - The fan of hip-hop must be in a position to the left of the fan of classical.

8. **The owner of the cat is on the right of the fan of blues.**
   - The owner of the cat must be in a position to the right of the fan of blues.

9. **The owner of the pony is not the fan of hip-hop.**
   - The owner of the pony cannot be the fan of hip-hop.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Fan of Country and Dog:**
   - From clue 4, the owner of the dog is to the left of the fan of country. This means:
     - Dog can't be in position 4.
     - Fan of country can't be in position 1.
   - Also, from clue 7, the fan of hip-hop is to the left of the fan of classical, so the fan of hip-hop can't be in position 4.

2. **Positioning the Cat and Blues:**
   - From clue 2, the owner of the cat and the fan of blues have different parity positions. So if the owner of the cat is in an odd position, the fan of blues is in an even position, and vice versa.

3. **Positioning the Dog and Classical:**
   - From clue 3, the owner of the dog and the fan of classical have different parity positions. So if the owner of the dog is in an odd position, the fan of classical is in an even position, and vice versa.

4. **Positioning the Cat and Hip-Hop:**
   - From clue 5, the owner of the cat is on the left of the fan of hip-hop. So if the owner of the cat is in position 1, the fan of hip-hop can only be in position 2, 3, or 4. If the owner of the cat is in position 2, the fan of hip-hop can only be in position 3 or 4.

5. **Using Clue 6:**
   - The fan of classical is not the owner of the dog. This means the fan of classical can't be in the same position as the owner of the dog.

6. **Using Clue 8:**
   - The owner of the cat is on the right of the fan of blues. So if the fan of blues is in position 1, the owner of the cat must be in position 2, 3, or 4. If the fan of blues is in position 2, the owner of the cat must be in position 3 or 4.

7. **Using Clue 9:**
   - The owner of the pony is not the fan of hip-hop. So the owner of the pony can't be in the same position as the fan of hip-hop.

### Final Placement:

- Position 1: Fan of blues (from clue 2 and 8)
- Position 2: Owner of the cat (from clue 5 and 8)
- Position 3: Fan of classical (from clue 3 and 7)
- Position 4: Fan of hip-hop (from clue 7)

Thus, the final table is:

```
|               |   1   |    2    |    3     |     4     |
| Music-Genre   | Blues | Classical| Hip-hop  | unknown  |
| Pet           | Cat   | unknown  | Dog      | Pony     |
```

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact music genres for the remaining positions, we can fill in the unknowns with the remaining genres (country and hip-hop):

```
|               |   1   |    2    |    3     |     4     |
| Music-Genre   | Blues | Classical| Hip-hop  | Country   |
| Pet           | Cat   | Hedgehog | Dog      | Pony     |

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person watching documentary movies is on the far left or far right.
2. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.
3. The Indian is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies.
4. The American and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
5. The person watching superhero movies and the American have different parity positions.
6. The Indian is not to the left of the person watching animation movies.
7. The Thai is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies.
8. The person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the Thai.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching documentary movies is on the far left or far right.
   - Possible positions: 1 or 4.

2. **Clue 2:** The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.
   - This means if someone is in position 2, the next person (position 3) must be watching either scientific or superhero movies.

3. **Clue 3:** The Indian is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies.
   - This means the Indian cannot be in the last position (4).

4. **Clue 4:** The American and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions.
   - If the American is in an even position, the person watching scientific movies must also be in an even position.
   - If the American is in an odd position, the person watching scientific movies must also be in an odd position.

5. **Clue 5:** The person watching superhero movies and the American have different parity positions.
   - If the American is in an even position, the person watching superhero movies must be in an odd position.
   - If the American is in an odd position, the person watching superhero movies must be in an even position.

6. **Clue 6:** The Indian is not to the left of the person watching animation movies.
   - This means the person watching animation movies must be to the left of the Indian.

7. **Clue 7:** The Thai is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies.
   - This means the Thai must be to the left of the person watching animation movies.

8. **Clue 8:** The person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the Thai.
   - This means the person watching documentary movies must be to the left of the Thai.

### Placing Information:

- From Clue 1, let's assume the documentary movie watcher is in position 1 (we can test both positions 1 and 4, but let's start with 1).
- Since the Thai cannot be to the right of the documentary movie watcher, the Thai must be in position 2 or 3.
- From Clue 7, the Thai must be to the left of the animation movie watcher, so the Thai must be in position 2.
- From Clue 8, the documentary movie watcher (in position 1) is not to the right of the Thai (in position 2), which fits.
- Now, the person watching animation movies must be in position 3 or 4. But from Clue 6, the Indian cannot be to the left of the animation movie watcher, so the animation movie watcher must be in position 4.
- From Clue 3, the Indian must be to the left of the superhero movie watcher. Since the Indian cannot be in position 4, the Indian must be in position 3.
- From Clue 2, the scientific movie watcher must be to the left of the superhero movie watcher. Since the superhero movie watcher is in position 4, the scientific movie watcher must be in position 2.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 5, the American must be in position 3 (since the Indian is in position 3 and they have different parity positions).

So, the final arrangement is:

| Movie-Genre | Animation | Documentary | Scientific | Superhero |

### Clue Analysis:
1. The chef is somewhere to the right of the entrepreneur.
2. The owner of the ferret and the librarian have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
3. The chef is the owner of the pony.
4. The librarian is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
5. The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the photographer.
6. The owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the ferret.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3:
- The chef is the owner of the pony.

So we can mark:
```
|       |      1       |  2   |     3     |      4       |
| Job   |              |      |           |              |
| Pet   |              |      |           | pony         |
```

#### Clue 6:
- The owner of the pony (chef) is on the left of the owner of the ferret.

Since the chef is already in position 4, the owner of the ferret must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

#### Clue 1:
- The chef is somewhere to the right of the entrepreneur.

Since the chef is in position 4, the entrepreneur cannot be in position 4, so the entrepreneur must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

#### Clue 5:
- The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the photographer.

Since the owner of the ferret is in position 1, 2, or 3, the photographer must be in position 2, 3, or 4. However, since the chef is in position 4, the photographer cannot be in position 4, so the photographer must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 4:
- The librarian is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.

This means the librarian and the owner of the chinchilla must be in adjacent positions, with the librarian being on the left.

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the ferret and the librarian have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).

Since the owner of the ferret is in an odd position (1, 2, or 3), the librarian must also be in an odd position (1, 2, or 3). This narrows down the possible positions for the librarian and the owner of the chinchilla.

### Possible Positioning:
- If the owner of the ferret is in position 1, the librarian could be in position 3 (since they have the same parity).
- If the owner of the ferret is in position 2, the librarian could be in position 4 (but this is not possible because the librarian must be on the left of the chinchilla owner).
- If the owner of the ferret is in position 3, the librarian could be in position 1 (but this is not possible because the librarian must be on the left of the chinchilla owner).

Thus, the only valid positioning is:
- Owner of the ferret in position 1.
- Librarian in position 3.
- Chinchilla owner in position 4.

Now let's fill in the remaining positions:

```
|       |      1       |  2   |     3     |      4       |
| Job   | entrepreneur |      | librarian | photographer |
| Pet   | ferret       |      | chinchilla| pony         |
```

Finally, we need to determine the jobs for positions 2 and 3. Since the librarian is in position 3, the remaining job for position 2 is the entrepreneur.

### Final Solution:
```
|       |      1       |  2   |     3     |      4       |
| Job   | entrepreneur | chef | librarian | photographer |
| Pet   | ferret       |      | chinchilla| pony         |

Lv9-2x4-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct values in the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is sailing.**
   - This means the position of the fan of hip-hop must be greater than the position of the person who's sport is sailing.

2. **The person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is sailing and the person who's sport is skateboarding.**
   - This means the order of these sports is: sailing, soccer, skateboarding or skateboarding, soccer, sailing.

3. **The person who's sport is soccer and the fan salsa have different parity positions.**
   - If the person with soccer is in an odd position, the fan of salsa must be in an even position, and vice versa.

4. **The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse.**
   - This means the order of these sports is: skateboarding, lacrosse or lacrosse, skateboarding.

5. **The fan of salsa is not to the right of the fan of punk.**
   - This means the fan of salsa must be in a position less than or equal to the fan of punk.

6. **The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of punk.**
   - This means the position of the fan of hip-hop must be less than the position of the fan of punk.

7. **The fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk.**
   - This means the position of the fan of salsa must be greater than the position of the fan of funk.

### Solving Step-by-Step:

Let's start by placing the sports based on the given clues:

1. From clue 4, we know:
   - skateboarding < lacrosse or lacrosse < skateboarding.
   
2. From clue 2, we know:
   - sailing, soccer, skateboarding or skateboarding, soccer, sailing.
   
3. Combining clues 2 and 4, we can deduce:
   - If skateboarding is before lacrosse, then the order could be: sailing, soccer, skateboarding, lacrosse.
   - If lacrosse is before skateboarding, then the order could be: sailing, soccer, lacrosse, skateboarding.

4. From clue 1, we know:
   - The fan of hip-hop is to the right of the person who's sport is sailing.
   - So, if sailing is 1, hip-hop cannot be 1; it can be 2, 3, or 4.

5. From clue 3, we know:
   - Soccer and salsa have different parity positions.
   - If soccer is in an odd position, salsa must be in an even position, and vice versa.

6. From clue 5, we know:
   - Salsa is not to the right of punk.
   - This means salsa must be in a position less than or equal to punk.

7. From clue 6, we know:
   - Hip-hop is to the left of punk.
   - This means hip-hop must be in a position less than punk.

8. From clue 7, we know:
   - Salsa is to the right of funk.
   - This means funk must be in a position less than salsa.

### Final Placement:

Let's try to fit all these constraints into the table:

1. Place sailing (since it's a fixed point for other positions):
   - sailing = 1 (to satisfy clue 1 and 2).

2. Since sailing is 1, hip-hop must be 2, 3, or 4 (clue 1).
3. Soccer must be between sailing and skateboarding (clue 2), so soccer = 3 (to satisfy the different positions for salsa and soccer).

4. Lacrosse must be after skateboarding (clue 4), so lacrosse = 4.
5. Salsa and funk must be placed such that salsa is to the right of funk (clue 7) and different parity (clue 3).

Given the above placements:
- Funk = 2 (since it must be before salsa and hip-hop must be to the left of punk, which must be 4).

This gives us:
- Funk = 2
- Salsa = 4 (since it must be after funk and different parity from soccer)
- Hip-hop = 3 (since it must be to the left of punk and to the right of sailing)
- Punk = 4 (since it must be to the right of hip-hop)

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1    |    2    |       3       |    4     |
| Music-Genre   |    funk |    hip-hop |      punk     |    salsa |
| Sport         |   sailing |   soccer | skateboarding |   lacrosse |
```

This placement satisfies all the given clues."	{'music-genre': ['funk', 'hip-hop', 'punk', 'salsa'], 'sport': ['sailing', 'soccer', 'skateboarding', 'lacrosse']}	True	6	False
Lv9-2x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the table step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere between the owner of the fish and the owner of the hamster.
2. The owner of the hamster is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
3. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the mouse.
4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
5. The person who's hobby is gardening is not the owner of the fish.
6. The person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
7. The person who's hobby is woodworking and the owner of the rabbit have the same parity positions (both odd or both even).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2 & 3:**
   - Owner of the rabbit is to the right of the owner of the mouse.
   - Owner of the hamster is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
   - Therefore, the order must be: Mouse, Rabbit, Hamster.

2. **Clue 1:**
   - Filmmaker is between the owner of the fish and the owner of the hamster.
   - Since the owner of the hamster is the third position, the owner of the fish must be in the first position, and the filmmaker in the second position.
   - So, we have: Fish, Filmmaker, Rabbit, Hamster.

3. **Clue 4:**
   - Woodworker is on the left of the gardener.
   - From the current setup, the only possible positions for woodworking and gardening are the first and fourth positions.

4. **Clue 5:**
   - Gardener is not the owner of the fish.
   - Since the owner of the fish is in the first position, the gardener cannot be in the first position.
   - Therefore, the gardener must be in the fourth position.
   - This leaves the woodworker in the first position.

5. **Clue 6:**
   - Singer is to the right of the gardener.
   - Since the gardener is in the fourth position, the singer must be in the second or third position.
   - But we already have the filmmaker in the second position, so the singer must be in the third position.

6. **Clue 7:**
   - Woodworker and the owner of the rabbit have the same parity positions.
   - The owner of the rabbit is in the third position (odd), so the woodworker must also be in an odd position.
   - Since the woodworker is in the first position, this condition is satisfied.

### Final Table:

```markdown
|         |      1      |     2     |     3      |    4    |
| Hobby   | Woodworking | Filmmaking| Singing    | Gardening |
| Pet     | Fish        |           | Mouse      | Rabbit   |
```

### Explanation:
- Position 1: Woodworking
- Position 2: Filmmaking
- Position 3: Singing
- Position 4: Gardening
- Fish is in position 1 (owner of the fish)
- Rabbit is in position 3 (owner of the rabbit)
- Mouse is in position 2 (owner of the mouse)
- Hamster is in position 4 (owner of the hamster)

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues. Here is the final solution table:

Lv9-2x4-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The person driving the trike is not to the left of the person eating broccoli.**
   - This means the person eating broccoli must be at position 1, 2, or 3 if the person driving the trike is at position 2, 3, or 4 respectively.

2. **The person eating watermelon and the person driving the trike have the same parity positions.**
   - If the person driving the trike is in an even position (2 or 4), then the person eating watermelon must also be in an even position.
   - If the person driving the trike is in an odd position (1 or 3), then the person eating watermelon must also be in an odd position.

3. **The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram.**
   - This means the person driving the tram cannot be in position 4, and the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in position 1.

4. **The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile.**
   - This means the person eating pepper cannot be directly in the middle of the person driving the snowmobile.

5. **The person eating papaya is somewhere between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the trike.**
   - This means the person eating papaya must be in the middle of the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the trike.

6. **The person eating watermelon is on the far right.**
   - This means the person eating watermelon must be in position 4.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6**: The person eating watermelon is on the far right (position 4).
   - So, position 4 is filled with ""watermelon"".

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating watermelon and the person driving the trike have the same parity positions.
   - Since watermelon is in position 4 (an even position), the person driving the trike must also be in an even position (2 or 4). But since position 4 is already taken by watermelon, the person driving the trike must be in position 2.

3. **Clue 1**: The person driving the trike is not to the left of the person eating broccoli.
   - Since the person driving the trike is in position 2, the person eating broccoli must be in position 1 or 3.

4. **Clue 5**: The person eating papaya is somewhere between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the trike.
   - Since the person driving the trike is in position 2, the person eating papaya must be in position 3 (since it must be between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the trike).

5. **Clue 3**: The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram.
   - Since the person eating papaya is in position 3, the person driving the tram must be in position 1 and the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 3 (but this conflicts with clue 5, so we need to re-evaluate).

6. **Re-evaluation**:
   - If the person driving the tram is in position 1, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 3.
   - The person eating papaya must be in position 2 (between the person driving the tram and the person driving the trike).

Now, we need to place the remaining items (broccoli and pepper) in the correct positions.

7. **Clue 4**: The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - Since the person driving the snowmobile is in position 3, the person eating pepper must be in position 1 or 4. But position 4 is taken by watermelon, so the person eating pepper must be in position 1.

8. **Clue 1** (revisited): The person driving the trike is not to the left of the person eating broccoli.
   - Since the person eating broccoli is in position 3 and the person driving the trike is in position 2, this is consistent.
