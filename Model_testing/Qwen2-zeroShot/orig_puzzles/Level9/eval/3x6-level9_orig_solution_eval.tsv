Lv9-3x6-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 13**: The entrepreneur is on the far left.
2. **Clue 14**: The manager is on the far right.

So, we can start with:
```
|   Entrepreneur |              |              |           |         |            | Manager  |
```

3. **Clue 4**: The entrepreneur is not the fan of classical.
4. **Clue 6**: The fan d&b is between the owner of the cat and the fan gospel.
5. **Clue 7**: The fan d&b is in an odd position (positions 1, 3, or 5).

Since the entrepreneur is in position 1, the fan d&b cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the fan d&b must be in position 3 or 5.

6. **Clue 5**: The owner of the turtle is between the analyst and the owner of the cat.
7. **Clue 12**: The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the fan soul.

This means the turtle owner is in positions 2 or 3, and the fan soul is in positions 4, 5, or 6.

8. **Clue 2**: The analyst and the fan gospel have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
9. **Clue 8**: The accountant and the fan rock have the same parity positions.
10. **Clue 9**: The videographer is on the left or right of the entrepreneur (already fixed in position 1).
11. **Clue 10**: The fan gospel is somewhere to the right of the fan rock.
12. **Clue 11**: The fan rock is not to the left of the bartender.
13. **Clue 15**: The owner of the fish is somewhere between the owner of the goat and the fan gospel.
14. **Clue 16**: The fan soul and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions.

Let's try to place the elements based on these constraints:

- Since the entrepreneur is in position 1, the fan d&b must be in position 3 or 5.
- If the fan d&b is in position 3, then the fan gospel and the owner of the cat must be in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since the fan gospel is to the right of the fan rock, and the fan rock is not to the left of the bartender). This means the fan rock is in position 4 and the fan gospel is in position 5. But this conflicts with the turtle owner being in position 3 (from clue 5), so the fan d&b must be in position 5.

Thus, the fan d&b is in position 5, and the fan gospel and the owner of the cat must be in positions 4 and 6 respectively (since the fan gospel is to the right of the fan rock, and the fan rock is not to the left of the bartender).

Now, the layout looks like:
```
|   Entrepreneur |              |              | Fan Rock   | Fan Gospel | Fan Soul   | Manager  |
```

- The owner of the turtle must be in position 2 (clue 5).
- The analyst and the fan gospel must be in even positions (clue 2), so the analyst is in position 2.
- The fan rock and the accountant must be in even positions (clue 8), so the accountant is in position 4.
- The owner of the goat must be in position 3 (clue 15).
- The owner of the fish must be in position 1 (clue 15), but this conflicts as the entrepreneur is in position 1. So, the owner of the fish must be in position 6.

Thus, the final layout is:
```
|   Entrepreneur | Fan Rock   | Goat       | Accountant | Fan Gospel | Fish      | Manager  |
```

Now, let's assign the jobs and music genres:

- The entrepreneur (position 1) cannot be the fan of classical (clue 4).
- The fan d&b (position 5) cannot be the fan of classical (clue 6).
- The fan gospel (position 4) cannot be the fan of classical (clue 10).
- The fan rock (position 3) cannot be the fan of classical (clue 4).

So, the fan of classical must be in position 2 (the analyst), which is an even position (clue 2).

Thus, the final solution is:
```
|   Entrepreneur | Fan Classical | Goat       | Accountant | Fan Gospel | Fish      | Manager  |
```

And the music genres and pets are assigned as follows:
- The analyst (position 2) is the fan of classical.
- The accountant (position 3) is the fan of punk.
- The fan rock (position 3) is the fan of punk.
- The fan gospel (position 4) is the fan of gospel.
- The fan d&b (position 5) is the fan of d&b.
- The fan soul (position 6) is the fan of soul.
- The owner of the turtle (position 2) is the owner of the goat.
- The owner of the fish (position 6) is the owner of the cat.
- The owner of the horse (position 3) is the owner of the goat.
- The owner of the lizard (position 1) is the owner of the fish.

Final Solution:
```
|   Entrepreneur | Fan Classical | Goat       | Accountant | Fan Gospel | Fish      | Manager  |

   - The owner of the bird is not the entrepreneur.
   - The project-manager is not the person watching musical movies.
   - The entrepreneur is somewhere between the owner of the mouse and the software-developer.
   - The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person watching action movies.
   - The owner of the frog is not to the left of the entrepreneur.
   - The person watching animation movies is in an odd position.
   - The software-developer and the owner of the guinea-pig have different parity positions.
   - The software-developer and the owner of the mouse have the same parity positions.

### Deductions

Let's start with some direct deductions:

- **Clue 1:** The photographer (P) is on the left of the project-manager (PM).
- **Clue 6:** The owner of the frog (F) is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies (M).
- **Clue 10:** The software-developer (SD) and the owner of the mouse (MOUSE) have the same parity positions.
- **Clue 13:** The owner of the hamster (HAM) is in an odd position.
- **Clue 26:** The person watching musical movies (M) is on the right of the person watching action movies (A).

From these, we can infer:
- P < PM
- F < M or F > M
- SD and MOUSE have the same parity.
- HAM is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
- M > A

### Positioning and Parity

Given that HAM is in an odd position and has a specific parity, let's consider the possible positions for HAM:
- If HAM is in position 1, then the remaining even positions are 2, 4, 6.
- If HAM is in position 3, then the remaining even positions are 2, 4, 6.
- If HAM is in position 5, then the remaining even positions are 2, 4, 6.

Since SD and MOUSE have the same parity, and HAM is in an odd position, SD and MOUSE must be in even positions.

### Placing Individuals

Let's try placing the individuals step-by-step:

1. **Position 1 (HAM):** (Odd)
2. **Position 2 (SD/MOUSE):** (Even)
3. **Position 3 (F):** (Odd or Even based on M)
4. **Position 4 (SD/MOUSE):** (Even)
5. **Position 5 (MOUSE/SD):** (Even)
6. **Position 6 (P):** (Even)

Since P is on the left of PM, and PM is between the person watching adventure movies (ADVENTURE) and the owner of the turtle (TURTLE), and the photographer is on the left of the project-manager, we can place:

- **Position 1 (HAM):** (Odd)
- **Position 2 (SD):** (Even)
- **Position 3 (F):** (Odd)
- **Position 4 (MOUSE):** (Even)
- **Position 5 (PM):** (Odd)
- **Position 6 (P):** (Even)

### Final Placement

- **Job 1 (Analyst):** Not HAM, not SD, not PM, not P.
- **Job 2 (Entrepreneur):** Between SD and PM, not right of SD, not right of PM.
- **Job 3 (Fisherman):** Somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies.
- **Job 4 (Photographer):** On the left of PM, not in position 1, 3, or 5.
- **Job 5 (Project-Manager):** Between ADVENTURE and TURTLE.
- **Job 6 (Software-Developer):** On the left of PM, not in position 1, 3, or 5.

Given all constraints, the final placement is:

| Job           | Analyst       | Entrepreneur  | Fisherman     | Photographer   | Project-Manager | Software-Developer |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The Thai is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
2. **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is video-games is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the American.
4. **Clue 4:** The Thai and the person whose hobby is video-games have different parity positions.
5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
6. **Clue 6:** The person whose hobby is video-games and the Japanese have the same parity positions.
7. **Clue 7:** The person whose hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
8. **Clue 8:** The person driving the car is not to the left of the person whose hobby is video-games.
9. **Clue 9:** The person whose hobby is filmmaking and the American have the same parity positions.
10. **Clue 10:** The person driving the car is not to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
11. **Clue 11:** The Argentine is not the person whose hobby is puzzles.
12. **Clue 12:** The person whose hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
13. **Clue 14:** The Mexican is the person driving the bike.
15. **Clue 15:** The Thai is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike.
16. **Clue 16:** The person whose hobby is video-games is not the person driving the subway.
17. **Clue 17:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is the Thai.
18. **Clue 18:** The person driving the car is not to the left of the Japanese.
19. **Clue 19:** The Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway.
20. **Clue 20:** The Argentine is not to the right of the person whose hobby is drawing.
21. **Clue 21:** The Brazilian is somewhere between the Mexican and the Thai.
22. **Clue 22:** The Brazilian and the person driving the snowmobile have the same parity positions.
23. **Clue 23:** The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is not the person driving the snowmobile.
24. **Clue 24:** The Mexican is in an odd position.
25. **Clue 25:** The person whose hobby is video-games is somewhere between the person driving the car and the Mexican.

#### Initial Deductions:
- From Clue 14, the Mexican drives the bike (position 4).
- From Clue 24, the Mexican is in an odd position, so the Mexican must be in position 3.
- From Clue 15, the Thai is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike. Since the Thai is in position 3, the trike driver must be in position 5 or 6.
- From Clue 17, the Thai has the hobby of puzzles.
- From Clue 1, the Thai is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. So, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2 or 3. But since the Thai is in position 3, the snowmobile must be driven by the person in position 2.
- From Clue 21, the Brazilian is between the Mexican (position 3) and the Thai (position 3), which creates a contradiction unless we adjust the Thai to a different position.
- From Clue 22, the Brazilian and the person driving the snowmobile have the same parity positions. Since the snowmobile is driven by an even position (2), the Brazilian must also be in an even position (4, 6).
- From Clue 19, the Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway. The person driving the subway must be in an even position (4, 6).

Let's try to fit the pieces together:

1. **Position 1:** American
2. **Position 2:** Snowmobile driver
3. **Position 3:** Thai (puzzles)
4. **Position 4:** Mexican (bike)
5. **Position 5:** Brazilian
6. **Position 6:** Japanese

Now let's assign the hobbies and nationalities:

- **Position 1:** American (nationality)
- **Position 2:** Snowmobile driver (transport)
- **Position 3:** Thai (puzzles, nationality)
- **Position 4:** Mexican (bike, nationality)
- **Position 5:** Brazilian (nationality)
- **Position 6:** Japanese (nationality)

Hobbies:
- **Position 1:** American (video-games)
- **Position 2:** Snowmobile driver (drawing)
- **Position 3:** Thai (puzzles)
- **Position 4:** Mexican (filmmaking)
- **Position 5:** Brazilian (rock-climbing)
- **Position 6:** Japanese (card-games)

### Final Table:
```

Lv9-3x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding elements (food, music genre, nationality) into their respective positions based on the given constraints.

Let's break down and solve the puzzle step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze Clues and Place Initial Information

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of pop and the person eating apricot have different parity positions.
2. **Clue 2**: The Pakistani is not the person eating watermelon.
3. **Clue 3**: The fan of country and the person eating apricot have different parity positions.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person eating apricot.
5. **Clue 5**: The person eating zucchini is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
6. **Clue 6**: The Italian is in an odd position.
7. **Clue 7**: The Colombian is on the left of the person eating zucchini.
8. **Clue 8**: The Australian is not to the left of the Indian.
9. **Clue 9**: The fan of reggae is on the right of the person eating artichoke.
10. **Clue 10**: The person eating artichoke and the fan of punk have the same parity positions.

17. **Clue 17**: The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the right of the fan of country.
18. **Clue 18**: The Indian is not to the left of the Indian (redundant).
19. **Clue 19**: The person eating artichoke and the Colombian have the same parity positions.
20. **Clue 20**: The Indian is on the right of the Polish.
21. **Clue 21**: The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapes.
22. **Clue 22**: The person eating artichoke is somewhere between the Polish and the person eating zucchini.
23. **Clue 23**: The fan of punk is the Colombian.
24. **Clue 24**: The Australian is somewhere to the right of the Indian.

### Step 2: Deduce and Fill in the Table

Let's start filling in the table with the information we can deduce from the clues:

#### Nationality:
- **Italian** must be in an odd position (Clue 6): 1, 3, or 5.
- **Colombian** is on the left of the person eating zucchini (Clue 7), so the Colombian cannot be in the last position.
- **Polish** must be to the left of the Indian (Clue 20), so Polish cannot be in the 6th position.
- **Indian** is on the right of the Polish (Clue 20), so Indian cannot be in the 1st position.

From Clue 16, the Colombian is between the Italian and the fan of reggae. This means the Italian, Colombian, and fan of reggae must be consecutive.

Let's try placing these:

- **Italian** in 1 (odd position):
  - **Colombian** in 2
  - **Fan of reggae** in 3

This satisfies Clue 6, Clue 7, and Clue 16.

#### Food:
- **Artichoke** and **Colombian** have the same parity positions (Clue 19). Since Colombian is in 2, Artichoke must be in 2 as well (which contradicts the initial assumption, so let's re-evaluate).

Re-evaluating:
- **Italian** in 3 (odd position):
  - **Colombian** in 4
  - **Fan of reggae** in 5

This still satisfies Clue 6, Clue 7, and Clue 16.

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

- **Fan of punk** is the Colombian (Clue 23), so **Colombian** in 4.

#### Music Genre:
- **Fan of punk** is the Colombian (Clue 23), so **Fan of punk** in 4.

#### Food:
- **Artichoke** and **Colombian** have the same parity positions (Clue 19). Since Colombian is in 4, Artichoke must be in 4 as well (contradiction, so re-evaluate).

Re-evaluating:
- **Italian** in 1 (odd position):
  - **Colombian** in 2
  - **Fan of reggae** in 3

This still satisfies Clue 6, Clue 7, and Clue 16.

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

- **Fan of punk** is the Colombian (Clue 23), so **Colombian** in 2.

#### Food:
- **Artichoke** and **Colombian** have the same parity positions (Clue 19). Since Colombian is in 2, Artichoke must be in 2 as well (contradiction, so re-evaluate).

Re-evaluating:
- **Italian** in 3 (odd position):
  - **Colombian** in 4
  - **Fan of reggae** in 5

This still satisfies Clue 6, Clue 7, and Clue 16.

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

- **Fan of punk** is the Colombian (Clue 23), so **Colombian** in 4.

#### Food:
- **Artichoke** and **Colombian** have the same parity positions (Clue 19). Since Colombian is in 4, Artichoke must be in 4 as well (contradiction, so re-evaluate).

Re-evaluating:
- **Italian** in 5 (odd position):
  - **Colombian** in 6
  - **Fan of reggae** in 4

This still satisfies Clue 6, Clue 7, and Clue 16.

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

- **Fan of punk** is the Colombian (Clue 23), so **Colombian** in 6.
