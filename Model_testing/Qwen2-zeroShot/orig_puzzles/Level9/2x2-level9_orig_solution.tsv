Lv9-2x2-1	"Let's break down the information provided in the puzzle step-by-step.

1. There are two different types of food: grapes and raspberry.
2. There are two different types of sports: parkour and rowing.
3. The person who does rowing is in an odd position.
4. The person eating raspberry and the person who does rowing have the same parity positions.

Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), we can deduce the following:

- Position 1 is odd.
- Position 2 is even.

From point 3, the person who does rowing must be in position 1 (the only odd position).

From point 4, the person eating raspberry and the person doing rowing must be in the same position. Since the person doing rowing is in position 1, the person eating raspberry must also be in position 1.

Now we know:
- Position 1: Rowing, Raspberry
- Position 2: Parkour, Grapes

So, the final solution table looks like this:

```
|         |     1     |    2    |
| Food    | Raspberry | Grapes  |
| Sport   | Rowing    | Parkour |

Lv9-2x2-2	"Certainly! Let's break down the puzzle step by step.

### Given Information:
- There are two beverages: 7up and milk.
- There are two types of food: asparagus and pineapple.
- The person drinking 7up and the person eating asparagus have the same parity (both odd or both even) positions.
- The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Positioning of Beverages and Foods:**
   - We have two rows (Beverage and Food) and two columns (1 and 2).
   - The possible positions for each beverage and food are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2).

2. **Parity Constraint:**
   - The person drinking 7up and the person eating asparagus must be in the same parity position.
   - Possible same parity positions are (1, 1) and (2, 2) or (1, 2) and (2, 1).

3. **Position Constraint:**
   - The person drinking 7up is to the right of the person drinking milk.
   - This means if the person drinking milk is in column 1, the person drinking 7up must be in column 2.

Let's test the possible combinations:

### Case 1: (1, 1) and (2, 2)
- If 7up is at (1, 1), then asparagus must also be at (2, 2).
- Milk cannot be at (1, 1) because 7up is to the right of milk.
- If milk is at (2, 1), then 7up would be at (2, 2), but this conflicts with asparagus being at (2, 2).

### Case 2: (1, 2) and (2, 1)
- If 7up is at (1, 2), then asparagus must also be at (2, 1).
- Milk cannot be at (1, 2) because 7up is to the right of milk.
- If milk is at (1, 1), then 7up would be at (1, 2), which satisfies all conditions.

### Conclusion:
The only valid arrangement that satisfies all the given conditions is:
- The person drinking 7up is at (1, 2).
- The person drinking milk is at (1, 1).
- The person eating asparagus is at (2, 1).
- The person eating pineapple is at (2, 2).

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage   |    milk   |    7up    |
| Food       |  asparagus|  pineapple|

Lv9-2x2-3	"Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two different music genres: folk and R&B.
2. There are two different sports: cycling and ice-hockey.
3. The fan of folk and the person who prefers cycling have different parity (odd or even) positions.
4. The person who prefers ice-hockey is to the right of the person who prefers cycling.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the possible positions for each preference:**
   - We have two rows (Music-Genre and Sport) and two columns (1 and 2).

2. **Analyze the parity condition:**
   - If the fan of folk is in position 1, then the person who prefers cycling must be in position 2 (since they have different parities).
   - If the fan of folk is in position 2, then the person who prefers cycling must be in position 1.

3. **Analyze the relative positioning:**
   - The person who prefers ice-hockey is to the right of the person who prefers cycling.
   - This means if the person who prefers cycling is in position 1, the person who prefers ice-hockey must be in position 2.
   - If the person who prefers cycling is in position 2, the person who prefers ice-hockey cannot be in position 1 (because there would be no space to the right), so this scenario is not possible.

4. **Combine the conditions:**
   - The only valid scenario is that the person who prefers folk is in position 1, and the person who prefers cycling is in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person who prefers ice-hockey must be in position 1, and the person who prefers R&B must be in position 2.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | Folk    | R&B        |
| Sport         | Ice-Hockey | Cycling   |
```

### Explanation:
- The fan of folk is in position 1, and the person who prefers cycling is in position 2.
- The person who prefers ice-hockey is in position 1, and the person who prefers R&B is in position 2.
- Both conditions (different parities and relative positioning) are satisfied.

Lv9-2x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour.
2. **Clue 2:** The mexican and the person who's sport is swimming have different parity positions (i.e., one is in an odd position and the other is in an even position).
3. **Clue 3:** The argentine is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour.

Given the structure of the table:
- We have two columns: 1 and 2.
- We have two nationalities: Argentine and Mexican.
- We have two sports: Parkour and Swimming.

Let's denote:
- Person 1: \( P1 \)
- Person 2: \( P2 \)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 3:** The argentine is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour.
- This means if the person with parkour is in column 1, the argentine must be in column 2.
- If the person with parkour is in column 2, the argentine cannot be in column 1 (since there would be no space to the right).

**Clue 1:** The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour.
- If the person with parkour is in column 1, the person with swimming can be in column 2.
- If the person with parkour is in column 2, the person with swimming can be in column 1.

**Clue 2:** The mexican and the person who's sport is swimming have different parity positions.
- This means if the mexican is in an odd position, the person with swimming must be in an even position, and vice versa.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Person 1 has Parkour
- The argentine must be in column 2.
- The person with swimming can be in column 2 (right of parkour).

This setup satisfies Clue 3 and Clue 1. Now, we need to place the mexican and the person with swimming considering Clue 2:
- If the mexican is in column 1 (odd position), the person with swimming must be in column 2 (even position). This fits our scenario.

So, the table would look like:
```
|               |    1    |     2     |
| Nationality   | Mexican | Argentine |
| Sport         | Parkour | Swimming  |
```

#### Scenario 2: Person 2 has Parkour
- The argentine cannot be in column 1 (since there would be no space to the right).
- This scenario is not possible because it violates Clue 3.

Thus, the only valid solution is:

```
|               |    1    |     2     |
| Nationality   | Mexican | Argentine |
| Sport         | Parkour | Swimming  |

Lv9-2x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and determine the correct arrangement.

### Clue Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking sprite and the person who's hobby is gardening have different parity positions.
   - This means that if one is in an odd position (1), the other must be in an even position (2).

2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
   - This means that the sprite drinker is in position 1, and the gardener is in position 2.

### Applying the Clues:

- From Clue 2, we know that the person drinking sprite is in position 1, and the person with the hobby of gardening is in position 2.

- From Clue 1, since the sprite drinker is in position 1 (odd), the gardener must be in position 2 (even).

### Conclusion:
- Position 1: Sprite drinker
- Position 2: Gardener

Now, let's fill in the table:

```

Lv9-2x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the dog and the person eating pineapple have the same parity positions.
2. The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating lemon.

### Analysis:

#### Clue 1: Same Parity Positions
- If the owner of the dog is in position 1 (odd), then the person eating pineapple must also be in position 1.
- If the owner of the dog is in position 2 (even), then the person eating pineapple must also be in position 2.

#### Clue 2: Pineapple on the Left of Lemon
- This means that if someone eats pineapple, the person eating lemon must be to their right.

### Possible Scenarios:

**Scenario 1:**
- If the owner of the dog is in position 1 (odd):
  - The person eating pineapple must also be in position 1.
  - Therefore, the person eating lemon must be in position 2.

**Scenario 2:**
- If the owner of the dog is in position 2 (even):
  - The person eating pineapple must also be in position 2.
  - Therefore, the person eating lemon must be in position 1.

Given these scenarios, let's test each one to see which fits all the clues.

### Testing Scenario 1:
- Position 1: Owner of the dog, eating pineapple.
- Position 2: Eating lemon.

This fits both clues:
- The owner of the dog and the person eating pineapple have the same parity position (both in position 1).
- The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating lemon.

### Testing Scenario 2:
- Position 1: Eating lemon.
- Position 2: Owner of the dog, eating pineapple.

This does not fit the second clue because the person eating pineapple is not on the left of the person eating lemon.

### Conclusion:
The correct scenario is Scenario 1.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|        |     1     |   2    |
| Food   | Pineapple | Lemon  |
| Pet    | Dog       |        |

Lv9-2x2-7	"Certainly! Let's break down the puzzle step by step to find the correct arrangement.

### Given Information:
- There are two jobs: fisherman and nurse.
- There are two pets: rat and snake.
- The fisherman and the owner of the rat have different parity positions (one is in an even position, the other in an odd position).
- The owner of the snake is in an odd position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Owner of the Snake in Odd Position:**
   - The owner of the snake must be in position 1 since it's the only odd position available.

2. **Fisherman and Owner of Rat Have Different Parity Positions:**
   - If the owner of the snake is in position 1 (odd), then the owner of the rat must be in position 2 (even).

3. **Determine Jobs and Pets:**
   - Since the owner of the snake is in position 1, we need to assign either ""fisherman"" or ""nurse"" to this position.
   - The owner of the rat is in position 2, so we need to assign the remaining job and pet to this position.

Let's consider the possible assignments:

- If the owner of the snake (position 1) is a fisherman, then the owner of the rat (position 2) must be a nurse.
- If the owner of the snake (position 1) is a nurse, then the owner of the rat (position 2) must be a fisherman.

Given that the fisherman and the owner of the rat have different parity positions, we can assign:
- Fisherman to position 1 (owner of the snake)
- Nurse to position 2 (owner of the rat)

This satisfies all the conditions:
- The fisherman (in position 1) and the owner of the rat (in position 2) have different parity positions.
- The owner of the snake (in position 1) is in an odd position.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|       |     1     |   2   |
| Job   | Fisherman | Nurse |
| Pet   | Snake     | Rat   |

Lv9-2x2-8	"Certainly! Let's break down the given information and solve the puzzle step by step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two different favorite beverages: coffee and hot-chocolate.
2. There are two different means of transport: quad-bike and roller.
3. The person drinking hot-chocolate and the person driving the roller have the same parity positions (both in odd or both in even positions).
4. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking coffee.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Parity Positions
Since there are only two people, we can assign positions as follows:
- Position 1 (odd)
- Position 2 (even)

Given that the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person driving the roller have the same parity positions, they must both be in either position 1 or position 2. 

#### Step 2: Apply the Second Clue
The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking coffee. This means the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2, and the person drinking coffee must be in position 1.

#### Step 3: Assign Beverages and Transport
- Since the person in position 2 is drinking hot-chocolate, the person in position 1 must be drinking coffee.
- Since the person in position 2 is drinking hot-chocolate and needs to be driven by someone with the same parity, the person in position 2 must be riding a roller.
- Therefore, the person in position 1 must be riding a quad-bike.

### Final Table:
```
|             |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage    | Coffee    | Hot-Chocolate |
| Transport   | Quad-bike | Roller        |

Lv9-2x2-9	"Let's break down the given information and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: family, satire.
2. The people use 2 different means of transport: car, motorbike.
3. The person watching satire movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies.
4. The person driving the car and the person watching satire movies have different parity positions (i.e., one is in an odd position and the other is in an even position).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the possible positions for genres and transport:**
   - There are two columns (1 and 2) for both genres and transport.

2. **Analyze the first condition:**
   - The person watching satire movies is to the right of the person watching family movies.
   - This means that if family is in column 1, satire must be in column 2, and vice versa.

3. **Analyze the second condition:**
   - The person driving the car and the person watching satire movies have different parity positions.
   - If the person watching satire is in an odd position, the person driving the car must be in an even position, and vice versa.

Given these conditions, let's test the possibilities:

#### Possibility 1:
- Family in column 1, Satire in column 2.
- Car in column 1, Motorbike in column 2.

This would mean:
- The person watching family movies is in an odd position (column 1).
- The person watching satire movies is in an even position (column 2).
- The person driving the car is in an odd position (column 1).
- The person driving the motorbike is in an even position (column 2).

This satisfies the condition that the person driving the car and the person watching satire movies have different parity positions.

#### Possibility 2:
- Family in column 2, Satire in column 1.
- Car in column 2, Motorbike in column 1.

This would mean:
- The person watching family movies is in an even position (column 2).
- The person watching satire movies is in an odd position (column 1).
- The person driving the car is in an even position (column 2).
- The person driving the motorbike is in an odd position (column 1).

This also satisfies the condition that the person driving the car and the person watching satire movies have different parity positions.

However, since the first condition states that the person watching satire movies is to the right of the person watching family movies, the only valid configuration is:

- Family in column 1, Satire in column 2.
- Car in column 1, Motorbike in column 2.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |   1    |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Family | Satire    |
| Transport     | Car    | Motorbike |

Lv9-2x2-10	"Let's break down the given conditions and solve the puzzle step by step.

### Conditions:
1. The person eating apricot and the Indonesian have the same parity positions.
2. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot.

### Initial Table Setup:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Food          |            |         |
| Nationality   |            |         |
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Condition 1: The person eating apricot and the Indonesian have the same parity positions.
- This means that if the person eating apricot is in an odd position (1), then the Indonesian must also be in an odd position (1).
- If the person eating apricot is in an even position (2), then the Indonesian must also be in an even position (2).

#### Condition 2: The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot.
- This means that if the person eating apricot is in position 1, the person eating carrot must be in position 2.
- If the person eating apricot is in position 2, there is no valid position for the person eating carrot (since it has to be to the right, but there is no position to the right of 2).

Given these conditions, let's deduce the solution:

1. **If the person eating apricot is in position 1:**
   - The Indonesian must also be in position 1 (same parity).
   - Therefore, the person in position 2 cannot be the Indonesian, so it must be the person eating carrot.
   - This satisfies both conditions.

2. **If the person eating apricot is in position 2:**
   - There is no valid position for the person eating carrot (it has to be to the right, but there is no such position).

Therefore, the only valid solution is:
- Position 1: Apricot (and Indonesian)
- Position 2: Carrot

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Food          |  Apricot   |  Carrot |
| Nationality   |  Indonesian|  Indonesian |
