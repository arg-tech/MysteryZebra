- **Sport = Biathlon** for Brazilian (Clue 21)
- **Sport = Water-Polo** is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat (Clue 1) and not the owner of the ferret (Clue 27, 28, 35).
- **Hot-Chocolate** is at position 4 (Clue 2).
- **Hobby = Collecting** corresponds to **Sport = Skiing** (Clue 3).
- **Fanta** is on the left of the Australian (Clue 13), and since the person drinking fanta and the Colombian have the same parity positions (Clue 49), fanta must be at position 3.
- **Owner of the Rat** is in an odd position (1, 3, 5) (Clue 11, 22, 27, 31, 51, 52, 53).
- **Golf** is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the Chinese (Clue 6), and it is to the right of the owner of the fish (Clue 12).
