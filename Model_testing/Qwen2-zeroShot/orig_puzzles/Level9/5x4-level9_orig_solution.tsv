### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person Watching Musical Movies**: From Clue 1, it can be either 1 or 3.
2. **Person Watching Time-Travel Movies**: From Clue 3 and Clue 9, the person watching time-travel movies must be at 1 or 3 because the person watching musical movies is also at 1 or 3. But from Clue 10, the person watching musical movies is on the right of the journalist, so the person watching musical movies must be at 3, and the person watching time-travel movies must be at 1.
3. **Doctor Position**: From Clue 6, the doctor must be at 4 because the person drinking 7up must be at 1 or 3 (but 3 is taken by the person watching time-travel movies), so the doctor is at 4.
4. **Electrician Position**: From Clue 4, the electrician cannot be at 4 (doctor). So, the electrician must be at 2.
5. **Person Drinking 7up**: From Clue 12, the person drinking 7up must be at 2 (electrician) or 3 (person watching time-travel movies, but that's already taken). So, the person drinking 7up is at 2, and the person drinking soy-milk is at 4 (doctor).
6. **Person Drinking Milk**: From Clue 7, the person drinking milk must be at 1 or 3 (but 3 is taken by the person watching time-travel movies). So, the person drinking milk is at 1.
7. **Fan of Funk**: From Clue 8, the fan of funk is to the left of the person watching sports movies. From Clue 20, the fan of funk is in an odd position, so it must be at 1 or 3. Since 1 is taken by the person drinking milk, the fan of funk must be at 3.
8. **Person Watching Adventure Movies**: From Clue 4, the person watching adventure movies cannot be at 4 (doctor). So, the person watching adventure movies must be at 2 (electrician) or 3 (fan of funk). But since the fan of funk is at 3, the person watching adventure movies must be at 2.
9. **Person Watching Sports Movies**: From Clue 8, the person watching sports movies must be to the right of the fan of funk. So, the person watching sports movies must be at 4 (doctor).
10. **Fan of Blues**: From Clue 2, the person whose hobby is Sudoku and the fan of blues have different parity positions. From Clue 3, the fan of blues and the person watching time-travel movies have the same parity positions. Since the person watching time-travel movies is at 1, the fan of blues must be at 3 (same parity as 1). The person whose hobby is Sudoku must be at 2 (different parity as 3).
