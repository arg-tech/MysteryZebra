Lv9-4x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information provided and deduce the correct placement step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Beverages:**
   - There are two different beverages: almond-milk and tea.
   - The person who drinks tea has magic-tricks as their hobby (from clue 1).

2. **Hobbies:**
   - There are two different hobbies: magic-tricks and skydiving.
   - The person with the hobby of magic-tricks is on the left of the person who drinks tea.
   - Therefore, if we denote the person who drinks tea as T and the person with magic-tricks as M, then M must be in position 1 and T must be in position 2.

3. **Jobs:**
   - There are two different jobs: videographer and writer.
   - The writer and the person with the hobby of skydiving have different parity positions (clue 2).
   - Since M (magic-tricks) is in position 1, the skydiver cannot be in position 1, so the skydiver must be in position 2.
   - This means the writer must be in position 1 because the writer and the skydiver have different parity positions.

4. **Music-Genres:**
   - There are two different music-genres: hip-hop and soul.
   - The fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of soul (clue 3).
   - Since M (magic-tricks) is in position 1 and T (tea) is in position 2, the fan of soul must be in position 1 and the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2.

### Final Table:

Lv9-4x2-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

### Clues:
1. The videographer and the person driving the train have different parity positions.
2. The person driving the train is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the colombian.

### Initial Setup:
We need to fill in the table with the following categories:
- Job (photographer, videographer)
- Nationality (colombian, polish)
- Sport (ice-hockey, sailing)
- Transport (train, van)

|               |      1       |      2       |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Job           |              |              |
| Nationality   |              |              |
| Sport         |              |              |
| Transport     |              |              |

### Analyzing the Clues:

#### Clue 1:
The videographer and the person driving the train have different parity positions.
- This means one is in position 1 and the other is in position 2.

#### Clue 2:
The person driving the train is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
- If the person driving the train is in position 1, then the person whose sport is ice-hockey must be in position 1 or 2.
- If the person driving the train is in position 2, then the person whose sport is ice-hockey must be in position 1.

#### Clue 3:
The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the colombian.
- This means the colombian cannot be in position 1 if the person whose sport is ice-hockey is in position 1, and the colombian cannot be in position 2 if the person whose sport is ice-hockey is in position 2.

### Deduction:
From Clue 2, let's assume the person driving the train is in position 1:
- Then the person whose sport is ice-hockey must be in position 1 or 2.
- But from Clue 3, the colombian must be to the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey. So, if the person whose sport is ice-hockey is in position 1, the colombian must be in position 2. However, this would violate Clue 1 because the videographer and the person driving the train must have different parity positions.

Therefore, the person driving the train must be in position 2:
- The person whose sport is ice-hockey must be in position 1.
- The colombian must be in position 2 (to satisfy Clue 3).

### Final Assignment:
- Position 1: Person driving the train (not the videographer), sport is ice-hockey.
- Position 2: Videographer, colombian.

Now, we can assign the remaining jobs, nationalities, and sports:
- Since the person driving the train is in position 2, the videographer must be in position 1.
- The colombian is in position 2, so the polish person must be in position 1.
- The sport in position 1 is ice-hockey, so the sport in position 2 must be sailing.

### Final Table:
|               |      1       |      2       |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Job           | videographer | photographer |
| Nationality   | polish       | colombian    |
| Sport         | ice-hockey   | sailing      |
| Transport     | van          | train        |

Lv9-4x2-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given clues to determine the correct arrangement.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the scientist have different parity positions.
2. The Russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
3. The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the left of the person eating pear.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: Different Parity Positions for Rock-Climber and Scientist
- This means if one is in an odd position (1), the other must be in an even position (2).

#### Clue 2: Russian on the Right of the Person with Reading Hobby
- If the person with the reading hobby is in position 1, the Russian must be in position 2.
- If the person with the reading hobby is in position 2, there is no restriction on the Russian's position as it would be to the right.

#### Clue 3: Person with Reading Hobby Somewhere to the Left of the Person Eating Pear
- This means the person with the reading hobby cannot be in position 2 if the person eating pear is in position 1.

### Possible Arrangements Based on Clues:

1. **Position 1: Reading Hobby**
   - If the person with the reading hobby is in position 1, then the Russian must be in position 2.
   - This means the person eating pear cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 2. However, this would conflict with the Russian being in position 2, so this is not possible.

2. **Position 2: Reading Hobby**
   - If the person with the reading hobby is in position 2, the Russian can be in any position except 1.
   - The person eating pear must be in position 1.

### Let's Assign Values:

- **Position 1:**
  - Must be either the person with the reading hobby or the person eating pear.
  - Since the person with the reading hobby is in position 2, the person eating pear must be in position 1.

- **Position 2:**
  - Must be the person with the reading hobby (as per clue 2).
  - The Russian cannot be here, so the Russian must be in position 1.

- **Clue 1:**
  - The scientist and rock-climber have different parity positions.
  - Since the Russian is in position 1, the scientist must be in position 2.

- **Clue 3:**
  - The person with the reading hobby is in position 2, and the person eating pear is in position 1.
  - This does not conflict with any other conditions.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1     |        2        |

Lv9-4x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and place the information into the table.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person eating apricot.
2. The person who's hobby is reading and the owner of the turtle have the same parity positions.
3. The person who's sport is cricket and the person who's hobby is woodworking have the same parity positions.

### Initial Table:
```
|         |      1      |       2       |
| Food    |             |               |
| Hobby   |             |               |
| Pet     |             |               |
| Sport   |             |               |
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person eating apricot.
This means if someone is eating apricot (in position 1 or 2), the turtle owner must be in the adjacent position (either 2 or 1).

#### Clue 2: The person who's hobby is reading and the owner of the turtle have the same parity positions.
This means that if the hobby is reading, it must be in the same position as the turtle owner.

#### Clue 3: The person who's sport is cricket and the person who's hobby is woodworking have the same parity positions.
This means that if the sport is cricket, it must be in the same position as the hobby of woodworking.

### Assigning Positions:

Let's start by assigning positions for the food and see where the turtle and apricot fit based on Clue 1.

**Case 1: Apricot in Position 1**
- Turtle must be in Position 2 (Clue 1).
- Reading must be in Position 2 (Clue 2).

So, we have:
```
|         |      1      |       2       |
| Food    | apricot    | asparagus    |
| Hobby   | reading    | woodworking  |
| Pet     |            |              |
| Sport   |            |              |
```

Now, let's check Clue 3:
- Cricket must be in Position 1 (same parity as woodworking which is in Position 2).

So, we have:
```
|         |      1      |       2       |
| Food    | apricot    | asparagus    |
| Hobby   | reading    | woodworking  |
| Pet     |            |              |
| Sport   | cricket    | skateboarding |
```

Finally, we need to assign the pets:
- Since cricket is in Position 1, the pet in Position 1 must be the bird (because the turtle is in Position 2).
- Asparagus is eaten by the person with the pet turtle (Clue 1).

So, we have:
```
|         |      1      |       2       |
| Food    | apricot    | asparagus    |
| Hobby   | reading    | woodworking  |
| Pet     | bird       | turtle       |
| Sport   | cricket    | skateboarding |
```

### Final Solution:
```
|         |      1      |       2       |
| Food    | apricot    | asparagus    |
| Hobby   | reading    | woodworking  |
| Pet     | bird       | turtle       |
| Sport   | cricket    | skateboarding |

Lv9-4x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.
   - This means the lizard owner cannot be in position 2 if the bus driver is in position 1, or if the lizard owner is in position 1, the bus driver must be in position 2 or later.

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating lemon and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions.
   - Parity means whether a number is even or odd. If one person is in an even-numbered position, the other must also be in an even-numbered position (or both in odd-numbered positions).

3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies.
   - Similar to Clue 1, but now with respect to the movie genre.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Positions for Lizard Owner and Bus Driver**:
   - From Clue 1, the lizard owner must be in position 1, and the bus driver must be in position 2.

2. **Determine the Positions for Lemon and Motorbike**:
   - From Clue 2, since the positions must have the same parity, the person eating lemon and the person driving the motorbike must both be in either position 1 or 2 (both even/odd).

3. **Determine the Positions for Satire Movies**:
   - From Clue 3, the owner of the lizard (position 1) is to the left of the person watching satire movies. Therefore, the person watching satire movies must be in position 2.

4. **Assign Remaining Items**:
   - Since the bus driver is in position 2 and the person watching satire movies is also in position 2, the person driving the bus and the person watching satire movies must be the same person. This contradicts our earlier placement of the lizard owner in position 1 and the bus driver in position 2. Hence, we need to re-evaluate.

Given these constraints, let's try another approach:

- Place the lizard owner in position 1 and the bus driver in position 2.
- The person eating lemon and the person driving the motorbike must be in the same parity position. Let's assume they are in position 1 and 3 respectively (since 1 is odd and 3 is odd).
- The person watching satire movies must be in position 2 (as per Clue 3).

This leaves us with:
- Position 1: Lizard owner, Eating cranberry (since the other option is lemon)
- Position 2: Bus driver, Watching satire
- Position 3: Motorbike driver, Eating lemon
- Position 4: Eating cranberry, Watching martial-arts

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1       |     2     |    3    |    4    |
| Food          | Cranberry    | Cranberry | Lemon   | Lemon   |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts | Satire    | Satire  | Martial-arts |
| Pet           | Lizard       | Rabbit    | Rabbit  | Lizard  |
| Transport     | Bus          | Motorbike | Bus     | Motorbike |
```

### Explanation:
- **Position 1**: Lizard owner, Eating cranberry.
- **Position 2**: Bus driver, Watching satire.
- **Position 3**: Motorbike driver, Eating lemon.
- **Position 4**: Eating cranberry, Watching martial-arts.

This configuration satisfies all the given clues."
Lv9-4x2-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
2. The fan of ambient music and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
3. The fan of indie music is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient music.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
- This means that if one person is in position 1 for watching comedy, then the person with soccer must be in position 2.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- The fan of ambient music and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions.
- This means they are either both in position 1 (odd) and 2 (even), or both in position 2 (even) and 1 (odd).

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The fan of indie music is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient music.
- This means if the fan of ambient music is in position 1, the fan of indie music must be in position 2.

### Combining the Clues:

From Clue 1:
- If Comedy is in position 1, Soccer must be in position 2.
- If Comedy is in position 2, Soccer must be in position 1.

From Clue 2:
- If the fan of ambient music is in position 1, the owner of the cat must also be in position 1 (same parity).
- If the fan of ambient music is in position 2, the owner of the cat must also be in position 2 (same parity).

From Clue 3:
- If the fan of ambient music is in position 1, the fan of indie music must be in position 2.
- If the fan of ambient music is in position 2, the fan of indie music must be in position 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

1. **Ambient in Position 1:**
   - Owner of the cat in Position 1.
   - Indie in Position 2.
   - Comedy in Position 2 (from Clue 1).
   - Soccer in Position 1 (from Clue 1).

2. **Ambient in Position 2:**
   - Owner of the cat in Position 2.
   - Indie in Position 1.
   - Comedy in Position 1 (from Clue 1).
   - Soccer in Position 2 (from Clue 1).

### Final Arrangement:

Given these constraints, let's test each arrangement:

**Ambient in Position 1:**
- Position 1: Ambient, Cat
- Position 2: Indie, Comedy
- Position 3: Thriller, Lizard
- Position 4: Basketball, Soccer

This fits all the clues:
- The person watching comedy is on the right of the person playing soccer.
- The fan of ambient and the owner of the cat have the same parity (both in Position 1).
- The fan of indie is to the right of the fan of ambient.

**Ambient in Position 2:**
- Position 1: Indie, Comedy
- Position 2: Ambient, Lizard
- Position 3: Thriller, Cat
- Position 4: Basketball, Soccer

This does not fit Clue 3 because the fan of indie is not to the right of the fan of ambient.

Thus, the correct arrangement is:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller | Comedy     |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  | Indie      |
| Pet           | Lizard   | Cat        |

Lv9-4x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and systematically fill in the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking tea is on the left of the fan of house.
2. The person watching sports movies and the fan of house have the same parity positions.
3. The person whose hobby is dancing and the person drinking fanta have the same parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The person drinking tea is on the left of the fan of house.
This means if we denote the person drinking tea as T and the fan of house as H, then T must be in position 1 and H must be in position 2.

So, we can start with:
```
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |    T    |    H       |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |         |            |
```

#### Clue 2: The person watching sports movies and the fan of house have the same parity positions.
Since the fan of house (H) is in position 2, the person watching sports movies must also be in an even position, which means it must be in position 2. So, the sports movie watcher is in position 2 for movie genre.

So, we update the table:
```
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |    T    |    H       |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         | Sports    |
| Music-Genre   |         |            |
```

#### Clue 3: The person whose hobby is dancing and the person drinking fanta have the same parity positions.
Since the person drinking tea (T) is in position 1, the person whose hobby is dancing must also be in position 1. Therefore, the person drinking fanta (F) must be in position 2.

So, we update the table:
```
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |    T    |    H       |
| Hobby         | Dancing |    F       |
| Movie-Genre   |         | Sports    |
| Music-Genre   |         |            |
```

Now, we need to determine the remaining details:
- The person drinking tea (T) cannot be a fan of house (H), so the person drinking tea must be a fan of fanta (F).
- The person whose hobby is dancing (D) cannot be a fan of sports (S), so the person whose hobby is dancing must be a fan of scientific (S).

So, we update the table:
```
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |    T    |    H       |
| Hobby         | Dancing |    F       |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific | Sports    |
| Music-Genre   | House    | Soul      |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |    T    |    H       |
| Hobby         | Dancing |    F       |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific | Sports    |
| Music-Genre   | House    | Soul      |
```

The final solution table is:
```
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |    T    |    H       |
| Hobby         | Dancing |    F       |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific | Sports    |

Lv9-4x2-8	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

Given the constraints:

1. The person driving the boat is on the right of the fisherman.
2. The person driving the boat and the person watching thrillers have different parity positions.
3. The person watching westerns and the person drinking water have different parity positions.

We need to fill in the table as follows:

|               |     1     |     2      |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Beverage      |           |            |
| Job           |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Transport     |           |            |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the person driving the boat and their position relative to the fisherman:**
   - Since the person driving the boat is on the right of the fisherman, we can denote:
     - Fisherman: Position 1 (left)
     - Boat Driver: Position 2 (right)

2. **Determine the movie genres for the boat driver and the fisherman:**
   - From constraint 2, the boat driver and the person watching thrillers must have different parity positions. Since the boat driver is in position 2, they cannot watch thrillers (which would be in an odd position).
   - Therefore, the fisherman watches thrillers (Position 1).

3. **Determine the movie genres for the fisherman and the boat driver:**
   - Since the fisherman is in position 1 and watches thrillers, the boat driver must watch westerns (since there are only two genres: thriller and western).

4. **Determine the beverages for the fisherman and the boat driver:**
   - From constraint 3, the person watching westerns (boat driver) and the person drinking water have different parity positions. Since the boat driver is in position 2, they must drink water.
   - Therefore, the fisherman drinks mirinda (since there are only two beverages: mirinda and water).

5. **Assign the remaining job:**
   - Since the fisherman is already assigned the job of journalist, the boat driver must be the fisherman.

### Final Table:

|               |     1     |     2      |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Beverage      | Mirinda   | Water      |
| Job           | Journalist| Fisherman  |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller  | Western    |

Lv9-4x2-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The Russian is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
2. **Clue 2**: The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony.
3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the rabbit and the person eating onion have the same parity positions.

We need to fill in the table with the following information:
- Food: onion, pineapple
- Nationality: Indonesian, Russian
- Pet: pony, rabbit
- Sport: cycling, swimming

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Determine the order based on Clue 1**
- The Russian must be on the left of the person who prefers swimming.
- Since there are only two columns, this means the Russian is in column 1 and the person who prefers swimming is in column 2.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          |           |            |
| Nationality   | Russian   | Indonesian |
| Pet           |           |            |
| Sport         | Swimming  | Cycling    |

**Step 2: Determine the order based on Clue 2**
- The owner of the rabbit is to the right of the owner of the pony.
- Given the current order, this means the owner of the pony is in column 1 and the owner of the rabbit is in column 2.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          |           |            |
| Nationality   | Russian   | Indonesian |
| Pet           | Pony      | Rabbit     |
| Sport         | Swimming  | Cycling    |

**Step 3: Determine the food preferences based on Clue 3**
- The owner of the rabbit (in column 2) and the person eating onion have the same parity positions.
- Since the owner of the rabbit is in column 2, and the parity position is even, the person eating onion must also be in an even position (column 2).

Given that the person eating onion is in column 2, and the only remaining food is pineapple, the person eating onion must be eating pineapple.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Pineapple | Onion      |
| Nationality   | Russian   | Indonesian |
| Pet           | Pony      | Rabbit     |
| Sport         | Swimming  | Cycling    |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Pineapple | Onion      |
| Nationality   | Russian   | Indonesian |
| Pet           | Pony      | Rabbit     |
| Sport         | Swimming  | Cycling    |

Lv9-4x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and place the information into the table.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The musician and the person eating peach have different parity positions.**
   - This means if the musician is in an odd position, the person eating peach must be in an even position, and vice versa.

2. **The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.**
   - This means the chess player is not in the last (rightmost) position, and the bus driver is to their right.

3. **The person driving the train is the person who's hobby is chess.**
   - So, the chess player is also the train driver.

4. **The musician is on the far left.**
   - The musician is in position 1.

Given these clues, we can start filling in the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1 (far left): Musician**
   - Musician is in position 1.
   - Since the musician is on the far left, they cannot be eating peach (because the musician and the person eating peach have different parity positions).

2. **Position 2:**
   - The person in position 2 could either be the person eating peach or the one with the hobby of chess (since the chess player is also the train driver).
   - We need to determine which one fits based on the other clues.

3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the train is the person who's hobby is chess.
   - Therefore, the person in position 2 must be the chess player (and hence the train driver).

4. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.
   - Since the chess player is in position 2, the bus driver must be in position 3 or 4.

5. **Clue 1:** The musician and the person eating peach have different parity positions.
   - Since the musician is in position 1 (odd), the person eating peach must be in position 2 (even).

6. **Position 3 and 4:**
   - Position 3 must be the bus driver (since the chess player is in position 2 and the bus driver is to the right of the chess player).
   - Position 4 must be the person eating banana (the only remaining option).
