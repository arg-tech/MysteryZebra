12. **The fan d&b is between the person who's hobby is photography and the chef**.
13. **The fan rock and the firefighter have the same parity positions**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is cooking is in an even position. So, cooking must be in position 2 or 4.
2. **Clue 1**: The person with cooking is either to the left or right of the person with skydiving. This means skydiving cannot be in position 1 (since it would make cooking in position 2 or 4 impossible without violating Clue 1).
3. **Clue 2**: Skydiving is either to the left or right of gardening. Since skydiving cannot be in position 1, gardening can only be in position 2, 3, or 4.
4. **Clue 6**: Gardening is on the right of the fan rock. This means the fan rock must be in position 1 or 2.
5. **Clue 3**: The fan rock is not to the right of the fan d&b. This means the fan rock must be in position 1.
6. **Clue 4**: The fan d&b is not to the left of the police-officer. This means the police-officer must be to the right of the fan d&b.
7. **Clue 8**: The fan rock is not the police-officer. So, the police-officer cannot be in position 1.
8. **Clue 7**: The analyst is the fan country. This means the analyst cannot be in position 1.
9. **Clue 11**: The person who's hobby is gardening is not to the left of the person who's hobby is photography. This means photography cannot be in position 1 or 2.
10. **Clue 10**: The person who's hobby is photography is not to the right of the firefighter. This means the firefighter must be to the right of photography.
11. **Clue 9**: The fan d&b is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is photography.
12. **Clue 12**: The fan d&b is between the person who's hobby is photography and the chef. This means photography must be in position 3, and the chef must be in position 4.
13. **Clue 13**: The fan rock and the firefighter have the same parity positions. Since the fan rock is in position 1 (odd), the firefighter must also be in an odd position.

Given these constraints, let's assign the values:

- Position 1: Fan rock (d&b)
- Position 2: Cooking
- Position 3: Photography
- Position 4: Chef

Now, let's determine the hobbies and jobs:

- Position 1: Fan rock (d&b) - Police-officer (since fan rock is not the police-officer and it must be an odd position)
- Position 2: Cooking - Analyst (fan country)
- Position 3: Photography - Firefighter (must be to the right of photography and cannot be in position 1 or 2)
- Position 4: Chef - Must be to the right of photography

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |      1      |       2        |     3     |    4    |
| Hobby         |   d&b      |   cooking     |  photography |  skydiving |
| Job           | police-officer | analyst     |  firefighter |  chef    |
| Music-Genre   | techno     | country      |  rock      |  techno  |
```

This satisfies all the given conditions."

Lv9-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person who's hobby is drawing is not to the left of the Chinese.
2. The Egyptian is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
3. The Egyptian is the person who's hobby is drawing.
4. The Egyptian is somewhere between the Italian and the owner of the guinea-pig.
5. The person who's hobby is video-games and the Chinese have different parity positions (i.e., if one is in an odd position, the other is in an even position).
6. The owner of the mouse is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
7. The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the Italian.
8. The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
9. The Dutch is on the left of the Chinese.
10. The owner of the bird is between the Chinese and the owner of the turtle.
11. The person who's hobby is fishing is not the Chinese.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3:** The Egyptian is the person who's hobby is drawing.
2. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is drawing (Egyptian) is not to the left of the Chinese. So, Chinese cannot be in position 1 or 2.
3. **Clue 2:** The Egyptian (drawing) is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since Egyptian is already in position 1 or 2, the person with fishing must be in position 3 or 4.
4. **Clue 9:** The Dutch is on the left of the Chinese. This means Chinese cannot be in position 1.
5. **Clue 4:** The Egyptian (drawing) is between the Italian and the owner of the guinea-pig. Given that Egyptian is in position 1 or 2, the Italian and the owner of the guinea-pig must be in positions 3 and 4.
6. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is video-games and the Chinese have different parity positions. If Chinese is in position 2 (even), then the person with video-games must be in position 1 or 3 (odd). If Chinese is in position 4 (even), then the person with video-games must be in position 3 (odd).

### Positioning:

- **Position 1:** Egyptian (drawing)
- **Position 2:** Chinese (since it cannot be to the left of Egyptian)
- **Position 3:** Italian
- **Position 4:** Owner of the guinea-pig

### Parity Check for Video-Games:

- If Chinese is in position 2 (even), then the person with video-games must be in position 1 (odd). But position 1 is already taken by Egyptian. Therefore, Chinese must be in position 4 (even) and the person with video-games must be in position 3 (odd).

Thus, the person with video-games is in position 3, which is Italian.

### Final Parity Check:

- **Position 1:** Egyptian (drawing)
- **Position 2:** Chinese
- **Position 3:** Italian (video-games)
- **Position 4:** Owner of the guinea-pig

### Remaining Hobbies and Pets:

- **Clue 11:** The person who's hobby is fishing is not the Chinese. So, the person with fishing must be in position 3 or 4, but since Italian is in position 3 (video-games), the person with fishing must be in position 4.
- **Clue 8:** The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games (Italian). So, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 4.
- **Clue 6:** The owner of the mouse is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing (Egyptian). So, the owner of the mouse must be in position 1 or 2. Given the positioning, the owner of the mouse must be in position 2.
- **Clue 7:** The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the Italian. So, the owner of the mouse is in position 2.
- **Clue 10:** The owner of the bird is between the Chinese and the owner of the turtle. Given the positioning, the owner of the bird must be in position 3, and the owner of the turtle must be in position 4.

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1      |     2      |    3     |    4    |
| Hobby         | Drawing     | Fishing    | Video-games | Hiking  |
| Nationality   | Egyptian    | Chinese    | Italian    | Dutch   |
| Pet           | Mouse       | Guinea-pig | Turtle     | Bird    |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is also the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This means we can pair these two.

2. From Clue 3, if Chess is in position 1, Camping (Ice-Hockey) must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since Camping is Ice-Hockey, let's consider the possible positions for Chess:
   - If Chess is in position 1, then Camping/Ice-Hockey must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - If Chess is in position 2, then Camping/Ice-Hockey must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If Chess is in position 3, then Camping/Ice-Hockey must be in position 4.

3. From Clue 4, Chess cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 2.

4. From Clue 5, Rowing and Ice-Hockey are consecutive. If Chess is in position 1, then Ice-Hockey (Camping) must be in position 2, and Rowing must be in position 3.

5. From Clue 10, if Camping is in position 2, then Rowing must be in position 1 and Dancing in position 3.

6. From Clue 1, since Coffee and Dancing have the same parity, and Dancing is in position 3, Coffee must be in position 1.

7. From Clue 7, Water is to the left of 7up. Since Coffee is in position 1, Water must be in position 2, and 7up in position 4.

8. From Clue 6, Sailing is next to 7up, so Sailing must be in position 3.

9. From Clue 9, Coffee is to the left of Woodworking, and Coffee is in position 1, so Woodworking must be in position 4.

10. From Clue 11, Coffee (position 1) is adjacent to Lacrosse, so Lacrosse must be in position 2.

### Final Table:

```
|            |   1    |     2      |    3    |      4      |

Lv9-3x4-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use logical deductions to find the correct arrangement.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Person driving the van is the person drinking lemonade (3).**
   - This means:
     - Van = Lemonade

2. **The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate (5).**
   - Since Lemonade is already placed, Hot-Chocolate must be to the right of Lemonade.
   - Possible positions for Lemonade: 1 or 2.
     - If Lemonade is in position 1, Hot-Chocolate must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
     - If Lemonade is in position 2, Hot-Chocolate must be in position 3 or 4.

3. **The person driving the subway is not to the right of the person drinking tea (1).**
   - This means if the person drinking tea is in position 2, 3, or 4, the person driving the subway cannot be in position 3 or 4.

4. **The person eating apricot and the person drinking juice have different parity positions (9).**
   - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position.

5. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the right of the person driving the skateboard (4).**
   - This means if the person driving the skateboard is in position 1 or 2, Hot-Chocolate cannot be in position 2 or 3.

6. **The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person eating blueberry (7).**
   - This means Blueberry must be to the right of Juice.

7. **The person driving the subway is on the left of the person drinking juice (8).**
   - This means Subway cannot be in position 2, 3, or 4, and Juice must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person eating apricot and the person drinking tea have the same parity positions (9).**
   - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must also be in an odd position.

9. **The person driving the van is on the far left or far right (3).**
   - We already know Van = Lemonade, so Lemonade is either in position 1 or 4.

10. **The person eating radish is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (3).**
    - This means Radish and Helicopter must be adjacent.

### Final Arrangement:

Given all these constraints, let's try to fit everything together:

- **Lemonade (Van) must be in position 1** (since it can only be at the far left or far right, and we need space for other items).
- **Hot-Chocolate must be to the right of Lemonade**, so it can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **Subway must be to the left of Juice**, so Subway can be in position 1 or 2.
- **Juice must be to the left of Blueberry**.
- **Apricot and Tea must have the same parity positions**.

Let's try the following arrangement:

1. **Subway**: Given it must be to the left of Juice and not to the right of Tea, and considering other constraints, it makes sense to place it in position 1.
2. **Juice**: To the right of Subway and to the left of Blueberry, it can be in position 2.
3. **Blueberry**: To the right of Juice, it can be in position 3.
4. **Hot-Chocolate**: To the right of Lemonade and not to the right of Skateboard, it can be in position 4.
5. **Lemonade (Van)**: Already placed in position 1.
6. **Tea**: To the right of Apricot, and with the same parity as Apricot, it must be in position 3.
7. **Apricot**: To the left of Tea, it must be in position 2.

Now, we need to assign the remaining food and transport items:

- **Helicopter**: Must be adjacent to Radish, and considering the positions, Helicopter can be in position 2 or 3, and Radish in position 3 or 2.
- **Cabbage**: Must have different parity from Hot-Chocolate, so Cabbage can be in position 3 (since Hot-Chocolate is in position 4).

Thus, the final arrangement is:

```
|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage    |  Juice   |  Hot-Chocolate |  Lemonade  |  Tea      |
| Food        |  Apricot |  Cabbage      |  Blueberry |  Radish   |
| Transport   |  Subway  |  Helicopter   |  Van       |  Skateboard  |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage    |  Juice   |  Hot-Chocolate |  Lemonade  |  Tea      |
| Food        |  Apricot |  Cabbage      |  Blueberry |  Radish   |

Lv9-3x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person whose sport is soccer is not to the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
2. The person whose hobby is card-games is not to the left of the person whose sport is cricket.
3. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the person whose sport is soccer.
4. The person whose hobby is card-games is on the right of the person whose hobby is baking.
5. The person whose hobby is writing is on the left of the person whose hobby is baking.
6. The person drinking juice is somewhere between the person whose hobby is cooking and the person whose hobby is baking.
7. The person whose hobby is baking is not to the right of the person whose hobby is baking (this is redundant but confirms consistency).
8. The person drinking milk and the person whose sport is badminton have the same parity positions (i.e., both are in even or odd positions).
9. The person whose sport is handball is on the far left.
10. The person whose hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is baking.
11. The person whose sport is badminton is between the person whose sport is handball and the person whose hobby is card-games.
12. The person whose hobby is baking is not to the right of the person whose sport is soccer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Handball is on the far left (position 1):**
   - Handball → 1

2. **Badminton is between Handball and Card-Games:**
   - Since Handball is at position 1, Badminton must be at position 2 or 3.
   - If Badminton were at position 3, then Card-Games would have to be at position 4, but this would violate clue 11 (Badminton is between Handball and Card-Games).

   Therefore, Badminton is at position 2, and Card-Games is at position 3:
   - Handball → 1
   - Badminton → 2
   - Card-Games → 3

3. **Writing is on the left of Baking:**
   - Writing must be at position 1 or 2, but since Handball is already at position 1, Writing must be at position 2.
   - Baking must be at position 3 or 4.
   - Since Card-Games is at position 3, Baking must be at position 4.
   - Writing → 2
   - Baking → 4

4. **Card-Games is on the right of Baking:**
   - This is consistent with our current placement (Card-Games at 3, Baking at 4).

5. **Soccer is not to the left of Writing:**
   - Writing is at position 2, so Soccer cannot be at position 1 or 2. Therefore, Soccer must be at position 3 or 4.
   - Since Baking is at position 4, Soccer must be at position 3.
   - Soccer → 3

6. **Iced-tea is not to the left of Soccer:**
   - Iced-tea cannot be at position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, Iced-tea must be at position 4.
   - Iced-tea → 4

7. **Juice is between Cooking and Baking:**
   - Cooking and Baking are at positions 2 and 4, respectively. Therefore, Juice must be at position 3.
   - Juice → 3

8. **Milk and Badminton have the same parity positions:**
   - Badminton is at position 2 (even), so Milk must also be at an even position.
   - The only remaining even position is 2, but it is already occupied by Badminton.
   - Therefore, Milk must be at position 4.
   - Milk → 4

9. **Soccer is not to the right of Baking:**
   - Soccer is at position 3, and Baking is at position 4, which is consistent.

### Final Table:

```
|            |    1     |     2     |     3      |    4     |
| Beverage   |  Iced-tea|    Milk   |    Juice   |   7up    |
| Hobby      |  Writing|  Badminton|  Card-games|  Baking  |
| Sport      | Handball|  Cricket  |   Soccer   | Badminton|
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."

10. The person driving the jet-ski is in an even position.
11. The fan of electronic is not to the right of the fan of disco.
12. The person driving the skateboard and the fan of techno have the same parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6**: The Mexican is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Mexican

2. **Clue 10**: The person driving the jet-ski is in an even position (2 or 4).
   - Since the Mexican is in position 1, the jet-ski driver must be in position 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The Nigerian is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
   - Therefore, the Nigerian cannot be in position 4. The possible positions for the Nigerian are 2 or 3.

4. **Clue 3**: The Nigerian is somewhere between the Polish and the fan of techno.
   - This implies that the Nigerian, Polish, and fan of techno must occupy three consecutive positions.

5. **Clue 4**: The fan of techno is not to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
   - The person driving the quad-bike must be to the left of the fan of techno.

6. **Clue 5**: The Nigerian is not to the right of the fan of techno.
   - Combining with Clue 3, we can narrow down the positions for these three people.

7. **Clue 7**: The fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of disco.
   - This implies that the fan of electronic is in position 1 or 2, and the fan of disco is in position 2 or 3.

8. **Clue 9**: The fan of electronic is not to the right of the fan of disco.
   - This further confirms that the fan of electronic is in position 1 and the fan of disco is in position 2 or 3.

9. **Clue 8**: The person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the Polish.
   - The train driver must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the Polish must be in position 3 or 4.

10. **Clue 12**: The person driving the skateboard and the fan of techno have the same parity positions.
    - Since the jet-ski driver is in position 4 (even), the skateboard driver and the fan of techno must also be in even positions (2 or 4).

### Final Placement:

- **Position 1**: Mexican
- **Position 2**: Fan of electronic
- **Position 3**: Fan of disco
- **Position 4**: Jet-ski driver (Nigerian)

Given the constraints, let's place the remaining elements:

- The Polish cannot be in position 4 (jet-ski driver) and must be in position 3 (since the Nigerian is in position 4).
- The fan of techno must be in position 2 (same parity as the jet-ski driver).

So, the final arrangement is:

| Music-Genre   | Nationality | Transport   |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Electronic    | Mexican     | Train       |
| Disco         | Fan of electronic | Skateboard  |
| Gospel        | Fan of disco | Polish      |
| Techno        | Nigerian    | Jet-ski     |

|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Electronic    | Mexican     | Train       |
| Disco         | Fan of electronic | Skateboard  |
| Gospel        | Fan of disco | Polish      |
| Techno        | Nigerian    | Jet-ski     |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of ambient is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep.
   - This means if someone is a fan of dubstep, the person who is a fan of ambient must be to their right.

2. **Clue 2**: The British is not to the left of the British.
   - This clue is redundant since it's impossible for someone to be to the left of themselves.

3. **Clue 3**: The person eating cherry is not to the left of the Spanish.
   - This means the Spanish must be to the left of the person eating cherry.

4. **Clue 4**: The person eating cherry is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish.
   - This means the person eating radish must be to the left of the person eating cherry.

5. **Clue 5**: The fan of ambient is not the Japanese.
   - This means the Japanese cannot be a fan of ambient.

6. **Clue 6**: The Spanish and the fan of ambient have different parity positions.
   - If the Spanish is in an odd position, the fan of ambient must be in an even position, and vice versa.

7. **Clue 7**: The person eating watermelon is not to the left of the Spanish.
   - This means the Spanish must be to the left of the person eating watermelon.

8. **Clue 8**: The person eating watermelon and the British have different parity positions.
   - If the British is in an odd position, the person eating watermelon must be in an even position, and vice versa.

9. **Clue 9**: The fan of jazz is on the left of the person eating apricot.
   - This means the person eating apricot must be to the right of the fan of jazz.

10. **Clue 10**: The Spanish and the fan of dubstep have different parity positions.
    - If the Spanish is in an odd position, the fan of dubstep must be in an even position, and vice versa.

11. **Clue 11**: The person eating radish is somewhere between the fan of ambient and the person eating apricot.
    - This means the person eating apricot must be to the right of the person eating radish, and the person eating radish must be to the right of the fan of ambient.

12. **Clue 12**: The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient.
    - This means the Japanese cannot be in the last position and must be to the left of the fan of ambient.

13. **Clue 13**: The British is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon.
    - This means the British can be either to the left or right of the person eating watermelon.

### Analyzing and Placing the Elements:

From Clues 1, 11, and 12, we can deduce:
- The fan of ambient cannot be in position 1 (because then the Japanese would also need to be in an earlier position, which is not possible).
- The fan of ambient cannot be in position 4 (because then there would be no room for the person eating radish to be between the fan of ambient and the person eating apricot).

Thus, the fan of ambient must be in position 2 or 3.

Given Clue 6 and Clue 10, the Spanish and the fan of ambient must have different parity positions:
- If the Spanish is in position 1 (odd), the fan of ambient must be in position 2 (even).
- If the Spanish is in position 2 (even), the fan of ambient must be in position 1 (odd).

Given Clue 3 and Clue 4, the person eating cherry must be to the right of the person eating radish, and the Spanish must be to the left of the person eating cherry:
- If the Spanish is in position 1, the person eating cherry must be in position 3 or 4, and the person eating radish must be in position 1 or 2.
- If the Spanish is in position 2, the person eating cherry must be in position 4, and the person eating radish must be in position 1.

Given Clue 5, the Japanese cannot be a fan of ambient, so if the fan of ambient is in position 2, the Japanese must be in position 1.

Given Clue 7, the person eating watermelon must be to the right of the Spanish, and they must have different parity positions:
- If the Spanish is in position 1, the person eating watermelon must be in position 3 or 4.
- If the Spanish is in position 2, the person eating watermelon must be in position 4.

Given Clue 8, the person eating watermelon and the British must have different parity positions:
- If the person eating watermelon is in position 3 (odd), the British must be in position 2 (even).
- If the person eating watermelon is in position 4 (even), the British must be in position 3 (odd).

Given Clue 9, the fan of jazz must be to the left of the person eating apricot:
- If the fan of jazz is in position 1, the person eating apricot must be in position 2 or 3.
- If the fan of jazz is in position 2, the person eating apricot must be in position 3 or 4.
