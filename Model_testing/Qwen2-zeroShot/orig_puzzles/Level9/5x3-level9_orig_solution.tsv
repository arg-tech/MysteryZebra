Lv9-5x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each piece of information into the grid while ensuring all conditions are met. Let's start by organizing the given information and solving step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Condition 1:** The person eating corn is on the far left or far right.
   - This means corn can only be in position 1 or 3.

2. **Condition 2:** The fan of jazz is somewhere to the right of the person watching western movies.
   - This means the person who likes jazz cannot be in position 1, and the person watching western movies cannot be in position 3.

3. **Condition 3:** The person eating watermelon is between the person eating pumpkin and the person watching spy movies.
   - This implies that if the person eating watermelon is in position 2, then the person eating pumpkin must be in position 1 and the person watching spy movies must be in position 3, or vice versa.

4. **Condition 4:** The fan of pop is not to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.
   - This means the person with the hobby of card-games cannot be in position 1 if the fan of pop is in position 2 or 3.

5. **Condition 5:** The person whose hobby is dancing is the engineer.
   - This fixes one of the job entries.

6. **Condition 6:** The person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the fan of jazz.
   - This means the person watching time-travel movies cannot be in position 1 if the fan of jazz is in position 2 or 3.

7. **Condition 7:** The person watching western movies and the person eating corn have different parity positions.
   - If corn is in position 1 (odd), the person watching western movies must be in an even position (2 or 3). Conversely, if corn is in position 3 (odd), the person watching western movies must be in an even position (2).

8. **Condition 8:** The accountant is the fan of jazz.
   - This fixes another job entry.

9. **Condition 9:** The person whose hobby is dancing is on the left of the pilot.
   - This means the person with the hobby of dancing cannot be in position 3 if the pilot is in position 2 or 3.

### Solving the Grid:

Let's start by placing the known values:
- **Job:** The engineer has the hobby of dancing (Condition 5).
- **Job:** The accountant is the fan of jazz (Condition 8).

Now let's use the conditions to fill in the rest:

1. **Condition 1:** Corn can be in position 1 or 3.
2. **Condition 7:** The person eating corn and the person watching western movies have different parity positions.
3. **Condition 2 & 6:** The fan of jazz is to the right of the person watching western movies, and the person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the fan of jazz.
4. **Condition 3:** The person eating watermelon is between the person eating pumpkin and the person watching spy movies.
5. **Condition 4:** The fan of pop is not to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.
6. **Condition 9:** The person whose hobby is dancing is on the left of the pilot.

Let's assume corn is in position 1 (odd):
- **Position 1:** Corn
- **Position 3:** Western movies (since it must be in an odd position)

Now, the fan of jazz must be in position 2 or 3:
- **Position 2:** Fan of jazz (since the fan of jazz is to the right of the person watching western movies)
- **Position 3:** Time-travel movies (since the person watching time-travel movies cannot be in position 1)

The person eating pumpkin and the person watching spy movies must be positioned such that the person eating watermelon is between them:
- **Position 2:** Watermelon (since it must be between pumpkin and spy movies)
- **Position 1:** Pumpkin
- **Position 3:** Spy movies

Finally, the fan of pop must be in position 3 since the fan of pop cannot be to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games, and the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 2 (since the person with the hobby of dancing is in position 1).

So, the final grid looks like this:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food          |  Corn    |  Pumpkin   |  Watermelon |
| Hobby         |  Dancing |  Card-games|  Fishing    |

| Movie-Genre   |  Spy     |  Time-travel|  Western    |
| Music-Genre   |  Jazz    |  Pop       |  Punk       |
```

### Final Solution:

```

10. The person whose sport is cycling and the software-developer have different parity positions.
11. The person whose sport is cycling and the person watching spy movies have different parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 4
Clue 1 and Clue 4 together imply that the person drinking lemonade cannot be to the right of the person whose sport is cycling and also cannot be to the right of the person whose hobby is board-games. This means the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 3
Clue 2 states that the person watching superhero movies is to the right of the person whose hobby is sudoku. Clue 3 states that these two individuals have different parity positions. Therefore, one must be in an odd position (1 or 3) and the other in an even position (2).

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 7
Clue 7 states that the fisherman is to the left of the person drinking lemonade. This implies that the fisherman cannot be in position 3 if the lemonade drinker is in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 8 and Clue 9
Clue 8 states that the person whose hobby is sudoku is to the right of the person whose hobby is photography. Clue 9 states that the person whose sport is parkour is not to the left of the person whose hobby is sudoku. This means the person whose hobby is parkour must be to the right of the person whose hobby is photography but can be to the left of the person whose hobby is sudoku.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 5 and Clue 10
Clue 5 states that the person drinking cola and the person whose sport is cycling have the same parity positions. Clue 10 states that the person whose sport is cycling and the software-developer have different parity positions. This means the software-developer cannot be in the same position as the person drinking cola.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
Clue 6 states that the person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the person drinking cola. This means the person drinking cola cannot be in position 2 or 3 if the lemonade drinker is in position 1.

### Final Placement:

Let's start placing the information based on the above analysis:

1. **Person drinking cola**: From Clue 5, they must be in an odd position (1 or 3).
2. **Person drinking lemonade**: From Clue 1 and Clue 4, they must be in position 1 or 2.
3. **Fisherman**: From Clue 7, they must be in position 1 or 2.
4. **Hobby Sudoku**: From Clue 2 and Clue 3, they must be in position 2 or 3.
5. **Sport Cycling**: From Clue 5, Clue 10, and Clue 11, they must be in position 1 or 3.
6. **Software-Developer**: They must be in a position different from the person whose sport is cycling.

Based on all these constraints, let's try to fit the pieces:

- **Position 1**: Fisherman (since they must be to the left of the person drinking lemonade and not to the right of the person whose sport is cycling)
- **Position 2**: Person drinking lemonade (since they must be to the left of the person drinking cola and not to the right of the person whose sport is cycling or hobby is board-games)
- **Position 3**: Person drinking cola (since they must be to the right of the person drinking lemonade and have the same parity positions as the person whose sport is cycling)

Now, we need to assign the remaining attributes:

- **Hobby Photography**: Position 1
- **Hobby Sudoku**: Position 3
- **Sport Parkour**: Position 1 (since it cannot be to the left of the person whose hobby is sudoku)
- **Sport Cycling**: Position 3 (since it must have different parity positions than the software-developer)
- **Sport Soccer**: Position 2
- **Job Nurse**: Position 1
- **Job Software-Developer**: Position 3
- **Job Fisherman**: Position 2
- **Movie-Genre Musical**: Position 1
- **Movie-Genre Spy**: Position 2
- **Movie-Genre Superhero**: Position 3

### Final Table:

Lv9-5x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will systematically apply each clue to determine the correct placement of each attribute (hobby, job, nationality, pet, and transport) for each person. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the snowmobile and the person who's hobby is gardening have the same parity positions.
2. The Canadian is the owner of the horse.
3. The Colombian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
4. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the writer.
5. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
6. The Canadian is not to the right of the person driving the trike.

8. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the software-developer.
9. The owner of the mouse is not the Indonesian.
10. The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the software-developer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the snowmobile and the person who's hobby is gardening have the same parity positions.
   - This means if the snowmobile person is in an odd position, the gardening person must also be in an odd position, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2**: The Canadian is the owner of the horse.
   - This places the Canadian in one of the three positions and the horse in that same position.

3. **Clue 3**: The Colombian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
   - Since the horse is owned by the Canadian, the Colombian cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the Canadian must be in position 1, and the Colombian can be in position 2 or 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the writer.
   - This implies the writer and the guinea-pig owner are adjacent.

5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - This means the snowmobile person is in position 1 or 2, and the motorbike person is in position 2 or 3.

6. **Clue 6**: The Canadian is not to the right of the person driving the trike.
   - Since the Canadian is in position 1, the trike driver cannot be in position 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the writer.
   - This places the writer and the gardening person as adjacent, with the gardening person to the right.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the software-developer.
   - This places the software-developer to the right of the sudoku person.

9. **Clue 9**: The owner of the mouse is not the Indonesian.
   - This eliminates the Indonesian from owning the mouse.

10. **Clue 10**: The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the software-developer.
    - This places the drawing person to the right of the software-developer.

### Applying the Clues:

- From Clue 2, the Canadian is in position 1, and the horse is in position 1.
- From Clue 3, the Colombian must be in position 2 or 3.
- From Clue 5, the snowmobile person is in position 1 or 2, and the motorbike person is in position 2 or 3.
- From Clue 6, the trike driver cannot be in position 2 or 3.
- From Clue 7, the writer and the gardening person are adjacent, with the gardening person to the right.
- From Clue 8, the sudoku person is to the left of the software-developer.
- From Clue 10, the drawing person is to the right of the software-developer.

### Final Deductions:

- Position 1: Canadian (Horse)
- Position 2: Colombian (Guinea-Pig / Writer)
- Position 3: Indonesian (Mouse / Trike)

Since the snowmobile and gardening person must have the same parity, and the snowmobile person is in position 1 (odd), the gardening person must be in position 3 (odd). Thus, the writer is in position 2.

- Position 1: Canadian (Horse)
- Position 2: Colombian (Writer)
- Position 3: Indonesian (Gardening)

From Clue 5, the snowmobile person is in position 1 (Canadian), and the motorbike person is in position 3 (Indonesian).

- Position 1: Canadian (Horse, Snowmobile)
- Position 2: Colombian (Writer)
- Position 3: Indonesian (Gardening, Motorbike)

From Clue 8, the software-developer must be in position 3, and the sudoku person in position 2.

- Position 1: Canadian (Horse, Snowmobile)
- Position 2: Colombian (Sudoku, Writer)

Lv9-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The Malaysian is not the person drinking tea.**
2. **The person whose sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking tea have the same parity positions.**
3. **The police-officer is on the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.**
4. **The Mexican is not the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
5. **The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the Malaysian.**
6. **The Pakistani is not the person whose hobby is cooking.**
7. **The person whose hobby is board-games is on the right of the nurse.**
8. **The engineer is on the far left.**
9. **The person whose sport is basketball is on the far left.**
10. **The person whose sport is basketball and the person whose hobby is card-games have different parity positions.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 8 and 9:**
   - The engineer (far left) and the person whose sport is basketball (far left) must be the same person.
   - Therefore, the engineer drinks hot-chocolate.

2. **Clue 1 and 5:**
   - The Malaysian does not drink tea.
   - The person drinking tea is to the left of the Malaysian.
   - Since the engineer is on the far left, the person drinking tea cannot be the engineer.
   - Thus, the person drinking tea could be either 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 2:**
   - The person whose sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking tea have the same parity positions.
   - If the person drinking tea is at position 1, then the person with ice-hockey is also at position 1, which contradicts clue 9 (basketball is on the far left).
   - Hence, the person drinking tea must be at position 2.
   - The person with ice-hockey must also be at position 2.

4. **Clue 3:**
   - The police-officer is to the right of the person with ice-hockey.
   - Therefore, the police-officer is at position 3.

5. **Clue 4:**
   - The Mexican does not drink hot-chocolate.
   - The person drinking hot-chocolate is the engineer (position 1).

6. **Clue 6:**
   - The Pakistani is not the person whose hobby is cooking.
   - Since the police-officer is at position 3, the Pakistani cannot be the police-officer.
   - Therefore, the Pakistani must be at position 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 7:**
   - The person whose hobby is board-games is to the right of the nurse.
   - Since the engineer (position 1) is the nurse, the person with board-games must be at position 2 or 3.
   - But we already know that position 2 is the person drinking tea and position 3 is the police-officer.
   - Therefore, the person with board-games must be at position 3, which is the police-officer.
   - This means the nurse must be at position 1.

8. **Clue 10:**
   - The person whose sport is basketball and the person whose hobby is card-games have different parity positions.
   - Since the person with basketball is at position 1 (the engineer), the person with card-games must be at position 3 (the police-officer), which has the same parity as the basketball person.
   - This creates a contradiction unless the person with card-games is at position 2.
   - Therefore, the person with card-games is at position 2, and the person with basketball is at position 1.

9. **Assigning remaining roles:**
   - The Mexican cannot be the person drinking hot-chocolate (engineer) or the person with card-games (board-games).
   - The only remaining role for the Mexican is the person with board-games.
   - Therefore, the Mexican must be at position 2.
   - The person with cooking must be the Pakistani at position 3.

| Transport     |           |            |             |

From Clue 4:
- **Hobby 2: Card-games**
- **Transport 2: Helicopter**

From Clue 8:
- **Nationality 1: Colombian** (since they can only be at the far left or far right)
- **Nationality 3: Not Colombian**

From Clue 6:
- **Transport 3: Not Quad-bike** (so it must be either trike or helicopter)

From Clue 9:
- **Fan of dubstep: On the left or right of the Colombian**
- Since the Colombian is at position 1 or 3, the fan of dubstep must be at position 2.

From Clue 10:
