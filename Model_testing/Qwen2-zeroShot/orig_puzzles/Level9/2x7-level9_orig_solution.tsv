### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5:** Videographer -> Parkour
2. **Clue 11:** Cycling is between Parkour and Videographer. So, positions for Parkour, Cycling, and Videographer must be consecutive. Since Videographer is 5, Parkour and Cycling must be 3 and 4 or 4 and 3.
3. **Clue 12:** Dressmaker is to the left of Cycling.
4. **Clue 15:** Dressmaker is to the left of Analyst.
5. **Clue 13:** Cycling is not to the right of Parkour. Therefore, Parkour must be 3, Cycling must be 4, and Videographer must be 5.

15. **Clue 16:** Baseball is to the right of Lacrosse. Therefore, Baseball must be 6 or 7.
16. **Clue 14:** Software-Developer is not to the right of Lawyer. Therefore, Lawyer must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
17. **Clue 8:** Software-Developer is between Mechanic and Volleyball. Therefore, Software-Developer must be 2, Mechanic must be 1, and Volleyball must be 3 (already determined).

Now, let's place the remaining jobs and sports:

- Position 1: Mechanic
- Position 2: Software-Developer
- Position 3: Volleyball
- Position 4: Cycling
- Position 5: Parkour
- Position 6: Baseball

Lv9-2x7-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is in an even position.
   - Possible positions for filmmaking: 2, 4, 6.

2. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person eating apple.
   - This means the person with filmmaking must be in an even position (2 or 4), and the person eating apple must be to the right of the person with filmmaking.

3. **Clue 13:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking.
   - This confirms that filmmaking must be in position 2, and hiking must be in position 4.

4. **Clue 12:** The person who's hobby is skydiving and the person eating apple have different parity positions.
   - Since filmmaking is in position 2 and hiking is in position 4, the person eating apple cannot be in position 2 or 4. So, the person eating apple must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).

5. **Clue 9:** The person eating apple is not to the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - Since camping is between filmmaking and apple, and filmmaking is in position 2, the person eating apple must be in position 1.

6. **Clue 1:** The person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
   - Since apple is in position 1, pineapple must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But since filmmaking is in position 2, pineapple must be in position 3 or 4.

7. **Clue 15:** The person who's hobby is camping and the person eating pineapple have different parity positions.
   - Since camping is in position 2, pineapple must be in position 4.

8. **Clue 17:** The person who's hobby is hiking is not to the left of the person eating pineapple.
   - Since hiking is in position 4 and pineapple is also in position 4, this clue is satisfied.

9. **Clue 10:** The person eating cranberry is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading.
   - Since apple is in position 1 and pineapple is in position 4, cranberry must be in position 5 and reading must be in position 6 or 7.

10. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the person eating plum.
    - Since card-games cannot be in position 6 or 7, it must be in position 3, 5, or 1.

11. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
    - Since card-games cannot be in position 6 or 7, it must be in position 3 or 5. Magic-tricks must be in position 1 or 2. Since apple is in position 1, magic-tricks must be in position 2, and card-games must be in position 3.

12. **Clue 16:** The person who's hobby is card-games is not to the left of the person eating plum.
    - Since card-games is in position 3, plum must be in position 5.

13. **Clue 14:** The person eating grapefruit is not to the left of the person eating apple.
    - Since apple is in position 1, grapefruit must be in position 3 or 5. But card-games is in position 3, so grapefruit must be in position 5.

14. **Clue 7:** The person eating pepper is not to the left of the person eating pineapple.
    - Since pineapple is in position 4, pepper must be in position 5, but plum is already in position 5, so this is a contradiction. Let's re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating the positions:
- Pineapple in position 4
- Card-games in position 3
- Plum in position 5
- Pepper in position 6
- Grapefruit in position 7

20. **Clue 20:** The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
21. **Clue 21:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
22. **Clue 22:** The person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right.

### Solution:

1. From Clue 15, the person who's hobby is hiking is in the middle (position 4).
2. From Clue 10, the person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. So, chess must be in position 3.
3. From Clue 20, the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since hiking is in position 4, cooking can only be in positions 1 or 2.
4. From Clue 22, the person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right. Since Clue 14 states that the person drinking fanta is to the left of the person drinking sprite, sprite cannot be in position 1 (as fanta would then be in position 2, which is not possible due to Clue 2). Therefore, sprite must be in position 7.
5. From Clue 2, the person drinking sprite is on the right of the person drinking fanta. So, fanta must be in position 6.
6. From Clue 14, the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite. This confirms our previous placement.
7. From Clue 7, the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. This also confirms our previous placement.
8. From Clue 4, the person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta is in position 6, singing must be in position 7 (which is already occupied by sprite), so it must be in position 5.
9. From Clue 4, the person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. This confirms our previous placement.
10. From Clue 20, the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since cooking can only be in positions 1 or 2, and board-games must be to the right of cooking, board-games must be in position 5 (but singing is already there), so cooking must be in position 2, and board-games must be in position 3 (but chess is already there), so board-games must be in position 6, and cooking must be in position 1.
11. From Clue 13, the person who's hobby is board-games is not the person drinking tea. So, tea must be in position 3 (but board-games is already there), so tea must be in position 2.
12. From Clue 12, the person drinking tea and the person who's hobby is board-games have the same parity positions. Since tea is in position 2 (even) and board-games is in position 6 (even), this is consistent.
13. From Clue 11, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not to the left of the person drinking tea. So, filmmaking must be in position 4 (hiking is already there), so filmmaking must be in position 7 (sprite is already there), so filmmaking must be in position 6 (board-games is already there), so filmmaking must be in position 5 (singing is already there), so filmmaking must be in position 3 (chess is already there), so filmmaking must be in position 2 (cooking is already there), so filmmaking must be in position 1.
14. From Clue 16, the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since water is in position 4 (hiking is already there), so juice must be in position 2 (cooking is already there), so juice must be in position 1.
15. From Clue 17, the person drinking soy-milk is not to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. So, soy-milk must be in position 3 (chess is already there), so soy-milk must be in position 2 (cooking is already there), so soy-milk must be in position 1 (juice is already there), so soy-milk must be in position 6 (board-games is already there), so soy-milk must be in position 5 (singing is already there), so soy-milk must be in position 4 (hiking is already there), so soy-milk must be in position 7 (sprite is already there).

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan jazz and the scientist have different parity positions.
   - This means one is in an odd position and the other in an even position.

2. **Clue 2:** The paramedic is somewhere to the left of the fan jazz.
   - Paramedic cannot be in position 7.

3. **Clue 3:** The fan blues is on the left of the coach.

   - Fan Jazz < Chef.

10. **Clue 10:** The chef is not to the right of the doctor.
    - Doctor < Chef.

11. **Clue 11:** The fan hip-hop is somewhere between the fan country and the writer.
    - Fan Country, Fan Hip-Hop, Writer (or Writer, Fan Hip-Hop, Fan Country).

12. **Clue 12:** The fan soul is on the left or right of the doctor.
    - Doctor, Fan Soul (or Fan Soul, Doctor).

13. **Clue 13:** The writer is not to the left of the paramedic.
    - Paramedic < Writer.

14. **Clue 14:** The scientist is on the left or right of the fan jazz.
    - Fan Jazz, Scientist (or Scientist, Fan Jazz).

15. **Clue 15:** The fan jazz is on the right of the fan hip-hop.
    - Fan Hip-Hop < Fan Jazz.

16. **Clue 16:** The fan jazz and the mechanic have the same parity positions.
    - Both in odd or both in even positions.

17. **Clue 17:** The fan house is not to the right of the mechanic.
    - Mechanic < Fan House.

### Solution Steps:

1. From Clue 16, the positions of the fan jazz and the mechanic must be either both odd or both even.
2. From Clue 15, Fan Jazz > Fan Hip-Hop.
3. From Clue 1, Fan Jazz and Scientist have different parity positions.
4. From Clue 2, Paramedic < Fan Jazz.
5. From Clue 3, Fan Blues < Coach.
6. From Clue 4, Scientist, Mechanic, Fan House.
7. From Clue 5, Fan Soul < Fan Salsa.
8. From Clue 6, Chef < Fan Salsa.
9. From Clue 7, Fan Country < Fan Soul.
10. From Clue 8, Fan Salsa > Chef.
11. From Clue 9, Fan Jazz < Chef.
12. From Clue 10, Doctor < Chef.
13. From Clue 11, Fan Country, Fan Hip-Hop, Writer or Writer, Fan Hip-Hop, Fan Country.
14. From Clue 12, Doctor, Fan Soul or Fan Soul, Doctor.
15. From Clue 13, Paramedic < Writer.
16. From Clue 14, Fan Jazz, Scientist or Scientist, Fan Jazz.
17. From Clue 17, Mechanic < Fan House.

Let's start placing the elements:

- Position 1: Fan Jazz (odd, as it must be in an odd position with the mechanic)
- Position 2: Chef (Chef > Fan Jazz, so Chef can't be in position 1, 2, or 3; thus, Chef must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7)
- Position 3: Mechanic (mechanic must be in an odd position, and it can't be in position 1 as Fan Jazz is there)
- Position 4: Doctor (Doctor < Chef, so Doctor can't be in position 5, 6, or 7)
- Position 5: Paramedic (Paramedic < Fan Jazz, so Paramedic must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4)
- Position 6: Fan Soul (Fan Soul < Fan Salsa, and Fan Salsa > Chef, so Fan Soul can be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- Position 7: Fan Salsa (Fan Salsa > Chef)

Considering all constraints:
- Fan Jazz = 1, Mechanic = 3, Chef = 5, Doctor = 4, Paramedic = 2, Fan Soul = 6, Fan Salsa = 7

Now, let's place the jobs and music genres:

- Position 1: Fan Jazz (odd), Mechanic (odd) -> Mechanic is in position 3.
- Position 2: Paramedic (even).
- Position 3: Mechanic (odd).
- Position 4: Doctor (even).
- Position 5: Chef (odd).
- Position 6: Fan Soul (even).
- Position 7: Fan Salsa (odd).

From Clue 14, Fan Jazz, Scientist or Scientist, Fan Jazz. Since Fan Jazz is in position 1, Scientist must be in position 7 (odd).

From Clue 12, Fan Soul is on the left or right of the doctor. Fan Soul is in position 6, so the doctor must be in position 4.

From Clue 13, Paramedic < Writer. Paramedic is in position 2, so Writer must be in position 6 (Fan Soul).

From Clue 11, Fan Country, Fan Hip-Hop, Writer or Writer, Fan Hip-Hop, Fan Country. Since Writer is in position 6, Fan Country and Fan Hip-Hop must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Fan Country < Fan Soul, so Fan Country must be in position 1 or 2. Fan Hip-Hop < Fan Country, so Fan Hip-Hop must be in position 2 or 3.

From Clue 15, Fan Jazz > Fan Hip-Hop, so Fan Hip-Hop must be in position 2, and Fan Country must be in position 1.

From Clue 3, Fan Blues < Coach. Fan Blues must be in position 3, and Coach must be in position 4.

From Clue 10, Chef is not to the right of the doctor, so Chef must be in position 5.

From Clue 16, Fan Jazz and the mechanic have the same parity positions. Mechanic is in position 3, so Fan Jazz and the mechanic are both in odd positions.

Lv9-2x7-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will go through each clue step-by-step and use a systematic approach to place the foods and jobs in the correct positions.

Let's start by summarizing the clues:

1. The chef is on the right of the coach.
2. The person eating raspberry and the coach have the same parity positions.
3. The freelancer is on the left of the person eating mango.
4. The coach is not to the right of the person eating blueberry.
5. The person eating watermelon is the librarian.
6. The person eating lime is on the left or right of the librarian.
7. The freelancer is somewhere between the analyst and the librarian.
8. The librarian is on the right of the pilot.
9. The architect is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple.
10. The person eating cucumber is somewhere between the coach and the person eating raspberry.
11. The architect is not the person eating raspberry.
12. The person eating raspberry is in an odd position.
13. The person eating cucumber is not to the left of the chef.
14. The librarian is in the middle (position 4).
15. The freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating lime.
16. The analyst is on the right of the freelancer.
17. The person eating mango is somewhere to the right of the person eating pineapple.

Now let's place the librarian first since they are in the middle (position 4) and eating watermelon:

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     |     4      |     5     |     6      |    7    |
| Food   |           |          |           | watermelon |           |            |         |
| Job    |           |          |           | librarian  |           |            |         |

Next, let's place the coach and the person eating raspberry based on clue 2 and 12:
- The person eating raspberry is in an odd position (clue 12), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- The person eating raspberry and the coach have the same parity positions (clue 2).

Since the librarian is in position 4, the coach cannot be in position 3 (as that would make both positions even). Therefore, the coach must be in position 1 or 5.

If the coach were in position 1, the person eating raspberry would also be in position 1, but there is no space for the coach to be on the right of the coach. So, the coach must be in position 5, and the person eating raspberry must be in position 3.

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     | watermelon |     5     |            |         |
| Food   | raspberry |          |           | watermelon | raspberry |            |         |
| Job    |           |          |           | librarian  |           |            |         |

Now, let's place the freelancer and the person eating mango based on clues 3 and 7:
- The freelancer is on the left of the person eating mango (clue 3).
- The freelancer is somewhere between the analyst and the librarian (clue 7).

Since the librarian is in position 4, the freelancer must be in position 3 (left of the person eating mango) and the person eating mango must be in position 5 or 6. But position 5 is already taken by the coach, so the person eating mango must be in position 6.

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     | watermelon |     5     | mango      |         |
| Food   | raspberry |          |           | watermelon | raspberry | mango      |         |
| Job    |           |          |           | librarian  |           |            |         |

Now, let's place the analyst and the freelancer based on clue 16:
- The analyst is on the right of the freelancer (clue 16).

Since the freelancer is in position 3, the analyst must be in position 6.

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     | watermelon |     5     | mango      | analyst  |
| Food   | raspberry |          |           | watermelon | raspberry | mango      | analyst  |
| Job    |           |          |           | librarian  |           |            |         |

Next, let's place the architect and the person eating pineapple:
- The architect is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple (clue 9).
- The person eating mango is somewhere to the right of the person eating pineapple (clue 17).

Since the person eating mango is in position 6, the person eating pineapple must be in position 3 or 4. But position 3 is already taken by the person eating mango, so the person eating pineapple must be in position 4.

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     | watermelon |     5     | mango      | analyst  |
| Food   | raspberry |          | pineapple | watermelon | raspberry | mango      | analyst  |
| Job    |           |          |           | librarian  |           |            |         |

Now, let's place the person eating cucumber and the person eating lime:
- The person eating cucumber is somewhere between the coach and the person eating raspberry (clue 10).
- The person eating lime is on the left or right of the librarian (clue 6).
- The person eating cucumber is not to the left of the chef (clue 13).
- The architect is not the person eating raspberry (clue 11).

Since the person eating raspberry is in position 3, the person eating cucumber must be in position 2 (since it must be between the coach in position 5 and the person eating raspberry in position 3).

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     | watermelon |     5     | mango      | analyst  |
| Food   | raspberry | cucumber | pineapple | watermelon | raspberry | mango      | analyst  |
| Job    |           |          |           | librarian  |           |            |         |

Now, the person eating lime must be in position 7 (the only remaining position).

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     | watermelon |     5     | mango      | analyst  |
| Food   | raspberry | cucumber | pineapple | watermelon | raspberry | mango      | analyst  |
| Job    |           |          |           | librarian  |           |            |         |

Finally, the remaining job (pilot) must be in position 1.

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     | watermelon |     5     | mango      | analyst  |
| Food   | raspberry | cucumber | pineapple | watermelon | raspberry | mango      | analyst  |
| Job    | pilot     |          |           | librarian  |           |            |         |

We need to assign the remaining jobs (architect, chef, freelancer) to the remaining positions. From clue 15, the freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating lime, and from clue 7, the freelancer is between the analyst and the librarian. Therefore, the freelancer must be in position 2.

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     | watermelon |     5     | mango      | analyst  |
| Food   | raspberry | cucumber | pineapple | watermelon | raspberry | mango      | analyst  |
| Job    | pilot     | freelancer |           | librarian  |           |            |         |

The architect must be in position 3 (right of the freelancer).

|        |     1     |    2     |     3     | watermelon |     5     | mango      | analyst  |
| Food   | raspberry | cucumber | pineapple | watermelon | raspberry | mango      | analyst  |
| Job    | pilot     | freelancer | architect | librarian  |           |            |         |

The chef must be in position 5 (right of the coach).
