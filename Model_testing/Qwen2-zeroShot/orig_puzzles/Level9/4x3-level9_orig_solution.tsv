Lv9-4x3-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue Analysis:
1. The person driving the airplane and the fan hip-hop have different parity positions.
2. The fan d&b is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car.
3. The person driving the airplane is not the bartender.
4. The malaysian is on the left of the russian.
5. The fan d&b and the bartender have different parity positions.
6. The fan techno is the nurse.
7. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the polish.
8. The person driving the car is on the left of the fan techno.
9. The fan hip-hop and the nurse have different parity positions.
10. The malaysian is the fan hip-hop.

### Initial Setup:
We need to place:
- Jobs: architect, bartender, nurse
- Music-Genres: d&b, hip-hop, techno
- Nationalities: malaysian, polish, russian
- Transport: airplane, car, scooter

#### Clue Application:

1. **Clue 10**: The malaysian is the fan hip-hop.
   - Position: Malaysian -> Fan Hip-Hop

2. **Clue 6**: The fan techno is the nurse.
   - Position: Nurse -> Fan Techno

3. **Clue 4**: The malaysian is on the left of the russian.
   - Possible positions: Malay (1), Russian (2 or 3)

4. **Clue 9**: The fan hip-hop and the nurse have different parity positions.
   - Since Malay is Fan Hip-Hop (odd position) and Nurse is Fan Techno (even position), this condition is satisfied.

5. **Clue 7**: The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the polish.
   - Polish cannot be in position 3, and the person driving the airplane must be in position 2 or 3.

6. **Clue 8**: The person driving the car is on the left of the fan techno.
   - Since Nurse is in position 2 (Fan Techno), the person driving the car must be in position 1.

7. **Clue 3**: The person driving the airplane is not the bartender.
   - The bartender can only be in position 1 or 2 (since car is in 1 and airplane is in 2 or 3).

8. **Clue 2**: The fan d&b is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car.
   - Since the car is in position 1, the fan d&b must be in position 1 or 2.

9. **Clue 5**: The fan d&b and the bartender have different parity positions.
   - If fan d&b is in position 1 (odd), then the bartender must be in position 2 (even).
   - If fan d&b is in position 2 (even), then the bartender must be in position 1 (odd).

10. **Clue 1**: The person driving the airplane and the fan hip-hop have different parity positions.
    - Since the malaysian is the fan hip-hop (position 1, odd), the person driving the airplane must be in an even position (2 or 3).

Given these constraints, let's place the elements:

- Position 1: Malay (Fan Hip-Hop)
- Position 2: Bartender
- Position 3: Polish (Airplane)

Since the car is in position 1 and the nurse is in position 2, the remaining positions are:
- Position 1: Malay (Fan Hip-Hop)
- Position 2: Bartender (Fan Techno)
- Position 3: Polish (Airplane)

Now, we need to assign the jobs and music genres:
- The bartender is in position 2 (Fan Techno), so the nurse must be in position 1 (Malaysian).
- The person driving the airplane is in position 3 (Polish), so they cannot be the bartender.
- The fan d&b must be in position 1 (Malay), and since the person driving the car is in position 1, the fan d&b cannot be the car.

Thus, the final assignments are:
- Position 1: Malay (Fan Hip-Hop, Nurse)
- Position 2: Polish (Bartender, Fan Techno)
- Position 3: Russian (Airplane, Architect)

7. **Clue 7:** The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
8. **Clue 8:** The person watching western movies is the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Rock-Climbing
- **Clue 6** tells us that the person with the hobby of rock-climbing is in position 2 (the middle).

|               |     1      |       2       |     3     |
| Food          |            |               |           |
| Hobby         |            | Rock-climbing |           |
| Movie-Genre   |            |               |           |
| Transport     |            |               |           |

#### Step 2: Positioning Filmmaking and Apple
- **Clue 5** states that the person whose hobby is filmmaking and the person eating apple have different parity positions.
- Since rock-climbing is in position 2, the remaining positions for filmmaking and apple must be 1 and 3.
- From **Clue 3**, the person watching drama movies is to the right of the person whose hobby is filmmaking. Therefore, the person with the hobby of filmmaking cannot be in position 3 (rightmost), so it must be in position 1.
- This means the person eating apple is in position 3.

|               |     1      |       2       |     3     |
| Food          | Apple      |               | Cranberry |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking | Rock-climbing |           |
| Movie-Genre   |            |               |           |
| Transport     |            |               |           |

#### Step 3: Positioning Puzzles and Cranberry
- **Clue 1** states that the person whose hobby is puzzles is to the right of the person eating cranberry.
- Since cranberry is in position 3, the person whose hobby is puzzles must be in position 2.

|               |     1      |       2       |     3     |
| Food          | Apple      | Asparagus     | Cranberry |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking | Puzzles       |           |
| Movie-Genre   |            |               |           |
| Transport     |            |               |           |

#### Step 4: Positioning Western Movies
- **Clue 8** states that the person watching western movies is the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.
- Therefore, the person watching western movies is in position 2.

|               |     1      |       2       |     3     |
| Food          | Apple      | Asparagus     | Cranberry |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking | Puzzles       | Rock-climbing |
| Movie-Genre   |            |               |           |
| Transport     |            |               |           |

#### Step 5: Positioning Drama Movies
- **Clue 3** states that the person watching drama movies is to the right of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
- Since filmmaking is in position 1, the person watching drama movies must be in position 3.

|               |     1      |       2       |     3     |
| Food          | Apple      | Asparagus     | Cranberry |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking | Puzzles       | Rock-climbing |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama      |               | Western   |
| Transport     |            |               |           |

#### Step 6: Positioning Satire Movies
- The only genre left is satire, which must be watched by the person whose hobby is puzzles (position 2).

|               |     1      |       2       |     3     |
| Food          | Apple      | Asparagus     | Cranberry |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking | Puzzles       | Rock-climbing |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama      | Satire        | Western   |
| Transport     |            |               |           |

#### Step 7: Positioning Transport
- **Clue 2** states that the person driving the boat is not to the right of the person eating apple.
- Since apple is in position 1, the person driving the boat cannot be in position 2 or 3.
- **Clue 7** states that the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
- Since puzzles is in position 2, the person driving the ship can be in position 1 or 3.
- **Clue 2** also states that the person driving the boat is not to the right of the person eating apple, so the person driving the boat cannot be in position 3.
- Therefore, the person driving the boat must be in position 1, and the person driving the ship must be in position 3.

|               |     1      |       2       |     3     |
| Food          | Boat       | Asparagus     | Cranberry |

Lv9-4x3-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person watching martial-arts movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
2. The fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person driving the scooter.
4. The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person driving the bike.
5. The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of gospel.
6. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person driving the trike.
7. The person watching martial-arts movies is not to the left of the fan of salsa.
8. The person who's hobby is board-games and the fan of soul have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Rock Climber and Scooter Driver
From clue 3, we know:
- The person who's hobby is rock-climbing drives the scooter.
- Therefore, rock-climbing must be in position 3, and the scooter is in position 3.

#### Step 2: Analyze Salsa Fan and Cooking Hobby
From clue 2, we know:
- The fan of salsa is to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
- This means the cooking hobbyist cannot be in position 3 (rock-climbing), so cooking must be in either position 1 or 2.

#### Step 3: Analyze Martial-Arts and Zombie Movies
From clues 1 and 5:
- The person watching martial-arts movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (position 3).
- The person watching zombie movies is to the left of the fan of gospel.
- Since rock-climbing is in position 3, the person watching martial-arts movies cannot be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 4: Analyze Trike and Bike Drivers
From clue 4:
- The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person driving the bike.
- This means they cannot be in consecutive positions.

#### Step 5: Analyze Board-Games and Soul Fan
From clue 8:
- The person who's hobby is board-games and the fan of soul have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).

#### Step 6: Combine All Clues
Let's place the elements based on the above deductions:

1. **Cooking Hobby**: Since it cannot be in position 3 (rock-climbing), let's try position 1.
2. **Salsa Fan**: Must be to the right of the cooking hobbyist, so position 2.
3. **Martial-Arts Movies**: Cannot be in position 1 or 2 (left of rock-climbing). So, it must be in position 3.
4. **Zombie Movies**: To the left of the fan of gospel, so it must be in position 1 or 2. But since cooking is in position 1, zombie movies must be in position 2.
5. **Gospel Fan**: Must be in position 3.
6. **Board-Games Hobby**: Since it has the same parity as the soul fan, it must be in an even position (2 or 4). But position 2 is taken by the salsa fan, so it must be in position 4.
7. **Soul Fan**: Must be in an even position, and since board-games is in position 4, soul fan must be in position 2 (salsa fan is already there, so this is a contradiction). Let's re-evaluate.

Re-evaluating the positions:
- Cooking: Position 1
- Salsa Fan: Position 2
- Martial-Arts Movies: Position 3
- Zombie Movies: Position 2 (contradiction)

Revisiting:
- Cooking: Position 1
- Salsa Fan: Position 2
- Martial-Arts Movies: Position 3
- Zombie Movies: Position 1
- Gospel Fan: Position 3
- Board-Games: Position 2
- Soul Fan: Position 4

Lv9-4x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.**
   - This means if someone has a hobby of drawing, there must be at least one person with a hobby of puzzles to their right.

2. **The person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the right of the doctor.**
   - The doctor cannot be in position 3 (rightmost), and the person watching thrillers must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **The Indian is between the Analyst and the Canadian.**
   - The Indian must be in the middle position (position 2).

4. **The German is not to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.**
   - If someone has a hobby of dancing, the German cannot be to the right of that person.

5. **The person who's hobby is dancing and the German have the same parity positions.**
   - If someone has a hobby of dancing, they and the German must be either both in odd positions (1 and 3) or both in even positions (2).

6. **The German is somewhere to the right of the person watching thriller movies.**
   - Since the person watching thrillers is to the right of the doctor, and the German is to the right of them, the German cannot be in position 1.

7. **The doctor is not to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.**
   - The person with the hobby of drawing cannot be in position 1.

8. **The person watching spy movies is not to the left of the person watching thriller movies.**
   - The person watching thrills must be to the left of the person watching spy movies.

9. **The person watching zombie movies is the person who's hobby is drawing.**
   - The person with the hobby of drawing must watch zombie movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 2 must be the Indian (Clue 3).**
   - This means the Indian is in the middle.

2. **The person watching zombie movies is the person who's hobby is drawing (Clue 9).**
   - The person with the hobby of drawing is in position 1 or 3, and they must watch zombie movies.

3. **Since the person with the hobby of drawing is in an odd position (1 or 3), and the German and this person have the same parity positions (Clue 5), the German must also be in an odd position.**
   - Therefore, the German is in position 1 or 3.

4. **The German is not to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing (Clue 4).**
   - So, if the German is in position 1, the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 3. If the German is in position 3, the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 1.

5. **The German is to the right of the person watching thriller movies (Clue 6).**
   - The person watching thrillers must be in position 1, and the German must be in position 3.

6. **The person with the hobby of drawing is in position 1 (since the German is in position 3 and they have the same parity).**
   - Therefore, the person with the hobby of drawing watches zombie movies in position 1.

7. **The person watching thriller movies is in position 2 (since the doctor is not to the left of the person with the hobby of drawing, and the Indian is in position 2).**
   - The doctor is in position 1, and the person watching thrillers is in position 2.

8. **The person watching spy movies is not to the left of the person watching thriller movies (Clue 8).**
   - Therefore, the person watching spy movies is in position 3.

9. **The Indian is between the Analyst and the Canadian (Clue 3).**
   - The Indian is in position 2, so the Analyst and Canadian must be in positions 1 and 3.
   - Since the person with the hobby of drawing (zombie movies) is in position 1, the Analyst must be in position 3, and the Canadian must be in position 1.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1     |     2     |    3    |

This solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv9-4x3-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the given clues

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the trike is the person watching martial-arts movies.
3. **Clue 3**: The person watching superhero movies is somewhere between the person drinking almond-milk and the person watching martial-arts movies.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
5. **Clue 5**: The person watching time-travel movies and the person who's hobby is collecting have the same parity (both even or both odd) positions.
6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the airplane is the person watching superhero movies.
7. **Clue 7**: The person watching martial-arts movies is not to the right of the person drinking coffee.

### Step 2: Deduce from Clues

From Clue 2 and Clue 6:
- The person driving the trike is also watching martial-arts movies.
- The person driving the airplane is watching superhero movies.

From Clue 7:
- Since the person watching martial-arts movies is not to the right of the person drinking coffee, the person drinking coffee must be to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.

From Clue 3:
- The person watching superhero movies is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person watching martial-arts movies.

From Clue 4:
- The person with the hobby of baking is to the left of the person drinking sprite.

From Clue 5:
- The person watching time-travel movies and the person with the hobby of collecting have the same parity positions.

### Step 3: Fill in the table

Let's denote:
- \( A \): Almond-milk drinker
- \( C \): Coffee drinker
- \( S \): Sprite drinker
- \( B \): Baking hobbyist
- \( F \): Fishing hobbyist
- \( M \): Martial-arts movie watcher
- \( H \): Superhero movie watcher
- \( T \): Time-travel movie watcher
- \( P \): Parity position (even/odd)

Using the above deductions, we can start filling in the table:

|               |      1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |    S         |           |            |
| Hobby         |    B         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |    H         |           |            |
| Transport     |    A         |           |            |

From Clue 2 and Clue 6:
- Trike (T) = Martial-arts (M)
- Airplane (A) = Superhero (H)

So, we update the table:

|               |      1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |    S         |           |            |
| Hobby         |    B         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |    H         |           |            |
| Transport     |    A         |           |    T       |

From Clue 3:
- Superhero (H) is between Almond-milk (A) and Martial-arts (M).

So, we place them accordingly:

|               |      1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |    S         |           |            |
| Hobby         |    B         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |    H         |           |    M       |
| Transport     |    A         |           |    T       |

From Clue 1:
- Coffee (C) is to the left of Sprite (S).

So, we place Coffee (C) in position 1:

|               |      1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |    C         |    S      |            |
| Hobby         |    B         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |    H         |           |    M       |
| Transport     |    A         |           |    T       |

From Clue 4:
- Baking (B) is to the left of Sprite (S).

So, we place Baking (B) in position 1:

|               |      1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |    C         |    S      |            |
| Hobby         |    B         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |    H         |           |    M       |
| Transport     |    A         |           |    T       |

From Clue 5:
- Time-travel (T) and Collecting (F) have the same parity.

Since T is in position 3 (odd), F must be in position 1 (odd).

So, we place Collecting (F) in position 1:

|               |      1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |    C         |    S      |            |
| Hobby         |    B         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |    H         |           |    M       |
| Transport     |    A         |           |    T       |

From Clue 7:
- Coffee (C) is not to the right of Sprite (S).

This is already satisfied.

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining positions for Baking (B) and the last movie genre (Time-travel).

|               |      1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |    C         |    S      |            |
| Hobby         |    B         |    F      |            |
| Movie-Genre   |    H         |    T      |    M       |
| Transport     |    A         |    T      |    T       |

### Final Solution Table

Lv9-4x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to fill in the table correctly. Let's go through each clue step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
2. **Clue 2:** The Italian is in an even position (i.e., position 2).
3. **Clue 3:** The Russian is not the person driving the boat.
4. **Clue 4:** The Russian is on the left of the librarian.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is baking and the Russian have the same parity positions.
6. **Clue 6:** The person driving the subway is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.
7. **Clue 7:** The person driving the boat is on the left of the nurse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of Italian
From Clue 2, the Italian must be in position 2.

#### Step 2: Position of Russian
From Clue 4, the Russian is on the left of the librarian. Since the Italian is in position 2, the Russian cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, the Russian must be in position 1, and the librarian must be in position 3.

#### Step 3: Parity Positions for Russian and Baking
From Clue 5, the Russian and the person with the hobby of baking must have the same parity positions. Since the Russian is in position 1 (odd), the person with the hobby of baking must also be in an odd position. Therefore, the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 1 or 3. But since the Russian is already in position 1, the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 3.

#### Step 4: Hobbies and Jobs
From Clue 1, the person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person with the hobby of baking is in position 3, the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 2. This leaves the person with the hobby of singing in position 1.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Hobby - Singing, Russian
- Position 2: Hobby - Drawing, Italian
- Position 3: Hobby - Baking, Librarian

#### Step 5: Transport and Jobs
From Clue 6, the person driving the subway is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the person with the hobby of singing is in position 1, the person driving the subway must be in position 1. Therefore, the person driving the subway is the Russian.

From Clue 7, the person driving the boat is on the left of the nurse. Since the nurse is in position 3, the person driving the boat must be in position 1. But we already know the person in position 1 is the Russian, so the person driving the boat must be in position 2, which is the Italian.

Therefore, the person in position 3 must be the nurse, and the person in position 2 must be the designer (since the librarian is in position 3).

So, the final table is:

```
|               |    1     |     2     |    3    |
| Hobby         | Singing  | Drawing   | Baking  |
| Job           | Russian  | Designer  | Librarian |
| Nationality   | Russian  | Italian   | Russian |
| Transport     | Boat     | Subway    | Taxi    |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |    3    |
| Hobby         | Singing  | Drawing   | Baking  |
| Job           | Russian  | Designer  | Librarian |
| Nationality   | Russian  | Italian   | Russian |
| Transport     | Boat     | Subway    | Taxi    |

Lv9-4x3-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. **The owner of the hedgehog is not the Canadian**.
2. **The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the person eating onion**.
3. **The person whose hobby is collecting and the Canadian have the same parity positions** (both are either in odd or even positions).
4. **The person whose hobby is video-games is in an odd position**.
5. **The person eating lime is in an odd position**.
6. **The person whose hobby is video-games is on the left of the French**.
7. **The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the left of the person eating lime**.
8. **The Thai is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog**.

Let's start filling in the table with the information we can deduce:

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Video-games position**: From clue 4, the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 1 or 3.
2. **Lime position**: From clue 5, the person eating lime must be in position 1 or 3.
3. **Video-games and Lime positions cannot overlap**: Since both video-games and lime are in odd positions, they must be in positions 1 and 3 respectively.

Thus:
- Position 1: Video-games
- Position 3: Lime

4. **Guinea-pig and Onion positions**: From clue 2, the owner of the guinea-pig must be to the left of the person eating onion. Since the person eating lime is in position 3, the guinea-pig must be in position 1 (since position 2 would make it impossible for the owner of the guinea-pig to be to the left of the person eating onion).

Thus:
- Position 1: Video-games (guinea-pig)
- Position 3: Lime

5. **Hedgehog and Canadian**: From clue 1, the owner of the hedgehog is not the Canadian. Therefore, the Canadian must be in position 2 (the only remaining position for the Canadian).

6. **Collecting and Canadian**: From clue 3, the person whose hobby is collecting and the Canadian have the same parity positions. Since the Canadian is in position 2 (even), the person with the hobby of collecting must also be in position 2.

Thus:
- Position 2: Collecting (Canadian)

7. **Thai and Hedgehog**: From clue 8, the Thai is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog. The only remaining positions are 1 and 2. Since the owner of the hedgehog cannot be in position 2 (it's the Canadian), the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 1. Therefore, the Thai must be in position 2.

Thus:
- Position 1: Video-games (guinea-pig)
- Position 2: Collecting (Thai)
- Position 3: Lime

8. **Final check for positions**:
   - Position 1: Video-games (guinea-pig)
   - Position 2: Collecting (Thai)
   - Position 3: Lime

This satisfies all the conditions:
- The owner of the hedgehog (position 1) is not the Canadian (position 2).
- The owner of the guinea-pig (position 1) is to the left of the person eating onion (position 3).
- The person with the hobby of collecting and the Canadian have the same parity positions (both are in position 2, which is even).
- The person with the hobby of video-games (position 1) is in an odd position.
- The person eating lime (position 3) is in an odd position.
- The person with the hobby of video-games (position 1) is on the left of the French (position 2).
- The owner of the hedgehog (position 1) is to the left of the person eating lime (position 3).
- The Thai (position 2) is to the left of the owner of the hedgehog (position 1).

Lv9-4x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the bike is on the far left or far right.
2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the ferret is the person watching fantasy movies.
3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the ferret is not to the left of the fan of soul.
4. **Clue 4:** The owner of the dog and the fan of R&B have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.
6. **Clue 6:** The fan of R&B is between the owner of the ferret and the person driving the jet-ski.
7. **Clue 7:** The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the fan of soul.
8. **Clue 8:** The owner of the dog is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person driving the bike must be in position 1 or 3.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- The owner of the ferret is the person watching fantasy movies.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The owner of the ferret cannot be in an odd position if the fan of soul is in an even position.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The owner of the dog and the fan of R&B have the same parity positions.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 6**
- The fan of R&B is between the owner of the ferret and the person driving the jet-ski.

**Step 7: Analyze Clue 7**
- The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the fan of soul.

**Step 8: Analyze Clue 8**
- The owner of the dog is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given Clue 1, we can assume the person driving the bike is in position 1 (since it simplifies the constraints):

1. Bike
2. ?
3. ?

From Clue 2, the owner of the ferret is in one of these positions and is watching fantasy movies.

From Clue 3, the owner of the ferret cannot be in an odd position if the fan of soul is in an even position. So, the owner of the ferret could be in position 2 or 3, and the fan of soul would be in position 3 or 1 respectively.

### Testing Possible Positions for Owner of Ferret and Fan of Soul:
- If the owner of the ferret is in position 2, the fan of soul must be in position 3.
- If the owner of the ferret is in position 3, the fan of soul must be in position 2.

Since Clue 6 states that the fan of R&B is between the owner of the ferret and the person driving the jet-ski, let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Owner of Ferret in Position 2, Fan of Soul in Position 3
- Owner of ferret in position 2, watching fantasy movies.
- Fan of soul in position 3.
- The fan of R&B must be in position 1 (since the person driving the bike is in position 1).

This leaves position 3 for the person driving the jet-ski, which contradicts Clue 5 (the person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard). So, this scenario is invalid.

#### Scenario 2: Owner of Ferret in Position 3, Fan of Soul in Position 2
- Owner of ferret in position 3, watching fantasy movies.
- Fan of soul in position 2.
- The fan of R&B must be in position 1 (since the person driving the bike is in position 1).

This leaves position 2 for the person driving the jet-ski, which satisfies Clue 5 (the person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard).

### Final Positions:
- Position 1: Bike
- Position 2: Fan of R&B
- Position 3: Jet-ski

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

- The owner of the dog and the fan of R&B have the same parity positions (both odd or both even). Since the fan of R&B is in position 2 (even), the owner of the dog must be in position 3 (odd), which conflicts with the jet-ski already in position 3. Therefore, the fan of R&B must be in position 1 (odd) and the owner of the dog in position 3 (odd).

- The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the fan of soul. Since the fan of soul is in position 2, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1 or 3. Given the owner of the dog is in position 3, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1.

- The owner of the guinea-pig is in position 2.

Lv9-4x3-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Constraint 1:** The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right.
2. **Constraint 2:** The person whose hobby is collecting is not to the left of the person eating avocado.
3. **Constraint 3:** The person eating cucumber is not the person driving the van.
4. **Constraint 4:** The person driving the helicopter and the person whose hobby is collecting have different parity positions (odd/even).
5. **Constraint 5:** The person driving the van is on the far left or far right.
6. **Constraint 6:** The person drinking iced-tea is not the person whose hobby is fishing.
7. **Constraint 7:** The person drinking milk and the person eating cauliflower have different parity positions.
8. **Constraint 8:** The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is fishing.
9. **Constraint 10:** The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
10. **Constraint 11:** The person driving the car is on the far left.
11. **Constraint 12:** The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in the middle.

### Initial Setup:
We can start by placing the known elements based on the constraints.

#### From Constraint 11:
- The person driving the car is on the far left.
- So, position 1 is ""car"".

#### From Constraint 12:
- The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in the middle.
- So, position 2 is ""magic-tricks"".

#### From Constraint 1:
- The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right.
- Since position 1 is already taken by ""car"", the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3.

#### From Constraint 5:
- The person driving the van is on the far left or far right.
- Since position 1 is ""car"" and position 3 is iced-tea, the person driving the van must be in position 2.

So far, we have:
```
|             |     1      |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage    |     car    |     van      |  iced-tea   |
| Food        |            |              |             |
| Hobby       |            |  magic-tricks|             |
| Transport   |            |              |             |
```

#### From Constraint 4:
- The person driving the helicopter and the person whose hobby is collecting have different parity positions.
- Since position 2 is ""van"" and position 3 is ""iced-tea"", the person driving the helicopter must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|             |     1      |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage    |    heli    |     van      |  iced-tea   |
| Food        |            |              |             |
| Hobby       |            |  magic-tricks|             |
| Transport   |            |              |             |
```

#### From Constraint 6:
- The person drinking iced-tea is not the person whose hobby is fishing.
- So, the person whose hobby is fishing must be in position 3 (since iced-tea is in position 3).

#### From Constraint 8:
- The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is fishing.
- Since the person whose hobby is fishing is in position 3, the person drinking milk must be in position 1 or 2.
- But position 1 is ""heli"" and position 2 is ""van"", so the person drinking milk must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|             |     1      |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage    |    heli    |     milk     |  iced-tea   |
| Food        |            |              |             |
| Hobby       |            |  magic-tricks|  fishing    |
| Transport   |            |              |             |
```

#### From Constraint 7:
- The person drinking milk and the person eating cauliflower have different parity positions.
- Since position 2 is ""milk"" and it is even, the person eating cauliflower must be in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
- Position 1 is ""heli"" and position 3 is ""iced-tea"", so the person eating cauliflower must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|             |     1      |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage    |    heli    |     milk     |  iced-tea   |
| Food        |  cauliflower|              |             |
| Hobby       |            |  magic-tricks|  fishing    |
| Transport   |            |              |             |
```

#### From Constraint 9:
- The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
- Since the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 2, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|             |     1      |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage    |    heli    |     milk     |  iced-tea   |
| Food        |  cauliflower|              |             |
| Hobby       |            |  magic-tricks|  fishing    |
| Transport   |            |              |  lemonade   |
```

#### From Constraint 10:
- The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
- We already placed lemonade in position 3, which is consistent with the constraint.

#### From Constraint 3:
- The person eating cucumber is not the person driving the van.
- Since the person driving the van is in position 2, the person eating cucumber must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|             |     1      |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage    |    heli    |     milk     |  iced-tea   |
| Food        |  avocado   |              |             |
| Hobby       |            |  magic-tricks|  fishing    |
| Transport   |            |  lemonade    |  cucumber   |
```

#### From Constraint 6:
- The person drinking iced-tea is not the person whose hobby is fishing.
- This is already consistent as the person whose hobby is fishing is in position 3.

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining beverage and food for positions 2 and 3 in the ""Beverage"" and ""Food"" columns.

Since we have:
- Beverage: heli, milk, iced-tea
- Food: avocado, cauliflower, cucumber

And we know:
- The person drinking milk is in position 2.
- The person eating avocado is in position 1.
- The person eating cucumber is in position 3.

Thus, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3, but we already have ""iced-tea"" in that position, so the only remaining beverage is ""lemonade"".

Therefore, the final solution is:

```
|             |     1      |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage    |    heli    |     milk     |  lemonade   |
| Food        |  avocado   |              |  cucumber   |
| Hobby       |            |  magic-tricks|  fishing    |
| Transport   |            |  lemonade    |  cucumber   |
```"
