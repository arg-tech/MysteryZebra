Note: The remaining positions need to be filled in based on the additional clues provided. However, without further specific details, we can't fully resolve all positions. This is a simplified solution based on the initial clues provided."
Lv9-6x7-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate items into their correct positions. Let's start by organizing the clues and placing the information step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 21**: The Australian is the one who practices Parkour.
   - Position 1: Australian, Parkour

2. **Clue 17**: The Dutch is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
3. **Clue 18**: The person driving the bike is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).
4. **Clue 22**: The person driving the bike is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).

Since the bike driver must be in an odd position and the Dutch must be in an even position, let’s place the Dutch in position 4 and the bike driver in position 1.

- Position 1: Australian, Parkour
- Position 4: Dutch

5. **Clue 37**: The Spanish is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).
6. **Clue 23**: The person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the owner of the pony.
7. **Clue 34**: The person drinking juice and the person driving the van have different parity positions.
8. **Clue 36**: The person driving the bike is not the owner of the goat.
9. **Clue 45**: The Dutch and the person who's sport is rugby have different parity positions.

Since the Dutch is in position 4, the person who does rugby cannot be in position 4. Also, the Dutch must be in an even position (4), so the rugby player must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7). Since the bike driver (position 1) is already occupied, the rugby player can be in position 3, 5, or 7.

Let’s assume the rugby player is in position 3 for now.

- Position 1: Australian, Parkour
- Position 3: Rugby
- Position 4: Dutch

10. **Clue 22**: The person driving the bike is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).

Since the bike driver is in an odd position and position 1 is already taken by the Australian, the bike driver could be in position 3, 5, or 7. However, position 3 is already taken by the rugby player, so the bike driver must be in position 5 or 7.

11. **Clue 33**: The person driving the bus is on the right of the fan house.
12. **Clue 39**: The Indian and the person drinking juice have different parity positions.

Since the Dutch is in position 4, the person who drinks juice cannot be in an even position. Therefore, the juice drinker must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).

Let’s assume the juice drinker is in position 1 for now.

- Position 1: Australian, Parkour, Juice
- Position 3: Rugby
- Position 4: Dutch

13. **Clue 34**: The person drinking juice and the person driving the van have different parity positions.

Since the juice drinker is in position 1 (odd), the van driver must be in an even position (2, 4, 6). Since the Dutch is in position 4, the van driver must be in position 2 or 6.

14. **Clue 35**: The person driving the bike is not the owner of the goat.
15. **Clue 36**: The person driving the bike is not to the right of the owner of the goat.

Since the bike driver is in position 5 or 7, and the goat owner must be to the left of the bike driver, the goat owner must be in position 1, 3, or 4. However, the Dutch is in position 4, so the goat owner must be in position 1, 3.

Since the juice drinker is in position 1, the goat owner must be in position 3.

- Position 1: Australian, Parkour, Juice
- Position 3: Goat, Rugby
- Position 4: Dutch

16. **Clue 38**: The person who's sport is tennis is in an even position (2, 4, 6).

Since the Dutch is in position 4, the tennis player must be in position 2 or 6.

17. **Clue 40**: The person who's sport is tennis is not the Indian.
18. **Clue 45**: The Dutch and the person who's sport is rugby have different parity positions.

Since the Dutch is in position 4 (even), the rugby player must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).

Since the rugby player is in position 3, the tennis player must be in position 2 or 6.

19. **Clue 42**: The fan classical is on the left or right of the person who's sport is soccer.

Since the Dutch is in position 4, the soccer player must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).

20. **Clue 43**: The French is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter.
21. **Clue 44**: The person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the French.

Since the French is to the right of the scooter driver, the French cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. The French must be in position 6 or 7.

22. **Clue 46**: The person driving the bike is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane.

Since the bike driver is in position 5, the airplane driver must be in position 3, 4, or 6.

23. **Clue 47**: The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing.

Since the surf player must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7), and the airplane driver is in position 3, 4, or 6, the surf player must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

24. **Clue 48**: The person who's sport is badminton is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

Since the badminton player must be in an even position (2, 4, 6), and the surf player is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7), the badminton player must be in position 2, 4, or 6.
