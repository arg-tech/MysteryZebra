Lv9-6x2-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the left of the photographer.
   - This means if the photographer is in position 2, the taxi driver must be in position 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This means if the person with the hobby of baking is in position 1, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The French is somewhere to the right of the American.
   - If the American is in position 1, the French must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person watching documentary movies and the person who's hobby is baking have the same parity positions (both are in odd or both are in even positions).
   - This means if the person's hobby is baking, they must be in an odd position if the documentary watcher is in an odd position, or in an even position if the documentary watcher is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Photographer and Taxi Driver
- From Clue 1, the photographer cannot be in position 1; the taxi driver must be in position 1 and the photographer in position 2.
  - **Position 1: Taxi Driver**
  - **Position 2: Photographer**

#### Step 2: Positioning the Baking Hobby and Sprite Drinkers
- From Clue 2, the person with the hobby of baking cannot be in position 2 because then the sprite drinker would have to be in position 2, which is not possible as the sprite drinker is to the right of the baking hobbyist.
- Therefore, the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 1.
- The sprite drinker must be in position 2.
  - **Position 1: Baking Hobby**
  - **Position 2: Sprite Drink**

#### Step 3: Positioning the American and French
- From Clue 3, the American cannot be in position 2; the French must be in position 2 and the American in position 1.
  - **Position 1: American**
  - **Position 2: French**

#### Step 4: Positioning the Documentary Watcher and Baking Hobbyist
- From Clue 4, since the baking hobbyist is in position 1 (odd), the documentary watcher must also be in an odd position.
- The only remaining odd position is position 1, but it's already occupied by the baking hobbyist.
- Thus, the documentary watcher must be in position 3.
  - **Position 1: Baking Hobby**
  - **Position 2: Sprite Drink**
  - **Position 3: Documentary Watcher**

#### Step 5: Filling Remaining Positions
- The remaining positions (4 and 5) can be filled with the remaining attributes (job, movie genre, transport, and nationality).
- Since the photographer is in position 2, the job must be in position 3, the movie genre in position 4, and the transport in position 5.
  - **Position 1: Baking Hobby**
  - **Position 2: Sprite Drink**
  - **Position 3: Fisherman (Job)**
  - **Position 4: Thriller (Movie Genre)**
  - **Position 5: Helicopter (Transport)**

- The remaining attributes (nationality and transport) fit into the last two positions.
  - **Position 1: American**
  - **Position 2: French**
  - **Position 3: Fisherman (Job)**
  - **Position 4: Thriller (Movie Genre)**
  - **Position 5: Helicopter (Transport)**
  - **Position 6: Photographer (Job)**
  - **Position 7: Documentary Watcher (Movie Genre)**
  - **Position 8: Taxi (Transport)**
  - **Position 9: Baking Hobby**
  - **Position 10: Sprite Drink**

```

This table satisfies all the given clues."
Lv9-6x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the bus is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
2. **Clue 2:** The project-manager is on the right of the person drinking tea.
3. **Clue 3:** The fan of r&b is not to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the fan r&b.
5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the dog and the person who's hobby is video-games have different parity positions (odd/even).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- The person driving the bus is to the right of the person with the hobby of video-games.
- This means the person with the hobby of video-games cannot be in position 2 (the last position).

#### Clue 2:
- The project-manager is on the right of the person drinking tea.
- This means the person drinking tea cannot be in position 2 (the last position).

#### Clue 3 & Clue 4:
- These two clues together imply that the person who likes r&b and the person with the hobby of video-games must be in positions where one is to the left and the other to the right of the other. Given the constraints, they must be in positions 1 and 2.

#### Clue 5:
- The owner of the dog and the person with the hobby of video-games have different parity positions.
- If the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 1 (odd), then the dog owner must be in position 2 (even).
- Conversely, if the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 2 (even), then the dog owner must be in position 1 (odd).

Given these constraints, let's place the information:

1. **Position 1:** Video-games, Dog Owner
2. **Position 2:** R&B Fan, Bus Driver

Now, we can fill in the rest of the table using the remaining clues and information:

- **Beverage:** Since the person drinking tea is not in position 2, and the person driving the bus is to the right of the person with the hobby of video-games, the person drinking tea must be in position 1.
- **Job:** The project-manager is on the right of the person drinking tea, so the project-manager must be in position 2.
- **Transport:** The bus driver is in position 2, so the tram user must be in position 1.

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |    Tea      |     Hot-Chocolate    |
| Hobby         | Video-Games |      R&B Fan       |
| Job           | Project-Manager |   Bus Driver      |
| Music-Genre   |     R&B     |      Pop          |
| Pet           |     Dog     |       Rat         |
| Transport     |       Tram  |        Bus        |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |    Tea      |     Hot-Chocolate    |
| Hobby         | Video-Games |      R&B Fan       |
| Job           | Project-Manager |   Bus Driver      |

Lv9-6x2-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The owner of the pony is on the right of the fan of R&B.**
   - This means if someone has a pony, they are in an even-numbered position.
   - If someone prefers R&B, they are in an odd-numbered position.

2. **The person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating banana.**
   - This means the horror movie fan must be in a position to the left of the banana eater.

3. **The person whose sport is cycling and the person driving the quad-bike have different parity positions.**
   - If one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position.

4. **The person eating kiwi is not to the right of the person watching horror movies.**
   - This means the kiwi eater cannot be in a position to the right of the horror movie fan.

5. **The person eating kiwi is the person driving the train.**
   - The kiwi eater drives the train.

6. **The person eating kiwi is not to the right of the person whose sport is cycling.**
   - This means the kiwi eater cannot be in a position to the right of the cyclist.

7. **The fan of R&B is not to the left of the person watching horror movies.**
   - This means the R&B fan cannot be in a position to the left of the horror movie fan.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions for R&B and Horror Fans
- From clue 1, if someone has a pony, they are in an even-numbered position.
- From clue 7, the R&B fan cannot be to the left of the horror movie fan.
- Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), the R&B fan must be in position 1, and the horror movie fan must be in position 2.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions for Kiwi Eater and Train Driver
- From clue 5, the kiwi eater is the train driver.
- From clue 6, the kiwi eater cannot be to the right of the cyclist.
- From clue 4, the kiwi eater is not to the right of the horror movie fan.
- Since the horror movie fan is in position 2, the kiwi eater (train driver) must be in position 1.

#### Step 3: Determine the positions for Pony Owner and Cycling Fan
- From clue 1, the pony owner must be in position 2 (even position).
- From clue 3, the cycling fan and the quad-bike driver must have different parity positions.
- Since the cycling fan must be in an odd position, they must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the quad-bike driver must be in position 2.

#### Step 4: Determine the remaining positions
- From clue 2, the horror movie fan (position 2) is to the left of the banana eater.
- From clue 4, the kiwi eater (position 1) is not to the right of the horror movie fan (position 2).
- Therefore, the banana eater must be in position 2.

- From clue 8, the kiwi eater (position 1) is not to the right of the cycling fan (position 1).
- Therefore, the remaining positions for the remaining items (food, movie genre, music genre, and sport) can be filled as follows:

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1    |     2     |

Lv9-6x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The photographer is not to the left of the Japanese**.
2. **The person who prefers skiing is on the left of the fan of disco**.
3. **The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the manager**.
4. **The person driving the helicopter and the person watching adventure movies have different parity positions (odd/even)**.
5. **The American is on the far left or far right**.

### Initial Setup:
We start with the initial table:
```
|               |      1       |     2     |
| Job           |              |           |
| Movie-Genre   |              |           |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Nationality   |              |           |
| Sport         |              |           |
| Transport     |              |           |
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The American is on the far left or far right.
   - This means either row 1 or row 2 must be American.

2. **Clue 1**: The photographer is not to the left of the Japanese.
   - If the Japanese is in position 1, the photographer cannot be in position 1.
   - If the Japanese is in position 2, the photographer can be in position 1.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who prefers skiing is on the left of the fan of disco.
   - This means the person who prefers skiing is in position 1 and the person who prefers disco is in position 2.

4. **Clue 3**: The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the manager.
   - This means the manager cannot be in position 1 if the helicopter is in position 1.

5. **Clue 4**: The person driving the helicopter and the person watching adventure movies have different parity positions.
   - This means one is in an odd position and the other in an even position.

Let's start placing the information:

- Since the American is on the far left or far right, let's assume the American is in position 1 (we can check both scenarios later).
- From Clue 2, the person who prefers skiing is in position 1 and the person who prefers disco is in position 2.

Given these constraints, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |      1       |     2     |
| Job           | Manager      | Photographer |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure    | Fantasy    |
| Music-Genre   | Disco        | Funk       |
| Nationality   | American     | Japanese   |
| Sport         | Skiing      | Handball   |
| Transport     | Van          | Helicopter |
```

### Verification:
1. **Clue 1**: The photographer is not to the left of the Japanese. (True)
2. **Clue 2**: The person who prefers skiing is on the left of the fan of disco. (True)
3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the manager. (False, needs adjustment)
4. **Clue 4**: The person driving the helicopter and the person watching adventure movies have different parity positions. (True)

Since Clue 3 is false, we need to adjust the positions. Let's try the American in position 2 instead of position 1:

```
|               |      1       |     2     |
| Job           | Manager      | Photographer |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure    | Fantasy    |
| Music-Genre   | Disco        | Funk       |
| Nationality   | Japanese     | American   |
| Sport         | Skiing      | Handball   |
| Transport     | Van          | Helicopter |
```

Now, let's verify again:
1. **Clue 1**: The photographer is not to the left of the Japanese. (True)
2. **Clue 2**: The person who prefers skiing is on the left of the fan of disco. (True)
3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the manager. (True, as the manager is in position 2)
4. **Clue 4**: The person driving the helicopter and the person watching adventure movies have different parity positions. (True)

All clues are satisfied with this arrangement.

### Final Solution:
```
|               |      1       |     2     |
| Job           | Manager      | Photographer |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure    | Fantasy    |
| Music-Genre   | Disco        | Funk       |
| Nationality   | Japanese     | American   |

Lv9-6x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements accordingly. Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The person eating pumpkin is not to the left of the malaysian.**
2. **The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram.**
3. **The coach is on the far right.**
4. **The person who's sport is surfing and the malaysian have different parity positions.**
5. **The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Coach is on the far right (Job).**
   - This means the coach is in position 2 for the job column.
   - So, the job column will look like:
     ```
     |               |      1      |      2      |
     | Food          |             |             |
     | Hobby         |             |             |
     | Job           |             |    Coach    |
     | Nationality   |             |             |
     | Sport         |             |             |
     | Transport     |             |             |
     ```

2. **The person eating pumpkin is not to the left of the malaysian.**
   - This means if the malaysian is in position 1, the person eating pumpkin cannot be in position 1. If the malaysian is in position 2, the person eating pumpkin can be in position 1.

3. **The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram.**
   - This means the tram driver cannot be in position 2, because the asparagus eater would then be to the left of the tram driver.

4. **The person who's sport is surfing and the malaysian have different parity positions.**
   - If the malaysian is in an odd position, the person who's sport is surfing must be in an even position, and vice versa.

5. **The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing.**
   - This means the gardening person cannot be in position 2, and the surfing person cannot be in position 1.

### Placing Elements:

- **Tram Driver:**
  - Since the asparagus eater is to the right of the tram driver, the tram driver cannot be in position 2 (as the asparagus eater would then be in position 1, which is to the left).
  - The only possible position for the tram driver is position 1.
  - So, the transport column will look like:
    ```
    |               |      1      |      2      |
    | Food          |             |             |
    | Hobby         |             |             |
    | Job           |             |    Coach    |
    | Nationality   |             |             |
    | Sport         |             |             |
    | Transport     | Tram        |             |
    ```

- **Malaysian:**
  - The malaysian cannot be in position 2 (coach is there).
  - If the malaysian is in position 1, the person eating pumpkin cannot be in position 1 (clue 1).
  - Therefore, the malaysian must be in position 2.
  - So, the nationality column will look like:

Lv9-6x2-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

### Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- The person with the hobby of video-games is on the far right (position 2).

|               |     1      |       2       |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Beverage      |            |               |
| Hobby         |            | video-games   |
| Movie-Genre   |            |               |
| Nationality   |            |               |

| Sport         |            |               |

### Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- The owner of the mouse is not to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

Since the person drinking hot-chocolate can only be in position 1, the owner of the mouse must be in position 1 or 2. However, since the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 2, the owner of the mouse cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the owner of the mouse must be in position 1.

|               |     1      |       2       |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate |           |
| Hobby         |            | video-games   |

| Sport         |            |               |

### Step 3: Analyze Clue 5
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the right of the person whose sport is tennis.

Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, the person whose sport is tennis must be in position 1 or 2. But we already know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, so the person whose sport is tennis must be in position 2.

|               |     1      |       2       |

| Pet           | mouse      |               |
| Sport         | tennis     | water-polo    |

### Step 4: Analyze Clue 6
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the owner of the dog.

Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, the owner of the dog must be in position 1 or 2. But we already know that the owner of the mouse is in position 1, so the owner of the dog must be in position 2.

|               |     1      |       2       |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate |           |

| Pet           | mouse      | dog           |
| Sport         | tennis     | water-polo    |

### Step 5: Analyze Clue 2
- The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.

Since the owner of the dog is in position 2, the person watching spy movies must be in position 1.

|               |     1      |       2       |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | spy          |

| Pet           | mouse      | dog           |
| Sport         | tennis     | water-polo    |

### Step 6: Analyze Clue 4
- The Mexican and the person watching spy movies have different parity positions.

Since the person watching spy movies is in position 1 (odd), the Mexican must be in an even position (position 2).

|               |     1      |       2       |
|---------------|------------|---------------|

Lv9-6x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements accordingly. Let's start by organizing the clues and then fill in the table step-by-step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon.
2. The fan of blues and the person drinking 7up have different parity positions (one is in an odd position, the other in an even position).
3. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the chef.
4. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
5. The person eating strawberry is not to the left of the person driving the taxi.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking 7up is to the right of the person eating watermelon.
   - This means the watermelon eater must be in position 1, and the 7up drinker must be in position 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The fan of blues and the person drinking 7up have different parity positions.
   - Since the 7up drinker is in position 2 (even), the fan of blues must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is badminton is to the left of the chef.
   - This means the badminton player must be in position 1, and the chef must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - This means the lemonade drinker must be in position 1, and the snowmobile driver must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 5**: The person eating strawberry is not to the left of the person driving the taxi.
   - This means the strawberry eater cannot be in position 1 if the taxi driver is in position 2.

### Combining Clues:
From Clue 1 and Clue 4, we can see that:
- Watermelon eater: Position 1
- 7up drinker: Position 2
- Lemonade drinker: Position 1
- Snowmobile driver: Position 2

This creates a conflict since both the watermelon eater and the lemonade drinker must be in position 1. Therefore, let's re-evaluate the positions considering the other clues.

### Correcting and Finalizing:
- From Clue 1, the watermelon eater must be in position 1, and the 7up drinker must be in position 2.
- From Clue 3, the badminton player must be in position 1, and the chef must be in position 2.
- From Clue 4, the lemonade drinker must be in position 1, and the snowmobile driver must be in position 2.

Since the badminton player and the lemonade drinker both need to be in position 1, we need to adjust:
- Watermelon eater: Position 1
- 7up drinker: Position 2
- Lemonade drinker: Position 1 (not possible, so re-evaluate)

Re-evaluating:
- Watermelon eater: Position 1
- 7up drinker: Position 2
- Strawberry eater: Position 1 (since it cannot be to the left of the taxi driver)
- Lemonade drinker: Position 2 (must be to the left of the snowmobile driver)

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |    lemonade |       7up     |

Lv9-6x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person eating pear.**
   - This means that the person who drinks hot-chocolate cannot be the same as the person who eats pear.

2. **The fan of classical and the person driving the airplane have the same parity positions.**
   - This means that if the person who likes classical music is in an even position, the person driving the airplane must also be in an even position, and vice versa.

3. **The person drinking iced-tea is not the person watching zombie movies.**
   - This means that the person who drinks iced-tea cannot be the same as the person who watches zombie movies.

4. **The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person eating avocado.**
   - This means that the person driving the airplane must be in a position before (to the left of) the person eating avocado.

5. **The person eating avocado is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling.**
   - This means that the person with the hobby of traveling must be in a position to the left of the person eating avocado.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote:
- \( A \): Hot-Chocolate
- \( B \): Iced-Tea
- \( C \): Avocado
- \( D \): Pear
- \( E \): Traveling
- \( F \): Woodworking
- \( G \): Animation
- \( H \): Zombie
- \( I \): Classical
- \( J \): Electronic
- \( K \): Airplane
- \( L \): Snowmobile

From clues 2 and 4, since the person driving the airplane must be to the left of the person eating avocado, and they have the same parity (even or odd), the possible positions for the airplane driver and the avocado eater are:
- \( (K, C) \) could be in positions (1, 2)
- Or \( (K, C) \) could be in positions (2, 1)

Since \( C \) (eating avocado) must be to the right of \( E \) (traveling), the only valid option is:
- \( (K, C) = (1, 2) \)
- \( (E, A) = (2, 1) \)

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      |   Iced-tea |    Hot-chocolate  |
| Food          |   Avocado  |       Pear      |
| Hobby         |  Traveling |    Woodworking  |
| Movie-Genre   |   Zombie   |     Animation   |
| Music-Genre   |  Classical |    Electronic   |
| Transport     |  Airplane  |     Snowmobile  |
```

We can verify the solution with the remaining clues:
- Clue 1: The person drinking hot-chocolate (1, 2) is not the person eating pear (2, 1). True.
- Clue 3: The person drinking iced-tea (1, 1) is not the person watching zombie movies (2, 1). True.
- Clue 5: The person eating avocado (2, 1) is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling (2, 1). True.

All clues are satisfied. Therefore, the final solution table is:

```
|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      |   Iced-tea |    Hot-chocolate  |
| Food          |   Avocado  |       Pear      |
| Hobby         |  Traveling |    Woodworking  |
| Movie-Genre   |   Zombie   |     Animation   |
| Music-Genre   |  Classical |    Electronic   |
| Transport     |  Airplane  |     Snowmobile  |

Lv9-6x2-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is video-games is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The person watching documentary movies is the person eating potato.
3. **Clue 3:** The person whose sport is water-polo is on the left of the fan of metal.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking water and the fan of techno have the same parity (both even or both odd) positions.
5. **Clue 5:** The fan of techno is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit.

### Initial Setup:
We start with the given table and fill in the known values:

```
|               |      1       |      2       |
| Beverage      |              |              |
| Food          |              |              |
| Hobby         |              |              |
| Movie-Genre   |              |              |
| Music-Genre   |              |              |
| Sport         |      -polo   |              |
```

### Applying Clues:

1. **Clue 2:** The person watching documentary movies is the person eating potato.
    - This means that in position 1, either ""Beverage"" or ""Food"" must be ""potato"" and the corresponding ""Movie-Genre"" must be ""documentary"".

2. **Clue 3:** The person whose sport is water-polo is on the left of the fan of metal.
    - This means that in position 1, ""Sport"" must be ""water-polo"", and in position 2, ""Music-Genre"" must be ""metal"".

3. **Clue 5:** The fan of techno is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit.
    - This means that in position 1, either ""Beverage"" or ""Food"" must be ""grapefruit"", and the corresponding ""Music-Genre"" must be ""techno"".

4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking water and the fan of techno have the same parity positions.
    - This means if one is in an even position, the other must also be in an even position, and similarly for odd positions.

5. **Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is video-games is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
    - This means that if ""Hobby"" is ""video-games"" in position 2, then ""Beverage"" cannot be ""soy-milk"" in position 1.

### Deductions:

From Clue 3:
- Position 1: ""Sport"" = ""water-polo""
- Position 2: ""Music-Genre"" = ""metal""

From Clue 2:
- Position 1: ""Movie-Genre"" = ""documentary""
- Position 1: ""Food"" = ""potato""

From Clue 5:
- Position 1: ""Beverage"" = ""grapefruit"" (since ""grapefruit"" and ""techno"" must be in the same parity)
- Position 1: ""Music-Genre"" = ""techno""

From Clue 4:
- Since ""Beverage"" in position 1 is ""grapefruit"" and ""Music-Genre"" in position 1 is ""techno"", both are in the same parity (odd).

From Clue 1:
- Since ""Hobby"" in position 2 is ""video-games"" and ""Beverage"" in position 1 is ""grapefruit"" (odd), ""Beverage"" in position 2 cannot be ""soy-milk"" (even). Therefore, ""Beverage"" in position 2 must be ""water"".

Now we can fill in the table:

```
|               |      1       |      2       |
| Beverage      |  grapefruit  |     water    |
| Food          |   potato     |             |
| Hobby         |  video-games |             |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary  |             |
| Music-Genre   |    techno    |    metal     |
| Sport         |    -polo     |             |
```

To complete the table, we need to assign the remaining values to ""Hobby"" and ""Food"" in position 2:

- ""Hobby"" in position 2 must be ""magic-tricks"" (since ""video-games"" is in position 1).
- ""Food"" in position 2 must be ""soy-milk"" (since ""potato"" is in position 1).

Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1       |      2       |
| Beverage      |  grapefruit  |     water    |
| Food          |   potato     |   soy-milk   |
| Hobby         |  video-games |  magic-tricks|
| Movie-Genre   | documentary  |             |
| Music-Genre   |    techno    |    metal     |
