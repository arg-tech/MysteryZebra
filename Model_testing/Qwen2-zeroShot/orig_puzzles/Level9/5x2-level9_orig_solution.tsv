Lv9-5x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

1. **Identify the fans and their preferences:**
   - The fan of R&B is the dressmaker.
   - The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
   - The person eating asparagus and the fan of country music have different parity positions.
   - The fan of country music is in an even position (position 2).
   - The fan of country music is not to the right of the bartender.

2. **Assign the positions:**
   - Since the fan of country music is in position 2, the fan of R&B must be in position 1 because the fan of R&B is the dressmaker.

3. **Determine the sport and movie genre for each person:**
   - The person with skateboarding is to the left of the person watching disaster movies. This means:
     - If the person in position 1 is skateboarding, the person in position 2 must be watching disaster movies.
     - However, this conflicts with the fan of country music being in position 2. So, the person in position 1 cannot be skateboarding.
   - Therefore, the person in position 2 must be skateboarding, and the person in position 1 must be watching disaster movies.

4. **Determine the food and music genre for each person:**
   - The person eating asparagus and the fan of country music have different parity positions. Since the fan of country music is in position 2, the person eating asparagus must be in position 1.
   - The fan of R&B is in position 1, so the person in position 1 is the dressmaker.
   - The person in position 1 is the dressmaker and eating asparagus, and the person in position 2 is skateboarding and watching disaster movies.
   - The remaining food (plum) and music genre (country) must be assigned to the person in position 2. Since the fan of country music is in position 2, the person in position 2 must be listening to country music.

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Food          | asparagus    | plum       |
| Job           | dressmaker   | bartender  |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster     | skateboarding|
| Music-Genre   | country      | r&b        |
| Sport         | disaster     | skateboarding|

Lv9-5x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the correct arrangement for each category (Beverage, Food, Music-Genre, Nationality, and Pet) for both Person 1 and Person 2. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person eating cucumber is on the right of the person eating mango.
2. The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.
3. The Colombian and the person drinking sprite have different parity positions (odd or even).
4. The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the right of the fan of jazz.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the order of Food
- Clue 1 states that the person eating cucumber is on the right of the person eating mango.
- Therefore, the order must be: Mango, Cucumber.

So, we can place:
- Food 1: Mango
- Food 2: Cucumber

#### Step 2: Determine the order of Beverage
- Clue 2 states that the fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.
- This means that either the person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the fan of reggae.

Let's assume:
- Beverage 1: Sprite
- Beverage 2: Water (we'll adjust if needed)

#### Step 3: Determine the order of Music-Genre
- Clue 2 also states that the fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.
- This means that either the person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the fan of reggae.

Let's assume:
- Music-Genre 1: Jazz
- Music-Genre 2: Reggae

#### Step 4: Determine the order of Nationality
- Clue 3 states that the Colombian and the person drinking sprite have different parity positions.
- This means that if the person drinking sprite is in an odd position, the Colombian is in an even position, and vice versa.

Let's assume:
- Nationality 1: Colombian
- Nationality 2: Malaysian

#### Step 5: Determine the order of Pet
- Clue 4 states that the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the right of the fan of jazz.
- This means that the fan of jazz cannot be in the last position, and the owner of the mouse must be in a position to the right of the fan of jazz.

Let's assume:
- Pet 1: Goldfish
- Pet 2: Mouse

Now let's arrange these based on the positions and clues:

### Possible Arrangements:
1. **Person 1**:
   - Food: Mango
   - Beverage: Sprite
   - Music-Genre: Jazz
   - Nationality: Colombian
   - Pet: Goldfish

Lv9-5x2-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The analyst is not to the right of the owner of the mouse.**
   - This means the analyst must be to the left of the owner of the mouse.

2. **The fan of pop and the person driving the taxi have different parity positions.**
   - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position (and vice versa).

3. **The person driving the taxi is on the right of the analyst.**
   - This confirms that the analyst is to the left of the taxi driver.

4. **The fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the person drinking juice.**
   - This means the person who drinks juice cannot be in the first position if the person who fans pop is in the first position.

5. **The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse.**
   - This means the owner of the mouse and the person drinking soy-milk must be adjacent.

### Initial Setup:
Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Analyst / Pop Fan / Juice Drinker / Soy Milk Drinker
- Position 2: Mouse Owner / Taxi Driver / Other

### Applying Clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The analyst is not to the right of the owner of the mouse.
   - Analyst must be in position 1, and the mouse owner must be in position 2.

2. **Clue 3:** The person driving the taxi is on the right of the analyst.
   - This confirms the analyst is in position 1, and the taxi driver is in position 2.

3. **Clue 2:** The fan of pop and the person driving the taxi have different parity positions.
   - Since the taxi driver is in position 2 (even), the pop fan must be in position 1 (odd).

4. **Clue 4:** The fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the person drinking juice.
   - This means the juice drinker cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 5:** The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse.
   - Since the mouse owner is in position 2, the soy milk drinker can be in either position 1 or 2. Given the juice drinker is in position 2, the soy milk drinker must be in position 1.

### Final Table:
```
|               |    1     |   2   |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk | Juice |
| Job           | Analyst  | Pilot |
| Music-Genre   | Pop      | D&B   |
| Pet           | Mouse    | Rat   |
| Transport     | Taxi     | Bus   |
```

### Explanation:
- **Position 1:** Analyst, Pop Fan, Soy Milk Drinker, Mouse Owner
- **Position 2:** Taxi Driver, Pilot, Juice Drinker, Rat Owner

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv9-5x2-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Parity Positions**:
   - The first position (1) is odd.
   - The second position (2) is even.

2. **Given Information**:
   - **Food**: Corn, Peach
   - **Music-Genre**: Blues, Trance
   - **Nationality**: Brazilian, Colombian
   - **Sport**: Handball, Rowing
   - **Transport**: Roller, Trike

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Constraint 1**: The person driving the roller and the Colombian have the same parity positions.
   - **Constraint 2**: The Brazilian and the person eating corn have the same parity positions.
   - **Constraint 3**: The Colombian is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is handball.
   - **Constraint 4**: The person whose sport is handball and the fan of blues have the same parity positions.

### Applying Constraints:

#### Constraint 1:
- The person driving the roller and the Colombian have the same parity positions.
  - This means either both are in position 1 or both are in position 2.

#### Constraint 2:
- The Brazilian and the person eating corn have the same parity positions.
  - This means either both are in position 1 or both are in position 2.

#### Constraint 3:
- The Colombian is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is handball.
  - This means the Colombian cannot be in position 2 if the person with handball is in position 1.

#### Constraint 4:
- The person whose sport is handball and the fan of blues have the same parity positions.
  - This means either both are in position 1 or both are in position 2.

### Deduction:

- From Constraint 1 and Constraint 2, we can deduce that both the Colombian and the Brazilian must be in the same parity position (both in position 1 or both in position 2).

- Since the Colombian cannot be in position 2 (Constraint 3), the Colombian must be in position 1. Therefore, the Brazilian must also be in position 1.

- Now, the Colombian is in position 1, so the person driving the roller must also be in position 1 (Constraint 1).

- Since the Brazilian and the person eating corn have the same parity positions (Constraint 2), the person eating corn must also be in position 1.

- Therefore, the only remaining positions for the person with handball and the fan of blues must be position 2 (since they need to have the same parity positions as each other and not overlap with the first two).

- The person with handball and the fan of blues can be assigned to position 2, and since the Colombian is already in position 1, the person with handball must be the one who drives the trike (the only other option for transport in position 2).

- This leaves the person eating peach and the fan of trance to be assigned to position 2.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          |   Peach   |   Corn    |

Lv9-5x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's break down the clues one by one.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is photography and the person watching comedy movies have different parity positions.
2. The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
3. The person watching comedy movies is in an even position.
4. The argentine is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.

Let's start with clue 3:
- The person watching comedy movies is in an even position. This means the person watching comedy movies must be in position 2.

Now, let's use clue 4:
- The argentine is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person in position 2 is watching comedy movies, the argentine cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the argentine must be in position 1.

So far, our table looks like this:

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |  Argentine  |           |
| Movie-Genre   |             |  Comedy   |
| Nationality   |  Argentine  |           |
| Pet           |             |           |
| Transport     |             |  Tram     |
```

Next, let's use clue 2:
- The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since the person in position 2 is watching comedy movies and the person in position 1 is Argentine, the person driving the tram must be either in position 1 or 2. However, since the person in position 1 is Argentine, the person driving the tram must be in position 2. So, the person in position 2 is driving the tram.

This confirms that the person in position 2 is driving the tram and watching comedy movies.

Now, let's use clue 1:
- The person who's hobby is photography and the person watching comedy movies have different parity positions. Since the person in position 2 is watching comedy movies, the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 1 (since they have different parity positions).

So, the person in position 1 has the hobby of photography.

Now, let's fill in the remaining details based on the clues and logical deductions:

- The person in position 1 is Argentine and has the hobby of photography.
- The person in position 2 is driving the tram and watching comedy movies.

Since the person in position 1 has the hobby of photography, the person in position 2 must have the hobby of fishing (the only other hobby).

Since the person in position 2 is driving the tram, the person in position 1 must own the rat (the only pet not mentioned for position 2).

Since the person in position 1 is Argentine, the person in position 2 must be Indian (the only nationality not mentioned for position 1).

Since the person in position 2 is driving the tram, the person in position 1 must use the quad-bike (the only transport not mentioned for position 2).

So, the final table is:

```
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |  Photography|  Fishing  |
| Movie-Genre   |  Tram       |  Comedy   |
| Nationality   |  Argentine  |  Indian   |
| Pet           |  Rat        |  Goldfish |
| Transport     |  Quad-bike  |  Tram     |

Lv9-5x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding elements in the correct positions. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step-by-step.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking cola and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions (both are in the same odd or even position).
3. **Clue 3**: The australian is somewhere to the left of the fan of d&b.

### Initial Setup:
We start with the given table:

```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Beverage      |            |          |
| Movie-Genre   |            |          |
| Music-Genre   |            |          |
| Nationality   |            |          |
| Sport         |            |          |
```

### Applying Clues:

**Clue 1**: 
- The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
- This means if the sport is skiing, it must be in position 1, and the beverage is sprite in position 2.

**Clue 2**: 
- The person drinking cola and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions.
- This means either both are in position 1 or both are in position 2.

**Clue 3**: 
- The australian is somewhere to the left of the fan of d&b.
- This means the australian must be in position 1, and the fan of d&b must be in position 2.

### Deduction Process:

1. From **Clue 3**, we know the australian must be in position 1.
2. Since the australian is in position 1, the fan of d&b must be in position 2.
3. From **Clue 1**, since the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person whose sport is skiing, the sport skiing must be in position 1, and sprite must be in position 2.
4. Now, from **Clue 2**, the person drinking cola and the person watching scientific movies must be in the same parity positions. Since the australian is in position 1, the cola drinker and the scientific movie watcher cannot be in position 1 (since the australian is there). Thus, they must be in position 2.
5. Since the sport skiing is in position 1 and sprite is in position 2, the cola drinker and the scientific movie watcher must be in position 2.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Beverage      |    sprite  |    cola  |
| Movie-Genre   |  scientific|  family  |
| Music-Genre   |     d&b    |    salsa |
| Nationality   |  australian|  canadian|
| Sport         |   skiing   |  lacrosse|
```

This configuration satisfies all the given clues."
Lv9-5x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The entrepreneur and the person who's sport is swimming have different parity positions.
   - This means if the entrepreneur is in an odd position (1), the person who's sport is swimming must be in an even position (2), and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person who's sport is swimming.
   - This directly links the hobby ""filmmaking"" with the sport ""swimming"".

3. **Clue 3:** The fan metal is not to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.
   - This means the person who prefers metal cannot be in the same column as the person whose sport is climbing, or to the right of them.

4. **Clue 4:** The fan metal is on the right of the fan salsa.
   - This means the person who prefers metal must be in the 2nd column if the person who prefers salsa is in the 1st column, or vice versa.

5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the bus and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions.
   - This means if the person driving the bus is in an odd position (1), the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must also be in an odd position (1), and vice versa.

Now, let's fill in the table based on these clues:

|               |     1      |      2       |
|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Hobby         | magic-tricks| filmmaking   |
| Job           | entrepreneur| teacher      |
| Music-Genre   | salsa      | metal        |
| Sport         | climbing   | swimming     |
| Transport     | bus        | ship         |

### Explanation:
1. From Clue 2, the person whose hobby is filmmaking is the person whose sport is swimming. So, we can place ""filmmaking"" in the 2nd column for ""Hobby"" and ""swimming"" in the 2nd column for ""Sport"".
2. From Clue 1, the entrepreneur and the person who's sport is swimming have different parity positions. Since the person who's sport is swimming is in the 2nd column (even position), the entrepreneur must be in the 1st column (odd position).
3. From Clue 5, the person driving the bus and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in the 1st column (odd position), the person driving the bus must also be in the 1st column (odd position). Therefore, ""bus"" goes in the 1st column for ""Transport"".
4. From Clue 4, the fan metal is on the right of the fan salsa. Since the person who prefers salsa is in the 1st column for ""Music-Genre"", the person who prefers metal must be in the 2nd column for ""Music-Genre"". Similarly, from Clue 3, the fan metal cannot be to the right of the person who's sport is climbing, so ""climbing"" must be in the 1st column for ""Sport"".
5. The remaining options for the last row (transport) fit the pattern where ""ship"" is in the 2nd column and ""bus"" is in the 1st column.

Lv9-5x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clue Breakdown:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is rowing and the person eating cucumber have the same parity positions.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person eating cucumber.
4. **Clue 4:** The software-developer is the person who's sport is basketball.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4:
- The software-developer is the person who's sport is basketball.
- This means the software-developer is either in position 1 or 2, and their sport is basketball.

#### Clue 1:
- The person who's sport is basketball (software-developer) is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies.
- If the software-developer is in position 1, then the person watching sports movies must be in position 2.
- If the software-developer is in position 2, then the person watching sports movies must be in position 1.

#### Clue 2:
- The person who's sport is rowing and the person eating cucumber have the same parity positions.
- If the software-developer (basketball) is in position 1, then the person watching sports movies must be in position 2.
- The person with rowing and cucumber must be in the same parity positions (both even or both odd).

#### Clue 3:
- The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person eating cucumber.
- If the software-developer (basketball) is in position 1, then the person with rowing and cucumber must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the person with chess cannot be in position 1 (since they would not be to the right of the cucumber eater if the cucumber eater is in position 2).

Given these constraints, let's assume the software-developer is in position 1 (basketball) and the person watching sports movies is in position 2.

- Position 1: Software-developer (basketball)
- Position 2: Person watching sports movies (sports)

Now we need to place the remaining items:

#### Clue 2:
- The person with rowing and cucumber must be in the same parity positions as the person with rowing (position 2).
- Therefore, the person with rowing and cucumber must also be in position 2.

This is a contradiction because position 2 is already occupied by the person watching sports movies. So, the software-developer must be in position 2.

- Position 2: Software-developer (basketball)
- Position 1: Person watching sports movies (sports)

Now we can place the rest:

#### Clue 2:
- The person with rowing and cucumber must be in the same parity positions as the person with rowing (position 1).
- Therefore, the person with rowing and cucumber must also be in position 1.

This is a contradiction because position 1 is already occupied by the person watching sports movies. So, the software-developer must be in position 1.

- Position 1: Software-developer (basketball)
- Position 2: Person watching sports movies (sports)

Now we can place the rest:

#### Clue 3:
- The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person eating cucumber.
- Since the person watching sports movies (sports) is in position 2, the person eating cucumber must be in position 1.

- Position 1: Software-developer (basketball), eating cucumber
- Position 2: Person watching sports movies (sports)

Now we need to place the remaining items:

- The person with chess must be in position 2 (right of the cucumber eater).

- Position 1: Software-developer (basketball), eating cucumber
- Position 2: Person with chess, watching sports movies (sports)

Finally, we need to place the remaining items:

- The person with rowing and pumpkin must be in the remaining position.

- Position 1: Software-developer (basketball), eating cucumber
- Position 2: Person with chess, watching sports movies (sports)

Lv9-5x2-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
2. The person watching thriller movies is on the far right.
3. The person whose sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber.
4. The person whose sport is basketball and the person driving the scooter have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
5. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the position of the person watching thriller movies
- Clue 2 tells us that the person watching thriller movies is on the far right.
- Therefore, the person watching thrillers is in position 2 for all categories.

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      |           | coffee      |
| Food          |           | cherry      |
| Movie-Genre   |           | thriller    |
| Sport         |           | basketball  |
| Transport     |           | scooter     |

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of coffee and almond milk
- Clue 1 states that the person drinking coffee is to the left of the person drinking almond milk.
- Since thrillers are in position 2, coffee must be in position 1 and almond milk must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | coffee    | almond milk |
| Food          |           | cherry      |
| Movie-Genre   |           | thriller    |
| Sport         |           | basketball  |
| Transport     |           | scooter     |

#### Step 3: Determine the position of cucumber
- Clue 3 states that the person whose sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber.
- Since basketball is in position 2 for sport, and thriller is in position 2 for movie genre, cucumber must be in position 1 for food, and sailing must be in position 2 for sport.

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | coffee    | almond milk |
| Food          | cucumber  | cherry      |
| Movie-Genre   |           | thriller    |
| Sport         | sailing   | basketball  |
| Transport     |           | scooter     |

#### Step 4: Determine the positions of roller and scooter
- Clue 5 states that the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller.
- Clue 4 states that the person whose sport is basketball and the person driving the scooter have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
- Since basketball is in an even position (2), the scooter must also be in an even position (2). This means the roller must be in an odd position (1).

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | coffee    | almond milk |
| Food          | cucumber  | cherry      |
| Movie-Genre   |           | thriller    |
| Sport         | sailing   | basketball  |
| Transport     | roller    | scooter     |

#### Step 5: Finalize the table with the remaining category (Beverage)
- The only beverage left is almond milk, which must go in the first position since coffee is already there.

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | coffee    | almond milk |
| Food          | cucumber  | cherry      |
| Movie-Genre   |           | thriller    |
| Sport         | sailing   | basketball  |
| Transport     | roller    | scooter     |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | coffee    | almond milk |
| Food          | cucumber  | cherry      |
| Movie-Genre   |           | thriller    |

Lv9-5x2-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Person Eating Radish:**
   - The person eating radish is on the far left (position 1).
   - Therefore, position 1 must be either ""radish"" or ""peach"".

2. **Turkish Person Driving Airplane:**
   - The Turkish person is driving the airplane.
   - This means the Turkish person is in position 2 (since they cannot be in position 1 as it is occupied by the person eating radish).

3. **Security Guard in Even Position:**
   - The security guard is in an even position (positions 2 or 4).
   - Since the Turkish person is in position 2, the security guard must be in position 4.

4. **Person Driving Airplane and Owner of Dog Have Different Parity Positions:**
   - The person driving the airplane is in position 2 (Turkish person).
   - The owner of the dog must be in an odd position (1 or 3) because the person driving the airplane is in an even position.

5. **Turkish Person Not Right of Person Eating Radish:**
   - The Turkish person is in position 2, and the person eating radish is in position 1.
   - This condition is satisfied.

6. **Determine Remaining Attributes:**
   - We know:
     - Position 1: Radish
     - Position 2: Turkish, drives airplane
     - Position 4: Security Guard
   - We need to assign the remaining attributes (mechanic, cat, bus) to positions 3 and 5.

7. **Assigning Remaining Attributes:**
   - Since the person in position 3 must be the owner of the dog (due to the parity condition), we can assign:
     - Position 3: Dog (owner)
     - Position 5: Cat (since it's the only pet left)

   - Now, we need to assign the remaining job and transport:
     - Position 3: Mechanic (since the security guard is at position 4)
     - Position 5: Bus (since the airplane is already assigned)
