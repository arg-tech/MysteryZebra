Lv9-4x6-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break down the clues step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is dancing is on the right of the musician.
2. **Clue 14:** The Chinese is the engineer.
3. **Clue 17:** The musician is on the far left or far right.
4. **Clue 22:** The person driving the car is on the far left or far right.
5. **Clue 32:** The person driving the car is in an even position (2 or 4).

Since the person driving the car is in an even position and it can't be position 4 (as the musician would be in position 1 or 6), the person driving the car must be in position 2.

6. **Clue 3:** The Chinese is somewhere to the left of the chef.
7. **Clue 20:** The Canadian is somewhere to the left of the teacher.
8. **Clue 6:** The teacher and the person who's hobby is chess have the same parity positions.
9. **Clue 10:** The Chef is somewhere between the Teacher and the Police-Officer.
10. **Clue 12:** The person who's hobby is chess is not in position 2 (since the person driving the car is there).
11. **Clue 16:** The person who's hobby is dancing is not to the left of the person who's hobby is dancing (this implies the person with the hobby of dancing is in position 6).

Given these constraints, let's start placing the known elements:

- Position 2: Person driving the car (must be even, so 2)
- Position 6: Person with the hobby of dancing

Now, let's place the musician and the Chinese:

- Since the musician is on the far left or far right, and the Chinese is to the left of the chef, the musician must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the Chinese must be in position 3 (since they are to the left of the chef and the Chinese cannot be in position 1).

Next, let's place the chef and the teacher:

- Since the chef is between the teacher and the police-officer, and the teacher and the person who's hobby is chess have the same parity positions, the teacher must be in position 4 (even position) and the person who's hobby is chess must also be in position 4.
- The chef must then be in position 5 (since the person who's hobby is dancing is in position 6 and the chef is between the teacher and the police-officer).

Let's now place the remaining elements:

- The Canadian must be to the left of the teacher, so the Canadian is in position 3 (but we already placed the Chinese there, so this needs re-evaluation).
- Re-evaluating the positions:
  - The Canadian must be in position 1 (leftmost), the teacher in position 4, and the chef in position 5.
- The person driving the car (position 2) cannot be the chef, so the person driving the car must be the musician.
- The police-officer must be in position 6 (rightmost).

Now, let's fill in the rest based on the remaining clues:

- The person who's hobby is chess is in position 4.
- The person who's hobby is dancing is in position 6.
- The person driving the car (position 2) must be the musician.
- The person driving the airplane must be in position 3 (since the person driving the scooter is in position 5, and the person driving the car is in position 2).
- The person driving the scooter (position 5) must be the police-officer.
- The person driving the ship must be in position 1 (since the person driving the airplane is in position 3, and the person driving the scooter is in position 5).

Finally, let's assign the nationalities and jobs:

- The Chinese (engineer) is in position 3.
- The Canadian (teacher) is in position 1.
- The Indian (journalist) is in position 4.
- The Russian (musician) is in position 2.
- The Indonesian (police-officer) is in position 5.
- The Egyptian (chef) is in position 6.

### Final Solution Table:

```plaintext
###############
| Hobby        | Chess  | Dancing | Fishing | Board-Games | Hiking | Traveling |
| Job          | Engineer | Teacher | Chef | Musician | Police-Officer | Journalist |
| Nationality  | Chinese | Canadian | Egyptian | Indian | Indonesian | Russian |
| Transport    | Airplane | Car | Scooter | Taxi | Ship | Skateboard |

Lv9-4x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the appropriate categories (Food, Job, Nationality, Transport) while ensuring all constraints are met.

Let's start by organizing the clues and solving step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze Clues and Place Initial Information

1. **Clue 22:** The person driving the van is on the far right.
   - Transport: Van, Position: 6

2. **Clue 23:** The person eating blueberry is in an even position.
   - Food: Blueberry, Positions: 2, 4, 6

Since the van is in position 6, the person eating blueberry must be in position 2 or 4.

3. **Clue 20:** The Brazilian is on the left or right of the Japanese.
   - Nationality: Brazilian, Japanese, Positions: 1, 3, 5, 6

4. **Clue 24:** The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the Indonesian.
   - Transport: Trike, Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

5. **Clue 28:** The Brazilian is not the person driving the bus.
   - Nationality: Brazilian, Transport: Not Bus

6. **Clue 26:** The person driving the trike is not to the left of the social worker.
   - Transport: Trike, Positions: 2, 3, 4, 5

7. **Clue 27:** The manager is not to the left of the German.
   - Job: Manager, German, Positions: 2, 3, 4, 5

8. **Clue 29:** The person eating plum is somewhere to the left of the French.
   - Food: Plum, Nationality: French, Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

9. **Clue 31:** The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person eating plum.
   - Transport: Bus, Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Food: Plum, Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

### Step 2: Use Process of Elimination and Logical Deductions

From Clue 22:
- Van in position 6.

From Clue 23:
- Blueberry in positions 2 or 4.

From Clue 20:
- Brazilian and Japanese in positions 1, 3, 5.

From Clue 28:
- Brazilian cannot be in position 1 (since they are not driving the bus).

From Clue 26:
- Trike cannot be in position 1 (leftmost).

From Clue 27:
- Manager not to the left of German.

From Clue 29:
- Plum to the left of French.

From Clue 31:
- Bus to the left of Plum.

### Step 3: Assign Values Based on Constraints

Let's start with the blueberry clue:
- Blueberry in position 4 (since it can't be 2 due to other constraints).

Now, let's place the van:
- Van in position 6.

Next, let's place the Japanese and Brazilian:
- Since Brazilian cannot be in position 1, let's place Japanese in position 1 and Brazilian in position 3.

Now, let's place the trike and the social worker:
- Trike must be to the left of the social worker, so trike could be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, but not 1 (Brazilian), so trike in position 2, social worker in position 3.

Now, let's place the bus:
- Bus must be to the left of plum, so bus in position 1.

Now, let's place the plumber and French:
- Plum in position 2, French in position 4.

Now, let's place the manager and German:
- Manager in position 5, German in position 6.

Finally, let's place the remaining foods and jobs:
- Apple in position 6 (since it must be to the right of the bus).
- Potato in position 3 (since it must be between van and trike).
- Pomegranate in position 1 (since it must be to the left of the manager).
- Raspberry in position 5 (since it must be to the right of the person driving the bus).

### Final Solution Table

|               |      1      |      2       |    3     |     4     |       5       |     6      |
| Food          |  Pomegranate|  Raspberry   |  Potato  |  Blueberry|  Plum        |  Apple     |
| Job           |  Designer   |  Social-worker|  Manager |  Musician |  Analyst     |  Videographer |
