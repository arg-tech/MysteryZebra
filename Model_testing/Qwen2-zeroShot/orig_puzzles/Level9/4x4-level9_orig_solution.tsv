### Step-by-step Solution:
Let's start placing the information based on the clues:

#### Clue 5 and Clue 1:
- The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person driving the van.
- This means that if the person driving the van is in position 4, the person driving the scooter must be in position 1.

#### Clue 10:
- The Dutch is somewhere between the person driving the boat and the Canadian.
- Since the person driving the scooter is in position 1, the person driving the van must be in position 4.
- Therefore, the Dutch must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 9 and Clue 1:
- The Canadian is somewhere to the right of the fan of soul.
- Since the person driving the van is in position 4, the Canadian cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- The only possible positions for the Canadian are 3 or 4.
- Since the Dutch is between the person driving the boat and the Canadian, and the Dutch can't be in position 4, the Canadian must be in position 3 and the Dutch in position 2.

#### Clue 1 and Clue 5:
- The person driving the scooter is in position 1, and the person driving the van is in position 4.
- The Canadian is in position 3, so the Dutch must be in position 2.

#### Clue 3 and Clue 14:
- The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the fan of folk.
- The fan of dubstep is on the right of the fan of folk.
- This means the fan of folk cannot be in position 4, and the fan of dubstep cannot be in position 1.

#### Clue 6 and Clue 15:
- The fan of trance and the Dutch have different parity positions.
- The Dutch is in position 2 (even), so the fan of trance must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

#### Clue 18:
- The fan of dubstep and the Argentine have different parity positions.
- Since the Argentine is not the fan of dubstep, the Argentine must be in an even position (2 or 4).

#### Clue 12:
- The Argentine is not the fan of dubstep.
- If the Argentine is in position 2, then the fan of dubstep must be in position 4.

#### Clue 4 and Clue 8:
- The person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the Argentine.
- The person eating cauliflower is not to the left of the Argentine.
- The person eating cauliflower is not the Chinese.
- The person eating pumpkin is not to the right of the person driving the bus.

### Step 2: Analyze and Assign Values

#### Step 2.1: Position of the Owner of the Guinea-Pig
- From constraint 2, the person driving the motorbike is the owner of the guinea-pig.
- From constraint 4, the owner of the guinea-pig is in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Therefore, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2.2: Position of the Person Driving the Boat
- From constraint 9, the person driving the boat is the owner of the horse.
- From constraint 10, the person driving the boat is on the far right.
- Therefore, the person driving the boat is in position 4.

#### Step 2.3: Position of the Person Watching Satire Movies
- From constraint 7, the person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right.
- Since position 4 is already occupied by the person driving the boat, the person watching satire movies must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the person watching satire movies is in position 1.

#### Step 2.4: Position of the Owner of the Guinea-Pig
- From constraint 1, the person eating watermelon and the owner of the guinea-pig have the same parity positions.
- Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 1 (odd), the person eating watermelon must also be in position 1.
- However, position 1 is already taken by the person watching satire movies.
- Therefore, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 3.

#### Step 2.5: Position of the Person Eating Watermelon
- From constraint 8, the person eating watermelon is somewhere to the right of the person eating nectarine.
- From constraint 1, the person eating watermelon and the owner of the guinea-pig have the same parity positions.
- Therefore, the person eating watermelon must be in position 4 (since position 3 is taken by the owner of the guinea-pig).

#### Step 2.6: Position of the Person Eating Nectarine
- From constraint 8, the person eating watermelon is somewhere to the right of the person eating nectarine.
- Therefore, the person eating nectarine must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since position 1 is taken by the person watching satire movies, the person eating nectarine must be in position 2.

#### Step 2.7: Position of the Person Eating Pear
- From constraint 3, the person eating pear is not the person driving the skateboard.
- From constraint 5, the person watching romance movies is not to the right of the person eating pear.
- Therefore, the person eating pear must be in position 3 (since position 4 is taken by the person eating watermelon).

#### Step 2.8: Position of the Person Watching Romance Movies
- From constraint 5, the person watching romance movies is not to the right of the person eating pear.
- Therefore, the person watching romance movies must be in position 1 (since position 3 is taken by the person eating pear and position 4 is taken by the person eating watermelon).

#### Step 2.9: Position of the Person Driving the Skateboard
- From constraint 13, the person driving the skateboard and the person watching disaster movies have the same parity positions.
- From constraint 14, the person driving the skateboard is not to the left of the person eating pear.
- Therefore, the person driving the skateboard must be in position 4 (since position 3 is taken by the person eating watermelon and position 1 is taken by the person watching satire movies).

#### Step 2.10: Position of the Person Watching Disaster Movies
- From constraint 12, the person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies.
- Therefore, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 2 (since position 3 is taken by the person eating pear and position 4 is taken by the person driving the skateboard).

#### Step 2.11: Position of the Person Driving the Jet-Ski
- From constraint 15, the owner of the mouse is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person eating watermelon.

2. The person whose sport is volleyball does not drink Fanta.
3. The owner of the ferret is between the person whose sport is climbing and the person drinking Mirinda.
4. The person whose sport is climbing is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.
5. The owner of the dog and the Japanese have different parity positions (i.e., if one is in an odd position, the other is in an even position).
6. The person whose sport is weightlifting is not to the right of the Chinese.
7. The person drinking Sprite is not to the left of the Japanese.
8. The person whose sport is climbing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda.

14. The person drinking Sprite is not to the left of the person drinking Sprite.
15. The person whose sport is Climbing is on the left of the person drinking Sprite.
16. The Russian is not to the left of the person drinking Hot-Chocolate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The Colombian is on the far left or far right.
   - Let's assume the Colombian is in position 1 for now (we can check later if it needs to be 4).

2. **Clue 2**: The person whose sport is volleyball does not drink Fanta.
   - This means the person with volleyball cannot be in position 1 or 4 if Fanta is there.

3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the ferret is between the person whose sport is climbing and the person drinking Mirinda.
   - This implies that the positions of the ferret, climbing, and Mirinda must be consecutive.

4. **Clue 4**: The person whose sport is climbing is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.
   - This means the owner of the dog cannot be in the first position if the climbing person is to the left of him.

5. **Clue 5**: The owner of the dog and the Japanese have different parity positions.
   - If the owner of the dog is in an odd position, the Japanese must be in an even position, and vice versa.

6. **Clue 6**: The person whose sport is weightlifting is not to the right of the Chinese.
   - This means the Chinese must be in a position to the right of the weightlifter.

7. **Clue 7**: The person drinking Sprite is not to the left of the Japanese.
   - This means the Japanese cannot be in position 1 if the Sprite drinker is in position 2 or 3.

8. **Clue 8**: The person whose sport is climbing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda.
   - This reinforces Clue 3.

9. **Clue 9**: The Japanese is between the person whose sport is weightlifting and the person drinking Hot-Chocolate.
   - This means the Japanese is in a position between the weightlifter and the Hot-Chocolate drinker.

10. **Clue 10**: The person drinking Hot-Chocolate is between the Japanese and the owner of the Rat.
    - This means the Japanese must be in a position to the left of the Hot-Chocolate drinker, and the owner of the Rat to the right.

11. **Clue 11**: The Japanese is on the left or right of the person drinking Hot-Chocolate.
    - This is consistent with Clue 10.

12. **Clue 12**: The person drinking Sprite is not to the left of the Japanese.
    - This means the Japanese cannot be in position 1 if the Sprite drinker is in position 2 or 3.

13. **Clue 13**: The owner of the Frog is on the left of the person whose sport is Volleyball.
    - This means the Volleyball person cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the Frog owner is in position 1.

14. **Clue 14**: The person drinking Sprite is not to the left of the person drinking Sprite.
    - This is a tautology and doesn't provide new information.

15. **Clue 15**: The person whose sport is Climbing is on the left of the person drinking Sprite.
    - This means the Sprite drinker must be to the right of the Climber.

16. **Clue 16**: The Russian is not to the left of the person drinking Hot-Chocolate.
    - This means the Russian cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the Hot-Chocolate drinker is in position 3 or 4.

This configuration satisfies all the given clues."
Lv9-4x4-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct placement of each attribute (beverage, job, movie genre, pet) for each person.

Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions:

### Clues Summary:
1. Lemonade is to the right of superhero.
2. Comedy is to the left of crime.
3. Fanta and police officer have different parity positions.
4. Manager is next to hamster.
5. Manager is not comedy.
6. Designer and crime have the same parity positions.
7. Designer is between horse and lemonade.
8. Police officer is not to the left of superhero.
9. Almond milk is not crime.
10. Tea is not to the right of librarian.
11. Goldfish is not lemonade.
12. Designer and crime have the same parity positions (redundant with clue 6).
13. Designer drinks fanta.
14. Librarian is to the right of police officer.
15. Cat is not to the left of almond milk.
16. Lemonade is to the left of designer.
17. Superhero is not cat.
18. Hamster is to the left of fanta.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Designer drinks fanta** (clue 13).
2. **Manager is next to hamster** (clue 4).
3. **Manager is not comedy** (clue 5).
4. **Designer and crime have the same parity positions** (clue 6/12).
5. **Designer is between horse and lemonade** (clue 7).

Since the designer is between horse and lemonade, and the designer drinks fanta, the designer must be in position 2 (since 1 and 3 would violate the ""between"" condition). So:
- Position 2: Designer, fanta

Since the designer is between horse and lemonade, and the designer is in position 2, the horse must be in position 1 and lemonade in position 3. So:
- Position 1: Horse
- Position 3: Lemonade

Since the designer is in position 2 and drinks fanta, and the designer and crime have the same parity positions, the designer cannot be in an odd position, so crime must also be in an even position. Since designer is in position 2, crime must be in position 4. So:
- Position 4: Crime

Now, let's place the remaining attributes:
- Position 1: Horse
- Position 2: Designer, fanta
- Position 3: Lemonade
- Position 4: Crime

Since the designer is in position 2, the manager must be in position 3 or 4. But since the manager is not comedy (clue 5), and the manager is next to the hamster (clue 4), the manager must be in position 3 and the hamster in position 4. So:
- Position 3: Manager
- Position 4: Hamster

Now we have:
- Position 1: Horse
- Position 2: Designer, fanta
- Position 3: Manager
- Position 4: Hamster, Crime

Next, we need to place the remaining attributes (librarian, police officer, tea, goldfish, cat):
- **Librarian is to the right of police officer** (clue 14).
- **Tea is not to the right of librarian** (clue 10).
- **Goldfish is not lemonade** (clue 11).
- **Almond milk is not crime** (clue 9).
- **Lemonade is to the left of designer** (clue 16).

Since the designer is in position 2 and drinks fanta, and lemonade is in position 3, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1. So:
- Position 1: Person drinking lemonade

Since the designer is in position 2, the manager is in position 3, and the hamster is in position 4, the only positions left are 1 and 4. The person drinking lemonade is in position 1, and the person drinking tea must be in position 4 (since tea is not to the right of the librarian and the librarian is to the right of the police officer). So:
- Position 1: Person drinking lemonade
- Position 4: Police officer, tea

Since the librarian is to the right of the police officer, the librarian must be in position 3. So:
- Position 3: Librarian

Finally, the only pet left is the goldfish, which must be in position 2. So:
- Position 2: Goldfish

Now, we have all the positions filled:
- Position 1: Person drinking lemonade
- Position 2: Goldfish
- Position 3: Librarian
- Position 4: Police officer, tea

This is the final solution based on the given clues."
Lv9-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Analyze Clues

**Clue 1:** The person eating broccoli and the nurse have different parity positions.
- Broccoli and Nurse have different positions (odd/even).

**Clue 2:** The bartender is somewhere to the left of the person eating broccoli.
- Bartender < Broccoli

**Clue 3:** The person eating grapefruit and the person whose sport is baseball have different parity positions.
- Grapefruit and Baseball have different positions.

**Clue 4:** The pilot is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is cricket.
- Pilot < Cricket

**Clue 5:** The person eating nectarine is not to the left of the person whose sport is baseball.
- Nectarine > Baseball

**Clue 6:** The bartender and the owner of the goat have different parity positions.
- Bartender and Goat have different positions.

**Clue 7:** The nurse is not to the left of the owner of the goat.
- Nurse > Goat

**Clue 8:** The person whose sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person whose sport is cricket.
- Cricket < Snowboarding

**Clue 9:** The owner of the mouse is not the pilot.
- Mouse ≠ Pilot

**Clue 10:** The pilot is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is sailing.
- Sailing < Pilot

**Clue 11:** The person eating nectarine is the person whose sport is cricket.
- Nectarine = Cricket

**Clue 12:** The person eating grapefruit is not to the left of the owner of the fish.
- Fish > Grapefruit

**Clue 13:** The owner of the fish is on the left of the person eating garlic.
- Fish < Garlic

**Clue 14:** The owner of the hamster is somewhere between the owner of the mouse and the person whose sport is baseball.
- Mouse < Hamster < Baseball

### Step 2: Deduce Positions

1. **Clue 11:** Nectarine = Cricket. So, Cricket is in position 4 (since it's the only one that can be nectarine).
2. **Clue 4 & 10:** Since Cricket is in position 4, Sailing must be in position 1 or 2. But since Pilot is to the right of Sailing, Pilot cannot be in position 1. So, Sailing must be in position 2, and Pilot must be in position 3 or 4. But since Cricket is in position 4, Pilot must be in position 3.
3. **Clue 8:** Since Cricket is in position 4 and Snowboarding is to the right, Snowboarding must be in position 4, but Cricket is already there, so this clue doesn't change anything.
4. **Clue 12:** Since Fish > Grapefruit, and Fish is not in position 1 (because Pilot is there), Fish must be in position 3, and Grapefruit must be in position 1.
5. **Clue 13:** Since Fish is in position 3 and Garlic is to the right, Garlic must be in position 4.
6. **Clue 14:** Since Mouse is not the pilot (Clue 9) and Hamster is between Mouse and Baseball, and since Pilot is in position 3, Mouse must be in position 1, Hamster in position 2, and Baseball in position 3.
7. **Clue 2:** Since Bartender is to the left of Broccoli, and Broccoli cannot be in position 1 (Grapefruit) or 3 (Baseball), Broccoli must be in position 4, and Bartender must be in position 1.
8. **Clue 6:** Since Bartender (position 1) and Goat have different positions, Goat must be in position 3.
9. **Clue 7:** Since Nurse is not to the left of Goat, Nurse must be in position 4.
10. **Clue 3:** Since Grapefruit (position 1) and Baseball (position 3) have different positions, this is consistent.
11. **Clue 5:** Since Nectarine (Cricket, position 4) is not to the left of Baseball (position 3), this is consistent.
12. **Clue 9:** Since Mouse is not the pilot (position 3), this is consistent.
13. **Clue 1:** Since Broccoli (position 4) and Nurse (position 4) have the same position, they have the same parity (even). This is consistent.

5. **Clue 15**: The person eating Lemon is on the left of the person eating Carrot. So, Lemon is at position 1 and Carrot is at position 2.

6. **Clue 16**: The person eating Cauliflower is somewhere to the right of the person eating Carrot. So, Cauliflower is at position 3.

7. **Clue 4**: The person drinking Coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Milk. Since we know the positions of Lemon, Carrot, and Cauliflower, Milk must be at position 4 and Coffee at position 3.

8. **Clue 8**: The person drinking Milk is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Soy-milk. Since Milk is at position 4, Soy-milk must be at position 1.

9. **Clue 14**: The person watching Mystery movies is not the person drinking Soy-milk. Since Soy-milk is at position 1, Mystery cannot be at position 1. Let's place Mystery at position 2.

10. **Clue 5**: The person watching Disaster movies and the person eating Grapefruit have the same parity positions. Since Mystery is at position 2, Disaster cannot be at position 2. So, Disaster must be at position 4 and Grapefruit at position 2.

11. **Clue 6**: The fan of Funk is somewhere between the person watching Disaster movies and the person eating Carrot. Since Disaster is at position 4 and Carrot is at position 2, Funk must be at position 3.

15. **Clue 2**: The person eating Cauliflower is somewhere to the right of the person eating Carrot. Since Carrot is at position 2 and Cauliflower is at position 3, this is satisfied.

16. **Clue 17**: The person watching Disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Coffee. Since Disaster is at position 4 and Coffee is at position 3, this is satisfied.

17. **Clue 9**: The fan of Funk is not to the right of the person eating Cauliflower. Since Funk is at position 3 and Cauliflower is at position 3, this is satisfied.

```

### Applying Clues:

1. **Clue 9:** The person watching sports movies is on the far right (position 4).
2. **Clue 13:** The person watching sports movies is in an even position (position 2).

So, the person watching sports movies is in position 2.

```
|               |     1     |    2    |      3       |      4       |

```

3. **Clue 11:** The person whose sport is handball is on the right of the person eating avocado.

Since the person in position 4 is eating snowboarding, the person in position 3 must be eating avocado and the person in position 4 is doing handball.

```
|               |     1     |    2    |      3       |      4       |

```

4. **Clue 5:** The person whose sport is surfing is the person eating avocado. This means the person in position 3 is eating avocado.

So, the person in position 1 is eating something else, and the person in position 2 is eating something else.

```

```

13. **Clue 8:** The Italian is not to the left of the person watching sports movies.
