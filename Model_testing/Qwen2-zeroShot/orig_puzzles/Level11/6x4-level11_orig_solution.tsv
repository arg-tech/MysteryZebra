### Initial Setup:
Let's set up the table with placeholders for each category.

```

```

### Solving the Clues:

1. **Clue 2**: The person driving the subway is on the far left (position 1).
2. **Clue 3**: The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person driving the subway (position 2).
3. **Clue 7**: The person driving the subway is not the person watching time-travel movies (position 1 cannot be time-travel).

Thus, the person in position 1 is driving the subway and not watching time-travel movies. This leaves positions 2, 3, and 4 for the remaining jobs and preferences.

4. **Clue 12**: The American is somewhere between the owner of the rabbit and the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the subway is in position 1, the American must be in position 3 or 4, and the owner of the rabbit must be in position 2 or 4.
5. **Clue 10**: The person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. So, if the owner of the rabbit is in position 2, the person watching musical movies must be in position 3 or 4.
6. **Clue 13**: The person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the firefighter. This means the firefighter can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
7. **Clue 14**: The chef is the person watching musical movies or the chef is the fan rock, but not both. If the chef is the person watching musical movies, they must be in position 3 or 4.
8. **Clue 15**: The fan punk is the American or the fan punk is the firefighter or both. This means the fan punk must be in position 3 or 4.
9. **Clue 16**: The fan hip-hop is on the left of the owner of the frog. So, the owner of the frog must be in position 3 or 4, and the fan hip-hop must be in position 1 or 2.
10. **Clue 17**: The firefighter is the person driving the trike or the firefighter is the owner of the cat or both. This means the firefighter can be in position 2, 3, or 4.

24. **Clue 24**: The person watching action movies and the pilot have different parity positions.
25. **Clue 25**: The pilot is not the person watching scientific movies.

### Applying Clues:

#### Clue 22 and 25:
- The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the far left or far right.
- The pilot is not the person watching scientific movies.
- Since the person whose hobby is filmmaking is either in position 1 or 4, and the pilot cannot be in position 4, the pilot must be in position 1 and the person whose hobby is filmmaking is in position 4.

#### Clue 9 and 22:
- The fan d&b is on the far left or far right.
- Given that the pilot is in position 1, the fan d&b must be in position 4 (since the person whose hobby is filmmaking is in position 4).

#### Clue 6 and 22:
- The person whose hobby is filmmaking is the writer.
- Therefore, the writer is in position 4.

#### Clue 15:
- The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the writer.
- Therefore, the owner of the goldfish is in position 3.

#### Clue 18:
- The person whose hobby is writing is between the person watching spy movies and the owner of the snake.
- Since the writer is in position 4, the person watching spy movies must be in position 1 or 2, and the owner of the snake must be in position 2 or 3. But since the owner of the goldfish is in position 3, the owner of the snake must be in position 2.

#### Clue 17:
- The owner of the rat is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
- The person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 3, so the owner of the rat is in position 2.

#### Clue 16:
- The person eating watermelon is not the person whose hobby is writing.
- Therefore, the person eating watermelon must be in position 1 or 3. Since the owner of the rat is in position 2 and the owner of the goldfish is in position 3, the person eating watermelon must be in position 1.

#### Clue 11 and 13:
- The person whose hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is chess.
- The person whose hobby is chess is on the right of the fan hip-hop.
- The person whose hobby is chess is on the right of the person eating pepper.
- The person eating pepper and the fan hip-hop have the same parity positions (both odd or both even).
- The person eating pepper is in position 1 (odd), so the fan hip-hop must also be in position 1 (odd). This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the positions.

#### Re-evaluating positions:
- The person whose hobby is chess is in position 3, and the fan hip-hop is in position 1.
- The person eating pepper is in position 3, and the fan hip-hop is in position 1.

#### Final Positions:
- Position 1: Fan hip-hop, eating pepper
- Position 2: Owner of the rat, watching martial-arts movies
- Position 3: Fan punk, eating watermelon
- Position 4: Writer, owning goldfish, watching spy movies

- From Clue 13, the Nigerian is the person who's sport is golf.
- From Clue 14, the Nigerian and the person who's sport is golf have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
- From Clue 15, the fan punk is somewhere to the left of the Nigerian.
- From Clue 25, the fan punk is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.
- Since the Nigerian is golf, the fan punk must be to the right of the person watching action movies and to the left of the Nigerian.
- This means the Nigerian cannot be in position 1, as that would place the fan punk in an invalid position.
- Thus, the Nigerian must be in position 2 or 4.

#### Step 2: Determine the Turkish and the person watching western movies:
- From Clue 10, the Turkish is on the left of the Nigerian.
- From Clue 24, the person watching western movies is not to the left of the Nigerian.

#### Step 3: Determine the person who's sport is skiing:
- From Clue 3, the person who's sport is skiing is either the Russian or the person watching action movies.
