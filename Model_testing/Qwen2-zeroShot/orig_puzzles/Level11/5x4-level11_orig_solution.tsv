   - **Action Movies (Constraint 1):** Not to the right of Adventure Movies.
   - **Fan Punk (Constraint 2, Constraint 6, Constraint 20):** To the right of Cat Owner, left of Fan Metal, and right of Turtle Owner.

   - **Climbing (Constraint 13, Constraint 14, Constraint 15):** Horror or Fan Punk, Folk or Climbing, Climbing or Cat Owner.

### Filling the Table:

Let's start with some logical deductions:

1. **Epic Movies must be at position 1 or 4.**
2. **Horror Movies must be to the left of Adventure Movies.**
3. **Action Movies cannot be at position 4.**

From these, let's place Epic Movies at position 1:

|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |     4     |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Food          |          |            |          |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic     |            |          |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |          |           |
| Pet           |          |            |          |           |
| Sport         |          |            |          |           |

Now, Horror must be before Adventure:

|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |     4     |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Food          |          |            |          |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Horror     | Adventure |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |          |           |
| Pet           |          |            |          |           |
| Sport         |          |            |          |           |

Since Action cannot be at position 4, it can only be at positions 2 or 3. Let’s place Action at position 2:

|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |     4     |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Food          |          |            |          |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Horror     | Adventure |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |          |           |
| Pet           |          |            |          |           |
| Sport         |          | Action     |          |           |

Now, Adventure must be after Horror, so it must be at position 3:

|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |     4     |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Food          |          |            |          |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Horror     | Adventure |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |          |           |
| Pet           |          |            |          |           |
| Sport         |          | Action     |          |           |

### Continuing with Other Constraints:

1. **Fan Punk (Constraint 2, Constraint 6, Constraint 20):** To the right of Cat Owner, left of Fan Metal, and right of Turtle Owner.
2. **Fan Country (Constraint 3, Constraint 5):** Right of Action Movies, left of Broccoli Eater.
3. **Cat Owner (Constraint 8, Constraint 12):** Not Parkour, Goat Owner or Action Movie.
4. **Goat Owner (Constraint 10, Constraint 12):** Not Action Movie, Plum Eater.
5. **Pony Owner (Constraint 11):** Not Action Movie.
6. **Biathlon (Constraint 7):** Left of Plum Eater.
7. **Ice-Hockey (Constraint 9):** Action Movie or Apple Eater.
8. **Plum Eater (Constraint 7, Constraint 17):** Biathlon or different parity from Apple Eater.
9. **Parkour (Constraint 8):** Not Cat Owner.
10. **Climbing (Constraint 13, Constraint 14, Constraint 15):** Horror or Fan Punk, Folk or Climbing, Climbing or Cat Owner.

### Final Placement:

Based on all the constraints, the final table is:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |     4     |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Food          | Apple    | Broccoli   | Peas     | Plum      |

| Music-Genre   | Folk     | Metal      | Country  | Punk      |
| Pet           | Goat     | Cat        | Pony     | Turtle    |
| Sport         | Biathlon| Ice-Hockey | Climbing | Parkour   |
```
