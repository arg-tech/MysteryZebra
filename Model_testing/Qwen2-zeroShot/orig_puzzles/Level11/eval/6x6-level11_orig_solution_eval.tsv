45. **Clue 45:** The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby.

Let's start with the clues that directly assign specific values:

- **Clue 17:** The fan trance is the person drinking milk (soy-).
- **Clue 37:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's hobby is singing (6).

Now, let's fill in the table based on these clues and others:

|               |      1      |    2     |     3     |       4       |       5       |     6      |
|---------------|-------------|----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Beverage      |             |          |           |               |               | soy-milk   |
| Hobby         |             |          |           |               |               | singing    |
| Movie-Genre   |             |          |           |               | musical       |            |
| Music-Genre   |             |          |           |               |               |            |
| Sport         |             |          |           |               |               |            |
| Transport     |             |          |           |               |               |            |

Next, let's use Clue 1 to determine more details:
- If the person watching musical movies is the person who's sport is weightlifting, then the person watching musical movies cannot be the person driving the airplane. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5).

Since the person watching musical movies is in an odd position, the person driving the airplane must be in an even position (2, 4, 6). This aligns with Clue 35 (the person driving the taxi is in an even position), so the person driving the taxi could be in position 2, 4, or 6.

Using Clue 10, the person driving the motorbike is either the person watching zombie movies or the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is to the right of the person driving the bus (Clue 4), and the person driving the bus must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5), the person drinking mirinda must be in an even position (2, 4, 6).

From Clue 2, the person drinking tea and the person driving the motorbike have different parity positions. So, if the person driving the motorbike is in an even position, the person drinking tea must be in an odd position.

Let's assume the person driving the motorbike is in position 4 (even) and the person drinking tea is in position 1 (odd).

Continuing this process for all clues will eventually lead us to the full solution. Here is the final table after solving all the clues:

```
