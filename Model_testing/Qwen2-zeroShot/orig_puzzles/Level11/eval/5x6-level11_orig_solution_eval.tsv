### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Clue 34: The social-worker drinks water.
\[ \text{Social-worker} \rightarrow \text{Water} \]

#### Clue 36: The social-worker is on the far left or far right.
Since the social-worker is the one drinking water, we can place them at either position 1 or 6.

Since photography is in an odd position (Clue 18), reading must be in an even position.

#### Clue 18: The person who's hobby is photography is in an odd position.
Let's assume photography is in position 1 for now:
\[ \text{Photography} \rightarrow 1 \]
\[ \text{Reading} \rightarrow 2, 4, 6 \]

Since the social-worker is in position 1 or 6, and they drink water, they must be in position 1.

This places the electrician in position 1 or 3, and the person who's hobby is baking in position 4 or 6.
