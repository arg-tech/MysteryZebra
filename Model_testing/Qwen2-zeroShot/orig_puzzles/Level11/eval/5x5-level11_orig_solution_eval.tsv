1. **Clue 18** and **Clue 19**: 
   - The person whose sport is tennis is on the far left (Position 1).

   - Clue 1: The person driving the tram is the fisherman or the person whose sport is skateboarding or both.
   - Clue 9: The fisherman is the person driving the quad-bike or the Russian is the fisherman or both.
   
   Since the fisherman must be in an even position (Clue 26), let's place the fisherman in position 2 or 4. Let's test these positions:
   
   - If the fisherman is in position 2, then the person driving the tram could be either the fisherman (position 2) or the person whose sport is skateboarding.
   - If the fisherman is in position 4, then the person driving the tram could be either the fisherman (position 4) or the person whose sport is skateboarding.

   - Position 2: Fisherman
   - Clue 1: The person driving the tram could be the fisherman or the person whose sport is skateboarding.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 14:** The fan punk is on the far left.
   - Fan Punk: 1 (leftmost position)

2. **Clue 1:** The fan blues is not the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - This doesn't give us immediate positions but will help later.

3. **Clue 2:** The fan folk is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing or the fan folk is the person eating avocado or both.
   - This means either the fan folk has rock-climbing as a hobby, or eats avocado, or both.

4. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is gardening is in an odd position (4).
   - Hobby Gardening: 4

5. **Clue 4:** The person driving the roller is not to the left of the person eating plum.
   - If the person eating plum is to the right of the person driving the roller, then the person eating plum cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the roller is in position 1 or 2.

6. **Clue 5:** The fan gospel and the person who's hobby is gardening have different parity positions.
   - Since gardening is in position 4 (even), the fan gospel must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

7. **Clue 6:** The fan punk is the person eating pomegranate or the fan punk is the person who's hobby is drawing or both.
   - Since the fan punk is already in position 1, this means the fan punk could be eating pomegranate or have drawing as a hobby, or both.

    - This means the fan blues cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the scooter is in position 1 or 2.

13. **Clue 12:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the fan gospel have the same parity positions.
    - Since the fan gospel is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and rock-climbing is in an even position (2 or 4), this is impossible. So, we need to revisit and adjust our assumptions.

14. **Clue 13:** The person watching disaster movies and the person eating avocado have the same parity positions.
