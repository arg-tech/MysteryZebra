Lv11-7x7-8	"To solve this complex logic puzzle, we will use the given constraints step-by-step to fill in the table. Let's start with the known constraints and build from there.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Engineer and Kiwi (1):**
   - The engineer and the person eating kiwi have different parity positions.
   - This means one is in an odd position and the other is in an even position.

2. **Garlic (4):**
   - The person eating garlic is in an odd position.
   - Therefore, Garlic must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. **Jazz (7):**
   - The fan jazz is the person who's hobby is woodworking or the fan jazz is the person watching time-travel movies or both.
   - This means the fan jazz could be the person with the hobby woodworking or watching time-travel movies, or both.

4. **Social-Worker and Collecting (14):**
   - The social-worker and the person who's hobby is collecting have the same parity positions.
   - This means they are either both in odd positions or both in even positions.

5. **Skiing (15):**
   - The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
   - This means if the person with the hobby woodworking is in position X, the person who's sport is skiing is in position X-1 or X+1.

6. **Milk (16):**
   - The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the fan jazz.
   - This means the fan jazz cannot be in position 7, and the person drinking milk must be in a position greater than the fan jazz.

7. **Soy-Milk (17):**
   - The person drinking soy-milk is in an odd position.
   - Therefore, Soy-Milk must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

8. **Hot-Chocolate (18):**
   - The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - This means the person who's hobby is singing is in a position less than the person drinking hot-chocolate.

9. **Pomegranate (19):**
   - The person drinking milk is not to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
   - This means the person eating pomegranate is in a position before the person drinking milk.

10. **Tea (20):**
