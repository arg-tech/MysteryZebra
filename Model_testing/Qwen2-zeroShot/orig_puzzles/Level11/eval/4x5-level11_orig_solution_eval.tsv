Lv11-4x5-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Initial Setup:
We need to place the five different foods, jobs, music genres, and transport methods into the five positions (1 through 5).

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of blues is not to the right of the fan of reggae.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the tram is on the far left (position 1).
3. **Clue 3:** The person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike (position 5).
4. **Clue 4:** The person driving the tram is in an odd position (position 1 or 3 or 5).
5. **Clue 5:** The fan of house is on the left of the photographer.
6. **Clue 6:** The person driving the tram is not to the left of the designer.
7. **Clue 7:** The person driving the subway is not to the left of the writer.
8. **Clue 8:** The person eating pineapple is the journalist.
9. **Clue 9:** The person eating pineapple is the fan of jazz or the person eating pineapple is the firefighter, but not both.
10. **Clue 10:** The journalist is in the middle (position 3).
11. **Clue 11:** The person eating spinach is not to the left of the person eating raspberry.
12. **Clue 12:** The fan of house is not to the left of the person driving the bike.
13. **Clue 13:** The person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the designer.
14. **Clue 14:** The person driving the subway is the writer.
15. **Clue 15:** The person eating papaya is on the left of the fan of reggae.
16. **Clue 16:** The person eating spinach is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
17. **Clue 17:** The person eating spinach is in an even position.
18. **Clue 18:** The firefighter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the trike.
19. **Clue 19:** The fan of blues is not to the right of the person eating raspberry.
20. **Clue 20:** The firefighter is the person driving the subway or the firefighter is the fan of house or both.
21. **Clue 21:** The person driving the quad-bike and the writer have different parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1:**
   - From Clue 2, the person driving the tram is in position 1.
   - From Clue 4, the person driving the tram is in an odd position (so it must be position 1).

2. **Position 3:**
   - From Clue 10, the journalist is in position 3.
   - From Clue 8, the person eating pineapple is the journalist, so the person eating pineapple is in position 3.

3. **Position 5:**
   - From Clue 3, the person eating pineapple is to the left of the person driving the bike, so the person driving the bike is in position 5.
   - From Clue 12, the fan of house is not to the left of the person driving the bike, so the fan of house cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the person driving the bike is in position 5, the fan of house must be in position 4.

4. **Position 4:**
   - The fan of house is in position 4.
   - From Clue 1, the fan of blues is not to the right of the fan of reggae, so the fan of blues must be in position 2 or 1 (but position 1 is taken by the person driving the tram), so the fan of blues is in position 2.
   - From Clue 15, the person eating papaya is on the left of the fan of reggae, so the person eating papaya is in position 1 (which is already taken by the person driving the tram) or position 2 (which is taken by the fan of blues). Therefore, the fan of reggae must be in position 2, and the person eating papaya is in position 1.

5. **Position 2:**
   - The fan of blues is in position 2.
   - The fan of reggae is in position 2 (this is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate).

Re-evaluating:
- The fan of blues is in position 2.
- The fan of reggae must be in position 4 (since it cannot be to the right of the fan of blues).

6. **Position 1:**
   - The person driving the tram is in position 1.
   - The person eating papaya is in position 1.

7. **Position 4:**

20. **Chinchilla and Pony**: The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the owner of the pony.
21. **Rock-Climbing and Argentine**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the left of the Argentine.
22. **Fish and Sub or Russian**: The owner of the fish is the Russian or the person driving the subway is the owner of the fish or both.
23. **Scooter and Subway**: The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway.
24. **Bus and Russian**: The Russian is not to the left of the person driving the bus.
25. **Fish and Far Left/Right**: The owner of the fish is on the far left or far right.
26. **Fish and Far Left/Right**: The owner of the fish is on the far left or far right (redundant).
27. **Italian and Traveling**: The Italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person who's hobby is traveling.

### Step 2: Assign Positions and Solve
We will start with the known positions and work through the clues:

1. **Owner of Chinchilla (Argentine)**: Clue 10 tells us that the owner of the chinchilla is the Argentine. This gives us:
   - Position 1: Argentine (Chinchilla)
   
2. **Person Driving Tram (Australian)**: Clue 12 tells us that the person driving the tram is the Australian. This gives us:
   - Position 4: Australian (Tram)
   
3. **Person Driving Tram in Even Position**: Clue 15 tells us that the person driving the tram is in an even position. Since position 4 is even, this confirms the previous assignment.
   
4. **Italian on Right of Rock-Climbing**: Clue 27 tells us that the Italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person who's hobby is traveling. This gives us:
   - Position 3: Italian (Traveling)
   - Position 2: Rock-Climbing (Unknown)

5. **Filmmaking and Drawing Parity**: Clue 14 tells us that the owner of the chinchilla (Argentine) and the person whose hobby is drawing have the same parity positions. Since the Argentine is in position 1 (odd), the person whose hobby is drawing must also be in an odd position. Therefore, the drawing person cannot be in position 4 (even).

6. **Owner of Horse in Odd Position**: Clue 5 tells us that the owner of the horse is in an odd position. This gives us:
   - Position 1, 3, or 5: Horse (Unknown)

7. **Fish and Not Left of Tram**: Clue 4 tells us that the owner of the fish is not to the left of the person driving the tram. Since the person driving the tram is in position 4, the owner of the fish cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the owner of the fish must be in position 5.

8. **Owner of Fish (Russian)**: Clue 22 tells us that the owner of the fish is the Russian or the person driving the subway is the owner of the fish or both. Since the person driving the subway cannot be the owner of the fish (Clue 23), the owner of the fish must be the Russian. This gives us:
   - Position 5: Russian (Fish)

9. **Owner of Pony (Argentine or Van Driver)**: Clue 6 tells us that the Argentine is the owner of the pony or the person driving the van is the Argentine or both. Since the Argentine is already assigned to position 1 (chinchilla), the person driving the van must be in position 5 (Russian). Therefore, the owner of the pony must be in position 2 or 3.

10. **Person Driving Scooter**: Clue 23 tells us that the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the subway is in position 4, the person driving the scooter must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

11. **Person Driving Bus**: Clue 24 tells us that the Russian is not to the left of the person driving the bus. Since the Russian is in position 5, the person driving the bus cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the person driving the bus must be in position 4 (tram), which contradicts our earlier assignment. This means we need to re-evaluate.

12. **Final Assignments**:
   - Position 1: Argentine (Chinchilla)
   - Position 2: Italian (Traveling)
   - Position 3: Rock-Climbing (Unknown)
   - Position 4: Australian (Tram)
   - Position 5: Russian (Fish)

13. **Pet Assignment**:
   - Position 1: Argentine (Chinchilla)
   - Position 2: Italian (Traveling)
   - Position 3: Rock-Climbing (Horse)
   - Position 4: Australian (Tram)
   - Position 5: Russian (Fish)

14. **Nationality Assignment**:
   - Position 1: Argentine
   - Position 2: Italian
   - Position 3: Rock-Climbing
   - Position 4: Australian
   - Position 5: Russian

15. **Hobby Assignment**:
   - Position 1: Chinchilla
   - Position 2: Traveling
   - Position 3: Rock-Climbing
   - Position 4: Tram
   - Position 5: Fish

16. **Transport Assignment**:
   - Position 1: Chinchilla
   - Position 2: Traveling
   - Position 3: Rock-Climbing
   - Position 4: Tram
   - Position 5: Fish

Lv11-4x5-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Given Constraints:**
   - Manager is somewhere between the fan disco and the person driving the boat.
   - Teacher is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.
   - Fan salsa is the project-manager or the project-manager is the person watching disaster movies, but not both.
   - The person watching disaster movies is on the far left.
   - Journalist is somewhere to the right of the person watching crime movies.
   - Fan disco and the manager have different parity positions.
   - The teacher is not to the left of the fan rock.
   - The teacher and the person driving the boat have the same parity positions.
   - The person driving the ship is on the left of the fan disco.
   - The person driving the van is the fan rock.
   - The fan rock is somewhere to the left of the person watching crime movies.
   - The fan electronic is in an odd position.
   - The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies.
   - The fan disco is not to the left of the person watching crime movies.
   - The person driving the ship is the fan ambient.
   - The journalist is on the left or right of the project-manager.
   - The teacher is the person driving the ship or the teacher is the person watching disaster movies.
   - The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies.
   - The fan electronic is not to the right of the manager.
   - The fan salsa is the person driving the motorbike or the person watching romance movies is the fan salsa.
   - The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the teacher.
   - The person driving the van is on the far left.
   - The journalist is the person driving the boat or the journalist is the person watching romance movies.
   - The teacher is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
   - The teacher is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.
   - The nurse is on the left or right of the person driving the ship.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - We need to place each job, movie genre, music genre, and transport in the correct cell.
   - Let's start with the fixed positions:
     - **Job 1 (Far Left):** The person watching disaster movies.
     - **Job 5 (Far Right):** The person driving the van, who is the fan rock.

3. **Deductions:**
   - Since the person watching disaster movies is on the far left, let's denote it as `Disaster` in Job 1.
   - The person driving the van (Job 5) is the fan rock.
   - The person driving the van (Job 5) is on the far left, so this conflicts with the person watching disaster movies being on the far left. This means the person watching disaster movies must be in Job 2, and the person driving the van (fan rock) must be in Job 5.
   - The teacher is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the teacher cannot be in Job 1 (disaster), and the person driving the van (fan rock) is in Job 5, the teacher must be in Job 2, 3, or 4.
   - The person driving the boat and the teacher have the same parity positions. If the teacher is in an even position, the person driving the boat must be in an even position. If the teacher is in an odd position, the person driving the boat must be in an odd position.
   - The person driving the ship is the fan ambient and is on the left of the fan disco. This means the fan ambient must be in Job 1 or 2, and the fan disco must be in Job 3 or 4.
   - The fan rock (person driving the van) is in Job 5.
   - The person driving the ship (fan ambient) must be in an even position, so it can only be in Job 2 or 4.
   - The fan disco must be on the left of the fan rock, so it can only be in Job 2 or 4.
   - The person driving the ship (fan ambient) and the teacher have the same parity positions. So if the teacher is in an even position, the person driving the ship must be in an even position. If the teacher is in an odd position, the person driving the ship must be in an odd position.

4. **Final Placement:**
   - Let's place the known values first:
     - Job 1: Disaster
     - Job 5: Van (fan rock)
   - Now, let's deduce the rest:
     - Since the teacher is on the left of the person driving the motorbike, and the teacher is not to the left of the fan rock, the teacher must be in Job 2 or 3.
     - The person driving the boat and the teacher have the same parity positions, so if the teacher is in an even position, the person driving the boat must be in an even position. If the teacher is in an odd position, the person driving the boat must be in an odd position.
     - The person driving the ship is the fan ambient, which must be in an even position, so it can only be in Job 2 or 4.
     - The fan disco must be on the left of the fan rock, so it can only be in Job 2 or 4.
     - The fan electronic is in an odd position, so it can only be in Job 3.
     - The journalist is the person driving the boat or the journalist is the person watching romance movies.
     - The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the teacher.
     - The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies.
     - The person driving the van is on the far left, which is already known.
     - The nurse is on the left or right of the person driving the ship.
