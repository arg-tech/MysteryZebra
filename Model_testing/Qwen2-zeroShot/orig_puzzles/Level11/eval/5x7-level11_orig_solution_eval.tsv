```

### Explanation:
- **Clue 56** places the person watching comedy movies either at position 1 or 7. Since the fisherman is not to the left of the owner of the frog (clue 36), the fisherman cannot be at position 1. Thus, the fisherman is at position 7, and the person watching comedy movies is at position 1.
- **Clue 49** indicates that the owner of the horse is between the person watching comedy movies and the analyst. Given the fisherman is at position 7, the person watching comedy movies must be at position 1, and the analyst must be at position 3.
- **Clue 40** and **Clue 57** indicate the owner of the hamster watches crime movies and is not the person eating artichoke. Thus, the owner of the hamster is at position 5, and the person eating artichoke is at position 3.
- **Clue 34** and **Clue 35** indicate the owner of the rabbit is the journalist and is to the left of the person eating asparagus.
- **Clue 18** indicates the person eating apricot is the person drinking coffee or the owner of the rabbit is the person eating apricot. Given the owner of the rabbit is the journalist, the person eating apricot is at position 4, and the person drinking coffee is at position 6.
- **Clue 28** and **Clue 37** place the person drinking lemonade between the owner of the hamster (position 5) and the person drinking water (position 7).
- **Clue 21** and **Clue 27** place the person drinking coffee (position 6) somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit (position 4).
- **Clue 14** and **Clue 22** place the person eating asparagus at position 2, and the person drinking milk at position 3.
- **Clue 33** and **Clue 32** place the person eating lemon at position 2, and the person eating garlic at position 3.
- **Clue 1** and **Clue 10** place the owner of the frog at an odd position (position 3), and the person eating lemon at an even position (position 2).
- **Clue 25** and **Clue 20** place the person eating grapefruit at position 4, and the owner of the goldfish at position 5.
- **Clue 39** and **Clue 44** place the owner of the horse at position 6, and the person drinking milk at position 4.
- **Clue 46** places the teacher at position 1, and the owner of the goat at position 3.
- **Clue 48** places the person drinking coffee (position 6) as the owner of the hamster or the person watching thriller movies. Given the owner of the hamster is the person watching crime movies, the person drinking coffee is the person watching thriller movies.

Thus, the final solution is as provided in the table above."	{'beverage': ['coffee', 'lemonade', 'milk', 'sprite', 'water', 'cola', 'juice'], 'food': ['potato', 'grapefruit', 'asparagus', 'artichoke', 'lemon', 'apricot', 'garlic'], 'job': ['fisherman', 'analyst', 'electrician', 'engineer', 'police-officer', 'journalist', 'teacher'], 'movie-genre': ['thriller', 'comedy', 'crime', 'action', 'family', 'sports', 'romance'], 'pet': ['rabbit', 'goat', 'horse', 'frog', 'goldfish', 'hamster', 'rat']}	True	3	False
