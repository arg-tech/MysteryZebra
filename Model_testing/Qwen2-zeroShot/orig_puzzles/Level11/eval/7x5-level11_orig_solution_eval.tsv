Lv11-7x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given constraints to deduce the correct placement of each category (food, hobby, movie genre, music genre, nationality, pet, and transport) for each position (1 through 5). Let's start by organizing the clues and solving step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 30**: The person eating strawberry is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.
2. **Clue 32**: The Indonesian is not the person watching documentary movies.
3. **Clue 29**: The Colombian is on the right of the person eating strawberry.
4. **Clue 34**: The fan trance is on the far left or far right.
5. **Clue 35**: The fan pop is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies.
6. **Clue 37**: The person watching scientific movies is the owner of the fish or the person driving the helicopter, but not both.
7. **Clue 38**: The person who's hobby is baking is the person watching zombie movies or the owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is baking or both.
8. **Clue 40**: The fan trance is the person driving the train or the fan trance is the person watching scientific movies, but not both.
9. **Clue 41**: The person driving the scooter is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

Let's start placing some elements based on these clues:

- Since the fan trance is on the far left or far right (clue 34), let's assume it's in position 1 for now.
- The person watching scientific movies is the owner of the fish or the person driving the helicopter, but not both (clue 37). This implies that the owner of the fish is not in position 1 because the fan trance is there.
- The person who's hobby is baking is the person watching zombie movies or the owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is baking or both (clue 38). This implies that if the owner of the bird does not have the hobby of baking, then the person with the hobby of baking must be watching zombie movies.
- The person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person driving the train (clue 12). This can help us place the person driving the train relative to the person watching zombie movies.
- The person driving the scooter is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (clue 41).

Now, let's place the elements step-by-step:

Lv11-7x5-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given constraints step-by-step to fill out the table. Let's start organizing the information:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Initial Setup:
We have five rows (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Music-Genre) and five columns (1 to 5).

#### 2. Applying Constraints:

**Constraint 1:** The Russian is somewhere to the left of the Accountant.
**Constraint 6:** The Russian is somewhere to the left of the Brazilian.
**Constraint 20:** The Accountant is somewhere to the left of the Nurse.
**Constraint 34:** The Fan Soul is on the far left or far right.

Since the Russian must be to the left of the Accountant and the Accountant is to the left of the Nurse, and considering the constraints about the Fan Soul being on the far left or far right, we can infer that the Russian cannot be in position 5. Also, since the Russian is to the left of the Accountant, the Accountant cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the possible positions for the Russian are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's assume the Russian is in position 1 (we will test this assumption later if it fails).

**Constraint 3:** The person eating Eggplant is not the person who's hobby is Puzzles.
**Constraint 13:** The owner of the Guinea-Pig is somewhere between the person who's hobby is Woodworking and the Dutch.

If the Russian is in position 1, then the Accountant and Nurse cannot be in position 1, so let's consider other possibilities for these roles.

**Constraint 7:** The German is the person drinking Tea.
**Constraint 40:** The person drinking Tea and the person who's hobby is Woodworking have the same parity positions.

Since the German is the person drinking Tea, and they have the same parity positions, the German cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since these would place the person with the hobby of Woodworking in an invalid position). Thus, the German must be in position 2, 4.

**Constraint 8:** The person drinking Milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Juice.
**Constraint 12:** The person drinking Juice is not to the left of the person drinking Tea.

Given the German drinks Tea, the person drinking Milk must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (left of the German). The person drinking Juice must be to the right of the person drinking Milk, but not to the left of the person drinking Tea. This means the person drinking Juice could be in position 3, 4, or 5.

**Constraint 10:** The person who's hobby is Puzzles is on the left or right of the Fan Gospel.
**Constraint 22:** The Fan Soul is not to the right of the Brazilian.

Considering the positions, if the Fan Soul is on the far left or far right, and the Fan Gospel is not to the left of the Brazilian, we can infer the positions of these roles.

**Constraint 17:** The person who's hobby is Chess is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is Board-Games.
**Constraint 25:** The owner of the Guinea-Pig is the Fan Techno or the owner of the Guinea-Pig is the person drinking Tea, but not both.

From these constraints, we can infer that the owner of the Guinea-Pig must be in an appropriate position based on the hobbies and drinking preferences.

#### 3. Testing Assumptions:

Let's test our initial assumption that the Russian is in position 1:

1. **Russian**: Position 1
2. **Accountant**: Position 3 (to the right of the Russian)
3. **Nurse**: Position 4 (to the right of the Accountant)
4. **German**: Position 2 (drinks Tea)
5. **Beverages**:
   - Tea: Position 2
   - Juice: Position 4 (right of Milk)
   - Milk: Position 1 (left of Juice)

Now, let's assign the remaining beverages and other details:

- **Almond-Milk**: Position 3 (different parity from German)
- **Mirinda**: Position 5 (not left of Radish)
- **Juice**: Position 4 (not left of Tea)
- **Milk**: Position 1 (left of Juice)

Next, we assign the food items:

- **Eggplant**: Not Puzzles
- **Peas**: Not Mirinda
- **Lemon**: Not Brazilian (Musician or Brazilian)
- **Spinach**: Not right of Brazilian

Finally, we assign the hobbies, jobs, and music genres:

- **Hobbies**: Chess (right of Board-Games), Puzzles (left or right of Gospel), Woodworking (same parity as German)
- **Jobs**: Electrician (Russian), Mechanic (Nurse), Musician (Gospel), Accountant (Board-Games)
- **Music Genres**: House (Techno), Gospel (Soul), Soul (House), Techno (Gospel)
- **Nationalities**: Dutch (Puzzles), Brazilian (Musician or Bird), Russian (Accountant), German (Tea), Malaysian (Woodworking)
- **Pets**: Guinea-Pig (between Woodworking and Dutch), Chinchilla (Hamster), Hamster (German or Bird), Rat (Bird), Bird (Fan Techno or Tea)
