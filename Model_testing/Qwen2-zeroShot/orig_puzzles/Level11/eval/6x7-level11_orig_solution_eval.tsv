Lv11-6x7-8	"Solving this logic puzzle involves a systematic approach using the given constraints. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how we can solve it:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Immediate Constraints:**
   - The person eating plum is the owner of the snake or the fan rock.
   - The person who's hobby is dancing is in the middle (position 4).
   - The person who's hobby is collecting is not to the right of the owner of the hamster.
   - The fan salsa is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting.
   - The person who's hobby is collecting is not to the right of the owner of the pony.
   - The person who's hobby is dancing is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).

2. **Assign Positions:**
   - Since the person who's hobby is dancing is in position 4, we start with that.
   - The person who's hobby is collecting must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) because they cannot be in position 4.

3. **Use Constraints Involving Parity:**
   - The owner of the cat and the person who's hobby is skydiving have the same parity positions.
   - The person who's hobby is dancing is in position 4, which is even, so the owner of the cat and the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in odd positions (1, 3, or 5).

4. **Assign Specific Hobbies and Jobs:**
   - The dressmaker is in position 5 (since they are in the middle).
   - The librarian is somewhere to the left of the person eating blueberry, and the person who's hobby is collecting is not to the right of the owner of the hamster.

5. **Use Position Constraints:**
   - The fisherman is not to the right of the fan rock, so the fisherman must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - The owner of the dog is somewhere to the left of the scientist, and the scientist is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

6. **Assign Music Genres and Beverages:**
   - The person who's hobby is dancing is in position 4, so the person drinking juice must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
   - The person who's hobby is magic tricks is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), and the owner of the bird is not to the left of the person eating pear.

7. **Final Assignment:**
   - Using all the above information, we can fill in the remaining positions.
