### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 14**: The person drinking juice is the person who's hobby is sudoku.
2. **Clue 8**: The person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the boat.
3. **Clue 9**: The person driving the boat is not the person who's hobby is collecting.
4. **Clue 16**: The person who's hobby is card-games is the person drinking cola.
5. **Clue 1**: The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (juice drinker).
6. **Clue 2**: The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram.
7. **Clue 5**: The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
8. **Clue 3**: The owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person drinking cola.
9. **Clue 4**: The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
10. **Clue 7**: The person drinking sprite is in an odd position.
11. **Clue 6**: The person drinking cola is somewhere between the owner of the hedgehog and the owner of the frog.
12. **Clue 11**: The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the owner of the bird.
13. **Clue 12**: The owner of the chinchilla is not to the left of the person driving the tram.
14. **Clue 13**: The owner of the chinchilla is the person who's hobby is sudoku or the owner of the chinchilla is the person driving the tram, but not both.
15. **Clue 10**: The person drinking juice is the owner of the chinchilla or the owner of the chinchilla is the person who's hobby is card-games or both.

### Initial Assumptions and Deductions:
- From Clue 14, the person drinking juice has the hobby of sudoku.
- From Clue 16, the person who's hobby is card-games drinks cola.
- From Clue 8, the person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the boat.
- Since the person drinking cola has the hobby of card-games, the person driving the boat cannot have the hobby of collecting (Clue 9).

### Positioning and Clues:
- From Clue 7, the person drinking sprite is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
- From Clue 10, the person drinking juice (sudoku) can be the owner of the chinchilla, or the owner of the chinchilla is the person with the hobby of card-games (cola drinker), but not both.

### Let's try positioning:
1. If the person drinking sprite is in position 1, then:
   - Position 1: Sprite
   - Position 2: ?
   - Position 3: ?
   - Position 4: ?

### Trying Clue 14 and 16:
- Position 4: Juice (sudoku)
- Position 3: Cola (card-games)
- Position 2: ?
- Position 1: Sprite

### Applying Clue 1:
- The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (juice drinker). So, the person driving the tram could be in position 2 or 4.

### Applying Clue 2:
- The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram.
- Therefore, the person driving the tram must be in position 4, and the person driving the bus must be in position 2.

### Applying Clue 5:
- The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. This is already satisfied since cola is in position 3 and juice is in position 4.

### Applying Clue 3:
- The owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. So, the owner of the frog could be in position 2 or 4.

### Applying Clue 4:
- The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, the owner of the bird must be in position 1 or 2.

### Applying Clue 11:
- The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the owner of the bird. So, if the owner of the bird is in position 2, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 3, and the owner of the frog must be in position 4.

### Final Configuration:
- Position 1: Sprite
- Position 2: Bus
- Position 3: Cola (card-games)
- Position 4: Juice (sudoku)

Now, let's assign the remaining elements:

- The owner of the bird is in position 2 (since it is to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles, and position 1 is occupied by sprite).
- The owner of the hedgehog is in position 3 (since it is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the frog).
- The owner of the frog is in position 4 (since it is the only remaining position).

So, the final configuration is:

```
|             |     1      |    2     |     3      |    4    |

Lv11-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Step 1: Analyze Clues
1. **Clue 8:** The person who's hobby is card-games is in an even position.
2. **Clue 11:** The fan pop is not to the right of the owner of the cat.
3. **Clue 14:** The fan pop is on the right of the fan rock.
4. **Clue 15:** The owner of the horse is not to the left of the fan pop.
5. **Clue 16:** The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The hobby ""card-games"" must be in position 2 or 4.
- The fan pop cannot be in position 1 (since it's on the right of fan rock).
- The fan rock must be in position 1 or 2 (since fan pop is on its right).
- The owner of the horse cannot be in position 1 (since fan pop is not to the left of the owner of the horse).

### Step 2: Analyze More Clues
6. **Clue 5:** The owner of the horse is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking mirinda.
7. **Clue 12:** The person who's hobby is dancing is the fan pop or the person who's hobby is dancing is the owner of the dog or both.
8. **Clue 9:** The fan rock and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions.
9. **Clue 13:** The fan funk and the person drinking 7up have different parity positions.
10. **Clue 4:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
11. **Clue 10:** The person drinking mirinda is not to the right of the fan house.
12. **Clue 7:** The owner of the dog and the fan house have different parity positions.
13. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat.
14. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the fan pop.
15. **Clue 3:** The fan rock and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions.
16. **Clue 6:** The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.

### Step 3: Deduce Positions
From clue 14 and 15, fan rock must be in position 1, and fan pop must be in position 2. This means the owner of the horse cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 3 or 4.

From clue 1, the person with the hobby of dancing must be in an odd position, and from clue 3, the owner of the cat must also be in an odd position. Therefore, the owner of the cat could be in position 1 or 3.

Since the owner of the horse is in an even position (position 3 or 4), and the owner of the cat is in an odd position, the owner of the cat must be in position 1, and the owner of the horse must be in position 3.

From clue 6, the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the owner of the horse is in position 3, the person drinking 7up must be in position 4, and the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 1.

From clue 16, the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 4, and the person drinking 7up must be in position 2.

From clue 12, the person who's hobby is dancing is the fan pop or the person who's hobby is dancing is the owner of the dog or both. Since the person with the hobby of dancing must be in an odd position, and the owner of the cat is in position 1, the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 3, and the person who's hobby is dancing is the owner of the dog.

From clue 10, the person drinking mirinda is not to the right of the fan house. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 4, the fan house must be in position 3, which is a contradiction since the owner of the horse is in position 3. Therefore, the fan house must be in position 2, and the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 3.

From clue 11, the fan pop is not to the right of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is in position 1, the fan pop must be in position 2.

From clue 13, the fan funk and the person drinking 7up have different parity positions. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 2, the fan funk must be in position 4.

From clue 9, the fan rock and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the cat is in position 1, the fan rock must be in position 1.

From clue 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 3.

From clue 7, the owner of the dog and the fan house have different parity positions. Since the fan house is in position 2, the owner of the dog must be in position 4.

From clue 10, the person drinking mirinda is not to the right of the fan house. Since the fan house is in position 2, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 4.

From clue 12, the person who's hobby is dancing is the fan pop or the person who's hobby is dancing is the owner of the dog or both. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is in position 3, the person who's hobby is dancing is the owner of the dog.

11. **Clue 11**: The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person eating carrot.
12. **Clue 12**: The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball.

Let's start filling in the grid based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 9**: The person driving the skateboard is on the far right (Position 4 for Transport).
   - Transport: [_, _, _, Skateboard]

2. **Clue 11**: The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person eating carrot.
   - Since the skateboard is at position 4, the jet-ski must be at position 1, 2, or 3.
   - Let's assume the jet-ski is at position 1 (we can adjust if it doesn't fit).

3. **Clue 11** (revisited): The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person eating carrot.
   - If jet-ski is at position 1, carrot must be at position 2, 3, or 4.
   - Let's assume the carrot is at position 2 (we can adjust if it doesn't fit).

4. **Clue 6**: The person eating carrot is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the snake.
   - If carrot is at position 2, then the goldfish and snake must be at positions 1 and 3 (or vice versa).
   - Let's assume goldfish is at position 1 and snake is at position 3.

5. **Clue 1**: The owner of the goldfish is not the person who's sport is skateboarding.
   - The owner of the goldfish cannot be at position 4 (skateboarding).

6. **Clue 12**: The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
   - The owner of the goldfish is at position 1, so volleyball must be at position 2, 3, or 4.
   - Let's assume volleyball is at position 2.

7. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
   - Water-polo cannot be at position 1 or 2.
   - Let's assume water-polo is at position 3.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person eating nectarine.
   - Climbing must be at position 1, and nectarine at position 2, 3, or 4.
   - Since the owner of the goldfish is at position 1, and the owner of the goldfish cannot be the person with skateboarding, climbing must be at position 1, and nectarine at position 2.

9. **Clue 4**: The person driving the boat is the person eating carrot or the owner of the turtle is the person driving the boat or both.
   - Carrot is at position 2, so the boat could be at position 1, 2, or 3.
   - Since the owner of the turtle is not the person driving the boat, let's assume the boat is at position 3.

10. **Clue 5**: The owner of the rabbit and the person driving the jet-ski have the same parity positions.
    - Jet-ski is at position 1 (odd), so the owner of the rabbit must also be at an odd position.
    - Let's assume the rabbit is at position 3.

11. **Clue 7**: The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard.
    - The owner of the turtle must be at position 1 or 2.
    - Since the owner of the turtle is not the person driving the boat, the turtle must be at position 2.

12. **Clue 8**: The person eating tomato is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake.
    - Tomato must be at position 1 or 2.
    - Since the owner of the snake is at position 3, tomato must be at position 1.

   - So, the Nigerian drinks Hot-Chocolate.

2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking Fanta is on the far right (position 4).
   - So, position 4 is Fanta.

3. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is handball is the person drinking Sprite or the person who's sport is handball is the Brazilian or both.
   - Since the Brazilian is on the right of the person who's sport is handball (Clue 1), the person who's sport is handball cannot be the Brazilian.

4. **Clue 1**: The Brazilian is on the right of the person who's sport is handball.
   - So, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - The Brazilian must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is rugby and the pilot have the same parity positions.
   - The person who's sport is rugby and the pilot must be in the same odd or even position.
   - Since the person who's sport is handball is in an odd position (1 or 2) and the person drinking Sprite is in an odd position (1 or 2), the pilot must be in an even position (2 or 4).

9. **Clue 9**: The Pilot is somewhere to the right of the Italian.
   - The Italian must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

10. **Clue 10**: The Brazilian is on the left or right of the Project-Manager.
    - Since the Brazilian is in position 3, the Project-Manager must be in position 2 or 4.

11. **Clue 12**: The person who's sport is handball is the Pilot or the Pilot is the person drinking Fanta, but not both.
    - Since the person who's sport is handball is in position 1 or 2 and the Pilot is in an even position, the person who's sport is handball must be the Pilot.
    - The person drinking Fanta is in position 4, so the Pilot is not the person drinking Fanta.

Lv11-4x4-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching romance movies is the person driving the jet-ski or the person driving the jet-ski is the fan of electronic, but not both.
2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.
3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere between the fan metal and the fan indie.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan metal is on the right of the person watching romance movies.
5. **Clue 5**: The person whose hobby is traveling is the person watching romance movies.

13. **Clue 13**: The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is reading.
14. **Clue 14**: The fan indie is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is reading.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 5, we know:
   - The person whose hobby is traveling (T) is the person watching romance movies (R).

2. From Clue 1, if the person watching R is the driver of jet-ski (J), then the fan of electronic (E) cannot be the driver of J. If the driver of J is E, then the person watching R cannot be the driver of J.

3. From Clue 6, since T is on the left of R, and R is watching R, we can infer:
   - The person with cooking (C) is on the left of T.

4. From Clue 7, the person watching documentary (D) is not to the right of R. Since R is 3, D must be 1 or 2.

5. From Clue 9, the person watching scientific (S) is on the left or right of the driver of J. This helps us place S relative to J.

6. From Clue 4, the fan of metal (M) is on the right of R. So M must be 4.

7. From Clue 3, the driver of J is between the fans of M and I. Given M is 4, I must be 2 or 3. Since R is 3, I must be 2.

8. From Clue 14, the fan of indie (I) is to the right of the person whose hobby is reading. Given I is 2, the person with reading (Rd) must be 1.

9. From Clue 13, the person driving the bus (B) is on the left or right of Rd. Since Rd is 1, B could be 1 or 2.

10. From Clue 8, the person with Rd is either driving the skateboard (Sk) or the person watching D is Rd. Since Rd is 1, Sk must be 1.

11. From Clue 12, the person watching D is not to the left of I. Given I is 2, D must be 3.

12. From Clue 11, the fan of E is C or the person watching W is E. Since E cannot be the driver of J, E must be C.

13. From Clue 10, the person with Rd is not to the right of the person with drawing (Dr). Given Rd is 1 and Dr must be 4 (since M is 4 and only 1, 2, 3, 4 are left).

14. From Clue 1, since the driver of J is E, the person watching R cannot be the driver of J. Therefore, the driver of J must be 2.

### Final Table:

| Hobby         | Cooking (C) | Reading (Rd) | Traveling (T) | Drawing (Dr) |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary (D) | Romance (R)  | Scientific (S) | Western (W)  |
