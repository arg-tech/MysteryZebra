13. The fan of pop is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus.
14. The person eating kiwi is the person eating kiwi (trivial).

### Step 2: Analyze and Solve
Let's start by placing some values based on the constraints.

#### Constraint 10:
- The person driving the van is the person eating potato.
This means the person in position 3 for ""Food"" is the person eating potato, and they are also the one driving the van.

#### Constraint 4:
- The person driving the van is not to the right of the person eating potato.
Since the person eating potato is in position 3, this constraint is automatically satisfied.

#### Constraint 5:
- The person driving the van is on the right of the fan of pop.
This means the fan of pop must be in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the van (potato) must be in position 3.

#### Constraint 7:
- The owner of the rat is the fan of blues or the owner of the rat is the person driving the ship, but not both.
Since the person driving the van (potato) is in position 3, the owner of the rat cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the owner of the rat is either in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the ship must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Constraint 13:
- The fan of pop is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus.
The person driving the bus must be in position 1 or 2, and the fan of pop must be in position 2 or 3. Since the person driving the van (potato) is in position 3, the fan of pop must be in position 2.

#### Constraint 11:
- The fan of pop is not to the left of the owner of the rat.
Since the fan of pop is in position 2, the owner of the rat must be in position 3 (potato).

#### Constraint 1:
- The fan of pop is the person eating potato or the owner of the goat, but not both.
Since the owner of the rat is the person eating potato, the fan of pop cannot be the owner of the goat. Therefore, the fan of pop must be the person eating potato, which we already know is in position 3.

#### Constraint 3:
- The owner of the rat and the person whose hobby is card-games have the same parity positions.
The owner of the rat is in position 3, so the person whose hobby is card-games must also be in an odd position (1 or 3). Since the person in position 3 is the owner of the rat, the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 1.

#### Constraint 6:
- The person driving the ship and the fan of gospel have different parity positions.
The person driving the van (potato) is in position 3, so the person driving the ship must be in an even position (2). This means the fan of gospel must be in position 1.

#### Constraint 8:
- The person whose hobby is cooking is the person driving the ship or the person whose hobby is cooking is the person eating kiwi, or both.
Since the person driving the ship is in position 2, the person whose hobby is cooking must be in position 2 or 3. Since the person in position 3 is the owner of the rat, the person in position 2 must be the person whose hobby is cooking.

#### Constraint 9:
- The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is cooking.
The person whose hobby is cooking is in position 2, so the person eating asparagus must be in position 1.

#### Constraint 2:
- The person eating asparagus is the fan of blues or the person eating asparagus is the person whose hobby is cooking, or both.
Since the person whose hobby is cooking is in position 2, the person eating asparagus must be in position 1, and it can be the fan of blues or the person whose hobby is cooking. Since the person in position 1 is the fan of blues, this constraint is satisfied.

#### Constraint 12:
- The person eating kiwi is not to the right of the person whose hobby is sudoku.
The person whose hobby is cooking is in position 2, and the person eating kiwi must be in position 1 or 2. Since the person in position 1 is the fan of blues, the person in position 2 must be the person eating kiwi.

#### Constraint 14:
- The person eating kiwi is the person eating kiwi (trivial).
This confirms our placement.

|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Designer      |          | **Designer** |          |

### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The person whose sport is badminton is either the fan of ambient or the doctor, but not both.
- Since the doctor is already in Position 1, the person with badminton cannot be the doctor.
- Therefore, the person with badminton must be the fan of ambient.

| Sport         |    1     |    2     |    3      |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Badminton     |          |          | **Ambient**|

### Step 4: Analyze Clue 7
- The person driving the motorbike is not to the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
- Since the person with badminton is in Position 3, the person driving the motorbike cannot be in Position 1 or 2.
- Therefore, the person driving the motorbike must be in Position 3.

| Sport         |    1     |    2     |    3      |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Motorbike     |          |          | **Motor** |

### Step 8: Analyze Clue 9
- The person driving the motorbike and the person whose sport is badminton have the same parity positions.
- Both are in Position 3, which is odd.
- This confirms our previous placement.

### Step 5: Analyze Clue 11
- The person driving the bike is the designer or the designer is the person drinking coffee, but not both.
- Since the designer is in Position 2, the person driving the bike cannot be the designer.
- Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be the designer.

| Sport         |    1     |    2     |    3      |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Coffee        | **Designer** |          |           |

### Step 6: Analyze Clue 3
- The person drinking 7up is the person driving the subway or the person drinking 7up is the designer or both.
- Since the designer is already in Position 2, the person drinking 7up could be in Position 2.
- However, since the designer is already there, the person drinking 7up must be the person driving the subway.

| Sport         |    1     |    2     |    3      |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Submarine     |          |          | **Subway**|

### Step 7: Analyze Clue 2
- The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
- Since the person drinking coffee is in Position 2, the person drinking fanta must be in Position 3.

| Sport         |    1     |    2     |    3      |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Fanta         |          | **Coffee** | **Fanta** |

### Step 8: Analyze Clue 5
- The person whose sport is baseball is on the left or right of the fan funk.
- Since the fan funk must be in an even position (Clue 9), it can only be in Position 2 or 4.
- Since Position 2 is occupied by the designer, the fan funk must be in Position 4.

| Sport         |    1     |    2     |    3      |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Baseball      | **Baseball** | **Fan Funk** | **Fanta** |

### Step 9: Analyze Clue 6
- The designer is the person drinking 7up or the person drinking 7up is the fan dubstep, but not both.
- Since the designer is in Position 2 and we need to place 7up, the person drinking 7up must be the fan dubstep.

| Sport         |    1     |    2     |    3      |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 7up           |          | **Fan Dubstep** | **Fanta** |

### Step 10: Analyze Clue 10
- The person whose sport is golf and the person drinking coffee have the same parity positions.
- Since the person drinking coffee is in Position 2 (even), the person whose sport is golf must also be in an even position.
- The only remaining even position is Position 4.

| Sport         |    1     |    2     |    3      |

  - Possible positions for the taxi: 1 or 3.

### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- **Clue 2:** The fan of dubstep is between the American and the fan of classical.
  - This implies that the American, fan of classical, and fan of dubstep must be in consecutive positions.

### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- **Clue 3:** The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the fan of r&b.
  - If the fan of r&b is in position 1, the person driving the tram could be in position 2 or 3.
  - If the fan of r&b is in position 2, the person driving the tram could only be in position 3.

### Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- **Clue 4:** The person eating orange is somewhere between the person driving the tram and the person eating broccoli.
  - This implies that the person eating orange cannot be in the first or last position if the tram and broccoli are in the first and last positions respectively.

### Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
- **Clue 5:** The fan of dubstep is somewhere between the American and the fan of classical.
  - From Clue 2, we know the order must be American, fan of classical, fan of dubstep or fan of classical, fan of dubstep, American.

### Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
- **Clue 6:** The person driving the motorbike is not to the right of the Spanish.
  - This implies the Spanish cannot be in position 2 or 3 if the motorbike is in position 1.

### Step 7: Analyze Clue 7
- **Clue 7:** The Spanish is the fan of dubstep or the fan of dubstep is the person driving the tram or both.
  - This means the Spanish must be either the fan of dubstep or the person driving the tram, or both.

### Step 8: Analyze Clue 8
- **Clue 8:** The person whose hobby is baking is not to the right of the fan of classical.
  - This means the fan of classical must be in a position before the person with the hobby of baking.

### Step 9: Analyze Clue 9
- **Clue 9:** The Spanish is on the left of the person eating spinach.
  - This means the Spanish must be in a position to the left of the person eating spinach.

### Step 10: Analyze Clue 10
- **Clue 10:** The person whose hobby is sudoku and the fan of classical have the same parity positions.
  - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must also be in an odd position.

### Step 11: Analyze Clue 11
- **Clue 11:** The person eating broccoli is not to the left of the person whose hobby is video-games.
  - This means the person with the hobby of video-games must be in a position to the left of the person eating broccoli.

### Solving the Puzzle:
- Let's start by placing the taxi in position 1 (since it is in an odd position).
- The fan of dubstep must be between the American and the fan of classical.
- The person driving the tram is to the right of the fan of r&b.
- The Spanish must be the fan of dubstep or the person driving the tram.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the elements:

1. **Position 1**: Taxi (from Clue 1)
2. **Position 2**: Spanish (from Clue 7 and 9, Spanish must be to the left of spinach)
3. **Position 3**: Tram (from Clue 3, since the tram must be to the right of the fan of r&b)

Now, considering the fan of dubstep, classical, and r&b:
- The fan of dubstep is between the American and the fan of classical (Clue 2).

We can deduce:
- **Position 2**: Spanish
- **Position 3**: Tram
- **Position 1**: Taxi

Since the fan of dubstep is between the American and the fan of classical, and the Spanish is the fan of dubstep or the person driving the tram, let's place them accordingly:
- **Position 2**: Spanish (fan of dubstep)
- **Position 3**: Tram

Now, the remaining positions are 1 and 2 for the fan of classical and the American:
- **Position 1**: Taxi
- **Position 2**: Spanish (fan of dubstep)
- **Position 3**: Tram

For the remaining elements (broccoli, orange, spinach, baking, sudoku, video-games, classical, dubstep, r&b, american, egyptian, spanish, motorbike, taxi, tram):
- **Position 1**: Taxi (Egyptian)
- **Position 2**: Spanish (fan of dubstep)
- **Position 3**: Tram (American)

Now, filling in the rest:
- **Food**:
  - Broccoli (Position 3)
  - Orange (Position 1)
  - Spinach (Position 2)

- **Hobby**:
  - Baking (Position 1)
  - Sudoku (Position 2)
  - Video-games (Position 3)

- **Music-Genre**:
  - Classical (Position 1)
  - Dubstep (Position 2)
  - R&B (Position 3)

- **Nationality**:
  - Egyptian (Position 1)
  - Spanish (Position 2)
  - American (Position 3)

- **Transport**:
  - Motorbike (Position 1)
  - Taxi (Position 2)
  - Tram (Position 3)

### Final Solution Table:

Lv11-5x3-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and use the given clues to fill in the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is cycling is the person who's hobby is sudoku.
2. **Clue 5**: The Turkish is between the person eating grapefruit and the person who's sport is swimming.
3. **Clue 6**: The Brazilian is in an odd position (positions 1 or 3).
4. **Clue 7**: The Chef is in an even position (positions 2 or 4).
5. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is collecting is not to the left of the bartender.
6. **Clue 2**: The person eating apricot is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
7. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person eating grapefruit.
8. **Clue 8**: The person eating apricot is the person who's sport is skateboarding or the person who's sport is skateboarding is the Brazilian, but not both.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
10. **Clue 10**: The Freelancer is the person who's hobby is chess or the Freelancer is Turkish or both.

### Filling in the Table:

#### Positions:
- Position 1: Odd (Brazilian)
- Position 2: Even (Chef)
- Position 3: Odd or Even (Freelancer or Turkish)

#### Clue 4:
- Sudoku = Cycling
- Let's assume Sudoku is in position 2 (since it needs to be somewhere to the right of Apricot, which can't be in position 1).

#### Clue 6 & 7:
- Brazilian in position 1 (Odd)
- Chef in position 2 (Even)

So, the table looks like this so far:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |
| Food          |               |             |            |
| Hobby         | Brazilian     | Sudoku      |            |
| Job           |               | Chef        |            |
| Nationality   |               |             |            |
| Sport         |               | Cycling     |            |
```

#### Clue 5:
- Turkish is between the person eating grapefruit and the person who's sport is swimming.
- Since the Turkish is in an odd position (position 3), we need to place Grapefruit and Swimming accordingly.

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |
| Food          |               |             | Grapefruit |
| Hobby         | Brazilian     | Sudoku      |            |
| Job           |               | Chef        |            |
| Nationality   | Turkish       |             |            |
| Sport         |               | Cycling     | Swimming   |
```

#### Clue 3:
- Cycling is to the right of Grapefruit, which is already in position 3.
- This means Cycling must be in position 2.

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |
| Food          |               |             | Grapefruit |
| Hobby         | Brazilian     | Sudoku      |            |
| Job           |               | Chef        |            |
| Nationality   | Turkish       |             |            |
| Sport         |               | Cycling     | Swimming   |
```

#### Clue 2:
- The person eating apricot is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
- Since Sudoku is in position 2, the person eating apricot must be in position 3 or 1.

Since Grapefruit is in position 3, the person eating apricot must be in position 1.

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |
| Food          | Apricot       |             | Grapefruit |
| Hobby         | Brazilian     | Sudoku      |            |
| Job           |               | Chef        |            |
| Nationality   | Turkish       |             |            |
| Sport         |               | Cycling     | Swimming   |
```

#### Clue 8:
- The person eating apricot is the person who's sport is skateboarding or the person who's sport is skateboarding is the Brazilian, but not both.
- Since the Brazilian is in position 1, the person eating apricot cannot be skateboarding (because that would make the Brazilian skateboarding, which is not allowed).

So, the person eating apricot (Brazilian) has skateboarding as their sport.

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |
| Food          | Apricot       |             | Grapefruit |
| Hobby         | Brazilian     | Sudoku      |            |
| Job           |               | Chef        |            |
| Nationality   | Turkish       |             |            |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Cycling     | Swimming   |
```

#### Clue 1:
- The person who's hobby is collecting is not to the left of the bartender.
- Since Sudoku is in position 2, the person with collecting must be in position 3 or 1.

Since Brazilian is in position 1, the person with collecting must be in position 3.

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |
| Food          | Apricot       |             | Grapefruit |
| Hobby         | Brazilian     | Sudoku      | Collecting |
| Job           |               | Chef        |            |
| Nationality   | Turkish       |             |            |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Cycling     | Swimming   |
```

#### Clue 9:
- The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
- Since Collecting is in position 3, Chess must be in position 2.

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |
| Food          | Apricot       |             | Grapefruit |
| Hobby         | Brazilian     | Chess       | Collecting |
| Job           |               | Chef        |            |
| Nationality   | Turkish       |             |            |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Cycling     | Swimming   |
```

#### Clue 10:
- The Freelancer is the person who's hobby is chess or the Freelancer is Turkish or both.
- Since Chess is in position 2, the Freelancer must be in position 2.

So, the table now looks like this:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |
| Food          | Apricot       |             | Grapefruit |
| Hobby         | Brazilian     | Chess       | Collecting |

| Sport         | Skateboarding | Cycling     | Swimming   |
```

#### Final Clue for Job:
- The remaining job is Bartender, which must be in position 1.

So, the final table is:
```
|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |

| Sport         | Skateboarding | Cycling     | Swimming   |
```

#### Nationality for Remaining:
- The remaining nationality must be Mexican, since Brazilian and Turkish are already assigned.

So, the final table is:

From Clue 9, the person watching satire movies and the fan of disco music have different parity positions. Since the fan of disco is in position 3 (odd), the person watching satire must be in an even position (1 or 2).

#### Step 3: Place the Person Watching Satire Movies
From Clue 10, the person whose sport is tennis is on the right of the person watching satire movies. From Clue 1, the person whose sport is tennis is between the person eating pepper and the person whose sport is rugby. Therefore, the person watching satire must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the person whose sport is tennis is on the right of the person watching satire, and the person whose sport is rugby is in position 3, the person watching satire must be in position 1. Therefore, the person whose sport is tennis is in position 2.

|               |     1     |    2    |    3     |

| Transport     |           |         |    Jet-ski|

From Clue 1, the person eating pepper is in position 1. From Clue 5, the person watching musical movies and the person eating spinach have the same parity positions. Since the person eating spinach is in position 3, the person watching musical movies must be in position 1. But position 1 is already occupied by the person eating pepper. So, the person watching musical movies must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |    2    |    3     |

| Transport     |           |         |    Jet-ski|

From Clue 7, the person driving the motorbike is the person watching drama movies or the person driving the motorbike is the fan of rock, but not both. Since the fan of rock is in position 3, the person driving the motorbike cannot be the fan of rock. Therefore, the person driving the motorbike must be the person watching drama movies. From Clue 6, the person driving the motorbike and the person watching satire movies have the same parity positions. Since the person watching satire is in position 1, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 3. But position 3 is already occupied by the person watching musical movies. So, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2, and the person watching drama movies must be in position 1.

From Clue 4, the fan of country music is the person whose sport is lacrosse or the person driving the car is the fan of country music or both. Since the fan of country music is in position 3, the person driving the car must be the fan of country music. Therefore, the person whose sport is lacrosse must be in position 1.

|               |     1     |    2    |    3     |

| Transport     |    Car     |    Motorbike|    Jet-ski|

From Clue 11, the fan of country music is not the person watching drama movies. Since the fan of country music is in position 3, the person watching drama movies must be in position 1.

|               |     1     |    2    |    3     |

Lv11-5x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

1. **The person who's hobby is drawing is the person watching family movies or the Japanese is the person who's hobby is drawing or both.**
   - This means if someone's hobby is drawing, they must be watching family movies, or the Japanese person has drawing as their hobby.

2. **The British and the person watching fantasy movies have the same parity positions.**
   - If the British person is in an odd position, the person watching fantasy movies must also be in an odd position, and vice versa.

3. **The person watching crime movies is the person driving the car or the photographer is the person watching crime movies, but not both.**
   - Only one of these can be true.

4. **The person driving the car and the Colombian have different parity positions.**
   - If the Colombian is in an odd position, the person driving the car must be in an even position, and vice versa.

5. **The Japanese is the person who's hobby is drawing.**
   - This directly links the Japanese person to the hobby of drawing.

6. **The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the left of the Japanese.**
   - The Japanese person must be to the right of the person watching crime movies.

7. **The British is on the far right.**
   - The British person is in position 3.

8. **The teacher and the person driving the van have the same parity positions.**
   - If the teacher is in an odd position, the person driving the van must be in an odd position, and vice versa.

9. **The person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the car.**
   - The person driving the bike is in position 3, and the person driving the car is in position 1 or 2.

10. **The teacher is not to the right of the British.**
    - Since the British is in position 3, the teacher cannot be in position 2 or 3.

11. **The person who's hobby is camping is not to the right of the person watching family movies.**
    - The person with the hobby of camping cannot be in position 3 if the person watching family movies is in position 2 or 3.

12. **The person driving the bike is not to the left of the person watching crime movies.**
    - The person watching crime movies cannot be in position 1 if the person driving the bike is in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's fill in the table based on these constraints:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 3 (British)**
   - From constraint 7, the British is on the far right.
   
2. **Japanese**
   - From constraint 5, the Japanese is the person who's hobby is drawing.
   - From constraint 6, the person watching crime movies is somewhere to the left of the Japanese.
   - Therefore, the Japanese must be in position 3, and the person watching crime movies must be in position 1 or 2.

3. **Hobby of Drawing**
   - From constraint 1, the person who's hobby is drawing is the Japanese.
   - So, the Japanese is in position 3 with drawing as the hobby.

4. **Crime Movies**
   - From constraint 3, the person watching crime movies is the person driving the car or the photographer is the person watching crime movies, but not both.
   - From constraint 6, the person watching crime movies must be to the left of the Japanese.
   - Therefore, the person watching crime movies is in position 1 or 2.
   - Let's assume the person watching crime movies is in position 1 (we will check consistency later).

5. **Car Driver**
   - From constraint 4, the person driving the car and the Colombian have different parity positions.
   - If the person watching crime movies is in position 1 (odd), the car driver must be in an even position (position 2).
   - Therefore, the person driving the car is in position 2.

6. **Van Driver**
   - From constraint 8, the teacher and the person driving the van have the same parity positions.
   - If the person driving the car is in position 2 (even), the van driver must be in an even position (position 2 or 4).
   - Since position 2 is already taken by the car driver, the van driver must be in position 4.

7. **Bike Driver**
   - From constraint 9, the person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the car.
   - Therefore, the person driving the bike is in position 3, which is already occupied by the British.

8. **Revising Bike Driver Position**
   - Since the person driving the bike cannot be in position 3, it must be in position 2.
   - This means the person driving the car must be in position 1.
   - The person watching crime movies is in position 1, so the person driving the car must be the photographer (constraint 3).

9. **Family Movies**
   - From constraint 1, the person who's hobby is drawing is the Japanese.
   - From constraint 1, the person watching family movies is not the Japanese.
   - Therefore, the person watching family movies is in position 2, and the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 1.

10. **Camping Hobby**
    - From constraint 11, the person who's hobby is camping is not to the right of the person watching family movies.
    - Therefore, the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 1, and the person watching family movies must be in position 2.

11. **Teacher**
    - From constraint 10, the teacher is not to the right of the British.
    - Since the British is in position 3, the teacher must be in position 1 or 2.
    - From constraint 8, the teacher and the person driving the van have the same parity positions.
    - Since the van driver is in position 4 (even), the teacher must be in position 2 (even).

12. **Colombian**
    - From constraint 4, the person driving the car and the Colombian have different parity positions.
    - Since the person driving the car is in position 1 (odd), the Colombian must be in position 2 (even).
