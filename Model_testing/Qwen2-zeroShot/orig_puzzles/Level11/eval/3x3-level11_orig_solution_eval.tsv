Lv11-3x3-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The Mexican is somewhere to the left of the Engineer.
2. **Clue 2:** The Colombian is between the Japanese and the owner of the Snake.
3. **Clue 3:** The Japanese is the Lawyer.
4. **Clue 4:** The Engineer is either the Japanese or the owner of the Rat, or both.

First, let's assign the Japanese as the Lawyer (Clue 3).

Since the Japanese is the Lawyer, we can start filling in the table:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Job           | Lawyer  |           |          |
| Nationality   |         |           |          |
| Pet           |         |           |          |

Next, we use Clue 2: The Colombian is between the Japanese and the owner of the Snake.

- Since the Japanese is in position 2, the Colombian must be in position 1 or 3.
- The owner of the Snake cannot be in position 2 because the Colombian is between the Japanese and the Snake owner.

This gives us two possibilities:
1. Colombian in position 1, Snake owner in position 3.
2. Colombian in position 3, Snake owner in position 1.

We will test these possibilities one by one.

### Case 1: Colombian in position 1, Snake owner in position 3
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Job           | Lawyer  |           |          |
| Nationality   | Colombian|           |          |
| Pet           | Snake   |           | Rat      |

Now, we use Clue 1: The Mexican is somewhere to the left of the Engineer.

- The Mexican cannot be in position 2 because the Japanese is there.
- The Mexican must be in position 1 or 3.
- Since the Colombian is in position 1, the Mexican must be in position 3.
- The Engineer must be in position 2.

This gives us:
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Job           | Lawyer  | Engineer  |          |
| Nationality   | Colombian| Mexican  |          |
| Pet           | Snake   |           | Rat      |

Now, we need to fill in the remaining job and pet for position 3. The only job left is the Nurse, and the only pet left is the Hamster.

|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Job           | Lawyer  | Engineer  | Nurse    |
| Nationality   | Colombian| Mexican  |          |
| Pet           | Snake   |           | Hamster  |

We need to check if this satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 1: The Mexican (position 3) is to the left of the Engineer (position 2).
- Clue 2: The Colombian (position 1) is between the Japanese (position 2) and the Snake owner (position 3).
- Clue 3: The Japanese is the Lawyer (position 2).
- Clue 4: The Engineer is either the Japanese or the owner of the Rat, or both. Here, the Engineer is not the Japanese but is the owner of the Rat, which fits the clue since the Rat is in position 3.

All clues are satisfied. Now, we need to determine the nationality for the Nurse.

Since the Colombian and Mexican are already assigned, the remaining nationality is Japanese.

|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Job           | Lawyer  | Engineer  | Nurse    |
| Nationality   | Colombian| Mexican  | Japanese |
| Pet           | Snake   |           | Hamster  |

Finally, we place the Rat in position 2 for the Engineer.

|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Job           | Lawyer  | Engineer  | Nurse    |
| Nationality   | Colombian| Mexican  | Japanese |
| Pet           | Snake   | Rat       | Hamster  |

Thus, the final solution is:

Lv11-3x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue step-by-step and use process of elimination to fill in the table.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The Egyptian is somewhere between the teacher and the fan of metal.**
   - This means the Egyptian cannot be the teacher or the fan of metal, but must be either the fan of gospel or techno, and be placed between the teacher and the fan of metal.

2. **The Security-guard is the fan of techno or the fan of techno is the Colombian or both.**
   - This means that either:
     - The Security-guard is the fan of techno.
     - The Colombian is the fan of techno.
     - Both could be true.

3. **The Egyptian is on the left of the fan of techno.**
   - This places the Egyptian to the left of the fan of techno.

4. **The Accountant is on the left or right of the Indian.**
   - This means the Accountant and the Indian must be adjacent (next to each other).

5. **The Accountant is on the left or right of the Security-guard.**
   - This means the Accountant and the Security-guard must also be adjacent (next to each other).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1 & 3:**
   - Since the Egyptian is on the left of the fan of techno, and the Egyptian is also between the teacher and the fan of metal, we can deduce:
     - The Egyptian is not the fan of metal (because it would place the Egyptian next to the fan of metal, which contradicts being between the teacher and the fan of metal).
     - Therefore, the Egyptian must be the fan of gospel.
     - The fan of metal must be to the right of the Egyptian, and the teacher must be to the left of the Egyptian.

2. **Clue 2:**
   - The Security-guard is the fan of techno or the fan of techno is the Colombian or both.
   - Since the Egyptian is the fan of gospel, and the fan of metal is to the right of the Egyptian, the only remaining option for the fan of techno is the Colombian.

3. **Clue 4 & 5:**
   - The Accountant and the Indian must be adjacent.
   - The Accountant and the Security-guard must also be adjacent.
   - Given that the Security-guard is the fan of techno (Colombian), and the Accountant must be next to the Indian, the only possible arrangement considering all clues is:
     - Accountant and Indian must be adjacent to the Security-guard (fan of techno).
     - Therefore, the Accountant must be the fan of metal, and the Indian must be the teacher.

### Final Table:

```
|               |       1        |     2      |     3     |
| Job           |    Teacher     |    Accountant |  Security-guard |
| Music-Genre   |      Gospel    |      Metal  |     Techno  |
| Nationality   |      Indian    |    Colombian |    Egyptian  |
```

Lv11-3x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given clues to fill in the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching documentary movies and the scientist have the same parity positions.
2. The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the scientist.
3. The nurse is in the middle.
4. The person watching action movies is the person driving the train or the person driving the train is the scientist or both.
5. The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching spy movies.
6. The person driving the skateboard and the scientist have different parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of the Nurse
From clue 3, the nurse is in the middle (position 2).

So, the table looks like this:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |       3        |
| Job           |           | Nurse      |                |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |                |
| Transport     |           |            |                |
```

#### Step 2: Analyze the Scientist's Position
Clue 1 states that the person watching documentary movies and the scientist have the same parity positions. Since the nurse is in position 2 (middle), the scientist cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the scientist must be either in position 1 or 3.

Clue 6 states that the person driving the skateboard and the scientist have different parity positions. This means if the scientist is in an odd position, the skateboard driver must be in an even position, and vice versa.

Let's test the possibilities for the scientist:
- If the scientist is in position 1 (odd):
  - The skateboard driver must be in position 2 (even).
  - From clue 2, the skateboard driver is to the right of the scientist, so this is not possible since position 2 is the nurse.
- If the scientist is in position 3 (odd):
  - The skateboard driver must be in position 1 or 2 (even).

Since the nurse is in position 2, the skateboard driver cannot be in position 2. Thus, the skateboard driver must be in position 1.

So, the scientist is in position 3:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |       3        |
| Job           |           | Nurse      | Scientist      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |                |
| Transport     |           |            |                |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the Person Watching Spy Movies
Clue 5 states that the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the skateboard driver is in position 1, the person watching spy movies must be in position 2 (the nurse).

So, the nurse watches spy movies:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |       3        |
| Job           |           | Nurse      | Scientist      |
| Movie-Genre   |           | Spy        |                |
| Transport     |           |            |                |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the Person Watching Documentary Movies
Clue 1 states that the person watching documentary movies and the scientist have the same parity positions. Since the scientist is in position 3 (odd), the person watching documentary movies must also be in position 3.

So, the scientist watches documentary movies:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |       3        |
| Job           |           | Nurse      | Scientist      |
| Movie-Genre   |           | Spy        | Documentary    |
| Transport     |           |            |                |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the Remaining Person's Job and Movie Genre
Since the nurse watches spy movies and the scientist watches documentary movies, the remaining job and movie genre must be assigned to the person in position 1.

Clue 4 states that the person watching action movies is the person driving the train or the person driving the train is the scientist or both. Since the scientist is already assigned to documentary movies, the person in position 1 (the skateboard driver) must be the one watching action movies and driving the train.

So, the final table is:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |       3        |
| Job           | Security-Guard | Nurse      | Scientist      |
| Movie-Genre   | Action        | Spy        | Documentary    |
| Transport     | Train         |            |                |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1     |     2      |       3        |
| Job           | Security-Guard | Nurse      | Scientist      |
| Movie-Genre   | Action        | Spy        | Documentary    |

Lv11-3x3-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate values in the table. Let's go through each clue step-by-step:

### Clue Analysis

1. **The person watching family movies and the person drinking water have the same parity positions.**
   - This means if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an odd position, and if one is in an even position, the other must be in an even position.

2. **The colombian is between the indonesian and the person drinking water.**
   - This places the colombian in the middle of the indonesian and the person drinking water.

3. **The person watching horror movies is not to the right of the indonesian.**
   - The person watching horror movies can only be in position 1 or 2.

4. **The person watching family movies is the italian or the person watching family movies is the person drinking lemonade or both.**
   - This means either the italian is watching family movies, or the person drinking lemonade is watching family movies, or both.

5. **The person watching epic movies is the indonesian.**
   - The indonesian is watching epic movies.

6. **The italian is not the person drinking almond-milk.**
   - The italian cannot drink almond-milk.

7. **The italian and the person watching horror movies have different parity positions.**
   - If the italian is in an odd position, the person watching horror movies must be in an even position, and vice versa.

8. **The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.**
   - This means the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1 and the person drinking lemonade is in position 2 or 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Clue 5**: The indonesian is watching epic movies.
   - So, row 3 (Movie-Genre) for the indonesian is ""epic"".

2. **Clue 2**: The colombian is between the indonesian and the person drinking water.
   - Since the indonesian is in position 3, the colombian must be in position 2, and the person drinking water must be in position 1.
   - So, row 3 (Beverage) for the colombian is ""water"", and row 1 (Beverage) for the person drinking water is ""water"".
   - Therefore, the person drinking water is colombian.

3. **Clue 1**: The person watching family movies and the person drinking water have the same parity positions.
   - Since the person drinking water is in position 1 (odd), the person watching family movies must also be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the italian is in position 1 (since the italian is not drinking almond-milk and must be drinking lemonade).

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching family movies is the italian or the person watching family movies is the person drinking lemonade or both.
   - Since the person drinking lemonade is in position 2 and the italian is in position 1, the person watching family movies is the italian.
   - So, row 2 (Beverage) for the italian is ""lemonade"", and row 2 (Movie-Genre) for the italian is ""family"".

5. **Clue 3**: The person watching horror movies is not to the right of the indonesian.
   - Since the indonesian is in position 3, the person watching horror movies must be in position 1 or 2.
   - But since the italian is in position 1 and watching family movies, the person watching horror movies must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person drinking lemonade is watching horror movies.
   - So, row 2 (Movie-Genre) for the person drinking lemonade is ""horror"".

6. **Clue 7**: The italian and the person watching horror movies have different parity positions.
   - Since the italian is in position 1 (odd), the person watching horror movies must be in position 2 (even), which is correct.

7. **Clue 8**: The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
   - Since the person drinking lemonade is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.
   - So, row 1 (Beverage) for the person drinking almond-milk is ""almond-milk"".

8. **Clue 6**: The italian is not the person drinking almond-milk.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

### Final Table

```
|               |    1    |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | lemonade | water       |
| Movie-Genre   | family     | horror   | epic        |

Lv11-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step 1: List the Constraints

1. The person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike.
2. The person driving the ship and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions.
3. The person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
4. The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi.
5. The person who's sport is climbing is the person eating grapes.
6. The person driving the ship is the person eating pomegranate or the person eating pomegranate is the person who's sport is badminton or both.
7. The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the ship.
8. The person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes.

### Step 2: Deduce the Positions

From constraint 5, we know:
- The person who's sport is climbing is the person eating grapes.

From constraint 8, since the person eating pomegranate is to the right of the person eating grapes, and from constraint 1, the person driving the ship (who eats pomegranate) must be to the right of the person driving the bike. So, the person eating grapes (climbing) must be in position 1 or 2, and the person eating pomegranate (ship) must be in position 2 or 3.

From constraint 2, the person driving the ship and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the ship is in position 2 or 3, the person who's sport is badminton must also be in position 2 or 3. Given that the person eating pomegranate (ship) is in position 2 or 3, the person who's sport is badminton must be in position 2 if the person eating pomegranate is in position 3, or in position 3 if the person eating pomegranate is in position 2.

From constraint 7, the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since the person eating grapes (climbing) is in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the ship (pomegranate) is in position 2 or 3, the person driving the ship cannot be in position 2 because the person eating grapes would then be to the right of the person driving the ship. Thus, the person driving the ship must be in position 3, and the person eating grapes (climbing) must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Person eating grapes (climbing)
- Position 2: Person driving the bike (unknown sport)
- Position 3: Person driving the ship (pomegranate)

From constraint 4, the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the person eating grapes (climbing) is in position 1, the person driving the taxi must be in position 2.

From constraint 6, the person driving the ship is the person eating pomegranate or the person eating pomegranate is the person who's sport is badminton or both. Since the person driving the ship is in position 3 and the person eating pomegranate is in position 3, the person driving the ship is the person eating pomegranate.

From constraint 3, the person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the person eating grapes (climbing) is in position 1, the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 2 or 3. But the person driving the taxi is in position 2, so the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 3.

From constraint 9, the person driving the ship and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the ship is in position 3, the person who's sport is badminton must also be in position 3, which contradicts the fact that the person driving the ship is the person eating pomegranate. Therefore, the person who's sport is badminton must be in position 2, and the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Person eating grapes (climbing)
- Position 2: Person driving the bike (badminton)
- Position 3: Person driving the ship (pomegranate)

### Step 3: Assign Sports and Foods

From constraint 5, the person who's sport is climbing is the person eating grapes. So:
- Position 1: Grapes (climbing)

From constraint 6, the person driving the ship is the person eating pomegranate or the person eating pomegranate is the person who's sport is badminton or both. Since the person driving the ship is in position 3, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 3. So:
- Position 3: Pomegranate (ship)

From constraint 7, the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is in position 3, the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 1. So:
- Position 1: Grapes (climbing)

From constraint 3, the person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the person who's sport is climbing is in position 1, the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 2 or 3. But the person driving the taxi is in position 2, so the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 3. So:
- Position 3: Lacrosse (ship)

From constraint 4, the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the person who's sport is climbing is in position 1 and the person driving the taxi is in position 2, the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 1. So:
- Position 1: Grapes (climbing)

From constraint 8, the person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes is in position 1 and the person eating pomegranate is in position 3, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 3. So:
- Position 3: Pomegranate (ship)

Lv11-3x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct beverage, food, and job for each person in the given positions (1, 2, and 3). Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person drinking soy-milk is the person eating strawberry or the person drinking soy-milk is the photographer or both.**
2. **The person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating strawberry.**
3. **The person drinking juice is on the right of the coach.**
4. **The person drinking sprite is not to the right of the journalist.**
5. **The person eating strawberry is the person drinking soy-milk.**
6. **The person eating peach is in an odd position.**
7. **The coach is on the left or right of the journalist.**
8. **The journalist is on the left or right of the coach.**

From Clue 5, we know that the person eating strawberry and drinking soy-milk is the same person.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5:
- The person eating strawberry is the person drinking soy-milk.
- This means position 2 must be the person who drinks soy-milk and eats strawberry.

#### Clue 2:
- The person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating strawberry.
- Since position 2 is occupied by the person drinking soy-milk and eating strawberry, position 1 must be the person drinking juice.

#### Clue 3:
- The person drinking juice is on the right of the coach.
- This means the coach cannot be in position 1, so the coach must be in position 3.

#### Clue 6:
- The person eating peach is in an odd position.
- Since positions 1 and 3 are already occupied, position 2 must be the person eating peach.

#### Clue 7 & 8:
- The coach is on the left or right of the journalist.
- The journalist is on the left or right of the coach.
- Given the coach is in position 3, the journalist can only be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is the person drinking juice, the journalist must be in position 2, which is the person drinking soy-milk and eating peach (from Clue 5).

This leaves position 3 as the coach, and since the person drinking juice is on the right of the coach, position 1 must be the person drinking juice.

### Final Placement:
- Position 1: Juice (Coach)
- Position 2: Soy-milk (Photographer) - Eating Peach
- Position 3: Sprite (Journalist)

Lv11-3x3-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use logical reasoning to fill in the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The Mexican is on the left or right of the Argentine (3).**
2. **The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola (5).**
3. **The person who's hobby is card-games is the Mexican (3).**
4. **The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up (5).**
5. **The person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is writing or the person who's hobby is writing is the Indian or both (5).**
6. **The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing (5).**
7. **The Mexican is somewhere between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the Indian (7).**

### Analyzing the Clues:

#### Clue 3:
- The Mexican's hobby is card-games.
- This means the Mexican cannot be in position 2 since there is no card-games mentioned for position 2.

#### Clue 5:
- The person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is writing or the person who's hobby is writing is the Indian or both.
- This implies that either the person drinking cola has the hobby of writing, or the person with the hobby of writing is the Indian, or both.

#### Clue 6:
- The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
- This means the person with the hobby of writing cannot be in position 3, as the 7up drinker must be to the right of them.

#### Clue 2 & 5:
- Combining Clue 2 and 5, we get that the person drinking 7up must be to the right of the person drinking cola.
- Also, the person drinking cola must be the one with the hobby of writing or the Indian must have the hobby of writing.

#### Clue 4 & 6:
- The person drinking milk is to the right of the person drinking 7up.
- The person drinking 7up is to the right of the person who's hobby is writing.

#### Clue 7:
- The Mexican is between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the Indian.

### Deductions:

1. Since the Mexican's hobby is card-games (Clue 3), the Mexican cannot be in position 2.
2. If the person drinking cola has the hobby of writing, then the Indian does not necessarily need to have the writing hobby.
3. If the person drinking cola does not have the hobby of writing, then the Indian must have it.

### Possible Configurations:

Given the constraints, let's place the nationalities and hobbies in a way that fits all clues:

- Let's assume the person with the hobby of writing is the Indian (to simplify).
- The Mexican (card-games) must be between the person with puzzles and the Indian.

### Final Table Configuration:

|               |    1    |     2      |     3     |
|---------------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Beverage      | Milk    | Cola       | 7up       |
| Hobby         | Puzzles | Writing    | Card-games|
| Nationality   | Argentine | Indian    | Mexican   |

### Verification:

1. **Mexican is on the left or right of the Argentine**: Correct (Mexican is to the right of Argentine).
2. **Person drinking 7up is to the right of the person drinking cola**: Correct (7up in 3, cola in 2).
3. **Person who's hobby is card-games is the Mexican**: Correct (Mexican has card-games).
4. **Person drinking milk is to the right of the person drinking 7up**: Correct (milk in 1, 7up in 3).
5. **Person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is writing or the person who's hobby is writing is the Indian**: Correct (cola in 2, writing in 2, Indian in 2).
6. **Person drinking 7up is to the right of the person who's hobby is writing**: Correct (7up in 3, writing in 2).
7. **Mexican is between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the Indian**: Correct (puzzles in 1, Mexican in 3, Indian in 2).

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The Canadian is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli.
2. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching sports movies.
3. The person watching sports movies is in an odd position (1 or 3).
4. The Canadian is the person watching sports movies or the Canadian is the person eating spinach or both.
5. The Indian is not to the left of the Indian (meaning the Indian must be in the middle position).
6. The person eating peas is on the right of the Indian.
7. The person eating spinach is on the left of the Indian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The person watching sports movies is in an odd position (1 or 3).
   - Therefore, the person watching sports movies can only be in position 1 or 3.

2. **Clue 4**: The Canadian is the person watching sports movies or the Canadian is the person eating spinach or both.
   - Since the Canadian must be in an odd position (1 or 3), and the person watching sports movies is also in an odd position, the Canadian must be the one watching sports movies.

3. **Clue 5**: The Indian must be in the middle position (2).

4. **Clue 6**: The person eating peas is on the right of the Indian.
   - Since the Indian is in position 2, the person eating peas must be in position 3.

Lv11-3x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues step-by-step to fill in the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking lemonade is not the person who's hobby is camping.
2. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
3. The person drinking lemonade is the person who's sport is biathlon or the person drinking lemonade is the person who's hobby is card-games or both.
4. The person who's hobby is camping is the person who's sport is soccer or the person who's hobby is camping is the person drinking milk, but not both.
5. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
6. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6**: The person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
   - This means the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1, and the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2 or 3.

2. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is camping is the person who's sport is soccer or the person who's hobby is camping is the person drinking milk, but not both.
   - This means that if someone's hobby is camping, then they cannot be the person drinking milk, and they can only be the one playing soccer or drinking lemonade (but not both).

3. **Clue 1**: The person drinking lemonade is not the person who's hobby is camping.
   - This confirms that the person drinking lemonade cannot be camping.

4. **Clue 3**: The person drinking lemonade is the person who's sport is biathlon or the person drinking lemonade is the person who's hobby is card-games or both.
   - Since the person drinking lemonade is not camping, they could either be doing biathlon or have card-games as their hobby.

5. **Clue 2**: The person drinking milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - This means the person with card-games as a hobby must be in position 1 or 2, and the person drinking milk must be in position 2 or 3.

6. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
   - This means the person with writing as a hobby must be in position 1 or 2, and the person playing badminton must be in position 2 or 3.

### Filling the Table:

Let's start filling the table based on these clues:

1. **Position 1**:
   - From Clue 5, the person with writing as a hobby must be here.
   - From Clue 6, the person drinking soy-milk must be here.
   - Therefore, the person in position 1 drinks soy-milk and has writing as a hobby.

2. **Position 2**:
   - From Clue 6, the person drinking lemonade must be here since soy-milk is in position 1.
   - From Clue 3, the person drinking lemonade could have card-games as a hobby or be playing biathlon.
   - From Clue 4, the person who's hobby is camping cannot drink milk, so the person drinking lemonade cannot be camping.
   - Therefore, the person in position 2 drinks lemonade and has card-games as a hobby.

3. **Position 3**:
   - From Clue 2, the person drinking milk must be here.
   - From Clue 3, the person drinking lemonade (in position 2) is not playing biathlon, so the person in position 3 must be playing biathlon.
   - Therefore, the person in position 3 drinks milk and plays biathlon.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage   | soy-milk | lemonade   | milk     |
| Hobby      | writing  | card-games |          |
| Sport      |          |           | biathlon|
```

We need to determine the sport for the person with card-games as a hobby. Since the person in position 2 drinks lemonade and has card-games as a hobby, and the person in position 3 plays biathlon, the person in position 2 must play soccer (the only remaining sport).

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage   | soy-milk | lemonade   | milk     |
| Hobby      | writing  | card-games |         |
| Sport      |          | soccer    | biathlon|
```

The final solution is:

```
|            |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage   | soy-milk | lemonade   | milk     |
