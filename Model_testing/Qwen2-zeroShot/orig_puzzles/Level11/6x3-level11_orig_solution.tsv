### Explanation:
1. **Sport**:
   - From Clue 4: The person eating lemon (climbing) is fixed.
   - From Clue 14: The person eating grapefruit is either snowboarding or funk. Since Clue 1 indicates that the cricket person is between funk and grapefruit, the only possibility is that the person eating grapefruit is snowboarding and the person who likes funk is 1.
   - From Clue 15: The person eating grapefruit (snowboarding) is to the left of the person whose sport is cricket.
   - From Clue 1: The person whose sport is cricket is between the fan of funk and the person eating grapefruit (snowboarding). Therefore, the person whose sport is cricket is 2, and the fan of funk is 1.
   - From Clue 6: The person driving the airplane (cricket) or the person drinking coffee (cricket) is the person driving the airplane. So, the person drinking coffee is the owner of the rat (Clue 11).

2. **Transport**:
   - From Clue 2: The person driving the airplane is on the left of the person driving the roller.
   - From Clue 12: The person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the owner of the lizard. The person drinking hot-chocolate (coffee) is 1, and the owner of the lizard (rat) is 3.
   - From Clue 9: The person drinking fanta (funk) is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (coffee), so fanta is 3.
   - From Clue 13: The person drinking hot-chocolate (coffee) is the person driving the airplane, so the person driving the airplane is 1.
   - From Clue 10: The owner of the lizard (rat) is not to the left of the owner of the goat (goat is 2).

3. **Beverage**:
   - From Clue 5: The person drinking fanta (funk) is not to the left of the fan of rock (rock is 3).
   - From Clue 3: The person drinking hot-chocolate (coffee) is not to the left of the fan of rock (rock is 3).

4. **Food**:
   - From Clue 8: The person eating grapefruit (snowboarding) is not to the left of the fan of rock (rock is 3).
   - From Clue 7: The owner of the lizard (rat) and the person whose sport is cricket (cricket is 2) have different parity positions (odd/even).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Freelancer and Tennis
- From Clue 9, the Freelancer is the person whose sport is tennis.
- Therefore, the Freelancer's sport is Tennis.

#### Step 2: Determine the Van Driver
- From Clue 3, the person driving the van is the person drinking 7up or the person driving the van is the Russian or both.
- From Clue 8, the Turkish is not the person driving the van.
- Since the Freelancer is the person whose sport is tennis, and the Turkish is not the van driver, the van driver must be either the person drinking 7up or the Russian.

#### Step 3: Determine the Fan of Metal and Punk
- From Clue 6, the fan of punk is on the right of the fan of metal.
- This implies the order is: fan of metal -> fan of punk.

#### Step 4: Determine the Parity of Positions
- From Clue 2, the person drinking 7up and the Turkish have different parity positions.
- If the Turkish is in an odd position, the person drinking 7up must be in an even position, and vice versa.

#### Step 5: Determine the Sport Order
- From Clue 10, the person whose sport is handball is on the left or right of the person whose sport is rowing.
- From Clue 12, the person whose sport is rowing is between the person drinking 7up and the mechanic.

#### Step 7: Determine the Remaining Information
- From Clue 7, the person whose sport is tennis is the Turkish or the Turkish is the person drinking hot-chocolate, but not both.
- Since the Freelancer is the person whose sport is tennis, the Turkish cannot be the person drinking hot-chocolate.
- Therefore, the Turkish drinks hot-chocolate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Doctor and Water-Polo:**
   - From clue 4, the doctor and the person who does water-polo must be in different parity positions.
   - Let’s assume the doctor is in position 1 (odd), then the person who does water-polo must be in position 2 or 3 (even).
   - Let’s assume the person who does water-polo is in position 2 (even), then the doctor is in position 1 (odd).

2. **Positioning the Engineer:**
   - From clue 5, the engineer cannot be the fan of electronic music.
   - Let’s assume the engineer is in position 3 (since it’s the last available position for the engineer after placing the doctor and water-polo).

3. **Positioning the Analyst:**
   - From clue 14, the analyst is either the fan of electronic music or Dutch, but not both.
   - Let’s assume the analyst is in position 2 (since the doctor is in position 1 and the engineer is in position 3).

   - Since the fan of country music is in position 3 (odd), the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person doing skateboarding must also be in an odd position.
   - Let’s assume the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1 and the person doing skateboarding is in position 3.

6. **Positioning the Person Doing Swimming:**
   - From clue 6, the person doing swimming is between the person doing skateboarding and the person drinking cola.
   - Since the person doing skateboarding is in position 3 and the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, the person doing swimming must be in position 2.

7. **Positioning the Person Drinking Cola:**
   - From clue 6, the person doing swimming is between the person doing skateboarding and the person drinking cola.
   - The person doing swimming is in position 2, so the person drinking cola must be in position 3.

8. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The person with photography as a hobby is not to the left of the fan of electronic music.
   - The person with photography as a hobby cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the fan of electronic music is in position 1 or 2.

Lv11-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of dubstep is on the right of the owner of the horse.
2. **Clue 2:** The Dutch is not the nurse.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is cycling is on the far left or far right.
4. **Clue 4:** The Japanese is the person drinking hot-chocolate or the nurse is the Japanese, but not both.
5. **Clue 5:** The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
6. **Clue 6:** The Argentine is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
7. **Clue 7:** The person drinking hot-chocolate and the Dutch have the same parity positions (both even or both odd).
8. **Clue 8:** The fan of country is the person drinking mirinda.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who's sport is sailing is somewhere between the person who's sport is tennis and the fan of dubstep.
10. **Clue 10:** The person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the mouse or the person drinking soy-milk is the Japanese or both.
11. **Clue 11:** The owner of the mouse is on the far right.
12. **Clue 12:** The person drinking soy-milk is not to the right of the fan of r&b.
13. **Clue 13:** The fan of dubstep is not to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
14. **Clue 14:** The owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the paramedic.
15. **Clue 15:** The fan of dubstep is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 15:** The fan of dubstep is in position 3.
2. **From Clue 11:** The owner of the mouse is in position 3.
3. **From Clue 5:** The person drinking soy-milk is in position 1 (since the fan of dubstep is in position 3).
4. **From Clue 7:** Since the Dutch has the same parity as the person drinking hot-chocolate, and the Dutch cannot be in position 1 (since the person drinking soy-milk is there), the Dutch must be in position 3 (but we already know that position 3 is for the fan of dubstep). Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in an odd position (1 or 3). Since position 3 is occupied, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1.
5. **From Clue 4:** The Japanese can either be drinking hot-chocolate or be the nurse, but not both. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, the Japanese must be the nurse.
6. **From Clue 6:** The Argentine is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing. The person who's sport is sailing cannot be in position 1 (Japanese) or 3 (dubstep). Therefore, it must be in position 2.
7. **From Clue 3:** The person who's sport is cycling is on the far left or far right. Since the Argentine is in position 2, the person who's sport is cycling must be in position 1 (Japanese) or position 3 (dubstep). But position 1 is occupied by the Japanese, so it must be in position 3 (dubstep). This conflicts with our earlier placement of the fan of dubstep in position 3, so let's re-evaluate:
   - If the person who's sport is cycling is in position 1 (Japanese), then the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 2 (Argentine), which fits.
8. **From Clue 8:** The fan of country is the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 1, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2 (Argentine).
9. **From Clue 9:** The person who's sport is sailing is between the person who's sport is tennis and the fan of dubstep. Since the person who's sport is sailing is in position 2 (Argentine), the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 1 (Japanese) or position 3 (dubstep). But position 3 is occupied by the fan of dubstep, so the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 1 (Japanese).
10. **From Clue 10:** The person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the mouse or the person drinking soy-milk is the Japanese or both. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 1 (Japanese), the Japanese is the owner of the mouse.
11. **From Clue 2:** The Dutch is not the nurse. Since the Japanese is the nurse, the Dutch cannot be in position 1 (Japanese).
12. **From Clue 12:** The person drinking soy-milk is not to the right of the fan of r&b. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 1 (Japanese), the fan of r&b must be in position 2 (Argentine).
13. **From Clue 13:** The fan of dubstep is not to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the fan of dubstep is in position 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate (Japanese) is in position 1.
14. **From Clue 14:** The owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the paramedic. The owner of the rabbit must be in position 3 (dubstep) since the fan of dubstep is in position 3.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
