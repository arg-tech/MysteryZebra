### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Position 1 (American)**: From Clue 19, the American is on the far left.
2. **Position 7 (Epic Movies)**: From Clue 21, the person watching epic movies is on the far right.
3. **Position 2 (Colombian)**: Since the Colombian and the person watching fantasy movies have different parity positions (Clue 1), and the American is at position 1, the Colombian cannot be at position 2. Thus, the Colombian must be at position 3, 5, or 7. But since position 7 is already taken by Epic movies, the Colombian can only be at position 3 or 5.
4. **Position 3 (Hedgehog Owner)**: From Clue 2, the owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right. Since position 1 is occupied by the American, the owner of the hedgehog must be at position 7.
5. **Position 5 (Canadian)**: From Clue 3, the Canadian is the owner of the pony. Since the owner of the hedgehog is at position 7, the Canadian cannot be at position 7. Therefore, the Canadian must be at position 5.
6. **Position 6 (Italian)**: From Clue 28, the Italian and the owner of the pony have different parity positions. Since the Canadian is at position 5, the Italian cannot be at position 5. Also, from Clue 23, the Canadian is to the right of the Italian. Therefore, the Italian must be at position 4.
7. **Position 4 (Time-Travel Movies)**: From Clue 11, the person watching time-travel movies is the Canadian or the owner of the horse or both. Since the Canadian is at position 5, the person watching time-travel movies could be at position 4 (the Italian). But since the Italian is at position 4, the person watching time-travel movies must be the owner of the horse. Therefore, the owner of the horse is at position 4.
8. **Position 2 (Argentine)**: From Clue 10, the Argentine is in an odd position. Since positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 are already taken, the Argentine must be at position 2.
9. **Position 3 (Hedgehog Owner)**: From Clue 4, the owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the American. Since the American is at position 1, the owner of the hedgehog cannot be at position 2. Therefore, the owner of the hedgehog must be at position 7.
10. **Position 3 (Fantasy Movies)**: From Clue 17, the Argentine and the person watching fantasy movies have the same parity positions. Since the Argentine is at position 2, the person watching fantasy movies must be at position 4 (the Italian).
11. **Position 1 (Documentary Movies)**: From Clue 9, the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the person watching fantasy movies is at position 4, the person watching documentary movies must be at position 6.
12. **Position 6 (Chinchilla Owner)**: From Clue 27, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person watching documentary movies is at position 6, the owner of the chinchilla must be at position 5 (the Canadian).
13. **Position 4 (Spy Movies)**: From Clue 29, the owner of the frog is not the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching spy movies is at position 6, the owner of the frog must be at position 3.
14. **Position 5 (Superhero Movies)**: From Clue 13, the person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the Russian. Since the Russian is on the far left or far right, and the American is at position 1, the Russian must be at position 7. Therefore, the person watching superhero movies must be at position 3.
15. **Position 7 (Russian)**: The Russian is on the far right (position 7).

Lv11-3x7-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the appropriate cells. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

### Filling in Known Information:
1. **Clue 5**: Ship (S) in position 4.
2. **Clue 18**: Van (V) is in an odd position (3 or 5).
3. **Clue 6**: V is to the left of the fan classical (C).

Let's assume V is in position 3 for now (we can check if position 5 works later).

```

```

4. **Clue 7**: V is not to the left of R&B (R).
5. **Clue 15**: V and snowboarding (SB) have the same parity (both odd).

Since V is in position 3, SB must be in position 5 (another odd position).

2. The Turkish is in an even position (4 or 6), and the Polish is to the left of the Turkish:
   - If Turkish = 4, then Polish = 1, 2, or 3.
   - If Turkish = 6, then Polish = 1, 2, 3, or 5.

3. The person driving the roller is between the person who's sport is handball and the Turkish:
   - If Turkish = 4, then Roller = 2 or 3, Handball = 1 or 5.
   - If Turkish = 6, then Roller = 4 or 5, Handball = 2 or 3.

4. The person driving the subway is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7) and somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rowing:
   - If Subway = 1, then Rowing = 3, 5, 7.
   - If Subway = 3, then Rowing = 5, 7.
   - If Subway = 5, then Rowing = 7.
   - If Subway = 7, then Rowing = none (not possible).

5. The person driving the taxi is between the person driving the trike and the Argentine:
   - If Taxi = 2, then Trike = 1, Argentine = 3.
   - If Taxi = 3, then Trike = 1, Argentine = 5.
   - If Taxi = 5, then Trike = 1, Argentine = 7.
   - If Taxi = 6, then Trike = 1, Argentine = 7.

6. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person driving the skateboard:
   - Biathlon < Skateboard.

7. The person driving the bike and the person who's sport is biathlon have the same parity positions:
   - Bike and Biathlon have the same parity.

8. The person who's sport is handball and the Canadian have different parity positions:
   - Handball ≠ Canadian (odd/even).

After analyzing all the clues, we can deduce the following placements:

|               |    1     |     2      |     3     |    4     |     5      |    6     |     7     |
