14. **The German is not to the right of the Fan of Funk.**
15. **The Brazilian is not to the right of the Polish.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Positioning the Paramedic**
- The Paramedic is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

**Step 2: Positioning the German**
- The German is on the far left or far right (1 or 5).
- Since the Paramedic can only be in 1, 3, or 5, and the German cannot be in 3, the German must be in 1 or 5.
- Let's assume the German is in position 1.

**Step 3: Positioning the Paramedic**
- Since the German is in position 1, the Paramedic must be in position 3 or 5.
- Assume the Paramedic is in position 3 for now.

**Step 4: Positioning the Brazilian**
- The Paramedic is the Brazilian or the Paramedic is the fan of country or both.
- Since the Paramedic is the Brazilian, the Brazilian is in position 3.
- The Brazilian is not the fan of country (clue 13), so the Brazilian cannot be the fan of any genre.

**Step 5: Positioning the Chinese**
- The Chinese is the fan of country or the Chinese is the analyst or both.
- The Chinese cannot be the analyst because the analyst is between the fan of soul and the Chinese (clue 8), and the Chinese cannot be in position 1 (German) or 3 (Brazilian).
- Therefore, the Chinese must be the fan of country.
- The Chinese must be in position 2 or 4.

**Step 6: Positioning the Analyst**
- The Analyst is between the fan of soul and the Chinese.
- If the Chinese is in position 2, the Analyst must be in position 4.
- If the Chinese is in position 4, the Analyst must be in position 2.
- Assume the Chinese is in position 2 and the Analyst is in position 4.

**Step 7: Positioning the Librarian**
- The Brazilian (position 3) is on the left of the Librarian.
- The Librarian must be in position 4 or 5.
- Since the Analyst is in position 4, the Librarian must be in position 5.

**Step 8: Positioning the Fan of Soul**
- The Fan of Soul is not to the left of the Brazilian.
- The Fan of Soul must be in position 4 or 5.
- Since the Analyst is in position 4 and the Librarian is in position 5, the Fan of Soul must be in position 5.

**Step 9: Positioning the Fan of Punk**
- The Fan of Punk is between the Polish and the Teacher.
- The Fan of Punk is on the left of the German (position 1).
- The Polish and the Teacher must be in positions 2 and 4.
- Since the Chinese is in position 2 and the Analyst is in position 4, the Polish must be in position 2 and the Teacher in position 4.
- This contradicts our earlier assumption that the Chinese is in position 2 and the Analyst is in position 4.
- Reassess: Assume the Chinese is in position 4 and the Analyst is in position 2.

**Step 10: Final Adjustments**
- The Fan of Soul is not to the left of the Brazilian.
- The Fan of Soul must be in position 5.
- The Polish is in position 3.
- The Teacher is in position 4.
- The Librarian is in position 1.

   - Rugby > Water-polo

3. **From clue 6:** The person who's sport is volleyball is in the middle.
   - Volleyball = 3

4. **From clue 11:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
   - Weightlifting < Rugby

5. **From clue 12:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.
   - Weightlifting < Volleyball (already known to be 3)
   - Weightlifting ≤ 2

   - Skydiving < Weightlifting ≤ 2

7. **From clue 8:** The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
   - Fishing = Board-games or Fishing ≠ Board-games

8. **From clue 14:** The person who's hobby is traveling is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's hobby is board-games.
   - Traveling = 2, Board-games = 1 or 4 (since Rugby > Traveling)

9. **From clue 2:** The person who's hobby is fishing is not to the left of the fan d&b.
   - Fishing ≥ Fan d&b

10. **From clue 3:** The fan blues is on the left of the fan hip-hop.

### Combining Clues:

- From clues 11 and 12, we can infer:
  - Fan funk < Fan folk ≤ 3
  - Fan blues < Fan hip-hop

- From clue 13:
  - Fan funk < 3 (Volleyball is 3)

- From clue 15:
  - Weightlifting = Skydiving or Weightlifting = Fan funk

- From clue 14:
  - Traveling = 2, Board-games = 1 or 4 (since Rugby > Traveling)

### Positioning:

   - Weightlifting = 1
   - Rugby = 4
   - Water-polo = 2 (since Rugby > Water-polo)

2. From clue 14, Traveling = 2, so Board-games must be 1.
3. From clue 15, since Weightlifting = 1 and it can either be Skydiving or Fan funk, and we already placed Weightlifting as 1, it must be Skydiving.
4. From clue 1, Fan blues is between Rugby (4) and Weightlifting (1), so Fan blues must be 2.
5. From clue 3, Fan blues < Fan hip-hop, and Fan blues is 2, so Fan hip-hop must be 3.
6. From clue 4, Fan folk is not to the left of Fan funk, and Fan funk < 3, so Fan funk must be 1 (Skydiving).
7. From clue 8, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games, and Board-games is 1 (Skydiving), so Fishing must be 4 or 5.
8. From clue 10, Fan hip-hop is not to the right of Fan folk, and Fan folk is 1, so Fan hip-hop must be 2 (Blues).
9. From clue 9, the person who's hobby is skydiving is the fan funk or the person who's sport is water-polo is the person who's hobby is fishing, but not both, and we've placed Skydiving as 1, so Fishing must be 5.
