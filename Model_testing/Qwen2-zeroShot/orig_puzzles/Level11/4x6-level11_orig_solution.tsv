```

### Explanation of Solution:

1. **Owner of the Dog (Clue 1, 27):** The owner of the dog is in an odd position and to the right of the person eating artichoke. This places the owner of the dog in position 3 (since it must be in an odd position and to the right of artichoke). So, the owner of the dog is in position 3 with the pet ""dog"".

2. **Person Eating Artichoke (Clue 2, 28):** The person eating artichoke cannot be to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the owner of the dog is in position 3, the person eating artichoke must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the person eating artichoke is in position 1 for now.

3. **Person Drinking Lemonade (Clue 2):** The person drinking lemonade and the person eating artichoke have the same parity positions. If the person eating artichoke is in position 1 (odd), then the person drinking lemonade must also be in an odd position. This can only be position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is taken by artichoke, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3. So, the person drinking lemonade is in position 3.

4. **Person Drinking Almond-Milk (Clue 3):** The person driving the boat is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. This means the person drinking almond-milk must be in an odd position. The only remaining odd position is 1. So, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1.

5. **Person Drinking Iced-Tea (Clue 5, 20, 30):** The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2 or 3. From Clue 20, the person driving the train and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions. The only position that fits is 4. So, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 4.

6. **Person Drinking Coffee (Clue 14):** The person drinking coffee is not to the left of the owner of the ferret. The owner of the ferret must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 2 and 6. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 4, the owner of the ferret must be in position 2 or 6. If the owner of the ferret is in position 2, then the person drinking coffee must be in position 3. But position 3 is already taken by lemonade. So, the owner of the ferret must be in position 6, and the person drinking coffee must be in position 2.

7. **Person Drinking Sprite (Clue 21, 29):** The person drinking sprite is the owner of the chinchilla and is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train. The person driving the train must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 4 and 6. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 4, the person driving the train must be in position 6. So, the person drinking sprite is in position 5.

8. **Person Driving the Boat (Clue 3):** The person driving the boat is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1, the person driving the boat must be in position 2 or 3. But position 3 is taken by lemonade. So, the person driving the boat must be in position 2.

9. **Person Driving the Helicopter (Clue 26, 26):** The person driving the helicopter is between the owner of the dog and the person driving the airplane. The owner of the dog is in position 3, and the person driving the airplane must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 2 and 4. Since position 2 is taken by the person driving the boat, the person driving the airplane must be in position 4. So, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 5.

10. **Person Driving the Airplane (Clue 23):** The person driving the airplane is the owner of the hedgehog or the person eating artichoke is the person driving the airplane. Since the person eating artichoke is in position 1, the person driving the airplane must be in position 4.

11. **Person Driving the Bike (Clue 17, 18):** The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog and the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person driving the bike. The owner of the dog is in position 3, so the person driving the bike must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 2 is taken by the person driving the boat, the person driving the bike must be in position 1. The owner of the ferret must be in position 6.

12. **Person Eating Pomegranate (Clue 6, 22):** The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person eating banana. The person eating banana is in position 1, so the person eating pomegranate must be in position 2 or 3. Since position 2 is taken by the person driving the boat, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 3.

13. **Person Eating Nectarine (Clue 13):** The person eating nectarine is somewhere between the person drinking sprite and the person drinking coffee. The person drinking sprite is in position 5, and the person drinking coffee is in position 2. So, the person eating nectarine must be in position 4.

16. **Person Eating Chinchilla (Clue 24):** The person drinking sprite is the owner of the chinchilla. The person drinking sprite is in position 5, so the person eating chinchilla must be in position 5.
