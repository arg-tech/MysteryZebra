Lv11-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The fan of disco and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions**:
   - This means if the fan of disco is in an odd position, the person drinking soy-milk must be in an odd position, and vice versa.

2. **The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the far left (position 1)**:
   - So, the hobby is sudoku in position 1.

3. **The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk**:
   - This means rock-climbing can be in position 1 or 2 if soy-milk is in position 2 or 3, or it can be in position 2 or 3 if soy-milk is in position 1 or 2.

4. **The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk**:
   - If soy-milk is in position 1, coffee must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If soy-milk is in position 2, coffee must be in position 3.
   - If soy-milk is in position 3, there's no restriction.

5. **The fan disco is the designer or the designer is the person drinking mirinda, but not both**:
   - This means either the designer is the fan of disco or the person drinking mirinda is the fan of disco, but not both.

6. **The fan rock and the person drinking coffee have different parity positions**:
   - If coffee is in an odd position, rock must be in an even position, and vice versa.

7. **The person drinking mirinda is the doctor or the person drinking mirinda is the fan disco or both**:
   - This means either the doctor drinks mirinda, the fan of disco drinks mirinda, or both.

8. **The doctor and the fan disco have different parity positions**:
   - If the doctor is in an odd position, the fan of disco must be in an even position, and vice versa.

9. **The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the designer**:
   - Rock-climbing cannot be in the same position as the designer.

10. **The journalist is on the left of the fan rock**:
    - The journalist cannot be in the same position as the fan of rock, and the journalist must be in a position to the left of the fan of rock.

### Deductions:

1. From constraint 2, the hobby is sudoku in position 1.
2. From constraint 5, we need to consider the fan of disco being the designer or the person drinking mirinda being the fan of disco.
3. From constraint 7, the person drinking mirinda is the doctor or the fan of disco, or both.
4. From constraint 8, the doctor and the fan of disco have different parity positions.

Let's start with some logical placements:

- Position 1: Sudoku (from constraint 2).
- Position 3: The fan of rock (from constraint 10).

Now let's place the fan of disco and the person drinking mirinda:

- Since the fan of disco and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions (constraint 1), and the person drinking soy-milk is to the right of the person drinking coffee (constraint 4), the fan of disco cannot be in position 1 (since it would force the person drinking soy-milk to be in an even position, which would conflict with the fan of disco needing to be in an odd position due to constraint 5).

Let's try placing the fan of disco in position 3:

- If the fan of disco is in position 3, then the person drinking soy-milk must also be in position 3 (same parity). But this conflicts with constraint 4 since the person drinking coffee must be to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Thus, the fan of disco cannot be in position 3.

Next, let's try the fan of disco in position 2:

- If the fan of disco is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2 (same parity). But this also conflicts with constraint 4 since the person drinking coffee must be to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

Therefore, the fan of disco must be in position 1, making the person drinking soy-milk in position 2 (since they must have the same parity).

- Position 1: Fan of disco (designer or fan of disco).
- Position 2: Person drinking soy-milk (doctor or fan of disco).

Since the person drinking mirinda is the doctor or the fan of disco (constraint 7):

- Position 2: Person drinking soy-milk (must be the doctor, so the person drinking mirinda is the fan of disco).

Now, the person drinking coffee must be to the right of the person drinking soy-milk (constraint 4):

- Position 3: Person drinking coffee (since position 2 is the person drinking soy-milk).

Finally, the fan of rock and the person drinking coffee must have different parity positions (constraint 6):

- Position 3: Person drinking coffee (odd position), so the fan of rock must be in position 2 (even position).

- Position 1: Fan of disco (designer).
- Position 2: Person drinking soy-milk (doctor).
- Position 3: Person drinking coffee (journalist).

Now, let's place the remaining hobbies and jobs:

- Position 1: Fan of disco (designer) -> Hobby: rock-climbing (since the designer is not rock-climbing, it must be the other two).
- Position 2: Person drinking soy-milk (doctor) -> Hobby: board-games (since the person drinking soy-milk is not rock-climbing and the designer has rock-climbing).
- Position 3: Person drinking coffee (journalist) -> Hobby: sudoku (since the person drinking coffee is not rock-climbing and the person drinking soy-milk has board-games).

Thus, the final arrangement is:

```
|               |     1      |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Mirinda      | Soy-milk    |
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Board-games | Sudoku     |
| Job           | Designer  | Doctor       | Journalist |
| Music-Genre   | Disco     | Punk         | Rock       |

Lv11-4x3-2	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step and use them to fill out the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 3:** The person drinking lemonade is on the far left.
   - Lemonade is in position 1.

2. **Clue 1 & 2:** The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person eating cabbage.
   - Since the person drinking lemonade (clue 3) is in position 1, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2 (left of the person eating cabbage).

3. **Clue 4:** The architect and the person eating peas have the same parity positions.
   - This means if the architect is in an odd position, the person eating peas must also be in an odd position; if the architect is in an even position, the person eating peas must also be in an even position.

4. **Clue 5:** The person eating cauliflower is between the person eating cabbage and the owner of the goldfish.
   - If we denote the positions as 1, 2, and 3, then the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2 (between positions 1 and 3), meaning the person eating cabbage and the owner of the goldfish must be in positions 1 and 3 respectively.

5. **Clue 6:** The person eating peas is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade.
   - Since the person drinking lemonade is in position 1, the person eating peas cannot be in position 2 or 3.

6. **Clue 7:** The dancer is the person eating peas or the owner of the goldfish or both.
   - This means the dancer can be in position 2 (if the person eating peas is there) or in position 3 (if the owner of the goldfish is there).

7. **Clue 8:** The owner of the fish is in the middle.
   - The owner of the fish must be in position 2.

### Putting It All Together:

- Position 1: Lemonade (from clue 3)
- Position 2: Coffee (from clue 2)
- Position 3: Mirinda (since all three beverages must be used and lemonade and coffee are already placed)

- Position 2: Coffee (from clue 2)
- Position 1: Lemonade (from clue 3)
- Position 3: Mirinda

Now, let's place the food and jobs based on the remaining clues:

- Position 1: Lemonade (far left)
- Position 2: Coffee
- Position 3: Mirinda

Since the person eating peas cannot be in position 2 (coffee drinker), and the person eating peas is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade (position 1), the person eating peas must be in position 3.

- Position 1: Lemonade
- Position 2: Coffee
- Position 3: Peas (eating peas)

The architect and the person eating peas have the same parity positions (both are in even positions), so the architect must be in position 2 (coffee drinker).

- Position 1: Lemonade
- Position 2: Coffee (architect)
- Position 3: Peas

The person eating cauliflower is between the person eating cabbage and the owner of the goldfish. Since the person eating peas is in position 3, the person eating cabbage must be in position 1 (lemonade drinker), and the owner of the goldfish must be in position 3 (peas eater).

- Position 1: Cabbage
- Position 2: Coffee (architect)
- Position 3: Peas (goldfish owner)

The dancer can be either in position 2 (architect) or in position 3 (goldfish owner). Given that the owner of the goldfish is in position 3, the dancer must be in position 2 (architect).

- Position 1: Cabbage
- Position 2: Coffee (architect)
- Position 3: Peas (goldfish owner)

Finally, the pet information:
- Position 1: Cabbage
- Position 2: Coffee (architect, gold)
- Position 3: Peas (goldfish owner, pony)

7. The lawyer is not to the right of the person eating spinach.
8. The analyst either drives the skateboard or has the hobby of fishing, but not both.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 6: The person driving the snowmobile is in the middle.
This means the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2 (Hobby).

#### Clue 2: The person driving the snowmobile is to the left of the person whose hobby is fishing.
Since the snowmobile driver is in position 2, the person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 3 (Job).

#### Clue 8: The analyst either drives the skateboard or has the hobby of fishing, but not both.
Since the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 3 (Job), the analyst cannot have the hobby of fishing. Therefore, the analyst must drive the skateboard.

4. The police-officer is on the left of the dressmaker.
5. The police-officer is somewhere to the right of the mechanic.
6. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the police-officer have different parity positions.
7. The person eating cherry is not the fan of jazz.
8. The person eating cherry is somewhere to the right of the police-officer.
9. The person eating radish is the mechanic.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Hobbies and Preferences
1. Rock-climbing -> Dubstep
2. Dressmaker vs Photography -> Different parity positions (odd/even)

#### Step 2: Identify the Jobs and Foods
9. Radish -> Mechanic
3. Mechanic -> Watermelon or Jazz
4. Police-officer -> Left of Dressmaker
5. Police-officer -> Right of Mechanic
6. Rock-climbing -> Different parity from Police-officer

#### Step 3: Analyze Parity Positions
From clue 5 and 6, we know:
- Police-officer is in an odd position (since it must be right of the mechanic and left of the dressmaker)
- Rock-climbing is in an even position (since it must be different from the police-officer)

#### Step 4: Assign Positions Based on Parity
- Police-officer is in position 1 (odd)
- Rock-climbing is in position 2 (even)
- Dressmaker is in position 3 (odd)

#### Step 5: Use the Information About the Mechanic
- Mechanic is in position 3 (radish)
- Mechanic can be either Watermelon or Jazz

Since the mechanic is in position 3, the police-officer must be in position 1 (left of the dressmaker).

#### Step 6: Determine the Remaining Preferences
- Since the police-officer is in position 1, the person with rock-climbing must be in position 2.
- The person with photography must be in position 3 (dressmaker), and since the police-officer is in position 1, the person with photography cannot be in position 1.

#### Step 7: Assign the Remaining Foods and Hobbies
- Position 1: Police-officer -> Cannot be rock-climbing, must be either watermelon or jazz.
- Position 2: Rock-climbing -> Dubstep
- Position 3: Dressmaker -> Photography

Since the police-officer is in position 1 and cannot be rock-climbing, and the mechanic is in position 3, the police-officer must be the fan of jazz (since the mechanic could be either watermelon or jazz, but the police-officer is not rock-climbing).

#### Step 8: Finalize the Table
- Position 1: Police-officer -> Jazz
- Position 2: Rock-climbing -> Dubstep
- Position 3: Dressmaker -> Photography

Since the person eating cherry is not the fan of jazz and is somewhere to the right of the police-officer, the person eating cherry must be in position 3 (dressmaker).

- Position 1: Police-officer -> Jazz
- Position 2: Rock-climbing -> Dubstep
- Position 3: Dressmaker -> Photography (cherry)

Since the person eating radish is the mechanic, and the mechanic is in position 3, the person eating radish is the mechanic.

- Position 1: Police-officer -> Jazz
- Position 2: Rock-climbing -> Dubstep
- Position 3: Mechanic -> Radish (cherry)

Finally, the person eating watermelon must be the dressmaker since the mechanic is the person eating radish.

- Position 1: Police-officer -> Jazz
- Position 2: Rock-climbing -> Dubstep
- Position 3: Mechanic -> Radish (cherry)
- Position 3: Dressmaker -> Watermelon (photography)

Lv11-4x3-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 7:
- The Mexican is in the middle.
This means the Mexican must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |    2     |       3        |
| Job           |           | Mexican  |                |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |                |
| Nationality   |           | Mexican  |                |
| Sport         |           |          |                |

#### Clue 1:
- The Mexican is not the police-officer.
Since the Mexican is in position 2, they cannot be the police-officer.

#### Clue 3:
- The person whose sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person whose sport is sailing.
- The person whose sport is sailing is in the middle (position 2).

So, the person whose sport is swimming can be in positions 1 or 3.

#### Clue 5:
- The person whose sport is sailing is in the middle.
This confirms that the person whose sport is sailing is in position 2.

|               |     1     |    2     |       3        |
| Job           |           | Sailing  |                |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |                |
| Nationality   |           | Mexican  |                |
| Sport         | Swimming  | Sailing  |                |

#### Clue 3 (revisited):
- The person whose sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person whose sport is sailing.
Since the person whose sport is sailing is in position 2, the person whose sport is swimming must be in position 1 or 3.

#### Clue 4:
- The person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the engineer.
This means the engineer and the person watching musical movies must be in adjacent positions (1 and 2, or 2 and 3).

#### Clue 9:
- The engineer is on the left of the police-officer.
This means the engineer must be in position 1 or 2, and the police-officer must be in position 2 or 3. Given that the engineer and the person watching musical movies are adjacent, we need to consider these constraints.

#### Clue 10:
- The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person watching western movies.
This means the person watching western movies must be in position 1 or 2, and the person watching romance movies must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 6:
- The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is skiing.
This means the person whose sport is skiing must be in position 1 or 2, and the person watching romance movies must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 2:
- The Russian is the person watching romance movies or the person whose sport is swimming is the Russian or both.
Given the previous constraints, let's test if the Russian is the person whose sport is swimming (Swimming) or the person watching romance movies.

#### Clue 11:
- The Brazilian is the person whose sport is skiing or the Brazilian is the person watching western movies, but not both.
This means the Brazilian must be in one of these positions, but not both.

### Final Placement:

From the constraints and logical deductions:

- The Mexican is in position 2 (Nationality).
- The person whose sport is sailing is in position 2.
- The person whose sport is swimming is in position 1.
- The person watching musical movies is in position 3 (since the engineer is on the left of the police-officer, and the engineer must be in position 1 or 2, and the person watching musical movies is adjacent to the engineer).
- The person watching western movies is in position 1 (since the person watching romance movies is to the right of the person watching western movies, and the person watching romance movies cannot be in position 1 due to the Russian constraint).

Thus, the final solution is:

```

   - This means if someone drinks hot-chocolate, they must be in position 1 or 2, and the owner of the lizard must be in position 2 or 3.

2. **The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the owner of the goat.**
   - This means if the owner of the goat is in position 1, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the owner of the goat is in position 2, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 3.

3. **The person driving the van is on the far right.**
   - The person driving the van is in position 3.

4. **The person whose hobby is singing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
   - This means if someone drinks hot-chocolate, their hobby is singing must be in position 1 or 2.

5. **The person drinking coffee is the person who's hobby is traveling or the person drinking coffee is the owner of the bird or both.**
   - This means the person drinking coffee could be either the owner of the bird or the person with the hobby of traveling, or both.

6. **The owner of the lizard and the person driving the snowmobile have different parity positions.**
   - This means if one is in an odd position (1 or 3), the other must be in an even position (2).

### Filling the Table:

#### Position 3:
- **Transport:** Van (given)
- **Beverage:** (to be determined)
- **Hobby:** (to be determined)
- **Pet:** (to be determined)

Since the van is in position 3, the person driving the van is in position 3.

#### Position 2:
- **Transport:** (to be determined)
- **Beverage:** (to be determined)
- **Hobby:** (to be determined)
- **Pet:** Lizard (from clue 1)

From clue 1, the owner of the lizard is in position 2, so we place the lizard here.

#### Position 1:
- **Transport:** (to be determined)
- **Beverage:** Hot-Chocolate (from clue 1)
- **Hobby:** Singing (from clue 4)
- **Pet:** (to be determined)

From clue 4, the person with the hobby of singing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so they must be in position 1. From clue 1, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3, so the person with the hobby of singing is in position 1.

#### Position 3:
- **Transport:** Snowmobile (from clue 2)
- **Beverage:** (to be determined)
- **Hobby:** (to be determined)
- **Pet:** Goat (from clue 2)

From clue 2, the person driving the snowmobile is in position 3, and since the owner of the goat must be to the left of this person, the owner of the goat is in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is already taken by the person with the hobby of singing, the owner of the goat must be in position 2. Therefore, the person in position 3 driving the snowmobile must own the goat.

#### Final Table:

8. **The person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the fan of country.**
   - The musical movie watcher is not in the first position if the country fan is in the first position.

9. **The person who's sport is sailing is not the owner of the pony.**

11. **The person who's sport is sailing is in an even position.**
    - The sailing enthusiast is in either position 2 or 4.

### Solving the Puzzle:

Let's start placing the information based on the clues:

1. **Positioning the Sailing Enthusiast:**
   - From clue 11, the sailing enthusiast is in position 2 or 4.
   - From clue 8, the musical movie watcher is to the right of the country fan.
   - From clue 10, the pony owner cannot be to the left of the musical movie watcher.
   - From clue 9, the sailing enthusiast is not the pony owner.
   
   If the sailing enthusiast is in position 2, then:
   - Position 1: Country fan (since the musical movie watcher is to the right).
   - Position 3: Musical movie watcher.
   - Position 4: Not the pony owner (since the pony owner cannot be to the left of the musical movie watcher).

2. **Determining the Pony Owner:**
   - The pony owner cannot be in position 1 (country fan) or 2 (sailing enthusiast).
   - Therefore, the pony owner must be in position 3.
   - This means the musical movie watcher is in position 3.

3. **Determining the Goat Owner:**
   - From clue 1, the goat owner is between the country fan and the musical movie watcher.
   - Since the country fan is in position 1 and the musical movie watcher is in position 3, the goat owner must be in position 2.

4. **Determining the Sports:**
   - From clue 5, the weightlifter is not to the right of the action movie watcher.
   - From clue 7, the pop fan is the action movie watcher or the weightlifter.
   - From clue 8, the musical movie watcher is to the right of the country fan.
   - From clue 4, the weightlifter cannot be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the weightlifter must be in position 3 (the same as the musical movie watcher), which contradicts the previous placement.
   
   Revisiting the clues, the only way to satisfy all conditions is:
   - Action movie watcher in position 1.
   - Pop fan in position 2 (goat owner).
   - Musical movie watcher in position 3.
   - Weightlifter in position 4.

5. **Determining the Pets and Genres:**
   - From clue 3, the frog owner is not the techno fan.
   - From clue 6, the goat owner is not the pop fan.
   - Therefore, the techno fan must be in position 4 (weightlifter).
