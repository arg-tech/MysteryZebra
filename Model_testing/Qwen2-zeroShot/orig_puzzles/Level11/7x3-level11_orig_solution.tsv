Lv11-7x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step-by-step. Let's start by organizing the clues and solving them one by one.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The firefighter is the person who's hobby is dancing or the firefighter is the egyptian or both.
2. The Spanish is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.
3. The person eating pumpkin is on the far left or far right.
4. The Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Egyptian.
5. The person whose sport is climbing and the Japanese have different parity positions (odd/even).
6. The person whose hobby is baking is between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking juice.
7. The Japanese is on the left or right of the software-developer.
8. The person whose hobby is drawing is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade.
9. The person whose hobby is dancing is the Japanese or the person whose hobby is dancing is the person whose sport is weightlifting, but not both.
10. The person driving the roller is not the person drinking lemonade.
11. The person driving the roller is between the person whose hobby is drawing and the person whose sport is weightlifting.
12. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the scooter.
13. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions for Pumpkin and Lemonade Drinkers
- From clue 3, the person eating pumpkin is on the far left or far right.
- From clue 2, the Spanish is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.

Since there are only three positions, if the person eating pumpkin is on the far left or right, the other two must be in the middle. Also, since the Spanish is on the left or right of the lemonade drinker, let's assume the Spanish is on the right side of the lemonade drinker.

#### Step 2: Determine the Firefighter and Egyptian
- From clue 1, the firefighter is either the person with the hobby of dancing or the Egyptian or both.
- From clue 4, the Spanish is to the right of the Egyptian.

Let's assume the Egyptian is on position 1 (leftmost), and the Spanish is on position 3 (rightmost). This leaves the firefighter on position 2.

#### Step 3: Determine the Sports and Parity Positions
- From clue 5, the person whose sport is climbing and the Japanese have different parity positions.
- Since the Japanese is on the rightmost position (position 3), the sport of climbing must be on an odd position (1 or 2).

Let's assume the sport of climbing is on position 1, which means the Japanese is on position 3.

#### Step 4: Determine the Hobbies and Foods
- From clue 6, the person whose hobby is baking is between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking juice.
- From clue 8, the person whose hobby is drawing is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade.

Since the Spanish is on the rightmost position (position 3), the person drinking lemonade cannot be the Spanish. Let's assume the person drinking lemonade is on position 1, and the person drinking iced-tea is on position 2 (between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking juice).

#### Step 5: Determine the Remaining Positions
- From clue 12, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the scooter.
- From clue 11, the person driving the roller is between the person whose hobby is drawing and the person whose sport is weightlifting.

Let's summarize the positions so far:
- Position 1: Egyptian, drinking lemonade
- Position 2: Firefighter, drinking iced-tea
- Position 3: Japanese, not drinking lemonade

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:
- The person whose hobby is baking is between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking juice.
- The person whose hobby is drawing is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade.
- The person driving the roller is between the person whose hobby is drawing and the person whose sport is weightlifting.
- The person driving the trike is the person whose sport is weightlifting.
- The person driving the scooter is the person whose sport is climbing.

### Final Table:

```
|               |       1       |         2          |       3        |
| Beverage      | lemonade      | iced-tea           |                |
| Food          | apple         | cabbage            | pumpkin        |
| Hobby         | drawing       | baking             | dancing        |

  | Food          |            |               |            |
  | Job           |            |               |            |
  | Music-Genre   |            |               |            |
  | Pet           |            |               |            |
  | Sport         |            |               |            |
  | Transport     |            |               |            |
  ```

### Step 2: Place Clue 7
- The electrician (who drinks soy-milk) is between the person eating cranberry and the person eating onion.
  - Since the electrician is in position 3, the person eating cranberry must be in position 1 and the person eating onion must be in position 2.
  ```plaintext

  | Beverage      |            |               |    soy-milk|
  | Food          | cranberry  |    onion      |            |

  | Transport     |            |               |            |
  ```

### Step 3: Place Clue 14
- The person eating onion and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions.
  - Since the person eating onion is in position 2 (an even position), the person driving the tram must also be in an even position (2 or 4). However, position 2 is already occupied by the person eating onion, so the person driving the tram must be in position 4.

  | Transport     |            |               |    tram    |
  ```

### Step 4: Place Clue 13
- The person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
  - The person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since those positions are already occupied). Therefore, it must be in position 3.
  - The owner of the chinchilla must be in position 1 or 2.

  | Transport     |            |               |    tram    |
  ```

### Step 5: Place Clue 16
- The owner of the chinchilla and the paramedic have different parity positions.
  - Since the owner of the chinchilla is in position 1 (an odd position), the paramedic must be in position 2 (an even position).
  ```plaintext

  | Transport     |            |               |    tram    |
  ```

### Step 6: Place Clue 5
- The person driving the helicopter is the fan d&b or the fan d&b is the owner of the goat, but not both.
  - The person driving the helicopter is in position 4.
  - The owner of the goat cannot be in position 4 because the paramedic is in position 2.
  - Therefore, the person driving the helicopter must be the fan d&b.
  ```plaintext

  | Fan d&b       |            |    d&b        |            |
  ```

### Step 7: Place Clue 6
- The person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person driving the tram.
  - This is already satisfied since the person driving the helicopter is in position 4 and the person driving the tram is in position 3.

### Step 8: Place Clue 9
- The accountant is not to the left of the owner of the goat.
  - The accountant cannot be in position 1 or 2 because the paramedic is in position 2 and the owner of the goat cannot be in position 1.
  - Therefore, the accountant must be in position 3.

  | Fan d&b       |            |    d&b        |            |
  ```

### Step 9: Place Clue 10
- The person eating cranberry is the person drinking soy-milk or the person eating cranberry is the person driving the car or both.
  - Since the person eating cranberry is in position 1, they are not the person drinking soy-milk (which is in position 3).
  - Therefore, the person eating cranberry must be the person driving the car.
