13. **Clue 13:** The person who's sport is handball and the person drinking coffee have the same parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 5:** The person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
   - \( \text{Hobby} = \text{Rock-climbing}, \text{Beverage} = \text{Cola} \)

2. **From Clue 1:** The person drinking cola (rock-climbing) is to the right of the person who's sport is handball.
   - Since cola is in position 2 or 4, handball must be in position 1 or 3.
   - Let's assume handball is in position 1 (we will check consistency later).

3. **From Clue 3:** The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
   - If handball is in position 1, sprite must be in position 2 (since cola is in position 2 or 4).

4. **From Clue 2:** The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.
   - If sprite is in position 2, swimming must be in position 3 or 4, and fanta must be in position 4.

5. **From Clue 7:** The person who's sport is cricket is in an even position (positions 2 or 4).
   - Since fanta is in position 4, cricket must be in position 2.

6. **From Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
   - Since writing is in position 4, filmmaking must be in position 1 or 2.

7. **From Clue 10:** The person who's hobby is writing and the person who's sport is cricket have the same parity positions.
   - Writing is in position 4, so cricket must also be in position 2 (which is consistent with our previous placement).

8. **From Clue 11:** The person who's sport is swimming is not to the left of the person drinking cola.
   - Swimming cannot be in position 1 because cola is in position 2 or 4.

9. **From Clue 12:** The person drinking fanta is the person who's sport is cricket or the person who's sport is cricket is the person who's hobby is writing or both.
   - Since fanta is in position 4 and cricket is in position 2, this is consistent.

10. **From Clue 4:** The person drinking coffee is not to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
    - Coffee cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4.

11. **From Clue 9:** The person drinking coffee is not to the right of the person who's sport is handball.
    - Coffee cannot be in position 4 if handball is in position 1.

12. **From Clue 8:** The person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's sport is cricket have different parity positions.
    - Fishing cannot be in position 2 (same parity as cricket).

13. **Final Placement:**
    - Position 1: Filmmaking (writing must be in position 4)
    - Position 2: Handball
    - Position 3: Coffee
    - Position 4: Rock-climbing (cola), Cricket (fanta), Writing

5. **Clue 5:** The British is in an even position.
6. **Clue 6:** The person eating pineapple is not to the left of the person eating grapefruit.
7. **Clue 7:** The Japanese is the person watching thriller movies or the person watching thriller movies is the person eating pineapple or both.
8. **Clue 8:** The Indonesian and the person eating watermelon have different parity positions.
9. **Clue 9:** The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the Japanese.
10. **Clue 10:** The person watching scientific movies is not to the left of the Indonesian.
11. **Clue 11:** The person eating grapefruit is not to the right of the British.
12. **Clue 12:** The person eating pineapple and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions.
13. **Clue 13:** The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon.
14. **Clue 14:** The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the person eating pineapple.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the even positions for the British:
- **Clue 5:** The British is in an even position. So, the British can be in positions 2 or 4.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions for the Japanese:
- **Clue 4:** The Japanese is not to the right of the person eating grapefruit.
- **Clue 14:** The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the person eating pineapple.
- **Clue 7:** The Japanese is the person watching thriller movies or the person watching thriller movies is the person eating pineapple or both.
- From these clues, if the Japanese is the person watching thriller movies, then the person eating pineapple must be to the right of the Japanese. But since the Japanese cannot be to the right of the person eating grapefruit, the Japanese must be the person watching thriller movies, and the person eating pineapple must be to the right of the Japanese.

#### Step 3: Determine the positions for the person eating grapefruit:
- **Clue 1:** The person eating grapefruit and the person watching thriller movies have the same parity positions.
- Since the Japanese is the person watching thriller movies, the person eating grapefruit must be in an even position (position 2 or 4).
- **Clue 11:** The person eating grapefruit is not to the right of the British.
- Therefore, the person eating grapefruit must be in position 2.

#### Step 4: Determine the positions for the person eating pineapple:
- **Clue 6:** The person eating pineapple is not to the left of the person eating grapefruit.
- **Clue 13:** The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon.
- **Clue 12:** The person eating pineapple and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions.
- The person eating pineapple must be in an odd position (position 1, 3), and it must be to the right of the person eating grapefruit. So, the person eating pineapple must be in position 3.

#### Step 5: Determine the positions for the person eating potato:
- **Clue 2:** The person eating potato and the Indonesian have the same parity positions.
- The person eating potato must be in an even position (position 2 or 4).
- **Clue 8:** The Indonesian and the person eating watermelon have different parity positions.
- Since the person eating grapefruit is in position 2, the person eating potato cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the person eating potato must be in position 4.

#### Step 6: Determine the remaining positions:
- **Clue 3:** The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating pineapple.
- The person eating pineapple is in position 3, so the person watching mystery movies must be in position 1.
- **Clue 9:** The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the Japanese.
- The person watching mystery movies is in position 1, so the Japanese must be in position 2 or 4.
- **Clue 10:** The person watching scientific movies is not to the left of the Indonesian.
- The person watching scientific movies must be in position 3 (the person eating pineapple), and the Indonesian must be in position 4.
- **Clue 13:** The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon.
- The person eating watermelon must be in position 1 (the person watching mystery movies).

9. The social-worker is on the left of the fan of reggae.
10. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing.
11. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the fan of reggae have different parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The dancer is the person who's hobby is fishing.
   - Fishing -> Dancer

2. **Clue 6**: The person who's hobby is photography is the fan of folk.
   - Photography -> Folk

3. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is cooking is between the fan of blues and the fan of folk.
   - Cooking must be between Blues and Folk.
   - Since Folk is Photography, Cooking must be between Blues and Photography.
   - Possible order: Blues -> Cooking -> Photography (Folk)

4. **Clue 4**: The fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
   - Blues -> Photography (Folk)
   - This means Blues must be in position 1 or 2.

5. **Clue 5**: The musician is on the left of the social-worker.
   - Musician -> Social-worker (Left of Social-worker)

6. **Clue 9**: The social-worker is on the left of the fan of reggae.
   - Social-worker -> Reggae (Left of Reggae)

7. **Clue 8**: The social-worker and the fan of blues have the same parity positions.
   - If Blues is in an odd position, so is Social-worker.
   - If Blues is in an even position, so is Social-worker.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who's hobby is photography is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing.
   - Photography (Folk) -> Fishing (Dancer)
   - This confirms Photography and Fishing are adjacent.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the fan of reggae have different parity positions.
   - Rock-climbing and Reggae have opposite parities.

Given these constraints, let's assign positions:

- Blues can only be in position 1 (odd) or 2 (even).
- If Blues is in position 1, then Photography (Folk) is in position 2.
- If Blues is in position 2, then Photography (Folk) is in position 3.

Since Blues and Social-worker have the same parity and Social-worker is on the left of Reggae, we can deduce:

- If Blues is in position 1, Social-worker must be in position 2 (even).
- If Blues is in position 2, Social-worker must be in position 3 (odd).

Given Blues is in position 1, Social-worker is in position 2, and Photography is in position 2 (Folk), this creates a conflict. Therefore, Blues must be in position 2, making Social-worker in position 3 and Photography in position 3 (Folk).

Thus, the correct positions are:
- Blues -> 2
- Photography -> 3 (Folk)
- Fishing -> 1 (Dancer)
- Social-worker -> 3 (Musician)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6:** The person watching epic movies is the fan of reggae.
   - This means the person in position 3 is the fan of reggae (since the person watching epic movies must be either 1 or 3).

2. **Clue 14:** The fan of reggae is the Canadian.
   - Therefore, the Canadian is in position 3.

3. **Clue 12:** The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies.
   - This means the person watching fantasy movies cannot be in position 4 (the rightmost position), and the person watching drama movies cannot be in position 1 (the leftmost position).

4. **Clue 3:** The person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right.
   - Since the person watching epic movies is in position 3 (the Canadian), this clue does not add new information here.

5. **Clue 1:** The Canadian is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
   - Since the Canadian is in position 3, the person watching fantasy movies cannot be in position 1 or 2.

6. **Clue 8:** The person watching drama movies is on the left of the fan of reggae.
   - Since the fan of reggae is in position 3, the person watching drama movies must be in position 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 9:** The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the fan of jazz.
   - The person watching fantasy movies cannot be in position 4, and the fan of jazz cannot be in position 1 (leftmost).

    - The Spanish can be in position 1 or 4.

11. **Clue 13:** The person watching fantasy movies is the Indian or the person watching fantasy movies is the fan of jazz, but not both.
    - This means the person watching fantasy movies cannot be both the Indian and the fan of jazz.

12. **Clue 15:** The fan of jazz is the Spanish or the person watching fantasy movies is the fan of jazz, but not both.
    - If the fan of jazz is the Spanish, then the person watching fantasy movies cannot be the fan of jazz. If the person watching fantasy movies is the fan of jazz, then the fan of jazz cannot be the Spanish.

### Final Deductions:
- The Canadian (fan of reggae) is in position 3.
- The person watching fantasy movies is in position 1 (since it cannot be 2 or 4).
- The person watching drama movies is in position 2 (since it must be to the left of the fan of reggae and to the right of the person watching fantasy movies).
- The person watching adventure movies is in position 4 (since it cannot be in position 1 or 3 and the person watching epic movies is in position 3).

### Remaining:
- The fan of jazz is the Spanish.
- The person watching fantasy movies is the Indian.
- The person watching epic movies is the Pakistani.

Lv11-3x4-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will systematically analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's start with the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person watching animation movies is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
2. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
3. The person driving the boat is on the right of the person watching adventure movies.
4. The person drinking fanta and the person watching zombie movies have different parity positions (one is odd, one is even).
5. The person drinking soy-milk is not the person driving the snowmobile.
6. The person watching adventure movies is in an even position.
7. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
8. The person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies.
9. The person watching adventure movies is the person drinking soy-milk or the person driving the snowmobile is the person watching adventure movies or both.
10. The person watching adventure movies and the person driving the van have different parity positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Adventure Movies
From Clue 6 and Clue 8, the person watching adventure movies must be in an even position and must be to the left of the person watching drama movies. Therefore, the only possible positions for the person watching adventure movies are 2 or 4.

#### Step 2: Parity of Positions
From Clue 4, the person drinking fanta and the person watching zombie movies have different parity positions. This means one is in an odd position and the other in an even position.

#### Step 3: Positioning Animation Movies
From Clue 1, the person watching animation movies is on the left of the person driving the airplane. From Clue 2, the person watching animation movies is on the right of the person drinking 7up. This means the person drinking 7up cannot be in position 4, and the person watching animation movies cannot be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Positioning Boat and Snowmobile
From Clue 3, the person driving the boat is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. This means the person watching adventure movies cannot be in position 4 (as there would be no position to the right).

Thus, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 2.

#### Step 5: Filling in Known Information
- Position 2: Adventure Movies
- Position 4: Not Adventure Movies (from Clue 8)

Since the person watching adventure movies is in position 2, the person driving the boat must be in position 3.

#### Step 6: Filling in Remaining Information
- Position 1: Not Animation (from Clue 1)
- Position 1: Not Soy-Milk (Clue 5)
- Position 1: Not Fanta (Clue 4)
- Position 1: Must be Coffee (remaining option)

- Position 2: Adventure Movies
- Position 3: Boat
- Position 4: Not Drama (Clue 7)
- Position 4: Not Soy-Milk (Clue 5)
- Position 4: Not Fanta (Clue 4)
- Position 4: Must be Zombie Movies (remaining option)

- Position 7: Soy-Milk (Clue 5)
- Position 7: Not Snowmobile (Clue 5)
- Position 7: Not Fanta (Clue 4)
- Position 7: Not Zombie (Clue 4)
- Position 7: Must be 7up (remaining option)

- Position 9: Not 7up (Clue 7)
- Position 9: Not Soy-Milk (Clue 5)
- Position 9: Not Drama (Clue 8)
- Position 9: Must be Fanta (remaining option)

### Final Solution Table:

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv11-3x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues step-by-step to fill in the table. Let's start by organizing the information and filling in what we know:

### Initial Clues:
1. The person drinking juice and the fan of trance have different parity positions.
2. The fan of disco is the person drinking fanta.
3. The person eating eggplant is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice.
4. The fan of rock is somewhere between the fan of d&b and the fan of trance.
5. The person drinking fanta and the person eating lettuce have the same parity positions.
6. The person eating radish is between the person eating lettuce and the person drinking juice.
7. The person drinking tea is the fan of trance or the fan of trance is the person eating eggplant, but not both.
8. The person eating kale is the fan of rock or the person drinking fanta is the person eating kale or both.
9. The person eating radish is on the left or right of the person eating lettuce.
10. The person eating lettuce is not to the right of the person drinking juice.
11. The fan of rock is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish.
12. The fan of trance is not to the left of the person eating kale.
13. The person drinking juice is not the person eating lettuce.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2: Fan Disco = Person Drinking Fanta
Let's denote the person drinking fanta as \(F\).

#### Clue 6: Person Eating Radish is Between Person Eating Lettuce and Person Drinking Juice
This means if the person drinking juice is at position \(J\), then the person eating lettuce is at \(L\) and the person eating radish is at \(R\), where \(L < R < J\).

#### Clue 10: Person Eating Lettuce is Not to the Right of Person Drinking Juice
This means \(L < J\).

#### Clue 11: Fan Rock is Somewhere to the Right of Person Eating Radish
This means if the person eating radish is at \(R\), then the fan of rock is at a position greater than \(R\).

#### Clue 12: Fan Trance is Not to the Left of Person Eating Kale
This means if the person eating kale is at \(K\), then the fan of trance is at a position greater than or equal to \(K\).

#### Clue 3: Person Eating Eggplant is Somewhere to the Right of Person Drinking Juice
This means if the person drinking juice is at \(J\), then the person eating eggplant is at a position greater than \(J\).

#### Clue 9: Person Eating Radish is on the Left or Right of Person Eating Lettuce
This is already covered by Clue 6 and Clue 10.

#### Clue 5: Person Drinking Fanta and Person Eating Lettuce Have Same Parity Positions
Since \(F\) (fanta) is at an even or odd position, \(L\) (lettuce) must be at the same position.

#### Clue 7: Person Drinking Tea is Fan Trance or Fan Trance is Person Eating Eggplant, But Not Both
If \(T\) (tea) is the fan of trance, then the person eating eggplant cannot be the fan of trance. If the person eating eggplant is the fan of trance, then \(T\) cannot be the fan of trance.

#### Clue 8: Person Eating Kale is Fan Rock or Person Drinking Fanta is Person Eating Kale or Both
If the person drinking fanta is the person eating kale, then the person eating kale is also the fan of rock. Otherwise, the person eating kale is the fan of rock.

#### Clue 4: Fan Rock is Somewhere Between Fan D&B and Fan Trance
This means the fan of rock is between the fan of d&b and the fan of trance.

#### Clue 1: Person Drinking Juice and Fan Trance Have Different Parity Positions
If the person drinking juice is at an even position, the fan of trance is at an odd position, and vice versa.

### Final Table Construction:
Let's try to place the items based on these clues:

1. \(F\) (fanta) is at an even position.
2. \(L\) (lettuce) is at the same position as \(F\).
3. \(R\) (radish) is between \(L\) and \(J\) (juice).
4. \(K\) (kale) is either the fan of rock or the person drinking fanta.
5. \(T\) (tea) is either the fan of trance or the person eating eggplant.

Given all constraints, let's assume:

- \(F\) (fanta) is at position 2 (even).
- \(L\) (lettuce) is at position 2.
- \(R\) (radish) is at position 1.
- \(J\) (juice) is at position 4.
- \(K\) (kale) is the fan of rock (since it's the only remaining option that fits the constraints).
- \(T\) (tea) is the fan of trance (since it's the only remaining option that fits the constraints).

Now, placing the rest:

- \(E\) (eggplant) must be at position 3.

### Final Table:
```
|               |    1    |   2    |   3   |    4     |
| Beverage      | Radish  | Fanta  | Juice | Tea     |
| Food          | Lettuce | Lettuce| Eggplant | Kale   |
| Music-Genre   | Rock    | Disco  | Trance | Trance  |
```

### Verification:
- Clue 1: Juice (4) and Trance (Trance) have different parity positions.
- Clue 2: Fanta (2) is the fan of disco.
- Clue 3: Eggplant (3) is to the right of Juice (4).
- Clue 4: Rock (Rock) is between D&B (unassigned) and Trance (Trance).
