4. **Use more constraints to fill in the rest:**

   - The person eating plum is on the far left (Constraint 17) - already filled.
   - The person eating cherry is on the far right (Constraint 24) - already filled.
   - The electrician is the person who's hobby is card-games (Constraint 4) - we need to find the electrician.
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is the person who's sport is baseball (Constraint 7) - so the sport is baseball.
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is the person who's sport is baseball (Constraint 7) - so the hobby is card-games.
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the fan of soul (Constraint 6) - the fan of soul must be in position 5 or 6, but since the social worker is in position 5, the fan of soul must be in position 6. This conflicts, so recheck and correct.

   Let's correct and reorganize:

   - The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the fan of soul (Constraint 6) - the fan of soul must be in position 5 or 6, but since the social worker is in position 5, the fan of soul must be in position 6. This conflicts, so recheck and correct.

   After rechecking, let's place the electrician correctly:

   - The electrician is the person who's hobby is card-games (Constraint 4)
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is the person who's sport is baseball (Constraint 7)

   So, the electrician is in position 3, the hobby is card-games, and the sport is baseball.
