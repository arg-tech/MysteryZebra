Lv1-6x4-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching documentary movies is the Thai.
2. **Clue 4:** The person watching musical movies is on the far left.
3. **Clue 9:** The Chinese is on the far left.
4. **Clue 10:** The Nigerian is the person who's sport is soccer (Clue 7 states that the person who's sport is soccer is on the far right).
5. **Clue 16:** The owner of the goldfish is the person who's sport is soccer.

From Clues 4 and 9:
- The person watching musical movies is the Chinese.
- The Chinese is on the far left.

From Clue 10 and Clue 7:
- The Nigerian is on the far right.
- The person whose sport is soccer is the Nigerian.

From Clue 16:
- The Nigerian owns the goldfish.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Chinese (watching musical movies)
- Position 4: Nigerian (sport is soccer, goldfish owner)

Using Clue 11:
- The fan of reggae is on the left of the person watching documentary movies (Thai).

Since the Thai is on the right of the person with the hobby of reading (Clue 2), and the Thai is in position 4, the person with the hobby of reading must be in position 3.

Using Clue 12:
- The Chinese (position 1) is the owner of the rabbit.

From Clue 14:
- The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the fan of gospel.

Since the Chinese is the owner of the rabbit, the fan of gospel must be in position 2.

From Clue 13:
- The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing.

Since the Nigerian is in position 4 (sport is soccer), the person whose sport is climbing must be in position 3. Therefore, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 4 (Nigerian).

From Clue 6:
- The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing.

Since the Chinese is on the far left (position 1) and the person who's sport is rowing is in position 3, the person with the hobby of skydiving must be in position 4 (Nigerian).

From Clue 5:
- The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing.

This confirms our previous findings.

From Clue 8:
- The fan of jazz is on the right of the fan of gospel.

Since the fan of gospel is in position 2, the fan of jazz must be in position 3.

From Clue 3:
- The Chinese is the person who's sport is rowing.

From Clue 15:
- The Nigerian is the owner of the rabbit.

Now, we can fill in the remaining information:
- Position 1: Chinese (watching musical movies, owner of the rabbit)
- Position 2: Fan of gospel (hobby is traveling)
- Position 3: Fan of jazz (sport is rowing, owner of the turtle)
- Position 4: Nigerian (watching superhero movies, sport is soccer, goldfish owner)

Finally, the only remaining hobby for the Thai is skydiving.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |     3     |      4      |
