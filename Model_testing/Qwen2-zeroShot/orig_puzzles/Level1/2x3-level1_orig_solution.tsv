Lv1-2x3-1	"Certainly! Let's break down the information provided and solve the puzzle step by step.

1. **The person who's sport is rugby is in the middle.**
   - This means that the sport ""rugby"" must be in position 2 (the middle).

2. **The person drinking juice is the person who's sport is surfing.**
   - This means that the beverage ""juice"" corresponds to the sport ""surfing"".

3. **The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left.**
   - This means that the beverage ""almond-milk"" is in position 1.

Given these clues, we can fill in the table as follows:

- The person on the far left (position 1) drinks almond-milk.
- The person in the middle (position 2) plays rugby.
- The person on the far right (position 3) drinks juice and plays surfing.

Let's put this into the table format:

```
|            |      1      |   2    |    3    |
| Beverage   | almond-milk |        |   juice |
| Sport      |     rugby   | surfing|    -    |
```

Since we have filled in all the necessary details, the final solution table is:

```
|            |      1      |   2    |    3    |

Lv1-2x3-2	"Certainly! Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step by step.

We have:
- 3 beverages: Fanta, Iced Tea, Tea
- 3 nationalities: Argentine, Canadian, Nigerian

The clues provided are:
1. The Argentine is on the left of the person drinking tea.
2. The Canadian is on the far left.
3. The Canadian is the person drinking iced-tea.

Let's use these clues to fill in the table:

1. **Clue 2**: The Canadian is on the far left.
   - This means the Canadian is in position 1.

2. **Clue 3**: The Canadian is the person drinking iced-tea.
   - Since the Canadian is in position 1, the beverage in position 1 must be iced-tea.

So, we can fill in the first row as follows:
- Position 1: Iced Tea (Canadian)
- Position 2: (Unknown Beverage)
- Position 3: (Unknown Beverage)

3. **Clue 1**: The Argentine is on the left of the person drinking tea.
   - This means the Argentine must be in position 1 or 2, but since position 1 is already occupied by the Canadian, the Argentine must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the Argentine drinks either Fanta or Tea.

Since position 1 is iced-tea and the Canadian is in position 1, the Argentine cannot drink iced-tea. Thus, the Argentine must drink either Fanta or Tea.

4. **Determine the remaining positions**:
   - If the Argentine is in position 2, then the person in position 3 must be Nigerian.
   - The Nigerian cannot drink iced-tea (since it's already taken by the Canadian) and cannot drink tea (since the Argentine would be to the left of someone drinking tea).

Therefore, the Nigerian must drink Fanta, and the Argentine must drink Tea.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1     |     2     |    3     |

Lv1-2x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the beverages and foods in the correct positions based on the given clues. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating radish.
2. The person drinking water is on the left of the person eating raspberry.
3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating radish.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
Clue 3 states that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating radish. This means:
- Soy-milk must be in position 1 or 2 (since it's to the left of radish).
- Radish must be in position 2 or 3.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) for soy-milk
- \( R \) for radish

From Clue 3, we have two possible configurations:
1. \( S \) in position 1, \( R \) in position 2
2. \( S \) in position 2, \( R \) in position 3

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
Clue 1 states that the person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating radish. If radish is in position 2, then tea must be in position 3. If radish is in position 3, then tea must be in position 2.

Let's analyze both configurations from Step 1:

1. **Configuration 1: \( S \) in position 1, \( R \) in position 2**
   - Tea must be in position 3.
   - The remaining beverage is water, which must be in position 1.

2. **Configuration 2: \( S \) in position 2, \( R \) in position 3**
   - Tea must be in position 2 (but this conflicts with \( S \) being in position 2).
   - Therefore, Configuration 2 is not valid.

So, we are left with Configuration 1:
- Position 1: Water
- Position 2: Soy-milk
- Position 3: Tea

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
Clue 2 states that the person drinking water is on the left of the person eating raspberry. From our configuration, water is in position 1, so raspberry must be in position 3.

This matches our current configuration where tea is in position 3.

#### Final Configuration:
- Position 1: Water
- Position 2: Soy-milk
- Position 3: Tea

Now, let's fill in the foods based on the clues:

- Plum must be in position 1 (since it's the only food left after assigning beverages).
- Raspberry must be in position 3 (as per Clue 2).
- Radish must be in position 2 (as per Clue 3).

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |    1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage   |  Water   | Soy-milk|  Tea      |
| Food       |  Plum    | Radish | Raspberry |
```"
Lv1-2x3-4	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating radish is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
2. The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
3. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Position of the Person with Woodworking Hobby
From clue 3, we know that the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in position 1 (the far left).

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby   | woodworking |            |             |

#### Step 2: Position of the Person Eating Radish
From clue 1, the person eating radish is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is in position 1, the person eating radish must be in position 2.

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby   | woodworking |   radish   |             |

#### Step 3: Position of the Person Eating Pomegranate
From clue 2, the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. We need to determine where the person with the hobby of card-games is located.

Since the person with woodworking is in position 1 and the person with radish is in position 2, the only remaining position for the person with the hobby of card-games is position 3.

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby   | woodworking |   radish   |  card-games |

Now, from clue 2, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 3 since they are on the right of the person with the hobby of card-games.

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby   | woodworking |   radish   | pomegranate |

#### Step 4: Assigning Foods
We now need to assign the foods to the positions. We have three foods: pomegranate, radish, and zucchini.

- From the table, the person in position 1 (woodworking) cannot eat radish or pomegranate because those positions are already taken. Therefore, the person in position 1 must eat zucchini.
- The person in position 2 (radish) eats radish.
- The person in position 3 (card-games) eats pomegranate.

So, the final assignment is:

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby   | woodworking |   radish   | pomegranate |
| Food    |      zucchini |  radish    | pomegranate |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby   | woodworking |   radish   | pomegranate |
| Food    |      zucchini |  radish    | pomegranate |

Lv1-2x3-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The person driving the trike is the owner of the hedgehog.**
   - This means the owner of the hedgehog is in the ""Transport"" column for trike (position 3).

2. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the owner of the bird.**
   - This means the owner of the bird must be in position 1 (leftmost), and the owner of the hedgehog (driving the trike) must be in position 3 (rightmost).

3. **The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person driving the airplane.**
   - Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 3, the person driving the airplane must be in position 1.

4. **The owner of the bird is in the middle.**
   - The owner of the bird is in position 2.

### Filling in the Table:

From the above steps, we can deduce:
- The owner of the bird is in position 2.
- The person driving the airplane is in position 1.
- The owner of the hedgehog (and the one driving the trike) is in position 3.

So, the table looks like this:

```

Lv1-2x3-6	"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- There are 3 different types of food: kiwi, plum, strawberry.
- There are 3 different means of transport: boat, motorbike, train.
- The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person driving the boat.
- The person eating plum is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
- The person eating strawberry is the person driving the boat.

Let's denote:
- Food: F1 (kiwi), F2 (plum), F3 (strawberry)
- Transport: T1 (boat), T2 (motorbike), T3 (train)

From the clues:
1. The person eating kiwi (F1) is on the right of the person driving the boat (T1).
2. The person eating plum (F2) is on the right of the person driving the motorbike (T2).
3. The person eating strawberry (F3) is the person driving the boat (T1).

From clue 3, we know that the person eating strawberry (F3) is the one driving the boat (T1). So:

|             |     1      |     2     |   3   |
| Food        |    F3      |           |       |
| Transport   |    T1      |           |       |

Now, from clue 1, the person eating kiwi (F1) must be to the right of the person driving the boat (T1). Since T1 is already at position 1, F1 must be at position 2 or 3. However, since F3 (strawberry) is at position 1, F1 cannot be at position 1. Therefore, F1 must be at position 2 or 3. But if F1 were at position 3, then the person driving the boat would have no one to their right. Thus, F1 must be at position 2:

|             |     1      |     2     |   3   |
| Food        |    F3      |    F1     |       |
| Transport   |    T1      |           |       |

From clue 2, the person eating plum (F2) is on the right of the person driving the motorbike (T2). Since F1 is at position 2 and F3 is at position 1, F2 must be at position 3:

|             |     1      |     2     |   3   |
| Food        |    F3      |    F1     |    F2 |
| Transport   |    T1      |           |       |

Now, we need to place the remaining transport modes. We know:
- T1 is the boat (from clue 3).
- T2 is the motorbike (since it has to be on the right of the person driving it, and F2 is at position 3, T2 must be at position 2).
- T3 is the train (the only remaining option).

So, the final solution is:

|             |     1      |     2     |   3   |
| Food        |    F3      |    F1     |    F2 |
| Transport   |    T1      |    T2     |    T3 |

Here is the final solution table surrounded by `#############`:

Lv1-2x3-7	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

Given:
1. The fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of jazz.
2. The fan of r&b is the owner of the ferret.
3. The owner of the chinchilla is on the far left.

We have three columns (1, 2, 3) and two rows (Music-Genre and Pet).

Let's start filling in the information:

### Step 1: Identify the owner of the chinchilla
From clue 3, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is on the far left. So, the first column must be the owner of the chinchilla.

|               |     1      |    2     |   3    |
| Music-Genre   |            |          |        |
| Pet           | Chinchilla |          |        |

### Step 2: Determine the music genres
From clue 1, the fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of jazz. Since the chinchilla is already placed in the first column, the second column must be the fan of salsa and the third column must be the fan of jazz.

|               |     1      |    2     |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa     | R&B      | Jazz   |
| Pet           | Chinchilla |          |        |

### Step 3: Determine the pets
From clue 2, the fan of r&b is the owner of the ferret. Since the fan of r&b is in the second column, the second column must also contain the ferret.

|               |     1      |    2     |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa     | R&B      | Jazz   |
| Pet           | Chinchilla | Ferret   |        |

Since the chinchilla is in the first column and the ferret is in the second column, the only pet left for the third column is the goldfish.

|               |     1      |    2     |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa     | R&B      | Jazz   |

Lv1-2x3-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person eating asparagus.
2. The person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
3. The person eating peach is the person who's hobby is card-games.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the person with the hobby of card-games.
From clue 3, we know that the person who eats peach has the hobby of card-games.

So, we can fill in:
```
|         |      1      |     2     |     3      |
| Food    |             |           |            |
| Hobby   | Peach       |           |            |
```

#### Step 2: Use clue 1 to determine the position of the person eating asparagus.
Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is card-games (peach) is on the right of the person eating asparagus. Therefore, the person eating asparagus must be in position 1.

So, we update the table:
```
|         |      1      |     2     |     3      |
| Food    | Asparagus   |           |            |
| Hobby   | Peach       |           |            |
```

#### Step 3: Use clue 2 to determine the positions of the other foods.
Clue 2 states that the person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 1, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 2, and the person whose hobby is skydiving must be in position 3.

So, we update the table:
```
|         |      1      |     2     |     3      |
| Food    | Asparagus   | Pomegranate |            |
| Hobby   | Peach       |            | Skydiving  |
```

Now, the only food left is the one for position 3, which is the pomegranate, but since it's already placed in position 2, the remaining food is the pomegranate.

So, we update the table:
```
|         |      1      |     2     |     3      |
| Food    | Asparagus   | Pomegranate | Pomegranate |
| Hobby   | Peach       | Card-Games | Skydiving  |
```

This setup violates the rule that each person has a unique food and hobby. Therefore, the correct placement should be:

```
|         |      1      |     2     |     3      |
| Food    | Asparagus   | Pomegranate | Peach      |
| Hobby   | Peach       | Card-Games | Skydiving  |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|         |      1      |     2     |     3      |

2. The owner of the rabbit is on the far right (position 3).
3. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The owner of the rabbit is on the far right (position 3). This means:
   - Pet 3 is a rabbit.
   
2. **Clue 1**: The owner of the horse is the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the rabbit is in position 3, the horse must be in either position 1 or 2. Therefore, the filmmaking hobbyist cannot be in position 3 because they would need to be to the right of the puzzles hobbyist, and there isn't enough space for both.
   - Pet 1 or Pet 2 is a horse.
   - Hobby 3 is not filmmaking.
   
3. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the rabbit is in position 3, the filmmaking hobbyist must be in position 2 or 3. But we already know the rabbit is in position 3, so the filmmaking hobbyist must be in position 2.
   - Hobby 2 is filmmaking.
   - Pet 2 is a horse.
   - Pet 3 is a rabbit.
   - The puzzles hobbyist must be in position 1.
   
4. **Assigning Hobbies**:
   - Position 1: Puzzles (since the filmmaking hobbyist is in position 2)
   - Position 2: Filmmaking (as per Clue 3)
   - Position 3: Horse (as per Clue 1)

5. **Assigning Remaining Pets**:
   - Position 1: Puzzles
   - Position 2: Filmmaking (horse)
   - Position 3: Rabbit

Lv1-2x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place them step-by-step into the given table.

### Clues:
1. The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
2. The person watching zombie movies is on the far right.
3. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking tea.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- The person watching zombie movies is on the far right (position 3).

So, we can place ""zombie"" in position 3 under ""Movie-Genre"".

|               |   1    |     2     |   3    |
| Beverage      |        |           |        |
| Movie-Genre   |        |           | zombie |

#### Clue 1:
- The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
- Since the person watching zombie movies is in position 3, the person drinking sprite must be in position 1 or 2.

Let's assume the person drinking sprite is in position 1 for now and see if it fits with other clues.

|               |   1    |     2     |   3    |
| Beverage      | sprite |           |        |
| Movie-Genre   |        |           | zombie |

#### Clue 3:
- The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking tea.
- This means the person drinking tea cannot be in position 1 (since there is no space to the left of position 1). Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 2 or 3.

Since position 3 is already taken by ""zombie"", the person drinking tea must be in position 2.

|               |   1    |     2     |   3    |
| Beverage      | sprite | tea       |        |
| Movie-Genre   |        |           | zombie |

Now, the only remaining genre is ""adventure"" for position 1.

|               |   1    |     2     |   3    |
| Beverage      | sprite | tea       |        |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure |           | zombie |

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person watching zombie movies (position 3) is on the right of the person drinking sprite (position 1).
- The person watching zombie movies (position 3) is on the far right.
- The person watching adventure movies (position 1) is on the left of the person drinking tea (position 2).

Thus, the final solution is:
