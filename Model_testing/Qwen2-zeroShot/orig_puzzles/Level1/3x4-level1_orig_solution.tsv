Lv1-3x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze and arrange the given clues step by step. Let's start by listing all the clues again for clarity:

1. The person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
2. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking cola.
3. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the owner of the mouse.
4. The person drinking cola is the owner of the chinchilla.
5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the mouse.
6. The person driving the bike is on the left of the owner of the rat.
7. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person driving the subway.

We will use the clues to deduce the order of the columns (1, 2, 3, 4) for each category (Beverage, Pet, Transport).

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Clue 1:
- The person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
  - This means the snowmobile is in column 1 or 2, and the van is in column 3 or 4.

#### Clue 2:
- The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking cola.
  - This means mirinda is in column 1 or 2, and cola is in column 3 or 4.

#### Clue 3:
- The person drinking sprite is on the left of the owner of the mouse.
  - This means sprite is in column 1 or 2, and the owner of the mouse is in column 3 or 4.

#### Clue 4:
- The person drinking cola is the owner of the chinchilla.
  - This places cola in column 3 or 4, and the chinchilla in column 3 or 4 as well.

#### Clue 5:
- The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the mouse.
  - Since the owner of the chinchilla is in column 3 or 4, the owner of the mouse must be in column 1 or 2.

#### Clue 6:
- The person driving the bike is on the left of the owner of the rat.
  - This means the bike is in column 1 or 2, and the rat is in column 3 or 4.

#### Clue 7:
- The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person driving the subway.
  - This means the lizard is in column 1 or 2, and the subway is in column 3 or 4.

### Combining Clues

From Clue 1 and Clue 7:
- The snowmobile and the bike cannot both be in columns 1 and 2 because the person driving the bike is on the left of the owner of the rat, and the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the van.
- Therefore, the snowmobile must be in column 1 or 2, and the van in column 3 or 4.

From Clue 2 and Clue 4:
- Mirinda and cola must be in columns 1 and 2, with cola being in column 3 or 4.
- Since cola is in column 3 or 4 and the owner of the chinchilla is in column 3 or 4, the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 4 (since cola is in column 3 or 4).

From Clue 3 and Clue 5:
- Sprite and the mouse must be in columns 1 and 2, with the mouse being in column 3 or 4.
- Since the owner of the chinchilla is in column 4, the owner of the mouse must be in column 3.

From Clue 6:
- The bike must be in column 1 or 2, and the rat in column 3 or 4.
- Since the rat is in column 3 or 4 and the mouse is in column 3, the rat must be in column 4.

From Clue 7:
- The lizard must be in column 1 or 2, and the subway in column 3 or 4.
- Since the lizard is in column 1 or 2 and the subway is in column 3 or 4, the lizard must be in column 1 and the subway in column 4.

### Final Arrangement

Based on the above deductions, we can now place the items in the correct columns:

|             |   1    |   2    |     3      |     4      |
|-------------|--------|--------|------------|------------|
| Beverage    | Sprite | Mirinda| Cola       | Fanta      |
| Pet         | Lizard | Mouse  | Chinchilla | Rat        |
| Transport   | Bike   | Suburb | Snowmobile | Van        |

Lv1-3x4-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We have:
- 4 types of food: asparagus, broccoli, corn, pear
- 4 jobs: fisherman, lawyer, musician, social-worker
- 4 means of transport: bike, car, motorbike, roller

From the clues provided:
1. The person driving the roller is on the left of the social-worker.
2. The person eating pear is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
3. The musician is on the right of the person eating corn.
4. The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the roller.
5. The person driving the bike is the fisherman.
6. The person driving the roller is the person eating broccoli.

First, let's place the fisherman:
5. The person driving the bike is the fisherman.
So, the fisherman drives the bike.

Next, let's determine the order of the transport modes based on clue 4 and 1:
4. The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the roller.
1. The person driving the roller is on the left of the social-worker.
This means the sequence must be: car -> roller -> social-worker.

Since the person driving the roller is also the person eating broccoli (clue 6), we can place that information:
- Broccoli is eaten by the person driving the roller.

Now, we know the person eating pear is on the right of the person driving the motorbike (clue 2):
- Let's denote the person driving the motorbike as M.
- The person eating pear is to the right of M.

We also know from clue 3 that the musician is on the right of the person eating corn:
- Let's denote the person eating corn as C.
- The musician is to the right of C.

Given the order of transport:
- Car -> Roller -> Social-worker
- We need to place the remaining two (motorbike and bike) and the corresponding jobs and foods.

From clue 4:
4. The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the roller.
Since the roller is the person eating broccoli, the car must be driven by someone else.

From clue 2:
2. The person eating pear is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
This means the person eating pear cannot be the one driving the roller or the car.

Let's assign the remaining jobs and foods:
- Since the person driving the bike is the fisherman, and he must be in the first position (clue 5):
  - Fisherman -> Bike

- The person driving the roller is the person eating broccoli (clue 6):
  - Broccoli -> Roller

- The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the roller, so:
  - Car -> Social-worker (since the roller is on the right)

- The person eating pear is on the right of the person driving the motorbike, and the musician is on the right of the person eating corn:
  - Corn -> Musician
  - Pear -> Lawyer (the only job left)

Finally, the remaining food for the lawyer must be asparagus.

Putting it all together:

|             |   1    |    2     |       3       |     4     |
| Food        | asparagus | corn    | broccoli      | pear      |
| Job         | fisherman | musician | social-worker | lawyer    |
| Transport   | bike     | car     | motor         | roller    |

Here is the final solution table:

```
|             |   1    |    2     |       3       |     4     |
| Food        | asparagus | corn    | broccoli      | pear      |

7. The person who's hobby is gardening is the Brazilian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Fan of Pop
From clue 3, the fan of pop is on the far left. Therefore:
```
| Hobby         |     1     |       2       |    3    |      4      |

| Nationality   |           |               |         |             |
```

#### Step 2: Positioning the Gardening Hobby
From clue 7, the Brazilian has the hobby of gardening. Therefore:
```
| Hobby         |     1     |       2       |    3    |      4      |
| Fan of Pop    |   Pop     |               |         |             |

| Nationality   | Brazilian |               |         |             |
```

#### Step 3: Positioning the Electronic Music Fan
From clue 1, the fan of electronic is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (Brazilian). Therefore, the electronic fan must be in position 2:
```
| Hobby         |     1     |       2       |    3    |      4      |
| Fan of Pop    |   Pop     | Electronic    |         |             |

| Nationality   | Brazilian |               |         |             |
```

#### Step 4: Positioning the Russian
From clue 5, the Russian is on the right of the fan of electronic. Therefore, the Russian must be in position 3:
```
| Hobby         |     1     |       2       |    3    |      4      |
| Fan of Pop    |   Pop     | Electronic    | Russian |             |
| Music-Genre   |           |               |         |             |
| Nationality   | Brazilian |               |         |             |
```

#### Step 5: Positioning the Indonesian
From clue 6, the Russian is on the right of the Indonesian. Therefore, the Indonesian must be in position 4:
```
| Hobby         |     1     |       2       |    3    |      4      |
| Fan of Pop    |   Pop     | Electronic    | Russian | Indonesian |
| Music-Genre   |           |               |         |             |
| Nationality   | Brazilian |               |         |             |
```

#### Step 6: Positioning the Singing Hobby
From clue 2, the Canadian is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the Canadian cannot be in position 4 (Indonesian), the singing hobbyist must be in position 1 and the Canadian in position 2:
```
| Hobby         |     1     |       2       |    3    |      4      |
| Fan of Pop    | Singing   | Electronic    | Russian | Indonesian |

| Nationality   | Brazilian | Canadian      |         |             |
```

#### Step 7: Positioning the Video-Games Hobby and Hip-Hop
From clue 4, the person who's hobby is video-games is the fan of hip-hop. The only remaining positions for these are 3 and 4, but since the Russian is already in position 3, the video-games hobbyist must be in position 4 and the fan of hip-hop must be in position 3:
```
| Hobby         |     1     |       2       |    3    |      4      |
| Fan of Pop    | Singing   | Electronic    | Hip-Hop | Video-Games |
| Music-Genre   |           |               |         |             |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Canadian      | Russian | Indonesian |
```

#### Step 8: Filling in the Music Genres
Finally, we can determine the music genres based on the remaining options:
- Position 1: Pop (from clue 3)
- Position 2: Electronic (from clue 1)
- Position 3: Hip-Hop (from clue 4)
- Position 4: Video-Games (from clue 4)

Thus, the final table is:

| Fan of Pop    | Singing   | Electronic    | Hip-Hop | Video-Games |

Lv1-3x4-4	"Let's break down the clues step by step to solve the puzzle:

1. **Freelancer is the person driving the train.**
   - Freelancer: Train

2. **The person whose sport is rugby is on the far left.**
   - Rugby: 1

3. **The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the train.**
   - Since the person driving the train is in position 3 (from the previous clue), the person driving the taxi must be in position 4.
   - Train: 3, Taxi: 4

4. **The firefighter is on the far right.**
   - Firefighter: 4

5. **The person whose sport is soccer is on the far right.**
   - Soccer: 4

From clues 4 and 5, we can deduce that:
- Firefighter: 4
- Soccer: 4

Since the firefighter and soccer are both in position 4, this conflicts with the previous clue. Let's re-evaluate:

- The firefighter cannot be the person whose sport is soccer, so the soccer person must be someone else.

6. **The person whose sport is rowing is the freelancer.**
   - Rowing: Freelancer

7. **The freelancer is on the left of the person whose sport is soccer.**
   - Since the freelancer is in position 3 (from clue 1) and the soccer person is in position 4, this aligns correctly.

8. **The project-manager is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.**
   - The person driving the motorbike must be in position 2, and the project-manager in position 3.
   - Motorbike: 2, Project-Manager: 3

Now, let's summarize and fill in the table:

- The person driving the train (freelancer) is in position 3.
- The person driving the taxi must be in position 4 because it is on the right of the person driving the train.
- The firefighter is in position 4.
- The soccer person is in position 4, but since the firefighter is also in position 4, this means the soccer person must be someone else.

Given the remaining positions and the remaining jobs and sports, we can assign them as follows:

- Position 1: Rugby (since it's the far left)
- Position 2: Motorbike (project-manager is on the right of this)
- Position 3: Train (freelancer)
- Position 4: Firefighter (and soccer)

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|             |     1     |        2        |     3      |      4      |

| Transport   |   Jet-ski |   Motorbike     |    Train   |     Taxi    |
```

Final Solution Table:

```
|             |     1     |        2        |     3      |      4      |

Lv1-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking iced-tea is the Nigerian.
2. **Clue 2**: The Pakistani is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.
3. **Clue 3**: The person watching crime movies is on the far right.
4. **Clue 4**: The person watching drama movies is on the left of the Nigerian.
5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person watching animation movies.
6. **Clue 6**: The Pakistani is the person drinking juice.
7. **Clue 7**: The French is on the left of the Pakistani.
8. **Clue 8**: The person drinking iced-tea is on the far right.

From Clue 1 and Clue 8, we know:
- The Nigerian drinks iced-tea and is on the far right (position 4).

From Clue 3, we know:
- Crime movies are in position 4.

Since the Nigerian is on the far right and drinks iced-tea, we can fill in:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |    4     |
| Beverage      |          |           |             |  iced-tea  |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |             |  crime    |
| Nationality   |          |           |             |  nigerian  |
```

From Clue 6, the Pakistani drinks juice:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |    4     |
| Beverage      |          |           |             |  iced-tea  |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |             |  crime    |
| Nationality   |          |           |             |  nigerian  |
| Beverage      |          |           | juice       |  iced-tea  |
```

From Clue 7, the French is on the left of the Pakistani:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |    4     |
| Beverage      |          |           | juice       |  iced-tea  |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |             |  crime    |
| Nationality   |          |  french   |             |  nigerian  |
```

From Clue 4, the person watching drama movies is on the left of the Nigerian:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |    4     |
| Beverage      |          |           | juice       |  iced-tea  |
| Movie-Genre   | drama    |           |             |  crime    |
| Nationality   |          |  french   |             |  nigerian  |
```

From Clue 2, the Pakistani is on the right of the person watching mystery movies:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |    4     |
| Beverage      |          |           | juice       |  iced-tea  |
| Movie-Genre   | drama    |           | mystery    |  crime    |
| Nationality   |          |  french   | pakistani   |  nigerian  |
```

From Clue 5, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person watching animation movies:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk |           | juice       |  iced-tea  |
| Movie-Genre   | drama    |           | mystery    |  crime    |
| Nationality   |          |  french   | pakistani   |  nigerian  |
```

Now, we need to assign the remaining beverage (almond-milk) and movie genre (animation) to the first two positions. Since the French is on the left of the Pakistani, and the Pakistani is already in position 3, the French must be in position 2. This leaves position 1 for the remaining beverage, which is almond-milk. The remaining movie genre, animation, goes to position 2.

So, the final solution is:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | soy-milk | juice       |  iced-tea  |
| Movie-Genre   | drama    | animation | mystery    |  crime    |
| Nationality   |  french   | pakistani | pakistani   |  nigerian  |

Lv1-3x4-9	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

First, we list out the given information:

1. The fan of d&b is on the right of the person eating tomato.
2. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
3. The fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of jazz.
4. The person who's sport is soccer is the person eating onion.
5. The person eating onion is on the right of the fan of punk.
6. The fan of punk is on the right of the person eating pepper.
7. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse.

We will use these clues to determine the correct placements.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is soccer is the person eating onion.
   - So, onion is eaten by the person whose sport is soccer.

2. **Clue 5**: The person eating onion is on the right of the fan of punk.
   - Since onion is eaten by the person whose sport is soccer, the fan of punk must be in the position to the left of the person eating onion.

3. **Clue 6**: The fan of punk is on the right of the person eating pepper.
   - Therefore, the person eating pepper must be in the position to the left of the fan of punk.

4. **Clue 1**: The fan of d&b is on the right of the person eating tomato.
   - The fan of d&b cannot be in the first position (since there would be no one to the left).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
   - Since soccer is already assigned to the third position (from Clue 4), water-polo must be in the fourth position.

6. **Clue 3**: The fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of jazz.
   - This means the fan of jazz cannot be in the first position.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
   - This means skateboarding must be in the first or second position, and lacrosse must be in the third or fourth position.

Let's start filling the table based on the above deductions:

|               |       1       |    2     |   3    |     4      |
| Food          |               |          |        |            |
| Music-Genre   |               |          |        |            |
| Sport         |               |          | soccer | water-polo |

From Clue 4:
- Onion is eaten by the person whose sport is soccer (position 3).
- The fan of punk is in position 2 (since onion is in position 3 and the fan of punk is on the left of the person eating onion).

From Clue 6:
- The person eating pepper is in position 1 (since the fan of punk is in position 2 and the person eating pepper is on the left of the fan of punk).

From Clue 1:
- The fan of d&b is in position 2 (since the fan of punk is in position 2 and the fan of d&b is on the right of the person eating tomato, which must be in position 1).

From Clue 3:
- The fan of jazz is in position 4 (since the fan of d&b is in position 2 and the fan of jazz is on the right of the fan of d&b).

From Clue 7:
- The person who's sport is skateboarding is in position 1 (since lacrosse is in position 4 and skateboarding is on the left of lacrosse).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Skating (sport)
- Position 2: Pepper (food), Punk (music)
- Position 3: Onion (food), Soccer (sport)
- Position 4: Tomato (food), Jazz (music)

Now, let's fill in the final table:

|               |       1       |    2     |   3    |     4      |
| Food          | Pepper        | Tomato   | Onion  | Cucumber   |
| Music-Genre   | Punk          | D&B      | Jazz   | Blues      |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Soccer   | Water-Polo | Lacrosse  |

Final solution:

```
|               |       1       |    2     |   3    |     4      |
| Food          | Pepper        | Tomato   | Onion  | Cucumber   |

Lv1-3x4-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking Mirinda is the owner of the Turtle.
2. The owner of the Mouse is on the left of the owner of the Rabbit.
3. The person drinking Iced Tea is on the left of the person eating Spinach.
4. The person drinking 7Up is on the right of the owner of the Turtle.
5. The person eating Tomato is on the far right.
6. The person drinking Iced Tea is on the left of the owner of the Turtle.
7. The person eating Pumpkin is on the right of the person drinking Fanta.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6**: The person drinking Iced Tea is on the left of the owner of the Turtle.
   - This means Iced Tea and Turtle are adjacent with Iced Tea to the left.

2. **Clue 1**: The person drinking Mirinda is the owner of the Turtle.
   - From Clue 6, we can place Mirinda and Turtle together: (Mirinda, Turtle).

3. **Clue 2**: The owner of the Mouse is on the left of the owner of the Rabbit.
   - This implies that the order for these two is: Mouse, Rabbit or Rabbit, Mouse.

4. **Clue 3**: The person drinking Iced Tea is on the left of the person eating Spinach.
   - This places Iced Tea and Spinach as adjacent with Iced Tea to the left.

5. **Clue 4**: The person drinking 7Up is on the right of the owner of the Turtle.
   - Since the owner of the Turtle is drinking Mirinda, the person drinking 7Up must be on the right of Mirinda.

6. **Clue 5**: The person eating Tomato is on the far right.
   - This means Tomato is in position 4.

7. **Clue 7**: The person eating Pumpkin is on the right of the person drinking Fanta.
   - This places Fanta and Pumpkin as adjacent with Fanta to the left.

### Placing the items based on the clues:

- **Position 4**: Tomato (from Clue 5)
- **Positions 2 and 3**: Iced Tea and Spinach (from Clue 3). Since Iced Tea is to the left of Spinach, we have: (Iced Tea, Spinach).
- **Position 1**: Mirinda (from Clue 1) and Iced Tea (from Clue 6), so Mirinda must be in Position 1.
- **Position 4**: Tomato (already placed)
- **Position 3**: Spinach (from Clue 3)
- **Position 2**: Iced Tea (from Clue 3 and Clue 6)

Now, we need to fit the remaining items (7Up, Fanta, Pumpkin, and the pets) into the remaining positions.

- **Owner of the Turtle**: Mirinda (from Clue 1)
- **Owner of the Mouse**: On the left of the owner of the Rabbit (from Clue 2)
- **Owner of the Rabbit**: To the right of the owner of the Mouse
- **Owner of the Chinchilla**: Remaining pet

From Clue 4, the person drinking 7Up is on the right of the owner of the Turtle (Mirinda), which means 7Up must be in Position 4.

- **Position 4**: 7Up (from Clue 4 and previous placement)

This leaves us with:
- **Position 1**: Mirinda (drinking 7Up from Clue 4)
- **Position 2**: Iced Tea
- **Position 3**: Spinach
- **Position 4**: 7Up

Since the person eating Tomato is on the far right (Position 4), the remaining food must be:
- **Position 1**: Pumpkin (from Clue 7, as it must be on the right of Fanta)
- **Position 2**: Fanta (from Clue 7)

So, the final arrangement is:

|            |    1     |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Beverage   |  7Up     |  IcedTea |  Spinach|  Mirinda  |
| Food       |  Pumpkin |  Fanta   |  Tomato |  Tomato   |
| Pet        |  Chinchilla| Mouse   | Rabbit  |  Turtle   |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |    1     |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Beverage   |  7Up     |  IcedTea |  Spinach|  Mirinda  |
| Food       |  Pumpkin |  Fanta   |  Tomato |  Tomato   |
| Pet        |  Chinchilla| Mouse   | Rabbit  |  Turtle   |
