Lv1-2x4-1	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

We have:
- 4 types of food: mango, pepper, pomegranate, raspberry.
- 4 nationalities: chinese, egyptian, thai, turkish.

Let's use the given clues to deduce the correct positions:

1. The egyptian is on the left of the chinese.
2. The person eating mango is the turkish.
3. The thai is on the right of the chinese.
4. The person eating pepper is on the left of the turkish.
5. The person eating raspberry is on the left of the chinese.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 1:
- Egyptian (E) is on the left of Chinese (C).
  - Possible positions: E _ C _

#### Clue 2:
- Turkish (T) eats mango (M).
  - T eats M.

#### Clue 3:
- Thai (Th) is on the right of Chinese (C).
  - Possible positions: E Th C

#### Clue 4:
- Person eating pepper (P) is on the left of Turkish (T).
  - Possible positions: P T
  - Since T eats M, we need to place P before T.
  - Therefore, possible positions: P T

#### Clue 5:
- Person eating raspberry (R) is on the left of Chinese (C).
  - Possible positions: R C
  - Since Chinese (C) is between Thai (Th) and Turkish (T), and we already have E and Th before C, we can place R on the far left.
  - Therefore, possible positions: R E Th C

Now, let's assign the foods based on the clues:

- R (raspberry) is on the left of C, so it must be at position 1.
- E (egyptian) is next to C, so it must be at position 2.
- Th (thai) is next to C, so it must be at position 3.
- C (chinese) is last, so it must be at position 4.
- T (turkish) eats M (mango), and it must be at position 4, but since C is at position 4, T must eat something else. We know T is on the right of P, so T must be at position 3 and P must be at position 2.

So, the correct arrangement is:
- Position 1: R (raspberry)
- Position 2: P (pepper)
- Position 3: T (turkish)
- Position 4: C (chinese)

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |   3    |    4    |
| Food          | Raspberry | Pepper      | Turkish| Chinese |
| Nationality   | Thai      | Egyptian    | Turkish| Chinese |
```

The final solution table is:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |   3    |    4    |
| Food          | Raspberry | Pepper      | Turkish| Chinese |
| Nationality   | Thai      | Egyptian    | Turkish| Chinese |

Lv1-2x4-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person who's sport is soccer.
2. The person who's hobby is camping is on the far right (position 4).
3. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.
5. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person who's sport is soccer.
   - So, the person with woodworking as a hobby and soccer as a sport must be in the same cell.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is camping is on the far right (position 4).
   - So, the hobby ""camping"" must be in position 4 for both the ""Hobby"" and ""Sport"" columns.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
   - This means the person with cooking as a hobby cannot be in position 4 because camping is there, so it must be in position 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.
   - Since woodworking is in position 4 (from Clue 2), the sport associated with swimming must be in position 3.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour.
   - Soccer is in position 3 (from Clue 4), so parkour must be in position 4.

Now we can fill in the table based on these deductions:

|         |      1      |      2      |    3    |     4      |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Hobby   | cooking     |             | camping | woodworking |
| Sport   | swimming    |             | soccer  | parkour   |

- Position 1: The only remaining hobby is video-games.
- Position 2: The only remaining sport is volleyball.

So the final solution is:

```
|         |      1      |      2      |    3    |     4      |
| Hobby   | video-games | cooking     | camping | woodworking |
| Sport   | volleyball  | swimming    | soccer  | parkour    |

Lv1-2x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate hobbies and movie genres in the correct positions.

Let's start with the given clues:

1. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies.
2. The person whose hobby is fishing is the person watching crime movies.
3. The person watching drama movies is on the far right.
4. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is writing.
5. The person whose hobby is traveling is on the left of the person watching drama movies.

We can summarize the information as follows:

- Drama is on the far right (position 4).
- Fishing corresponds to crime (position 1 or 2 for fishing, and position 1 for crime).
- Mystery is on the left of time-travel.
- Time-travel is on the right of writing.
- Traveling is on the left of drama.

Let's fill in the table step-by-step:

|               |    1    |    2    |      3      |       4       |
| Hobby         |         |         |             |               |
| Movie-Genre   |         |         |             | drama         |

From clue 3, we know:
- Drama is in position 4.

From clue 2, we know:
- Fishing corresponds to crime.
- Since fishing is on the left of time-travel, and drama is on the right, fishing cannot be in position 4. Therefore, fishing must be in position 1, and crime must be in position 2.

|               |    1    |    2    |      3      |       4       |
| Hobby         | fishing |         |             |               |
| Movie-Genre   | crime   |         |             | drama         |

From clue 1, we know:
- Mystery is on the left of time-travel.
- Since fishing and crime are already in positions 1 and 2, mystery must be in position 3, and time-travel must be in position 4.

However, from clue 4, we know:
- Time-travel is on the right of writing.
- This means writing must be in position 3, and mystery must be in position 2.

So, let's adjust our table based on these new placements:

|               |    1    |    2    |      3      |       4       |
| Hobby         | fishing | writing | mystery    | travel        |
| Movie-Genre   | crime   | time-travel |          | drama         |

Finally, from clue 5, we know:
- Traveling is on the left of drama.
- This is already satisfied as traveling is in position 4 and drama is in position 4.

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1    |    2    |      3      |       4       |
| Hobby         | fishing | writing | mystery    | travel        |
| Movie-Genre   | crime   | time-travel |          | drama         |

Lv1-2x4-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person who's sport is sailing is the person watching western movies**:
   - Sailing -> Western

2. **The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing**:
   - Disaster -> Surfing (left of Surfing)

3. **The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching action movies**:
   - Disaster -> Action (left of Action)

4. **The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching western movies**:
   - Western -> Disaster (right of Disaster)
   
From points 2 and 4, we can deduce:
- The order must be: Surfing, Action, Disaster, Western.

5. **The person who's sport is basketball is on the far right**:
   - Basketball -> 4th position (Western)

So, the order of sports from left to right is:
- Surfing
- Action
- Disaster
- Basketball (Western)

Now, let's fill in the movie genres based on the order of sports:
- Surfing -> ?
- Action -> ?
- Disaster -> ?
- Basketball (Western) -> ?

Since the movie genres are action, disaster, drama, and western, and we know:
- Western -> Basketball
- So, the remaining genres are action, disaster, and drama.

Given the constraints:
- Disaster is on the left of Action and Western.
- Therefore, Disaster cannot be on the far right (it must be before Western).

We can now place the genres:
- Surfing -> Drama (since itâ€™s not disaster, action, or western)
- Action -> Action (since it must be after disaster and before western)
- Disaster -> Disaster (must be on the left of both action and western)
- Basketball (Western) -> Western (as determined)

### Final Table:

```
|               |    1    |    2     |    3    |     4      |

- P must be to the left of PON.
- Possible pairs: (P, PON)

#### Clue 4: Hamster (HAM) - Hedgehog (H)
- HAM must be to the right of H.
- Possible pairs: (H, HAM)

Now let's combine these clues and deduce the final arrangement.

1. **Clue 1 & Clue 2:**
   - C must be to the left of CA.
   - K must be to the left of H.
   - Combining these, we can have: CK or KC (but since C must be to the left of CA, it can't be KC).

2. **Clue 3 & Clue 4:**
   - P must be to the left of PON.
   - H must be to the right of HAM.
   - Combining these, we can have: PHAM or HAMP (but since H must be to the right of HAM, it can't be HAMP).

3. **Combining all clues:**
   - We need to fit all the conditions together.
   - From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we have: CKH or KHC.
   - From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we have: PHAM or HAMP.

Given these constraints, the only logical arrangement that fits all conditions is:
- C (cucumber) must be first.
- K (kiwi) must be second.
- H (hedgehog) must be third.
- A (cauliflower) must be fourth.
- P (pineapple) must be first.
- PON (pony) must be last.
- HAM (hamster) must be between H and PON.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- C (cucumber) - K (kiwi) - H (hedgehog) - A (cauliflower)
- P (pineapple) - HAM (hamster) - PON (pony)

2. The fan of salsa is on the far right.
3. The fan of indie is on the far left.
4. The owner of the ferret is on the far right.
5. The fan of electronic is on the left of the owner of the rat.

### Initial Setup:
| Music-Genre | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|-------------|------|------|------|------|
| Pet         | Mouse|      |      | Ferret|

From Clue 1 and Clue 4:
- The owner of the mouse is on the far left (position 1).
- The owner of the ferret is on the far right (position 4).

So, we have:
| Music-Genre | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|-------------|------|------|------|------|
| Pet         | Mouse|      |      | Ferret|

From Clue 2 and Clue 3:
- The fan of salsa is on the far right (position 4).
- The fan of indie is on the far left (position 1).

|-------------|------|------|------|------|
| Pet         | Mouse|      |      | Ferret|
| Fan         | Indie|      |      | Salsa|

From Clue 5:
- The fan of electronic is on the left of the owner of the rat.

Since the fan of indie is already in position 1 and the fan of salsa is in position 4, the only positions left for electronic and rat are positions 2 and 3. Therefore, the fan of electronic must be in position 2 and the fan of rat must be in position 3.

So, we have:
| Music-Genre | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|-------------|------|------|------|------|
| Pet         | Mouse|      |      | Ferret|
| Fan         | Indie| Electronic | Rat | Salsa|

Now, we need to match the music genres with their fans:
- The fan of indie is in position 1, so the music genre in position 1 must be indie.
- The fan of electronic is in position 2, so the music genre in position 2 must be electronic.
- The fan of rat is in position 3, so the music genre in position 3 must be rat.
- The fan of salsa is in position 4, so the music genre in position 4 must be salsa.

Thus, the final solution is:

| Music-Genre | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|-------------|------|------|------|------|
| Pet         | Mouse|      |      | Ferret|
| Fan         | Indie| Electronic | Rat | Salsa|

Matching the genres:
- Position 1: Indie -> indie
- Position 2: Electronic -> electronic
- Position 3: Rat -> classical (since it's the only genre left)
- Position 4: Salsa -> salsa

So, the final table is:

| Music-Genre | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|-------------|------|------|------|------|
| Pet         | Mouse|      |      | Ferret|
| Fan         | Indie| Electronic | Rat | Salsa|

And the matching genres are:
- Position 1: indie
- Position 2: electronic
- Position 3: classical
- Position 4: salsa

Final Solution Table:
```
| Music-Genre | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |

Lv1-2x4-8	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person driving the trike is on the right of the designer.
2. The person driving the trike is the musician.
3. The designer is on the right of the chef.
4. The entrepreneur is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
5. The person driving the car is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The person driving the car is on the far left.
   - This means the car is driven by person 1.

2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the trike is the musician.
   - This means the musician is on either position 2, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 1**: The person driving the trike (musician) is on the right of the designer.
   - Since the musician is on positions 2, 3, or 4, and the designer must be to the left of the musician, the designer can only be in position 1, 2, or 3.

4. **Clue 3**: The designer is on the right of the chef.
   - If the designer is in position 1, then the chef cannot be in any position because there would be no space to the left of the designer.
   - Therefore, the designer must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the designer is in position 2, then the chef must be in position 1.
   - If the designer is in position 3, then the chef must be in position 1 or 2.

5. **Clue 4**: The entrepreneur is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
   - Since the person driving the trike (musician) is in position 2, 3, or 4, the entrepreneur must be in position 1 or 2 (left of the trike).

### Final Arrangement:
- From clue 5, the car is driven by person 1.
- From clue 2, the musician is in position 2, 3, or 4.
- From clue 3, if the designer is in position 2, the chef must be in position 1.
- From clue 4, the entrepreneur must be to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.

Given these constraints, let's place the designer and chef first:

- If the designer is in position 2, then the chef must be in position 1.
- The musician is in position 2 (since itâ€™s the rightmost of the designer).
- The entrepreneur must be in position 3 (left of the musician).
- The remaining position (4) will be for the last job (entrepreneur).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Chef
- Position 2: Designer
- Position 3: Entrepreneur
- Position 4: Musician

And the transport:
- Position 1: Car (driven by the chef)
- Position 2: Trike (driven by the musician)
- Position 3: Quad-bike (driven by the entrepreneur)
- Position 4: Tram (the only transport left)

```

### Explanation:

1. **From clue 3**: The person watching zombie movies is on the far right (position 4).
   - This gives us: `Zombie | ? | ? | ? | Family`.

2. **From clue 5**: The person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching spy movies.
   - Since the person watching zombie movies is in position 4, the person watching spy movies must be in position 3.
   - This gives us: `Zombie | ? | Spy | ? | Family`.

3. **From clue 1**: The person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
   - The person driving the ship is in position 4, so the person driving the airplane must be in position 3.
   - This conflicts with our previous step, but since the person driving the ship is already in position 4 and the person watching spy movies is in position 3, we need to re-evaluate.

4. **From clue 2**: The person watching family movies is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
   - Since the person driving the ship is in position 4, the person watching family movies must be in position 1.
   - This gives us: `Family | ? | ? | Spy | Zombie`.

5. **From clue 4**: The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.
   - We have positions 1 and 2 left for the transport modes, and the person driving the helicopter must be in position 1, and the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2.
   - This gives us: `Helicopter | Airplane | Motorbike | Ship`.

Putting it all together:
- Position 1: `Family` (from clue 2)
- Position 2: `Spy` (remaining from clues 1 and 4)
- Position 3: `Airplane` (from clue 2)
- Position 4: `Ship` (from clue 3)

And for transport:
- Position 1: `Helicopter`
- Position 2: `Airplane`
- Position 3: `Motorbike`
- Position 4: `Ship`

So the final solution is:

Lv1-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Beverages and Transports
We have:
- Beverages: cola, hot-chocolate, milk, sprite
- Transports: bus, taxi, train, tram

### Step 2: Analyze the Clues

**Clue 1:** The person driving the bus is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
- This means that if the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1 or 2, the person driving the bus must be in position 3 or 4.

**Clue 2:** The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking cola.
- This means that if the person drinking cola is in position 1 or 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 3 or 4.

**Clue 3:** The person driving the tram is on the left of the person driving the train.
- This means that if the person driving the tram is in position 1 or 2, the person driving the train must be in position 3 or 4.

**Clue 4:** The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person drinking milk.
- This means that if the person drinking milk is in position 1 or 2, the person driving the taxi must be in position 3 or 4.

### Step 3: Deduce the Solution

From **Clue 2**, we know that the person drinking cola must be in position 1 or 2, and the person drinking milk must be in position 3 or 4. This leaves positions 3 and 4 for the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking sprite.

From **Clue 1**, if the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1 or 2, the person driving the bus must be in position 3 or 4. Since the person drinking milk (and thus the person driving the taxi) is also in position 3 or 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 3 or 4.

From **Clue 3**, the person driving the tram must be in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the train must be in position 3 or 4. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3 or 4, the person driving the tram must be in position 1 or 2.

From **Clue 4**, if the person drinking milk is in position 1 or 2, the person driving the taxi must be in position 3 or 4. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3 or 4, the person drinking milk must be in position 1 or 2.

Combining all clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person drinking cola must be in position 1.
- The person drinking milk must be in position 2.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 4.
- The person drinking sprite must be in position 3.

- The person driving the tram must be in position 1.
- The person driving the train must be in position 4.
- The person driving the bus must be in position 3.
- The person driving the taxi must be in position 2.

### Final Solution Table

```
|             |  1   |   2   |       3       |   4    |
| Beverage    | cola | milk  | sprite       | hot-chocolate |
| Transport   | tram | taxi  | bus          | train      |
```

This satisfies all the given conditions."
