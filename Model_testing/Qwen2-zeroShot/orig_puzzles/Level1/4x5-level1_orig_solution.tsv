Lv1-4x5-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Positioning Based on Clues

1. **Clue 6:** The person with the hobby of cooking is on the far left.
2. **Clue 5:** The Egyptian is on the far right.
3. **Clue 3:** The Australian is in the middle (position 3).
4. **Clue 9:** The person driving the train is in the middle (position 3).

From these clues, we can set up the positions:
- Position 1: Cooking
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: Train (Australian)
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: Egyptian

5. **Clue 11:** The Egyptian is the person who's hobby is cooking. This contradicts our previous assumption. Therefore, the Egyptian must be in position 5 and their hobby must be magic-tricks.

So, the updated setup is:
- Position 1: Cooking
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: Train (Australian)
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: Magic-tricks (Egyptian)

6. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the Spanish.
7. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
8. **Clue 5:** The Egyptian is on the far right.
9. **Clue 8:** The Egyptian is on the right of the German.

Since the Egyptian is in position 5, the German must be in position 4. And from clue 1, the person with the hobby of traveling must be in position 4 (German).

So, the updated setup is:
- Position 1: Cooking
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: Train (Australian)
- Position 4: Traveling (German)
- Position 5: Magic-tricks (Egyptian)

10. **Clue 10:** The person driving the scooter is on the right of the Dutch.
11. **Clue 12:** The person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking fanta.

Since the Dutch cannot be in position 5 (Egyptian) or 4 (German), they must be in position 2. And since the person with the hobby of reading must be on the left of the person with the hobby of cooking (clue 2), the person with the hobby of reading must be in position 1.

So, the setup is:
- Position 1: Reading
- Position 2: Dutch
- Position 3: Train (Australian)
- Position 4: Traveling (German)
- Position 5: Magic-tricks (Egyptian)

13. **Clue 12:** The person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
14. **Clue 4:** The person drinking milk is in the middle.
15. **Clue 13:** The person drinking tea is the Dutch.

Since the Dutch drink tea, the Dutch must be in position 2. So, the person in position 1 must drink water and the person in position 4 must drink fanta. The person in position 3 must drink milk.

So, the final setup is:
- Position 1: Reading (Water)
- Position 2: Dutch (Tea)
- Position 3: Train (Australian) (Milk)
- Position 4: Traveling (German) (Fanta)
- Position 5: Magic-tricks (Egyptian)

Let's start placing elements based on these clues.

#### Step 1: Placing ""gospel"" and ""horror""
- From Clue 3: The fan of gospel is the person watching horror movies.
- Therefore, column 1 must be ""horror"" and ""gospel"".

#### Step 2: Placing ""country"" and ""drama""
- From Clue 4: The fan of country is the person watching drama movies.
- Therefore, column 2 must be ""drama"" and ""country"".

#### Step 3: Placing ""scientific"" and ""pop""
- From Clue 5: The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the fan of pop.
- Therefore, column 3 must be ""scientific"" and ""pop"", with ""pop"" being on the left.

#### Step 4: Placing ""ship"" and ""car""
- From Clue 6: The person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching drama movies.
- Therefore, column 4 must be ""time-travel"" (since the person driving the car is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies) and ""ship"".

- Since ""pop"" is already in column 3, the person eating kale must be in column 4 or 5.
- From Clue 10: The person eating lemon is on the left of the person eating zucchini.
- The person eating zucchini is the fan of indie (Clue 10).
- Therefore, the person eating lemon must be in column 1, and the person eating zucchini must be in column 2.

#### Final Placement:
- Column 1: lemon, bike
- Column 2: zucchini, drama, country
- Column 3: pop, scientific
- Column 4: time-travel, ship

Lv1-4x5-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **The fan of d&b is the person who's sport is sailing**:
   - This means the person whose sport is sailing (Mechanic) is the fan of d&b.

2. **The person who's sport is sailing is the mechanic**:
   - This reiterates that the mechanic's sport is sailing and they are the fan of d&b.

3. **The security-guard is on the left of the fan of d&b**:
   - Since the mechanic (sailing) is the fan of d&b, the security-guard must be in position 1.

4. **The person eating potato is on the right of the person eating asparagus**:
   - Let's denote the positions for asparagus and potato as A and P respectively. If A is in position X, then P must be in position X+1.

5. **The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person eating asparagus**:
   - Let's denote the position of the person eating asparagus as A. The person with water-polo is in position A+1.

6. **The designer is the person who's sport is parkour**:
   - The designer is in the position where the sport is parkour.

7. **The fan of country is on the right of the photographer**:
   - Let's denote the positions for the photographer and the fan of country as F and C respectively. If F is in position Y, then C is in position Y+1.

8. **The fan of rock is in the middle**:
   - The fan of rock is in position 3.

9. **The person eating cauliflower is on the left of the fan of d&b**:
   - Since the fan of d&b is in position 2 (mechanic), the person eating cauliflower is in position 1, which is already occupied by the security-guard. So, we need to find another position for the cauliflower.

10. **The person eating potato is on the far right**:
    - Potato is in position 5.

11. **The person eating pumpkin is on the right of the fan of funk**:
    - Let's denote the positions for the fan of funk and the person eating pumpkin as Fk and Pm respectively. If Fk is in position Z, then Pm is in position Z+1.

12. **The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person eating potato**:
    - Skiing is in position 4, and potato is in position 5.

Now let's fill in the positions based on these clues:

- Position 1: Security-guard (from clue 3)
- Position 2: Mechanic (sport: sailing, from clue 2 and 3)
- Position 3: Fan of rock (from clue 8)
- Position 4: Skiing (from clue 12)
- Position 5: Potato (from clue 10)

Next, we need to determine the remaining details:

- Position 1: Security-guard
- Position 2: Mechanic
- Position 3: Fan of rock
- Position 4: Skiing
- Position 5: Potato

We know:
- Asparagus is to the left of potato.
- Asparagus is to the left of water-polo.
- Water-polo is to the left of asparagus.

Since potato is in position 5, asparagus must be in position 3 or 4 (but 3 is already occupied by the fan of rock).

So, asparagus must be in position 4, and water-polo must be in position 5.

- Position 1: Security-guard
- Position 2: Mechanic
- Position 3: Fan of rock
- Position 4: Asparagus
- Position 5: Potato

Now we need to assign the remaining food items:
- Cauliflower must be in position 1 (security-guard) or 2 (mechanic).
- Nectarine must be in the remaining positions.

From clue 9:
- Cauliflower is on the left of the fan of d&b.
- The fan of d&b is in position 2 (mechanic).

So, cauliflower must be in position 1 (security-guard).

- Position 1: Security-guard (asparagus)
- Position 2: Mechanic (d&b, sailing)
- Position 3: Fan of rock (asparagus)
- Position 4: Asparagus (water-polo)
- Position 5: Potato (pumpkin)

Finally, we assign the remaining food items:
- Position 1: Security-guard (asparagus)
- Position 2: Mechanic (d&b, sailing)
- Position 3: Photographer (funk)
- Position 4: Designer (parkour)
- Position 5: Fan of indie (pumpkin)

2. **Clue 12:** The person driving the tram is British.
3. **Clue 7:** The Dutch is in the middle (position 3).
4. **Clue 5:** The French is on the far right (position 5).

So, we can fill in these positions:

5. **Clue 6:** The Egyptian is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
6. **Clue 10:** The Egyptian is on the right of the person eating raspberry.
7. **Clue 3:** The person eating raspberry is in the middle (position 3).

From Clue 3 and Clue 10, the person eating raspberry must be the Dutch (position 3), and the Egyptian must be in position 2. From Clue 6, the person driving the airplane must be in position 4. So, we update the table:
```

Since the person driving the boat is on the left of the engineer, and the pilot is on the left of the person eating banana, the only remaining positions for the engineer and the pilot are 1 and 2. Since the person eating lettuce is on the left of the pilot, the person eating lettuce must be in position 1, and the pilot in position 2. So, we update the table:

12. **Clue 13:** The person eating artichoke is on the right of the person driving the train.

Since the designer is the person eating cherry, the person eating artichoke must be in position 4. The person driving the train is the freelancer, so the freelancer must be in position 4. So, we update the table:
```
|               |     1      |    2     |     3     |     4      |     5     |

```
