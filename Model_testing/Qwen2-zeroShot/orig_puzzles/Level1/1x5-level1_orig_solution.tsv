Lv1-1x5-1	"Sure, let's solve this step by step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The electrician is on the left of the engineer.
2. **Clue 2:** The freelancer is in the middle.
3. **Clue 3:** The writer is on the right of the freelancer.
4. **Clue 4:** The freelancer is on the right of the engineer.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Electrician (E)
- Position 2: Freelancer (F)
- Position 3: Engineer (Eng)
- Position 4: Writer (W)
- Position 5: Videographer (V)

From Clue 2, we know the freelancer is in the middle, so:
- Position 2: Freelancer (F)

From Clue 4, the freelancer is on the right of the engineer, so the engineer must be in position 1:
- Position 1: Engineer (Eng)
- Position 2: Freelancer (F)

From Clue 1, the electrician is on the left of the engineer, but since the engineer is already in position 1, there is no space for the electrician on the left. This means the electrician must be in position 5:
- Position 1: Engineer (Eng)
- Position 2: Freelancer (F)
- Position 5: Electrician (E)

Now, from Clue 3, the writer is on the right of the freelancer, and since the freelancer is in position 2, the writer must be in position 4:
- Position 1: Engineer (Eng)
- Position 2: Freelancer (F)
- Position 4: Writer (W)

This leaves only position 3 for the videographer:
- Position 1: Engineer (Eng)
- Position 2: Freelancer (F)
- Position 3: Videographer (V)
- Position 4: Writer (W)
- Position 5: Electrician (E)

So, the final arrangement is:

```
|       |      1      |    2     |     3      |   4    |      5       |
| Job   | Engineer    | Freelancer | Videographer | Writer | Electrician  |

Lv1-1x5-2	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 4**: The Indian is on the far left.
   - This means the Indian is in position 1.

2. **Clue 1**: The Russian is on the right of the Indian.
   - Since the Indian is in position 1, the Russian must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 2**: The Russian is on the left of the Dutch.
   - This means the Dutch cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since the Russian would have to be to the left of the Dutch). So, the Dutch must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

4. **Clue 3**: The Dutch is on the left of the British.
   - This means the British must be in a position to the right of the Dutch.

Let's now place the nationalities based on these constraints:

- Position 1: Indian (from Clue 4)
- Position 2: Russian (from Clues 1 and 2)

Now we need to place the Dutch and British:
- The Dutch cannot be in position 1 or 2, so they can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- The British must be to the right of the Dutch, so if the Dutch is in position 3, the British can be in position 4 or 5; if the Dutch is in position 4, the British can only be in position 5.

Given these options, let's try placing the Dutch and British:

- If the Dutch is in position 3, then the British could be in position 4 or 5. But this would leave no room for the Russian in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 without violating the order. So, the Dutch cannot be in position 3.
- Therefore, the Dutch must be in position 4, and the British in position 5.

This leaves the German to be placed in the remaining position, which is 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Indian
- Position 2: Russian
- Position 3: German
- Position 4: Dutch
- Position 5: British

Here is the final solution table:

```
|               |   1    |    2    |   3   |    4    |   5    |

Lv1-1x5-3	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.
2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
3. The person who's hobby is dancing is in the middle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is dancing is in the middle. This means that dancing is in position 3.

   ```
   |         |    1    |       2       |    3    |     4     |     5     |
   | Hobby   |         |               | Dancing |           |           |
   ```

2. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since dancing is in position 3, rock-climbing must be in position 1 or 2.

   - If rock-climbing were in position 1, then it would need to be followed immediately by dancing in position 2, which contradicts the fact that dancing is in position 3. Therefore, rock-climbing must be in position 2.

   ```
   |         | Rock-Climbing |       2       |    3    |           |           |
   | Hobby   |         |               | Dancing |           |           |
   ```

3. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since positions 1 and 2 are taken by rock-climbing and dancing respectively, the only remaining positions for gardening and skydiving are 4 and 5.

   - Gardening must be in position 5 because it has to be on the right of skydiving, and skydiving must be in position 4.

   ```
   |         | Rock-Climbing |       2       |    3    | Skydiving | Gardening|
   | Hobby   |         |               | Dancing |           |           |
   ```

4. **Remaining Hobbies:**
   - The only remaining hobbies are camping. It must occupy the last remaining position, which is position 1.

   ```
   | Camping | Rock-Climbing |       2       |    3    | Skydiving | Gardening|
   | Hobby   |         |               | Dancing |           |           |
   ```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Camping | Rock-Climbing |       2       |    3    | Skydiving | Gardening|
| Hobby   |         |               | Dancing |           |           |

Lv1-1x5-4	"Sure, let's solve this step by step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating potato is on the right of the person eating plum.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating strawberry is in the middle (position 3).
3. **Clue 3**: The person eating strawberry is on the left of the person eating pomegranate.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: First person
- Position 2: Second person
- Position 3: Third person (middle position)
- Position 4: Fourth person
- Position 5: Fifth person

From Clue 2, we know that the third position is occupied by strawberry:
```
|        |  1   |   2    |     3      |      4      |   5    |
| Food   |      |        | strawberry |             |        |
```

From Clue 3, since strawberry is on the left of pomegranate, pomegranate must be in either position 4 or 5. However, from Clue 1, we know that potato is to the right of plum. This means that if pomegranate is in position 5, then potato and plum cannot fit the requirement of being next to each other with plum to the left. Therefore, pomegranate must be in position 4:
```
|        |  1   |   2    |     3      |      4      |   5    |
| Food   |      |        | strawberry | pomegranate |        |
```

Now, from Clue 1, potato must be in position 5 and plum in position 4, but since pomegranate is already in position 4, potato must be in position 5 and plum in position 2:
```
|        |  1   |   2    |     3      |      4      |   5    |
| Food   |      | plum   | strawberry | pomegranate | potato |
```

The only food left is grapes, which must be in position 1:
```
|        |  1   |   2    |     3      |      4      |   5    |
| Food   | grapes| plum   | strawberry | pomegranate | potato |
```

So, the final solution is:
```
|        |  1   |   2    |     3      |      4      |   5    |
| Food   | grapes| plum   | strawberry | pomegranate | potato |

Lv1-1x5-5	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

We have 5 positions and 5 nationalities:
- French (F)
- Indonesian (I)
- Russian (R)
- Spanish (S)
- Turkish (T)

The given clues are:
1. The Indonesian is on the left of the Turkish.
2. The Spanish is in the middle.
3. The Spanish is on the right of the French.

From clue 2, we know that the Spanish must be in position 3. So, we can write:
\[ \text{Position 3} = S \]

Now, let's use clue 3, which states that the Spanish is on the right of the French. Since Spanish is in position 3, the French must be in one of the first two positions. Therefore, the French can only be in position 1 or 2. Let's consider both possibilities:

### Case 1: French in position 1
If the French is in position 1, then the Spanish (in position 3) is to the right of the French. This fits with the third clue. Now we need to place the remaining nationalities (Indonesian and Russian) in positions 2 and 4, 5. Using the first clue, the Indonesian must be to the left of the Turkish. So, the Indonesian can be in position 2 and the Turkish in position 4 or 5. However, if the Indonesian is in position 2, the Turkish must be in position 5, and the remaining Russian would fit in position 4. Let's check:
\[ \text{Position 1} = F \]
\[ \text{Position 2} = I \]
\[ \text{Position 3} = S \]
\[ \text{Position 4} = R \]
\[ \text{Position 5} = T \]

This satisfies all the clues.

### Case 2: French in position 2
If the French is in position 2, then the Spanish (in position 3) is to the right of the French. This also fits with the third clue. Now we need to place the remaining nationalities (Indonesian and Russian) in positions 1, 4, 5. Using the first clue, the Indonesian must be to the left of the Turkish. So, the Indonesian can be in position 1 and the Turkish in position 4 or 5. However, if the Indonesian is in position 1, the Turkish must be in position 5, and the remaining Russian would fit in position 4. But this doesn't work because the Indonesian cannot be in position 1 and still leave room for the Turkish to be to the right of the Indonesian. Therefore, this case is invalid.

Thus, the only valid solution is:
\[ \text{Position 1} = F \]
\[ \text{Position 2} = I \]
\[ \text{Position 3} = S \]
\[ \text{Position 4} = R \]
\[ \text{Position 5} = T \]

So, the final solution is:
```

### Clues Recap:
1. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies.
2. The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies.
3. The person watching action movies is in the middle (position 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 3 is for Action Movies**:
   - From clue 3, we know that the person watching action movies is in position 3.

2. **Action and Time-Travel Clue**:
   - From clue 2, the person watching action movies (position 3) is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies.
   - Therefore, the person watching time-travel movies must be in either position 4 or 5.

3. **Comedy and Crime Clue**:
   - From clue 1, the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies.
   - Since positions 1 and 2 are the only remaining options for comedy and crime, we can place them here.

4. **Determine Remaining Positions**:
   - We have positions 1 and 2 for comedy and crime, and positions 4 and 5 for action and time-travel.
   - Given that the action movie person is in position 3, we need to determine which is which between positions 4 and 5.

Let's try placing comedy and crime in positions 1 and 2:
- If position 1 is comedy and position 2 is crime, then position 4 or 5 must be time-travel.

Since action is in position 3 and time-travel is on the right of action, time-travel must be in position 5.

This leaves position 4 for horror.

### Final Table:
```
|               |   1    |   2   |   3    |      4      |   5    |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy | Crime | Action | Horror     | Time-travel |

Lv1-1x5-7	"Certainly! Let's solve this step by step using the given clues.

1. **The Polish person is on the far left.**
   - This means the Polish person must be in position 1.
   
2. **The Polish is on the left of the Colombian.**
   - Since the Polish person is already in position 1, the Colombian must be in position 2 or further to the right.

3. **The Turkish is on the left of the Indonesian.**
   - This means the Turkish person must be before the Indonesian person in the sequence.

4. **The Brazilian is on the right of the Indonesian.**
   - This means the Indonesian person must be before the Brazilian person in the sequence.

Given these clues, let's fill in the positions:

- Position 1: Polish (P)
- Position 2: Could be either Turkish (T) or Colombian (C), but since the Indonesian (I) and Brazilian (B) need to be positioned accordingly, we'll revisit this later.
- Position 3: Could be Indonesian (I) or Turkish (T).
- Position 4: Could be Indonesian (I) or Brazilian (B).
- Position 5: Could be Indonesian (I) or Brazilian (B).

Since the Turkish person is on the left of the Indonesian and the Brazilian is on the right of the Indonesian, the only logical placement for these three is:
- Position 3: Indonesian (I)
- Position 4: Brazilian (B)
- Position 5: Turkish (T)

Now, we need to place the Colombian in the remaining position, which is position 2.

So, the final arrangement is:

2. The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the train.
3. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the bus.
4. The person driving the quad-bike is on the far right.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: First position
- Position 2: Second position
- Position 3: Third position
- Position 4: Fourth position
- Position 5: Fifth position (far right)

From clue 4, we know:
- The person driving the quad-bike is in position 5.

Now, from clue 2, since the person driving the quad-bike is in position 5 and they are on the right of the person driving the train, the person driving the train must be in position 4.

So, we have:
- Position 4: Train
- Position 5: Quad-bike

From clue 1, since the person driving the train (position 4) is on the right of the person driving the tram, the person driving the tram must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 3: Tram
- Position 4: Train
- Position 5: Quad-bike

From clue 3, since the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the bus, and we have positions 1, 2, and 3 left, the only way to fit these into the remaining spots is if the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2 and the person driving the bus is in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Snowmobile
- Position 2: Bus
- Position 3: Tram
- Position 4: Train
- Position 5: Quad-bike

This satisfies all the given clues. Therefore, the final solution is:

2. **Clue 2**: The owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the goldfish.
   - Since the mouse is in Position 3, the goldfish must be in Position 1 or 2.
   - If the goldfish were in Position 2, then the mouse would not be to its right. Therefore, the goldfish must be in Position 1.
   ```
   | Goldfish |      | Mouse    | Mouse |        | Dog |

1. **Given Conditions:**
   - The person eating potato (P) is on the left of the person eating eggplant (E).
   - The person eating grapefruit (G) is in the middle.
   - The person eating cranberry (C) is on the left of the person eating raspberry (R).
   - The person eating potato (P) is on the right of the person eating grapefruit (G).

2. **Determine the Middle Position:**
   - Since G is in the middle, it must be in position 3.

3. **Positioning P and E:**
   - From condition 1 and condition 4, we know that:
     - P is to the left of G and E.
     - Therefore, P must be in position 1 or 2.
     - Since P is also to the right of G, this means P cannot be in position 2 because G is in position 3. So, P must be in position 1.
     - Consequently, E must be in position 4.

4. **Positioning C and R:**
   - From condition 3, C is on the left of R.
   - The only positions left are 2 and 5.
   - Therefore, C must be in position 2 and R must be in position 5.
