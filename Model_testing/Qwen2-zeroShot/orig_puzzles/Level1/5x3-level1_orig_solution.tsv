Lv1-5x3-1	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We start with the given constraints and fill in the table accordingly:

### Constraints:
1. The fan of techno is on the right of the person watching thriller movies.
2. The security-guard is in the middle.
3. The journalist is the person drinking juice.
4. The person driving the snowmobile is in the middle.
5. The person driving the scooter is the teacher.
6. The fan of ambient is on the far right.
7. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far right.
8. The person watching time-travel movies is the teacher.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **From Constraint 3 (Journalist is the person drinking juice)**:
   - Journalist → Juice

2. **From Constraint 5 (Person driving the scooter is the teacher)**:
   - Teacher → Scooter

3. **From Constraint 8 (Person watching time-travel movies is the teacher)**:
   - Teacher → Time-travel

4. **From Constraint 4 (Person driving the snowmobile is in the middle)**:

5. **From Constraint 2 (Security-guard is in the middle)**:
   - Middle → Security-guard

6. **From Constraint 6 (Fan of ambient is on the far right)**:
   - Far right → Ambient

7. **From Constraint 7 (Person drinking iced-tea is on the far right)**:
   - Far right → Iced-tea

Since the far right is already assigned to both Ambient and Iced-tea, and we need to assign these two to different columns, we know that Iced-tea must be in column 3, and Ambient must be in column 1.

8. **From Constraint 1 (Fan of techno is on the right of the person watching thriller movies)**:
   - Thriller must be in column 1 or 2, and Techno must be in column 2 or 3.
   - Since Iced-tea (far right) and Ambient (far left) are fixed, the only place for Thriller and Techno is 1 and 2 respectively, with Techno on the right of Thriller.

9. **From Constraint 3 (Journalist is the person drinking juice)**:
   - Journalist must be in column 1, so column 1 is Juice.

10. **From Constraint 6 (Fan of ambient is on the far right)**:
    - Ambient must be in column 3.

11. **From Constraint 7 (Person drinking iced-tea is on the far right)**:
    - Iced-tea must be in column 3.

12. **From Constraint 5 (Person driving the scooter is the teacher)**:
    - Teacher must be in column 2, so column 2 is Scooter.

13. **From Constraint 4 (Person driving the snowmobile is in the middle)**:
    - Security-guard must be in column 2, so column 2 is Security-guard.

14. **From Constraint 8 (Person watching time-travel movies is the teacher)**:
    - Teacher must be in column 2, so column 2 is Time-travel.

Lv1-5x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to fill in the table based on the given clues. Let's break down the information and deduce step-by-step:

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person watching musical movies.
2. The fan of electronic is on the far right.
3. The person watching horror movies is the fan of disco.
4. The fan of disco is the Argentine.
5. The owner of the bird is in the middle.
6. The French is on the right of the entrepreneur.
7. The entrepreneur is the owner of the lizard.
8. The paramedic is on the left of the freelancer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the fans and their pets
- From clue 2: The fan of electronic is on the far right (position 3).
- From clue 7: The entrepreneur is the owner of the lizard, and the paramedic is on the left of the freelancer.
- From clue 1: The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person watching musical movies. Therefore, the owner of the lizard cannot be in position 3.

#### Step 2: Determine the fan of disco
- From clue 3: The person watching horror movies is the fan of disco.
- From clue 4: The fan of disco is the Argentine.
- Therefore, the Argentine is the fan of disco and watches horror movies.

#### Step 3: Determine the positions of the Argentine
- The Argentine is in position 1 because the fan of electronic is in position 3, and the Argentine cannot be there.

#### Step 4: Determine the positions of the paramedic and freelancer
- From clue 7: The entrepreneur is the owner of the lizard and is not in position 3 (since the fan of electronic is there).
- The paramedic is on the left of the freelancer, so if the entrepreneur is the owner of the lizard, the paramedic must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the Argentine is in position 1, the paramedic cannot be in position 1.
- Therefore, the paramedic is in position 2, and the freelancer is in position 3.

#### Step 5: Determine the pet owners
- The owner of the lizard is in position 2 (the paramedic).
- The owner of the bird is in the middle (position 2), but since the paramedic owns the lizard, the bird owner must be in position 1 or 3.
- Since the Argentine is in position 1, the bird owner must be in position 3.
- Therefore, the bird owner is the freelancer.
- The remaining pet (pony) must be owned by the entrepreneur in position 1.

#### Step 6: Determine the movie genres and music genres
- The person watching horror movies is the fan of disco (Argentine in position 1).
- The person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the lizard (paramedic in position 2).
- Therefore, the person watching musical movies is the freelancer in position 3.
- The remaining genre (thriller) must be watched by the entrepreneur in position 1.

#### Step 7: Determine the music genres
- The fan of electronic is in position 3.
- The fan of disco is the Argentine in position 1.
- The remaining genre (metal) must be the preferred music genre for the freelancer in position 3.
- Therefore, the entrepreneur in position 1 prefers disco, and the paramedic in position 2 prefers electronic.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |

Lv1-5x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break down the clues step by step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The American is on the left of the person whose sport is tennis.
2. **Clue 2:** The person whose sport is climbing is the person driving the taxi.
3. **Clue 3:** The American is on the right of the fan of electronic.
4. **Clue 4:** The American is on the right of the person driving the helicopter.
5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the trike is on the right of the person drinking milk.
6. **Clue 6:** The person drinking 7up is on the far left.
7. **Clue 7:** The Italian is on the left of the fan of punk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6:** The person drinking 7up is on the far left.
   - This means the first column must be 7up.

2. **Clue 1 & Clue 4:** The American is on the left of the person whose sport is tennis and also on the right of the person driving the helicopter.
   - Since the American cannot be on both sides of another person, the American must be in the middle column (2).

3. **Clue 2:** The person whose sport is climbing is the person driving the taxi.
   - This means the third column cannot have climbing or driving the taxi.

4. **Clue 3:** The American is on the right of the fan of electronic.
   - Since the American is in the middle column, the fan of electronic must be in the first column.

5. **Clue 7:** The Italian is on the left of the fan of punk.
   - Since the American is in the middle, the Italian must be in the first column, making the fan of punk in the third column.

6. **Clue 5:** The person driving the trike is on the right of the person drinking milk.
   - The person drinking milk cannot be in the third column (since the fan of punk is there), so it must be in the second column.

7. **Clue 2:** The person whose sport is climbing is the person driving the taxi.
   - Since the taxi is in the second column and the person drinking milk is in the second column, the sport of climbing cannot be in the second column. Therefore, the sport of climbing must be in the third column.

8. **Remaining Assignments:**
   - The first column is 7up (from Clue 6).
   - The second column is the American (from Clue 1 & Clue 4).
   - The third column is the person drinking milk (from Clue 5).

Lv1-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the snake is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
2. The owner of the rabbit is the fan of electronic.
3. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's hobby is chess.
4. The scientist is on the far right.
5. The fan of house is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.
6. The librarian is on the far left.
7. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left.
8. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From clue 7**: The person with the hobby ""reading"" must be in position 1 (leftmost) and the person with the sport ""golf"" must be in position 3 (rightmost).

2. **From clue 6**: The librarian is on the far left, so the librarian must be in position 1. Since the librarian has the hobby ""reading"", we can fill in the first row as follows:
   - Position 1: Librarian, Reading, Golf

3. **From clue 4**: The scientist is on the far right, so the scientist must be in position 3. This means the scientist cannot be the librarian or the one with the hobby ""reading"" or the sport ""golf"".

4. **From clue 3**: The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's hobby is chess. Since the person with the hobby ""chess"" cannot be in position 1 (Librarian), they must be in position 2. So, the sport ""skateboarding"" must be in position 2.

5. **From clue 2**: The owner of the rabbit is the fan of electronic. Since the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" must be to the left of the owner of the snake (clue 1), the owner of the rabbit cannot be in position 3 (since it would violate clue 1). Also, since the owner of the rabbit is the fan of electronic, and electronic is not the same as house or d&b, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 2 (since position 1 is taken by the librarian and position 3 by the scientist).

6. **From clue 5**: The fan of house is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the rabbit is in position 2, the fan of house must be in position 1, but position 1 is already taken by the librarian. Therefore, the fan of house must be in position 3, and the owner of the rabbit must be in position 2.

7. **From clue 1**: The owner of the snake is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" must be in position 1 (Librarian) and the owner of the snake must be in position 3 (Scientist), the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" must be in position 2.

8. **From clue 8**: The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the librarian is in position 1 and has the hobby ""reading"", and the sport ""golf"" is in position 3, the person with the sport ""golf"" must be in position 3.

9. **Remaining Hobbies and Sports**:
   - The remaining hobby is ""chess"" for the person in position 2.
   - The remaining sport is ""snowboarding"" for the person in position 1.
   - The remaining sport is ""d&b"" for the person in position 3.

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |      1       |     2      |       3       |
| Hobby         |  Reading    |  Chess     |   Puzzles    |
| Job           |  Scientist  |  Journalist|   Librarian  |
| Music-Genre   |  House      |  Electronic|   d&b        |
| Pet           |  Rabbit     |  Snake     |   Pony       |
| Sport         |  Snowboarding |  Skateboarding |  Golf       |
```

### Final Solution Table:

   - Therefore, the person driving the subway cannot be in position 3 (since the person in position 3 is drinking coffee).
   - Since the person in position 1 cannot be the person driving the subway (as they would be to the left of someone who has not been assigned a pet yet), the person driving the subway must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, **Transport for position 2**: Subway.
   
7. **Identify the person eating potato**:
   - The person eating potato is on the right of the owner of the rat.
   - Therefore, the person eating potato must be in position 3, and the owner of the rat must be in position 2.
   - Since position 3 is already occupied by the person drinking coffee, the person eating potato must be in position 3, and the owner of the rat must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, **Food for position 3**: Potato.
   - **Pet for position 2**: Rat.
   
8. **Identify the remaining person**:
   - The remaining person must be the American.
   - Therefore, **Nationality for position 1**: American.
   - The only beverage left for the American is soy-milk.
   - Therefore, **Beverage for position 1**: Soy-milk.
   - The only pet left for the American is the bird.
   - Therefore, **Pet for position 1**: Bird.
   - The only transport left for the American is the trike.

Lv1-5x3-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The Brazilian is the fan of metal.**
2. **The person eating banana is on the far right.**
3. **The person whose hobby is card-games is on the far right.**
4. **The entrepreneur is on the left of the fan of disco.**
5. **The Chinese is on the left of the fan of metal.**
6. **The fan of disco is on the right of the fan of metal.**
7. **The entrepreneur is in the middle.**
8. **The person whose hobby is filmmaking is in the middle.**
9. **The person eating nectarine is on the right of the coach.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions based on hobbies and preferences.
- From clue 3, the person with the hobby of card-games is on the far right (position 3).
- From clue 8, the person with the hobby of filmmaking is in the middle (position 2).

So we have:
```
| Food    | Hobby       | Job        | Music-Genre | Nationality |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
|         |             |            |             |             |
|         | Filmmaking  |            |             |             |
|         | Card-games  |            |             |             |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the positions for the Brazilian and the Chinese.
- From clue 1, the Brazilian is the fan of metal.
- From clue 5, the Chinese is on the left of the fan of metal.
- From clue 6, the fan of disco is on the right of the fan of metal.

Since the fan of metal is on the right of the Chinese, and the fan of disco is on the right of the fan of metal, the order must be:
- Chinese -> Fan of Metal -> Fan of Disco

Thus, the Brazilian is in position 3 (fan of metal) and the Chinese is in position 1.

So we have:
```
| Food    | Hobby       | Job        | Music-Genre | Nationality |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
|        |             |            |             | Chinese     |
|        | Filmmaking  |            |             |             |
|        | Card-games  |            |             | Brazilian   |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the positions for the entrepreneur and the coach.
- From clue 7, the entrepreneur is in the middle (position 2).
- From clue 4, the entrepreneur is on the left of the fan of disco. Since the fan of disco is in position 3, the entrepreneur must be in position 2.

So we have:
```
| Food    | Hobby       | Job        | Music-Genre | Nationality |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
|        |             | Entrepreneur|             | Chinese     |
|        | Filmmaking  |            |             |             |
|        | Card-games  |            |             | Brazilian   |
```

- From clue 9, the person eating nectarine is on the right of the coach. Since the coach cannot be in position 3 (card-games), it must be in position 1 or 2. Given that the entrepreneur is in position 2, the coach must be in position 1.

So we have:
```
| Food    | Hobby       | Job        | Music-Genre | Nationality |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Nectarine| Filmmaking  | Entrepreneur|             | Chinese     |
| Banana   | Filmmaking  |            |             |             |
| Card-games| Card-games  |            |             | Brazilian   |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the remaining details.
- The remaining job is the designer, which must be in position 3 (entrepreneur is already there).
- The remaining music genre is r&b, which must be in position 1 (metal and disco are already there).
- The remaining food is lime, which must be in position 2.

So we have:
```
| Food    | Hobby       | Job        | Music-Genre | Nationality |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Lime    | Filmmaking  | Designer   | R&B         | Chinese     |
| Banana  | Filmmaking  |            |             |             |
| Card-games| Card-games  | Entrepreneur| Disco      | Brazilian   |
```

- The remaining nationality is Malaysian, which must be in position 2.

So the final solution is:
```
| Food    | Hobby       | Job        | Music-Genre | Nationality |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Lime    | Filmmaking  | Designer   | R&B         | Chinese     |

#### Clue 6:
- The person whose sport is cricket is on the left of the person eating peach.

Since trance is already in position 1, the person with cricket must be in position 2 and the person eating peach must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```

```

#### Clue 1:
- The entrepreneur is on the left of the person eating peach.

So, the entrepreneur must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               | Entrepreneur | Trance    | Peach              |
| Food          |              |           |                    |

```

#### Clue 8:
- The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the entrepreneur.

So, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|               | Entrepreneur | Trance    | Thriller           |
| Food          |              |           |                    |

| Sport         | Cricket      | Trance    | Peach              |
```

#### Clue 2:
- The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person eating peach.

So, the person watching satire movies must be in position 3.

But we already have the person eating peach in position 3, so this means the person watching satire movies cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the person watching satire movies must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               | Entrepreneur | Satire    | Peach              |
| Food          |              |           |                    |

#### Clue 3:
- The person eating potato is the person watching zombie movies.

So, the person eating potato must be in position 3, and the person watching zombie movies must also be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|               | Entrepreneur | Satire    | Potato             |
| Food          |              |           |                    |

```

#### Clue 4:
- The fan of gospel is on the right of the fan of trance.

So, the person with gospel must be in position 3, and the person with trance must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               | Entrepreneur | Gospel    | Trance             |
| Food          |              |           |                    |

```

#### Clue 5:
- The software-developer is on the right of the person whose sport is sailing.

So, the software-developer must be in position 3, and the person whose sport is sailing must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               | Entrepreneur | Librarian  | Software-developer |
| Food          |              |           |                    |

| Sport         | Cricket      | Sailing    | Peach              |
```

Now, we need to assign the remaining food and music genres:

- The entrepreneur must eat papaya (since peach and potato are already assigned).
- The librarian must listen to house (since gospel and trance are already assigned).

So, we have:
```
|               | Entrepreneur | Librarian  | Software-developer |
| Food          | Papaya       | Potato     | Peach              |

Lv1-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person driving the tram is on the left of the person whose hobby is video-games.
2. The person eating potato is on the far left.
3. The person eating potato is the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
4. The person eating pumpkin is on the right of the fan of d&b.
5. The fan of d&b is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
6. The person driving the subway is on the far right.
7. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
8. The person whose hobby is video-games is the person drinking water.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning based on Clue 2 and Clue 3
- **Clue 2**: The person eating potato is on the far left.
- **Clue 3**: The person eating potato is the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.

So, the first column (leftmost) must be:
- **Food**: Potato
- **Hobby**: Magic-tricks

#### Step 2: Positioning based on Clue 6 and Clue 7
- **Clue 6**: The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
- **Clue 7**: The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan of dubstep.

Since the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan of dubstep, and there is only one person in each row, we can place these two items together in the second or third column.

#### Step 3: Positioning based on Clue 8
- **Clue 8**: The person whose hobby is video-games is the person drinking water.

This means the person drinking water has the hobby of video-games.

#### Step 4: Positioning based on Clue 1 and Clue 4
- **Clue 1**: The person driving the tram is on the left of the person whose hobby is video-games.
- **Clue 4**: The person eating pumpkin is on the right of the fan of d&b.

From Clue 1, the person drinking water (video-games) cannot be in the first column because the person driving the tram is to their left. So, the person drinking water must be in the third column.

From Clue 4, the fan of d&b is to the left of the person eating pumpkin. Since the person drinking water is in the third column, the fan of d&b must be in the second column, and the person eating pumpkin must be in the third column.

#### Step 5: Positioning based on Clue 5
- **Clue 5**: The fan of d&b is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.

This confirms that the fan of d&b is in the second column, and the person drinking lemonade is in the first column.

#### Step 6: Final Placement
- **Clue 6**: The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
- **Clue 7**: The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan of dubstep.

The person drinking lemonade is in the first column, and the fan of dubstep is in the second column.

- **Clue 6** and **Clue 7** are already satisfied with the current placement.
