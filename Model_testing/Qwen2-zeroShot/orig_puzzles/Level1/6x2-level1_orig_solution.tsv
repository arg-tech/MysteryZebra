Lv1-6x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to use the given clues to fill in the table step by step. Let's break down the clues and see how they fit together.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the goat is on the far left.
2. The accountant is on the right of the person driving the roller.
3. The person drinking mirinda is on the far right.
4. The French is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Owner of the Goat is on the far left:**
   - This means the goat is in position 1 for one of the individuals.

2. **Person Drinking Mirinda is on the far right:**
   - This means mirinda is in position 2 for one of the individuals.

3. **Accountant is on the right of the person driving the roller:**
   - This means if someone is driving the roller, the accountant must be to their right.

4. **French is on the right of the person watching zombie movies:**
   - This means if someone is watching zombie movies, the French must be to their right.

Let's start placing the known items:

|               |     1      |     2      |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Beverage      |    Goat    |    Mirinda |
| Job           |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |
| Pet           |            |            |
| Transport     |            |            |

From clue 2, we know that the accountant cannot be in position 1 because there is no one to the left of them. So, the accountant must be in position 2.

From clue 4, the French cannot be in position 1 because there is no one to the left of them. So, the French must be in position 2.

From clue 1, the goat is in position 1.

From clue 3, the person driving the roller must be in position 1, and the accountant (position 2) must be to their right. Therefore, the roller is driven by the person in position 1, and the accountant is in position 2.

From clue 4, the French (position 2) must be to the right of the person watching zombie movies. Since the French is already in position 2, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Beverage      |    Goat    |    Mirinda |
| Job           |    Accountant |  Journalist  |
| Movie-Genre   |    Zombie  |    Thriller |
| Nationality   |    Malaysian |  French     |
| Pet           |            |            |
| Transport     |    Roller  |    Van     |

We still need to determine the pet and nationality for each individual based on the remaining information.

Since the goat is in position 1 and the ferret is the other pet, the ferret must be in position 2.

Since the Malaysian is in position 1 and the French is in position 2, the Malaysian must be the one with the goat, and the French must be the one with the ferret.

So, the final table is:

|               |     1      |     2      |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Beverage      |    Goat    |    Mirinda |
| Job           |    Accountant |  Journalist  |
| Movie-Genre   |    Zombie  |    Thriller |
| Nationality   |    Malaysian |  French     |
| Pet           |    Ferret  |    Goat    |
| Transport     |    Roller  |    Van     |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Beverage      |    Goat    |    Mirinda |
| Job           |    Accountant |  Journalist  |
| Movie-Genre   |    Zombie  |    Thriller |
| Nationality   |    Malaysian |  French     |

Lv1-6x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The fan of pop is on the right of the owner of the rat.**
2. **The person drinking water is the fan of pop.**
3. **The person watching action movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.**
4. **The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the owner of the bird.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Fan of Pop and Owner of Rat
- From Clue 2: The person drinking water is the fan of pop.
- From Clue 1: The fan of pop is on the right of the owner of the rat.

So, let's place these:
- **Person 1**: Drinking water (pop fan)
- **Person 2**: Owner of the rat (pop fan's neighbor)

#### Step 2: Place the Beverages and Music Genres
- We know there are two beverages: 7up and water.
- Since Person 1 is drinking water, Person 2 must be drinking 7up.

So, the table now looks like:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Beverage      |    Water   |    7up  |
| Hobby         |            |         |
| Movie-Genre   |            |         |
| Music-Genre   |    Pop     |    Pop  |
| Pet           |            |         |
| Transport     |            |         |
```

#### Step 3: Place the Hobbies
- From Clue 3: The person watching action movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
- From Clue 4: The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the owner of the bird.

Since Person 1 and Person 2 are already placed, we can infer the following:
- If Person 1 is not camping, then Person 2 must be camping.
- If Person 1 is not driving the motorbike, then Person 2 must be driving the motorbike.

Let's assume:
- **Person 1**: Action movies (since it's on the left of camping)
- **Person 2**: Camping

So, the table now looks like:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Beverage      |    Water   |    7up  |
| Hobby         |  Action    |  Camping|
| Movie-Genre   |            |         |
| Music-Genre   |    Pop     |    Pop  |
| Pet           |            |         |
| Transport     |            |         |
```

#### Step 4: Place the Pets and Transport
- From Clue 4: The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the owner of the bird.
- Since Person 1 is already assigned action movies and camping, we need to assign the pet and transport for Person 1 and Person 2.

Let's assume:
- **Person 1**: Bird (since it's on the left of the motorbike driver)
- **Person 2**: Motorbike

So, the table now looks like:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Beverage      |    Water   |    7up  |
| Hobby         |  Action    |  Camping|
| Movie-Genre   |            |         |
| Music-Genre   |    Pop     |    Pop  |
| Pet           |    Bird    |    Rat  |
| Transport     | Motorbike  |    Ship |
```

#### Step 5: Finalize the Movie Genres
- From Clue 3: The person watching action movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
- This implies that the movie genre for Person 1 should be action, which is already correct.
- The remaining movie genre is crime, so:
  - **Person 1**: Crime
  - **Person 2**: Action

So, the final table is:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Beverage      |    Water   |    7up  |
| Hobby         |  Action    |  Camping|
| Movie-Genre   |    Crime   |    Action|
| Music-Genre   |    Pop     |    Pop  |
| Pet           |    Bird    |    Rat  |
| Transport     | Motorbike  |    Ship |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Beverage      |    Water   |    7up  |
| Hobby         |  Action    |  Camping|
| Movie-Genre   |    Crime   |    Action|
| Music-Genre   |    Pop     |    Pop  |
| Pet           |    Bird    |    Rat  |
| Transport     | Motorbike  |    Ship |

### Clues:
1. The person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the Polish.
2. The Malaysian is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.
3. The person watching adventure movies is the manager.
4. The person eating potato is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- The manager watches adventure movies.
- This means the manager cannot be in the second column (since the first column must be the person eating potato, as per Clue 4).

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- The person eating potato is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.
- Since the manager watches adventure movies, the person eating potato must be in the first column.

So, we can place ""potato"" in the first column under ""Food"".

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the Polish.
- Since the person eating potato is in the first column, the person with the hobby of hiking must be in the second column.

So, we can place ""hiking"" in the second column under ""Hobby"".

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The Malaysian is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.
- Since the person with the hobby of hiking is in the second column, the Malaysian must be in the first column.

So, we can place ""Malaysian"" in the first column under ""Nationality"".

#### Step 5: Determine the remaining columns
- We now know that the first column is ""Malaysian"".
- The second column must be ""Polish"" because the person with the hobby of hiking is on the left of the Polish (from Clue 1).
- The person eating potato is in the first column, so the person watching adventure movies (the manager) must be in the second column under ""Job"".

So, we can place ""manager"" in the second column under ""Job"".

#### Step 6: Determine the remaining preferences
- The person watching horror movies must be in the first column since the manager watches adventure movies.
- The person preferring hip-hop must be in the second column since the Malaysian prefers hip-hop (from Clue 2).

So, we can place ""horror"" in the first column under ""Movie-Genre"" and ""hip-hop"" in the second column under ""Music-Genre"".

The Nigerian is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since 7up is in position 1, the Nigerian must be in position 2.

|               |    1    |       2       |

#### Step 3: Placing the Mystery Movie Fan
The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the fan of funk. We don't know who these people are yet, but we know they must be in positions 1 and 2, respectively. Since the chef (position 1) is already placed, the mystery movie fan must be in position 1, and the fan of funk must be in position 2.

|               |    1    |       2       |

Lv1-6x2-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The videographer is on the far right.**
   - This means the videographer is in position 2.

2. **The fan of metal is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.**
   - This means if someone prefers time-travel movies, they must be in position 1 and the fan of metal must be in position 2.

3. **The person drinking mirinda is on the far right.**
   - This means the person drinking mirinda is in position 2.

4. **The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.**

### Initial Setup:
We start with the known positions from the clues:
- Videographer is in position 2.
- Person drinking mirinda is in position 2.
- Motor is in position 2 for transport.

So, the table looks like this:
```
|               |      1      |      2       |
| Beverage      |             |  Mirinda     |

| Music-Genre   |             |              |
| Transport     | motor       |  Motorbike   |
```

### Applying Remaining Clues:
5. **The fan of metal is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.**
   - Since the person drinking mirinda (position 2) is already assigned, the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the fan of metal must be in position 1.

6. **The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.**
   - The person driving the motorbike is in position 1 (since motor is in position 2).
   - Therefore, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 1.

Now we can assign the remaining items:
- The person who eats pineapple must be in position 2 since pomegranate is in position 2.
- The person who prefers romance must be in position 1 since time-travel is in position 2.
- The person who prefers trance must be in position 2 since metal is in position 1.
- The person who is an accountant must be in position 1 since videographer is in position 2.

### Final Solution Table:
```

| Beverage      |  Tea        |  Mirinda     |
