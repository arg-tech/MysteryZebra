Lv1-2x5-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the genres accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of pop is on the left of the person watching sports movies.**
   - This means if someone likes pop, the next position (to the right) must be the one who watches sports movies.
   
2. **The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.**
   - This means the disaster movies person is to the left of the superhero movies person.
   
3. **The fan of pop is on the right of the fan of jazz.**
   - This means if someone likes jazz, the next position (to the right) must be the one who likes pop.
   
4. **The person watching musical movies is on the far left.**
   - This means the first position (position 1) is for musical movies.
   
5. **The fan of soul is on the far left.**
   - This means the first position (position 1) is also for the fan of soul, which contradicts clue 4. Therefore, we need to resolve this.
   
6. **The person watching disaster movies is in the middle.**
   - This means the third position (position 3) is for disaster movies.
   
7. **The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of dubstep.**
   - This means if someone likes soul, the next position (to the right) must be the one who likes dubstep.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1:**
   - From clue 4, the person watching musical movies is on the far left. So, Position 1 = Musical Movies.
   - From clue 5, the fan of soul is on the far left. Since Position 1 is already taken by Musical Movies, this clue is incorrect or needs re-evaluation. We will resolve it later.

2. **Position 2:**
   - From clue 1, the fan of pop is on the left of the person watching sports movies.
   - From clue 3, the fan of pop is on the right of the fan of jazz.
   - Therefore, Position 2 must be either Jazz or Pop.

3. **Position 3:**
   - From clue 6, the person watching disaster movies is in the middle. So, Position 3 = Disaster Movies.

4. **Position 4:**
   - From clue 2, the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
   - So, Position 4 = Superhero Movies.

5. **Position 5:**
   - The remaining genre is Sports Movies.

6. **Re-evaluating the fan of soul and pop:**
   - From clue 7, the fan of soul is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
   - Since Position 1 is not for the fan of soul (contradicting clue 5), we need to adjust.
   - Position 2 must be Pop, and Position 1 must be Jazz (since the fan of pop is on the right of the fan of jazz).

So, the correct positions are:
- Position 1: Jazz
- Position 2: Pop
- Position 3: Disaster
- Position 4: Superhero
- Position 5: Sports

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 4**, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3:
   ```
   |   1    |   2   | Almond-Milk |    4     |   5    |
   | Music-Genre |       |             |          |        |
   ```

2. **From Clue 3**, the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Therefore, fanta must be in position 2:

   |   1    | Fanta | Almond-Milk |    4     |   5    |
   | Music-Genre |       |             |          |        |
   ```

3. **From Clue 1**, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking sprite. Since positions 1 and 2 are already filled, soy-milk must be in position 1 and sprite in position 5:
   ```
   | Soy-Milk | Fanta | Almond-Milk |    4     | Sprite |
   | Music-Genre |       |             |          |        |
   ```

4. **From Clue 2**, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the fan of indie. Since almond-milk is in position 3, indie must be in position 4:

   | Metal   |       |             |          |        |
   ```

6. **From Clue 6**, the fan of rock is the person drinking sprite. Since sprite is in position 5, the fan of rock must be in position 5:
   ```
   | Coffee  | Fanta | Almond-Milk | Indie    | Sprite |
   | Metal   |       |             | Rock    |        |

   ```

2. **Clue 7**: The writer is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This means the writer cannot be in position 5 (paramedic), so it must be in position 4 or 3.
   - Let's place the writer in position 4 for now and see if it works out.
   ```

7. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the writer.
   - The writer is already placed in position 4, so this clue is satisfied.

8. **Assigning Jobs**:
   - The remaining jobs are fisherman, nurse, paramedic, social-worker, and writer.
   - We already know the positions of nurse, paramedic, and writer.
   - The fisherman is in position 1, so the job for the fisherman is ""fisherman"".
   - The social-worker is in position 2, so the job for the social-worker is ""social-worker"".
   - The remaining jobs are ""nurse"" and ""writer"", which we already assigned to positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Lv1-2x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the sports and foods accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person eating grapes.**
2. **The person who's sport is rowing is the person eating strawberry.**
3. **The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person eating mango.**
4. **The person who's sport is swimming is in the middle.**
5. **The person eating grapes is on the left of the person eating banana.**
6. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person eating mango.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the position of Swimming
- From clue 4, the person who's sport is swimming is in the middle (position 3).
- From clue 3, the person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person eating mango.
- Therefore, the person eating mango must be in position 4 or 5.
- Since the person eating mango is also mentioned in clue 6 as the one doing weightlifting, and they are in position 4 or 5, we can deduce:
  - Position 3: Swimming
  - Position 4 or 5: Mango and Weightlifting

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of Rowing and Strasberry
- From clue 2, the person who's sport is rowing is the person eating strawberry.
- From clue 5, the person eating grapes is on the left of the person eating banana.
- Since the person eating mango is in position 4 or 5, the person eating strawberries (rowing) cannot be in position 4 or 5 because there would not be enough space for the person eating grapes to be on the left of the person eating bananas.
- Therefore, the person eating strawberries (rowing) must be in position 1 or 2.
- The person eating grapes must be in position 2 or 3, but since position 3 is occupied by swimming, the person eating grapes must be in position 2.
- Consequently, the person eating banana must be in position 3 or 4, but since position 3 is occupied by swimming, the person eating banana must be in position 4.

#### Step 3: Finalize the positions
- Position 1: Rowing (Strawberry)
- Position 2: Grapes
- Position 3: Swimming
- Position 4: Banana
- Position 5: Mango (Weightlifting)

### Final Table:

```
|         |    1     |     2      |    3     |       4       |     5      |
| Food    | Strawberry|   Grapes   | Swimming |    Banana     |  Mango     |
| Sport   |   Rowing  |  Volleyball|  Swimming| Weightlifting | Volleyball |
```

### Verification:
1. The person who's sport is volleyball (position 5) is on the right of the person eating grapes (position 2).
2. The person who's sport is rowing (position 1) is the person eating strawberry (position 1).
3. The person who's sport is swimming (position 3) is on the left of the person eating mango (position 5).
4. The person who's sport is swimming (position 3) is in the middle.
5. The person eating grapes (position 2) is on the left of the person eating banana (position 4).
6. The person who's sport is weightlifting (position 5) is the person eating mango (position 5).

All clues are satisfied with this arrangement.

Lv1-2x5-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the sports and means of transport into the given table according to the clues provided. Let's break down each clue step-by-step:

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **The person driving the roller is in the middle (position 3).**
2. **The person driving the car is on the far right (position 5).**
3. **The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the roller.**

5. **The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball.**
6. **The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Positioning the Roller:
- The person driving the roller is in position 3.

```
| Sport       |     1      |     2     |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Transport   |            |           |  Roller  |            |           |
```

#### Positioning the Car:
- The person driving the car is in position 5.

```
| Sport       |     1      |     2     |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Transport   |            |           |  Roller  |            |  Car      |
```

#### Positioning the Quad-bike:
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the roller.
- Since the roller is in position 3, the quad-bike must be in position 2.

```
| Sport       |     1      |     2     |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Transport   |            | Quad-bike |  Roller  |            |  Car      |
```

- According to clue 4, the person driving the quad-bike is the person who's sport is cricket.
- So, Cricket is in position 2.

```
| Sport       |     1      |     2     |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Transport   |            | Cricket   |  Roller  |            |  Car      |
```

#### Positioning the Skateboard:
- The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
- The only remaining position for the skateboard is position 1.

```
| Sport       |     1      |     2     |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Transport   | Skateboard | Cricket   |  Roller  |            |  Car      |
```

- According to clue 6, the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
- Therefore, Badminton is in position 4.

```
| Sport       |     1      |     2     |    3     |     4     |     5     |
| Transport   | Skateboard | Cricket   |  Roller  | Badminton |  Car      |
```

#### Positioning the Remaining Sports and Transport:
- The remaining sports are baseball, handball, and volleyball.
- According to clue 5, the person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball.
- Therefore, Baseball must be in position 1 and Volleyball in position 4.

However, we already have Badminton in position 4, so the correct positions are:
- Baseball in position 1
- Handball in position 3

Thus, the final arrangement is:

```
| Sport       | Baseball  | Cricket   | Handball  | Badminton | Volleyball|
| Transport   | Skateboard| Quad-bike | Roller    |          | Car       |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Sport       | Baseball  | Cricket   | Handball  | Badminton | Volleyball|
| Transport   | Skateboard| Quad-bike | Roller    |          | Car       |

Lv1-2x5-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the pets and sports in the correct positions. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is biathlon is in the middle (position 3).
   - This means:
     ```
     |         |   1    |   2   |  3 (Biathlon) |     4      |     5      |
     ```

2. **Clue 6**: The person who's sport is rugby is the owner of the pony.
   - This means:
     - Position 3 (biathlon) is not the owner of the pony.
     - The owner of the pony must be in one of the other positions.
     - We can place the pony and its owner somewhere else for now.

3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby.
   - Since the owner of the pony has the sport rugby, the owner of the rat must be in position 4 or 5.
   - This means:
     - If the pony is in position 1, the rat could be in position 2 or 3, but 3 is taken by biathlon.
     - If the pony is in position 2, the rat could be in position 3, but 3 is taken by biathlon.
     - If the pony is in position 4, the rat could be in position 5.
     - If the pony is in position 5, the rat would have no valid position.
   - Therefore, the pony must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Let's assume the pony is in position 4 for now (we'll check if this works).

4. **Clue 1**: The owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
   - If the pony is in position 4, the person with tennis must be in position 3 (but that's already biathlon).
   - Therefore, the pony must be in position 5, and the person with tennis must be in position 4.
   - This means:
     - Position 4 (tennis) is the owner of the pony.
     - Position 5 (rat) is the owner of the rat.
     - The owner of the pony (tennis) is on the right of the person with tennis, which is impossible unless we adjust our assumption.

5. **Re-evaluate Clue 4**: The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.
   - If the pony is in position 5, then the chinchilla and rabbit owners must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - Let's place the chinchilla in position 1 and the rabbit in position 2.

6. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is baseball is the owner of the chinchilla.
   - This means:
     - Position 1 (chinchilla) is the owner of the chinchilla.
     - Position 2 (rabbit) is the owner of the rabbit.
     - Position 3 (biathlon) is the middle.

Lv1-2x5-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the jobs and sports accordingly. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the teacher.
2. The person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
3. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
4. The teacher is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
5. The person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer (this is the same as clue 2, so it reinforces that).
6. The chef is on the right of the engineer.
7. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the scientist.

From clues 1, 3, and 4, we can deduce the following order for sports:
- Water-polo is on the left of the teacher.
- Water-polo is on the right of tennis.
- Teacher is on the right of rugby.

So, the order must be: tennis, water-polo, teacher, rugby, and the remaining two sports must fit into the remaining positions. Since water-polo is between tennis and teacher, and teacher is to the right of rugby, the order of sports must be: tennis, water-polo, teacher, rugby, and the remaining two sports (ice-hockey and soccer) must be placed in the first and last positions. Given that water-polo is on the left of the teacher, tennis must be the first sport, and soccer must be the last sport. Therefore, the order of sports is:
- 1: tennis
- 2: water-polo
- 3: teacher
- 4: rugby
- 5: soccer

Now, let's place the jobs based on the remaining clues:
- Clue 6: The chef is on the right of the engineer.
- Clue 7: The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the scientist.

Given the order of sports, we can place the jobs as follows:
- The chef must be on the right of the engineer, so the engineer must be in position 1 or 2, and the chef in position 2 or 3.
- The scientist must be on the left of the person with ice-hockey, so the scientist cannot be in position 5, and ice-hockey must be in position 5.

Let's try to place the jobs:
- If the engineer is in position 1, then the chef must be in position 2.
- The scientist cannot be in position 5, so the scientist must be in position 3, and the person with ice-hockey must be in position 5.
- This leaves the manager and the teacher to be placed in positions 4 and 3 respectively.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: engineer
- Position 2: chef
- Position 3: scientist
- Position 4: teacher
- Position 5: manager

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|         |    1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |
| Job     | engineer | chef       | scientist | teacher  | manager   |
| Sport   | tennis   | water-polo | soccer   | rugby    | ice-hockey |

Lv1-2x5-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the correct order of hobbies and music genres for each position (1 through 5). Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
2. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
3. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right.
4. The person who's hobby is photography is on the far left.
5. The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of classical.
6. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the fan of classical.
7. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the fan of indie.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From Clue 3**: The person with the hobby of dancing is on the far right (position 5).
   - \( \text{Position 5: Dancing} \)

2. **From Clue 4**: The person with the hobby of photography is on the far left (position 1).
   - \( \text{Position 1: Photography} \)

3. **From Clue 6**: The person with the hobby of woodworking is the fan of classical.
   - \( \text{Position 5: Woodworking} \) (since it must be the far right)
   - \( \text{Position 1: Classical} \) (since it must be the far left)

4. **From Clue 1**: The fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - Since the fan of house cannot be in position 5 (because it would violate Clue 1), the fan of house must be in position 2 or 3.
   - The person with the hobby of camping must be in position 3 or 4.

5. **From Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - This means the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Since position 5 is already occupied by woodworking, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in position 4.
   - Therefore, the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 3.

6. **From Clue 5**: The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of classical.
   - Since position 1 is already occupied by classical, the fan of rock must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the fan of house must be in position 3.

7. **From Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the fan of indie.
   - Since position 1 is occupied by photography, the fan of indie must be in position 4.
   - This matches our previous deductions that the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is in position 4 and the fan of rock is in position 2.

So, the final arrangement is:

- Position 1: Photography (Classical)
- Position 2: Rock
- Position 3: House (Camping)
- Position 4: Indie (Magic-Tricks)
- Position 5: Woodworking (Dancing)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |    2    |      3       |      4      |    5    |
| Hobby         | Photography | Rock    | House        | Indie       | Dancing |
| Music-Genre   | Classical   | Rock    | House        | Indie       | Blues   |
```

Note: Since ""Blues"" was not explicitly mentioned as the preferred genre for any specific position, I assumed it fits logically into the remaining slot. If you have more specific information about the music genres, please let me know!"
Lv1-2x5-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 5**: The owner of the goldfish is in the middle (position 3).
   - This means the pet in position 3 is the goldfish.
   - |   |   | goldfish |   |   |

2. **Clue 2**: The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the British.
   - Since the goldfish is in position 3, the British must be in position 4 or 5.
   - |   |   | goldfish | British |   |

3. **Clue 4**: The Italian is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.
   - The Italian must be in position 1 or 2.
   - | Italian |   | goldfish | British |   |

4. **Clue 1**: The owner of the fish is on the left of the Argentine.
   - Since the Italian is to the left of the goldfish owner, and the Italian can only be in position 1 or 2, the fish must be in position 2 if the Italian is in position 1.
   - | Italian | fish | goldfish | British |   |
   - If the Italian were in position 2, then the fish would need to be in position 1, but that would violate Clue 3 (Italian being on the left of the goldfish owner).

5. **Clue 3**: The American owns the frog.
   - The American must own the frog, which is given as position 3.
   - | Italian | fish | goldfish | British | American |

6. **Clue 6**: The owner of the dog is on the left of the American.
   - The American is in position 5, so the dog must be in position 4.
   - | Italian | fish | goldfish | British | American |
   - | Italian | fish | goldfish | dog | American |

7. **Clue 2**: The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the British.
   - We already have this setup, so it fits.
   - | Italian | fish | goldfish | dog | American |

8. **Clue 4**: The Italian is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.
   - We already have this setup, so it fits.
   - | Italian | fish | goldfish | dog | American |

Finally, we need to assign the remaining nationalities (Argentine and Nigerian) to positions 1 and 2. From Clue 1, the owner of the fish is on the left of the Argentine. Therefore, the Argentine cannot be in position 1, so the Argentine must be in position 2, and the Nigerian must be in position 1.

- | Nigerian | fish | goldfish | dog | American |
- | Argentine | fish | goldfish | dog | American |

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1     |    2    |     3     |    4    |    5     |
| Nationality   | Nigerian | Argentine | goldfish | dog | American |
| Pet           |          | fish     | goldfish |       |          |
