9. **The owner of the horse is on the right of the dressmaker.**
10. **The freelancer is the owner of the horse.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the person watching superhero movies.
- From clue 2, the person watching superhero movies is on the far left.
- Therefore, the first column is for the person watching superhero movies.

#### Step 2: Identify the beverage for the person watching superhero movies.
- From clue 6, the person watching superhero movies is the person drinking mirinda.
- So, the first column (superhero) drinks mirinda.

#### Step 3: Determine the transportation mode.
- From clue 4, the person driving the trike is on the right of the dutch.
- Since the first column is already occupied by the superhero, the second or third column must be the trike driver.
- From clue 4, the dutch is not in the first column, so the dutch must be either in the second or third column.
- The trike driver cannot be the first, so the trike must be in the second or third column.
- The Dutch cannot be in the second column because the trike is to their right, so the Dutch must be in the third column.
- Therefore, the second column is the trike driver, and the third column is the Dutch.

#### Step 4: Determine the job.
- From clue 7, the dressmaker is on the right of the pakistani.
- The pakistani cannot be in the third column (Dutch), so the pakistani must be in the first column, and the dressmaker must be in the second column.
- Since the second column is the trike driver, the first column must be the dressmaker (pakistani).

#### Step 5: Determine the food.
- From clue 8, the owner of the cat is on the left of the person eating lime.
- The cat owner cannot be in the first column (superhero), so the cat owner must be in the second or third column.
- The third column is the Dutch, so the cat owner must be in the second column.
- Therefore, the person in the second column (dressmaker) eats lime.

#### Step 6: Determine the pet.
- The owner of the cat is in the second column, so the cat is owned by the dressmaker (pakistani).
- The owner of the horse is on the right of the dressmaker.
- Therefore, the horse is owned by the Dutch in the third column.

#### Step 7: Determine the beverage for the person watching spy movies.
- From clue 3, the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
- The first column is superhero, so the spy watcher must be in the third column.
- The Dutch in the third column cannot drink 7up, so the 7up drinker must be in the second column (dressmaker).
- Therefore, the third column (spy watcher) drinks 7up.

#### Step 8: Determine the remaining beverage.
- The only remaining beverage is almond milk.
- The snowmobile driver is on the left of the almond milk drinker.
- The snowmobile driver cannot be in the first column (superhero), so the snowmobile driver must be in the second column.
- Therefore, the second column (dressmaker) drinks almond milk.

#### Step 9: Determine the remaining food.
- The person eating broccoli is on the far right.
- Therefore, the third column (Dutch) eats broccoli.

#### Step 10: Determine the remaining job.
- The freelancer is the owner of the horse.
- Therefore, the Dutch (third column) is the freelancer.

### Final Table:

```

Lv1-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Summary:
1. The owner of the goat is on the far right.
2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person driving the roller.
3. The person eating watermelon is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.
4. The fan of electronic is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.

6. The person driving the motorbike is the chef.
7. The person eating spinach is the owner of the goldfish.
8. The teacher is the person eating spinach.
9. The teacher is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
10. The person driving the trike is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
11. The person drinking juice is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify positions based on specific clues:
- **Clue 1**: The owner of the goat is on the far right (position 3).
- **Clue 11**: The person drinking juice is on the far right (position 3).

So, we can place:
- Goat: Position 3
- Juice: Position 3

#### Step 2: Use Clue 6 to place the chef:
- **Clue 6**: The person driving the motorbike is the chef.

We need to determine which position the chef is in and what they drive:
- Since the chef is on the left of the person drinking juice (clue 9), the chef must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the person driving the motorbike is the chef (clue 6), the chef must be in position 1 (as they cannot be in position 2 because the person in position 3 drinks juice).

So, we can place:
- Chef: Position 1
- Motorbike: Position 1

#### Step 3: Use Clue 7 and Clue 8 to place the teacher and the goldfish:
- **Clue 7**: The person eating spinach is the owner of the goldfish.
- **Clue 8**: The teacher is the person eating spinach.

Since the teacher is in position 1 (chef) or position 2, and the teacher eats spinach, the teacher must be in position 2.

So, we can place:
- Teacher: Position 2
- Spinach: Position 2
- Goldfish: Position 2

#### Step 4: Use Clue 2 and Clue 10 to place the sports and transportation:
- **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person driving the roller.
- **Clue 10**: The person driving the trike is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.

Since the chef is in position 1 (driving motorbike) and the person driving the roller is the one doing weightlifting, the person driving the roller must be in position 3 (since the goat is there).

So, we can place:
- Weightlifting: Position 3
- Roller: Position 3

Since the person driving the trike is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball, and the teacher is in position 2, the person driving the trike must be in position 1.

So, we can place:
- Trike: Position 1
- Baseball: Position 3

#### Step 5: Use Clue 3 and Clue 4 to place the beverages and music genres:
- **Clue 3**: The person eating watermelon is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.
- **Clue 4**: The fan of electronic is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.

Since the person driving the motorbike is the chef (position 1), the fan of electronic must be in position 2 or 3.

Since the person eating watermelon is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, and the teacher (who eats spinach) is in position 2, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1, and the person eating watermelon must be in position 3.

So, we can place:
- Mirinda: Position 1
- Watermelon: Position 3

Since the person driving the roller is the one doing weightlifting (position 3), the person driving the motorbike (position 1) cannot be the fan of electronic. Therefore, the fan of electronic must be in position 2.

So, we can place:
- Electronic: Position 2

#### Step 6: Use Clue 5 to place the music genre:
- **Clue 5**: The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person drinking juice.

Since the person drinking juice is in position 3, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2.

So, we can place:
- Hip-Hop: Position 2

Finally, the only remaining music genre is gospel, which must be in position 1.

So, we can place:
- Gospel: Position 1

Lv1-7x3-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The person drinking lemonade is on the far right.
   - This means position 3 for beverage is lemonade.

2. **Clue 3**: The person drinking 7up is on the left of the Egyptian.
   - This means position 1 or 2 for beverage is 7up and the Egyptian is either in position 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 2**: The person watching scientific movies is in the middle.
   - This means position 2 for movie genre is scientific.

4. **Clue 1**: The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the Egyptian.
   - Since the Egyptian can only be in position 2 (because the person watching time-travel movies is to their right), the Egyptian must be in position 2.

5. **Clue 3** (revisited): The person drinking 7up is on the left of the Egyptian.
   - Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the person drinking 7up must be in position 1.

6. **Clue 10**: The owner of the guinea-pig is in the middle.
   - This means position 2 for pet is guinea-pig.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is Sudoku is on the right of the person driving the subway.
   - Let's denote the person driving the subway as X and the person with Sudoku as Y. Since Y is to the right of X, and we need to fit everyone else in the remaining positions.

8. **Clue 8**: The person whose sport is Climbing is on the right of the person driving the subway.
   - This means the person with sport Climbing is to the right of X.

9. **Clue 9**: The British is on the right of the person driving the roller.
   - Let's denote the person driving the roller as A and the British as B. B is to the right of A.

12. **Clue 11**: The person whose sport is Tennis is on the right of the person whose sport is Climbing.
    - This means the person with sport Tennis is to the right of the person with sport Climbing.

Now let's fill in the table based on these deductions:

|               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|

| Sport         | Climbing    | Golf      | Tennis    |
| Transport     | Roller      | Subway    | Ship      |

Now, we need to determine the nationality and the remaining sport and transport:

- From Clue 9, the British is on the right of the person driving the roller, so the British must be in position 3 and the person driving the roller must be in position 2. So, the British is in position 3.
- From Clue 6, the person whose hobby is Sudoku is on the right of the person driving the subway, so the person driving the subway must be in position 1. Hence, the person driving the subway is British.
- From Clue 10, the owner of the guinea-pig is in the middle, so the guinea-pig is owned by the person in position 2, which is the Egyptian.
- From Clue 5, the owner of the turtle is the person who's sport is Golf, so the Egyptian must have sport Golf.
- From Clue 8, the person whose sport is Climbing is on the right of the person driving the subway, so the person with sport Climbing is in position 3, which is the British.
- From Clue 11, the person whose sport is Tennis is on the right of the person whose sport is Climbing, so the person with sport Tennis is in position 3, which is the British.
- Therefore, the person with sport Golf must be the Egyptian, and the person with sport Tennis must be the British.

Finally, we can fill in the table:

|               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
