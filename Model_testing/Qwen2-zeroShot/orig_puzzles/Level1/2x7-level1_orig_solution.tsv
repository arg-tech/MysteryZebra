Lv1-2x7-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully place each job and nationality in their respective positions based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step-by-step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The paramedic is on the left of the Chinese.
2. The Mexican is the paramedic.
3. The Videographer is on the right of the Social Worker.
4. The Canadian is on the right of the Nigerian.
5. The Mechanic is in the middle (position 4).
6. The Argentine is on the far left.
7. The Photographer is the Argentine.
8. The Electrician is on the right of the Nigerian.
9. The Canadian is on the left of the Australian.
10. The Chinese is on the left of the Mechanic.
11. The Videographer is on the right of the Australian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1:**
   - The Argentine is on the far left (Clue 6 & 7).
   - The Photographer is the Argentine.
   - So, Position 1 = Photographer (Argentine).

2. **Position 2:**
   - The Mexican is the paramedic (Clue 2).
   - The paramedic is on the left of the Chinese (Clue 1).
   - Since the Argentine is in position 1, the Mexican must be in position 2.
   - So, Position 2 = Paramedic (Mexican).

3. **Position 3:**
   - The paramedic (Mexican) is on the left of the Chinese (Clue 1).
   - So, Position 3 = Chinese.

4. **Position 4:**
   - The Mechanic is in the middle (Clue 5).
   - The Chinese is on the left of the Mechanic (Clue 10).
   - So, Position 4 = Mechanic.

5. **Position 5:**
   - The Canadian is on the right of the Nigerian (Clue 4).
   - The Canadian is on the left of the Australian (Clue 9).
   - The Mechanic is in position 4.
   - So, Position 5 cannot be Nigerian or Canadian because they need to fit the remaining slots.
   - Therefore, Position 5 = Videographer (since it must be on the right of the Social Worker and we have no other options for now).

6. **Position 6:**
   - The Nigerian is on the left of the Electrician (Clue 8).
   - The Electrician is on the right of the Nigerian (Clue 8).
   - So, Position 6 = Electrician.

7. **Position 7:**
   - The Social Worker is on the left of the Videographer (Clue 3).
   - The Videographer is on the right of the Australian (Clue 11).
   - So, Position 7 = Australian.

### Final Table:

Lv1-2x7-2	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step and place the correct food and music genres in the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The fan of punk is the person eating nectarine.**
   - This means Nectarine is in position 1 (since the fan of punk is in the middle, and we need to fit everything else around it).

2. **The person eating raspberry is on the left of the fan of soul.**
   - Let’s denote the fan of soul as S. The person eating raspberry (R) must be to the left of S.

3. **The fan of rock is on the far right.**
   - Rock (Rk) is in position 7.

4. **The person eating cucumber is on the right of the fan of funk.**
   - Let’s denote the fan of funk as F. Cucumber (C) must be to the right of F.

5. **The person eating nectarine is on the right of the fan of pop.**
   - Pop (P) must be in a position to the left of Nectarine (N), which is in position 1. So, P must be in position 6.

6. **The person eating raspberry is on the left of the person eating watermelon.**
   - Watermelon (W) is to the right of R.

7. **The fan of punk is in the middle.**
   - Punk (Pk) is in position 4.

8. **The fan of punk is on the right of the person eating peach.**
   - Peach (Pch) must be in position 3.

9. **The fan of soul is on the left of the person eating eggplant.**
   - Eggplant (E) is to the right of S.

10. **The person eating nectarine is on the left of the fan of d&b.**
    - d&b (D&B) is in position 2.

### Placing the Foods:

- **Position 1:** Nectarine (N)
- **Position 2:** d&b (D&B)
- **Position 3:** Peach (Pch)
- **Position 4:** Punk (Pk)
- **Position 5:** (Unknown)
- **Position 6:** Pop (P)
- **Position 7:** Rock (Rk)

From the given conditions:
- Raspberry (R) is to the left of the fan of soul.
- Cucumber (C) is to the right of the fan of funk.
- Watermelon (W) is to the right of Raspberry (R).
- Fan of soul (S) is to the left of Eggplant (E).

Let’s determine the positions for the remaining foods:
- Since Raspberry (R) is to the left of the fan of soul (S) and Watermelon (W) is to the right of R, R must be in position 5 and S in position 6.
- Cucumber (C) must be in position 2 or 3, but since R is in position 5, C must be in position 3.
- Therefore, Eggplant (E) must be in position 7.
- The only remaining position for Watermelon (W) is 6, but since Pop (P) is already in position 6, Watermelon (W) must be in position 5.

So the correct placement is:
- **Position 1:** Nectarine (N)
- **Position 2:** d&b (D&B)
- **Position 3:** Peach (Pch)
- **Position 4:** Punk (Pk)
- **Position 5:** Raspberry (R)
- **Position 6:** Pop (P)
- **Position 7:** Rock (Rk)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From statement 5:** The bartender is the person eating onion.
   - Bartender (1) -> Onion

2. **From statement 2:** The person eating onion is on the left of the writer.
   - Writer (4) -> Not bartender (since bartender is at position 1)

3. **From statement 1:** The person eating cucumber is on the left of the person eating onion.
   - Cucumber (2) -> On the left of 1 (Bartender)
   - So, cucumber is at position 2.

4. **From statement 3:** The freelancer is on the left of the person eating spinach.
   - Freelancer (6) -> Spinach (7) (since freelancer is to the left of spinach and there are only 7 positions)

5. **From statement 4:** The person eating corn is on the right of the person eating pepper.
   - Corn (3) -> Pepper (5) (since corn is to the right of pepper)

6. **From statement 6:** The mechanic is on the right of the freelancer.
   - Mechanic (5) -> To the right of freelancer (6)

7. **From statement 7:** The freelancer is on the left of the mechanic.
   - Freelancer (6) -> To the left of mechanic (5), which contradicts the previous step. This means we need to adjust positions.

8. **From statement 8:** The freelancer is on the right of the photographer.
   - Freelancer (6) -> Photographer (3 or 4)

9. **From statement 9:** The person eating pepper is the photographer.
   - Photographer (3) -> Pepper (5)

10. **From statement 10:** The person eating lemon is on the right of the bartender.
    - Lemon (4) -> To the right of bartender (1)

Lv1-2x7-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

First, let's summarize the clues:

1. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person driving the ship.
2. The person drinking 7up is the person driving the bus.
3. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
4. The person driving the bus is on the left of the person driving the tram.
5. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
6. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
7. The person drinking iced-tea is in the middle.
8. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person driving the skateboard.
9. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person driving the trike.
10. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.

We will start by placing the known positions and then deducing the rest.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- **1: 7up (driving the bus)**

#### Clue 4:
- **1 (7up) is on the left of the person driving the tram**.
- So, **2 must be the tram**.

#### Clue 1:
- **Soy-milk is on the right of the person driving the ship**.
- Since the person driving the ship is on the left of Soy-milk, we need to find where the ship is placed.

#### Clue 6:
- **Soy-milk is on the left of 7up**.
- This confirms that **Soy-milk must be in position 3** because 7up is at position 1.

#### Clue 1:
- Therefore, the person driving the ship must be in position 2.

#### Clue 3:
- **Juice is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski**.
- The person driving the jet-ski must be in position 4 or 5 (since juice cannot be in position 1 or 2).

#### Clue 7:
- **Iced-tea is in the middle**, so it must be in position 4.

#### Clue 3:
- Since **juice is on the right of the jet-ski driver**, the jet-ski driver must be in position 3, and juice must be in position 5.

#### Clue 9:
- **Almond-milk is on the right of the person driving the trike**.
- The person driving the trike must be in position 6, and almond-milk must be in position 7.

#### Clue 5:
- **Sprite is on the left of the person driving the trike**.
- Since the person driving the trike is in position 6, sprite must be in position 5. But we already know juice is in position 5, which is a contradiction. Let's recheck the positions.

Rechecking:
- If the jet-ski driver is in position 3, then juice is in position 5, and the person driving the trike is in position 6, and almond-milk is in position 7.
- This aligns with all the clues.

#### Clue 8:
- **Coffee is on the left of the person driving the skateboard**.
- The person driving the skateboard must be in position 7, and coffee must be in position 6.

#### Final Table:

|             |   1    |     2      |  3  |    4     |    5    |   6   |      7      |

Lv1-2x7-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each genre and transport mode according to the given clues. Let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching satire movies is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
2. **Clue 2**: The person watching drama movies is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
3. **Clue 3**: The person watching time-travel movies is the person driving the roller.
4. **Clue 4**: The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person watching animation movies.
5. **Clue 5**: The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.
7. **Clue 7**: The person driving the boat is the person watching crime movies.
8. **Clue 8**: The person watching martial-arts movies is in the middle (position 4).
9. **Clue 9**: The person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
10. **Clue 10**: The person driving the boat is on the right of the person watching animation movies.

### Initial Setup:
Let's start by placing the known positions based on Clue 8:
- Position 4: Martial-arts movies

Now, let's place other elements using the clues one by one:

#### Clue 3:
- Position 4: Time-travel movies (driving roller)
- So, roller is driven by the person watching time-travel movies.

#### Clue 7:
- The person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
- Since time-travel is in position 4, the trike must be in position 5 or 6.
- But we also know from Clue 6 that the trike is on the left of the motorbike, so the trike must be in position 5 and the motorbike in position 6.

#### Clue 6:
- Trike (position 5) is on the left of the motorbike (position 6).

#### Clue 5:
- Satire movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
- Motorbike is in position 6, so satire must be in position 7.

#### Clue 1:
- Satire is on the left of the jet-ski.
- Jet-ski must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 2:
- Drama is on the left of martial-arts.
- Martial-arts is in position 4, so drama must be in position 3.

#### Clue 4:
- Skateboard is on the left of animation.
- Animation cannot be in position 2 because jet-ski would have to be in 3, which conflicts with drama.
- Therefore, animation must be in position 7 (satire is there), which conflicts. So, skateboard must be in position 2 and animation in position 3 (drama is there).

#### Clue 10:
- Boat is on the right of animation.
- Animation is in position 3, so boat must be in position 7 (conflicts with satire), so animation must be in position 2, and boat in position 7.

#### Clue 9:
- Trike is on the right of time-travel.
- Trike is in position 5, so time-travel must be in position 4.

#### Final Verification:
- Position 1: Crime (boat)
- Position 2: Animation
- Position 3: Drama
- Position 4: Time-travel
- Position 5: Trike
- Position 6: Motorbike
- Position 7: Satire

### Final Solution Table:

Lv1-2x7-10	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.

Given:
- There are 7 different types of food: grapefruit, kiwi, orange, potato, pumpkin, strawberry, watermelon.
- There are 7 different jobs: chef, engineer, journalist, lawyer, paramedic, scientist, writer.
- We need to determine which food each person eats and what job each person has.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The person eating potato is the engineer (1).**
   - Engineer eats potato.

2. **The person eating watermelon is on the right of the chef (2).**
   - Chef is to the left of the person eating watermelon.

3. **The person eating watermelon is on the left of the person eating potato (3).**
   - Watermelon is eaten by someone who is immediately to the left of the engineer.

4. **The person eating orange is on the right of the person eating pumpkin (4).**
   - Pumpkin is eaten by someone who is immediately to the left of the person eating orange.

5. **The person eating pumpkin is on the far left (5).**
   - Pumpkin is eaten by the person in position 1.

6. **The person eating kiwi is on the left of the scientist (6).**
   - Scientist is to the right of the person eating kiwi.

7. **The engineer is on the right of the lawyer (7).**
   - Engineer is in position 7, and lawyer is in position 6.

8. **The person eating strawberry is in the middle (8).**
   - Strawberry is eaten by the person in position 4.

9. **The person eating kiwi is on the right of the paramedic (9).**
   - Paramedic is to the left of the person eating kiwi.

10. **The writer is on the right of the person eating orange (10).**
    - Orange is eaten by the person in position 5, and writer is in position 7.

### Putting it all together:

- **Position 1:** Pumpkin (from 5)
- **Position 2:** Kiwi (from 9, since paramedic is to the left of kiwi, and only one person can be left of kiwi)
- **Position 3:** Orange (from 4, since orange is to the right of pumpkin)
- **Position 4:** Strawberry (from 8, as it is in the middle)
- **Position 5:** Lawyer (from 7, since engineer is on the right of lawyer, and engineer is at position 7)
- **Position 6:** Paramedic (from 9, since paramedic is to the left of kiwi, and only one person can be left of kiwi)
- **Position 7:** Engineer (from 1)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|        |     1      |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5      |     6      |    7     |
| Food   |   Pumpkin  |   Kiwi    | Orange | Strawberry |    None    |    None    |    None  |
| Job    |    None    |   Paramedic|  Lawyer|    None    |   Chef     |   Engineer |   Scientist|
```

Since we don't have specific jobs for positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, they are marked as ""None"" in the job column. The remaining jobs (chef, engineer, scientist) are assigned based on the given constraints.
