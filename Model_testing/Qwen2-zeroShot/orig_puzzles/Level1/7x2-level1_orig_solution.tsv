Lv1-7x2-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. The person drinking cola is on the far right.
2. The mechanic is on the far right.
3. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
4. The owner of the frog is the Pakistani.
5. The person watching western movies is on the far left.
6. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person driving the subway.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1 & 2:
- The person drinking cola is on the far right.
- The mechanic is on the far right.
Since both cola and the mechanic are on the far right, we can conclude that the person drinking cola is also the mechanic.

#### Clue 5:
- The person watching western movies is on the far left.
This means the person watching western movies is in position 1.

#### Clue 6:
- The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person driving the subway.
Since the person driving the subway is on the far right (and we know it must be the mechanic), the owner of the turtle must be in position 2.

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the subway is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
Since the person driving the subway is in position 2 (the mechanic), the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 3.

#### Clue 4:
- The owner of the frog is the Pakistani.
Since the person in position 2 is the mechanic (and the owner of the turtle), the person in position 1 (watching western movies) cannot be the owner of the frog. Therefore, the person in position 3 (hobby of sudoku) or position 4 (job of fisherman) must be the owner of the frog and Pakistani.

#### Clue 2 & 1:
- Since the mechanic (drinking cola) is in position 2, the person in position 1 must be drinking cola.

3. The person driving the tram is on the left of the fan of indie.
4. The German is on the far right.
5. The person drinking almond-milk is the owner of the lizard.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Position of the German
From clue 4, we know that the German is on the far right. Therefore:
```
|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      |                |          |
| Hobby         |                |          |
| Job           |                | German   |
| Music-Genre   |                |          |
| Nationality   |                | German   |
| Pet           |                |          |
| Transport     |                |          |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the Position of the Teacher and the Person with the Hobby of Drawing
From clue 1, the teacher is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. This means the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 1, and the teacher in position 2.
```
|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      |                |          |
| Hobby         | Drawing        | Teacher  |
| Job           |                | German   |
| Music-Genre   |                |          |

| Pet           |                |          |
| Transport     |                |          |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the Position of the Owner of the Mouse and the Driver of the Van
From clue 2, the owner of the mouse is the person driving the van. Since the German is on the right (position 2), the only remaining position for the owner of the mouse and the driver of the van is position 1.
```
|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      |                |          |

| Transport     | Van            |          |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the Position of the Driver of the Tram and the Fan of Indie
From clue 3, the person driving the tram is on the left of the fan of indie. This means the fan of indie cannot be in position 1 because the person driving the tram would then be in position 2, which is already occupied by the German. Therefore, the fan of indie must be in position 2, and the person driving the tram must be in position 1.
```
|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      | Tram           | Indie    |

| Job           |                | German   |
| Music-Genre   |                |          |
| Nationality   |                | German   |
| Pet           | Mouse          |          |
| Transport     | Van            | Indie    |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the Remaining Positions
From clue 5, the person drinking almond-milk is the owner of the lizard. Since the positions for the lizard and almond-milk are not yet filled, they must be in the remaining positions.
```
|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      | Tram           | Almond-Milk|
| Hobby         | Drawing        | Teacher  |
| Job           | Police-Officer | German   |
| Music-Genre   | Indie          |          |
| Nationality   | Australian     | German   |
| Pet           | Mouse          | Lizard   |
| Transport     | Van            | Indie    |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      | Tram           | Almond-Milk|

Lv1-7x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information in the appropriate categories. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The argentine is on the left of the owner of the fish.**
   - This means if the first column (left) is Argentine, the second column (right) must be the owner of the fish.

2. **The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of hiking is in the second column, and the person watching documentary movies is in the first column.

3. **The argentine is the person watching documentary movies.**
   - From clue 3, we know that the first column is Argentine, and they watch documentary movies.

4. **The doctor is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of card-games is in the first column, and the doctor is in the second column.

5. **The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person driving the train.**
   - This means the person who sails is in the first column, and the person who drives the train is in the second column.

### Deduction:

- **Clue 3:** The first column is Argentine and watches documentary movies.
- **Clue 1:** Since the Argentine is on the left of the owner of the fish, the second column must be the owner of the fish.
- **Clue 4:** The doctor is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Therefore, the first column must be the person with the hobby of card-games, and the second column must be the doctor.
- **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the first column already has the Argentine watching documentary movies, the second column must be the one with the hobby of hiking.
- **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person driving the train. Since the first column is already taken by the card-games hobbyist, the second column must be the person who sails, and the first column must be the one who drives the train.

Lv1-7x2-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The Indian is on the left of the person drinking cola.
2. **Clue 2**: The Indian is on the left of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.
3. **Clue 3**: The person eating broccoli is on the far right.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan of hip-hop is on the far left.
5. **Clue 5**: The scientist is on the right of the pilot.
6. **Clue 6**: The French is the person watching comedy movies.

First, let's place the far-left and far-right elements based on Clues 3 and 4:
- **Far right (2nd column): Broccoli**
- **Far left (1st column): Hip-hop**

Now, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 2 to place the Indian and the person drinking cola:
- Since the Indian is on the left of the person drinking cola, and the Indian is also on the left of the person with the hobby of rock-climbing, we can infer that the Indian is in the first position, and the person drinking cola must be in the second position.
- Therefore, the Indian drinks cola and has rock-climbing as a hobby.

Next, let's use Clue 5 to place the scientist and the pilot:
- The scientist is on the right of the pilot, so if we assume the pilot is in the first position, the scientist must be in the second position.
- However, since the Indian is already in the first position, the pilot must be in the second position and the scientist in the third position.

Finally, let's use Clue 6 to place the French person:
- The French person watches comedy movies, and since the scientist is in the third position, the French person must be in the second position.

Summarizing the placements:
- **1st column (left):**
  - **Indian** (drinks cola, has rock-climbing as a hobby)
  - **Pilot** (job)
  - **French** (watches comedy movies)

- **2nd column (right):**
  - **Person drinking cola** (Indian)
  - **Scientist** (job)
  - **Person watching comedy movies** (French)

We still need to fill in the remaining categories (food, job, movie genre, music genre, nationality).

Since the Indian is in the first column, and the person drinking cola is in the second column, we need to assign the remaining items accordingly:
- **Broccoli** (food) must be in the second column.
- **Pineapple** (food) must be in the first column.
- **Board-games** (hobby) must be in the first column.
- **Rock-climbing** (hobby) must be in the second column.
- **Ambient** (music genre) must be in the first column.
- **Hip-hop** (music genre) must be in the second column.
- **Comedy** (movie genre) must be in the second column.
- **Family** (movie genre) must be in the first column.
- **Indian** (nationality) must be in the first column.
- **French** (nationality) must be in the second column.

Final solution:

```

Lv1-7x2-10	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **The videographer is on the far left.**
   - This means the job ""videographer"" is in column 1.

2. **The fan of classical is on the far right.**
   - This means the music genre ""classical"" is in column 2.

5. **The person drinking lemonade is on the far right.**
   - This means the beverage ""lemonade"" is in column 2.

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues:

|               |       1       |     2      |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Beverage      |              | lemonade   |
| Food          |              |            |

| Music-Genre   |              | classical  |
| Sport         |              | skateboarding |

Now, we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table:

6. From clue 3, since the videographer (job) is in column 1 and the person with the hobby ""baking"" must be to the left of the person with the sport ""skateboarding,"" we can place ""baking"" in column 1 and ""skateboarding"" in column 2 for some row.

7. From clue 4, the person eating corn must be to the left of the person watching ""epic"" movies. Since ""epic"" is already in column 2, the person eating corn must be in column 1 for some row.

8. We know from clue 5 that the person drinking ""lemonade"" is in column 2. Therefore, the person drinking ""cola"" must be in column 1.

So, let's place ""corn"" in column 1 and ""pumpkin"" in column 2 for the food row. The person drinking ""cola"" must be in column 1 for the beverage row.

|               |       1       |     2      |
|---------------|--------------|------------|

| Job           | videographer |            |
| Movie-Genre   |              | epic       |
| Music-Genre   |              | classical  |
| Sport         |              | skateboarding |

Since ""baking"" is in column 1 and ""skateboarding"" is in column 2, the remaining rows need to fit the remaining categories.

From clue 3, the person with the hobby ""baking"" is to the left of the person with the sport ""skateboarding."" So, ""baking"" is in column 1 and ""skateboarding"" is in column 2.

From clue 4, the person eating ""corn"" is to the left of the person watching ""epic"" movies. So, ""corn"" is in column 1 and ""epic"" is in column 2.

Thus, the remaining categories will fit as follows:

|               |       1       |     2      |
