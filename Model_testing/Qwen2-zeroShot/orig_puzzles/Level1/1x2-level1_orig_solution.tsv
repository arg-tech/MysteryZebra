Lv1-1x2-1	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

Given:
- There are two different types of food: asparagus and spinach.
- The person eating asparagus is on the left of the person eating spinach.

We need to place these foods in the given table:

|        |     1     |    2    |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Food   |   ?      |   ?     |

Since the person eating asparagus is on the left of the person eating spinach, we can deduce that:
- Asparagus must be placed in position 1.
- Spinach must be placed in position 2.

So, the final solution table will look like this:

```
|        |     1     |    2    |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Food   | Asparagus| Spinach |

Lv1-1x2-2	"Certainly! Let's analyze the information provided and fill in the table accordingly.

Given:
- There are two movie genres: documentary and family.
- The person who prefers family movies is on the far right.

Since there are only two columns (1 and 2), and the person who prefers family movies is on the far right, it means that the person who prefers family movies is in column 2.

So, we can fill in the table as follows:

```
|               |      1      |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary | family  |
```

Here is the final solution table:

```
|               |      1      |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary | family  |

Lv1-1x2-3	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given information and solve the puzzle step by step.

We have two columns (1 and 2) and two rows for ""Music-Genre"". The genres are house and R&B. We also know that:

1. The fan of house is on the far right.

Given this information, we can deduce the following:

- Since the fan of house is on the far right, the first column must be R&B and the second column must be house.

So, the final solution table would look like this:

```
|               |  1  |   2   |
| Music-Genre   | R&B | House |
```

Here is the final solution table surrounded by `#############` as requested:

Lv1-1x2-4	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We are given two people and two possible hobbies: dancing and writing. The condition is that the person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.

Here's how we can represent it:

|         |    1    |    2    |
| Hobby   |  Writing|  Dancing|

This arrangement satisfies the condition that the person with ""writing"" is on the left of the person with ""dancing"".

So, the final solution table is:

```
|         |    1    |    2    |
| Hobby   |  Writing|  Dancing|

Lv1-1x2-5	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step.

We have two columns and two rows to fill with the music genres ""country"" and ""pop"". The conditions given are:

1. The fan of pop is on the left of the fan of country.

Given this condition, we can deduce the following:

- Since the fan of pop must be on the left of the fan of country, the only possible arrangement is:
  - Column 1: Pop
  - Column 2: Country

So, the final solution table looks like this:

```
|               |  1  |    2    |
| Music-Genre   | Pop | Country |
```

Here is the final solution table surrounded by `#############` as requested:

Lv1-1x2-6	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given information and solve the puzzle step by step.

We have two columns (1 and 2) and two types of pets (fish and hamster). The key piece of information is that ""the owner of the hamster is on the right of the owner of the fish.""

Given this, we can deduce the following:

- The owner of the fish must be in column 1.
- The owner of the hamster must be in column 2.

So, the solution to the puzzle would look like this:

```
|       |  1   |    2    |

Lv1-1x2-7	"Certainly! Based on the given information and constraints:

- There are only two nationalities: Australian and Egyptian.
- The Australian is on the far left (position 1).

Given this, we can fill out the table as follows:

```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Nationality   |   Australian |   Egyptian  |

Lv1-1x2-8	"Sure, let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step.

We have two columns and two rows in the table:

|               |  1  |  2   |
| Music-Genre   |     |      |

And we know the following:
1. The fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of jazz.

Given this information, we can deduce the following:

- Since the fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of jazz, and there are only two positions (1 and 2), it means that the fan of d&b must be in position 1 and the fan of jazz must be in position 2.

So, the final solution table would look like this:

```
|               |  1  |  2   |
| Music-Genre   | d&b | jazz |

Lv1-1x2-9	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.

Given:
- There are two types of food: cherry and kale.
- The person eating cherry is on the left of the person eating kale.

We need to fill the table accordingly:

|        |   1    |  2   |
|--------|--------|------|
| Food   | cherry | kale |

Here's the reasoning:
- Since the person eating cherry must be on the left of the person eating kale, we place ""cherry"" in position 1 and ""kale"" in position 2.

The final solution table is:

```
|        |   1    |  2   |
|--------|--------|------|
| Food   | cherry | kale |
