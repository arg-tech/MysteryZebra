5. **From clue 2, the owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.**
   - Position 1: Pear
   - Position 2: Guinea-pig
   - Position 3: Mouse
   - Position 4: Apple
   - Position 5: Potato, Ferret

6. **From clue 4, the owner of the frog is on the right of the fan of punk.**
   - The owner of the frog cannot be in position 5 because the owner of the ferret is there.
   - Therefore, the fan of punk must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Since position 5 is occupied by the ferret, the fan of punk must be in position 4.
   - The owner of the frog must be in position 5.

7. **From clue 8, the fan of r&b is on the left of the owner of the pony.**
   - The fan of r&b can only be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - The owner of the pony must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

   - Therefore, the fan of r&b must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the owner of the pony must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - Given that position 4 is the fan of punk, the owner of the pony must be in position 3 or 5.
   - Since position 5 is already the owner of the ferret, the owner of the pony must be in position 3.
   - Therefore, the fan of r&b must be in position 2.

8. **From clue 7, the fan of salsa is the person eating zucchini.**
   - The fan of salsa cannot be in position 1, 2, or 4 because those positions are occupied.
   - Therefore, the fan of salsa must be in position 3.
   - This means the person eating zucchini is in position 3.

9. **From clue 9, the owner of the frog is on the left of the person eating peas.**
   - The owner of the frog is in position 5.
   - Therefore, the person eating peas must be in position 4.
   - But position 4 is already occupied by the fan of punk.
   - Therefore, the person eating peas must be in position 5.
   - This means the owner of the frog must be in position 4.

10. **From clue 10, the owner of the mouse is the fan of disco.**
    - The owner of the mouse is in position 1.
    - The fan of disco is in position 1.

Lv1-3x5-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. The fan of punk is the person watching sports movies.
2. The person eating carrot is on the left of the person watching drama movies.
3. The person watching romance movies is on the far left.
4. The person eating peach is on the right of the person eating mango.

8. The fan of folk is on the far left.
9. The person watching crime movies is the person eating cranberry.
10. The fan of disco is in the middle.
11. The fan of punk is the person eating peach.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The person watching romance movies is on the far left (position 1).
2. **Clue 8**: The fan of folk is on the far left (position 1). So, the person in position 1 is both watching romance and is the fan of folk.
   
   | Food          |    1    |   2    |   3   |   4    |     5     |

   | Music-Genre   | Folk    |        |       |        |           |

3. **Clue 1**: The fan of punk is the person watching sports movies.
4. **Clue 6**: The fan of punk is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.
5. **Clue 11**: The fan of punk is the person eating peach.
   
   Since the fan of punk is in position 1 (Romance), and it must be to the left of the fan of hip-hop, the fan of hip-hop cannot be in position 1. The only possible positions for the fan of hip-hop are positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since the fan of punk (peach) is in position 1, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

   Let's place the fan of punk (peach) in position 1:
   
   | Food          |    1    |   2    |   3   |   4    |     5     |

   | Music-Genre   | Folk    |        |       |        |           |

6. **Clue 9**: The person watching crime movies is the person eating cranberry.
   
   Since the fan of hip-hop (disco) is in position 2, the person watching crime movies (cranberry) must be in position 4 (since it can't be in position 2, as that's hip-hop).

   | Food          |    1    |   2    |   3   |   4    |     5     |
   | ------------- | Peach  |       |       | Cranberry |           |

   | Music-Genre   | Folk    | Disco  |       |        |           |

7. **Clue 2**: The person eating carrot is on the left of the person watching drama movies.
   
   The person watching drama movies must be in position 4 or 5 (since position 4 is cranberry, it can't be there). Therefore, the person eating carrot must be in position 3.

   | Food          |    1    |   2    | Carrot |   4    |     5     |
   | ------------- | Peach  |       |       | Cranberry |           |

   | Music-Genre   | Folk    | Disco  |       |        |           |

8. **Clue 7**: The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person eating carrot.
   
   Since the person watching romance movies is in position 1, the person eating carrot (position 3) is to the right of them.

   | Food          |    1    |   2    | Carrot |   4    |     5     |
   | ------------- | Peach  |       |       | Cranberry |           |

   | Music-Genre   | Folk    | Disco  |       |        |           |

9. **Clue 4**: The person eating peach is on the right of the person eating mango.
   
   Since the person eating peach (position 1) is on the right of the person eating mango, the person eating mango must be in position 2.

   | Food          |    1    | Mango  | Carrot |   4    |     5     |
   | ------------- | Peach  |       |       | Cranberry |           |

   | Music-Genre   | Folk    | Disco  |       |        |           |

10. **Clue 5**: The fan of hip-hop is the person watching crime movies.
   
    The person watching crime movies (position 4) is already assigned as cranberry, so this clue is satisfied.

11. **Clue 10**: The fan of disco is in the middle (position 3).

    | Food          |    1    | Mango  | Carrot |   4    |     5     |
    | ------------- | Peach  |       |       | Cranberry |           |
    | Movie-Genre   | Romance | Sports | Drama  |        |           |
    | Music-Genre   | Folk    | Disco  | Hip-Hop|        |           |

12. **Clue 11**: The fan of punk is the person eating peach.
   
    This is already satisfied by our previous assignments.

6. **Positions for Hamster and Pony:**
   - The owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the pony.
   - The owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the pony.
   - This means the sequence for these pets must be: hamster, pony, mouse.

7. **Positions for Folk and Soy-milk:**
   - The fan of folk is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - The person drinking soy-milk cannot be in position 3 (occupied by the fan of jazz).

### Assigning Values:

Let's start assigning values based on the above deductions:

- Position 3: Water (Fan of Jazz)
- Position 4: Iced-tea
- Position 5: Snake

Now, let's place the remaining positions:

- Position 1: Hamster (since it needs to be on the left of the pony and the mouse is on the right of the pony)
- Position 2: Pony (since the hamster is on the left and the mouse is on the right)
- Position 4: Iced-tea (as deduced earlier)
- Position 5: Snake (as deduced earlier)

Now, let's fill in the rest of the table:

- Position 1: Hamster
- Position 2: Pony
- Position 3: Water (Fan of Jazz)
- Position 4: Iced-tea
- Position 5: Snake

Finally, let's assign the beverages and music genres:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Brazilian and the American**:
   - Brazilian is on the far left (position 1).
   - American is the owner of the dog and must be in position 5 (since the American watches spy movies and it's on the far right).

   So, we have:
   ```
   | Movie-Genre   |     1     |      2      |    3     |    4     |     5      |
   | Nationality   |   Brazil  |             |          |          |    USA     |
   | Pet           |   Goldfish|             |          |    Dog   |    Snake   |
   ```

2. **Positioning the German**:
   - The German is on the right of the owner of the dog (American), so the German must be in position 4.
   
   Now, the table looks like:
   ```
   | Movie-Genre   |     1     |      2      |    3     |    4     |     5      |
   | Nationality   |   Brazil  |             |          |    Germ  |    USA     |
   | Pet           |   Goldfish|             |          |    Dog   |    Snake   |
   ```

3. **Positioning the Guinea-Pig**:
   - The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the dog (American). Therefore, the guinea-pig must be in position 2.
   
   Now, the table looks like:
   ```
   | Movie-Genre   |     1     |      2      |    3     |    4     |     5      |
   | Nationality   |   Brazil  |    Guinea-pig|          |    Germ  |    USA     |
   | Pet           |   Goldfish|    Guinea-pig|          |    Dog   |    Snake   |
   ```

4. **Positioning the Goldfish and Snake**:
   - The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the snake.
   - Since the Brazilian is on the far left, the owner of the goldfish cannot be in position 1. Also, the owner of the snake cannot be in position 5.
   - Given that the guinea-pig is in position 2 and the dog is in position 4, the only remaining positions for the goldfish and the snake are 3 and 5, respectively.
   
   Now, the table looks like:
   ```
   | Movie-Genre   |     1     |      2      |    3     |    4     |     5      |
   | Nationality   |   Brazil  |    Guinea-pig|    Rom   |    Germ  |    USA     |
   | Pet           |   Goldfish|    Guinea-pig|    Pony  |    Dog   |    Snake   |
   ```

5. **Finalizing Movie Genres**:
   - The Canadian watches documentaries (position 3).
   - The person watching romance movies is in the middle (position 3), which we already assigned as ""Rom"".
   - The person watching epic movies is on the far right (position 5), which is already assigned as ""USA"".
   - The American watches spy movies (position 5), which is already assigned as ""USA"".
   - The remaining genres are comedy and documentary. Since the Canadian watches documentaries, the remaining genre for the Canadian must be comedy.

   Final table:
