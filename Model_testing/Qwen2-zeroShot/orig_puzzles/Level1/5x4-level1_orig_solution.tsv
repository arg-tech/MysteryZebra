### Solving the Clues:

From Clue 5, we know:
- **Asparagus**: Classical

From Clue 10, we know:
- **Horse**: Epic Movies

From Clue 1, we need to find the person eating cabbage. Let's assume:
- If the person eating cabbage is in position 1, then the person watching documentary movies is in position 2.
- If the person eating cabbage is in position 2, then the person watching documentary movies is in position 3.
- If the person eating cabbage is in position 3, then the person watching documentary movies is in position 4.

Let's test:
- Assume the person eating cabbage is in position 2.
- Then the person watching documentary movies is in position 3.
- This means the person eating cabbage is not in position 3 or 4.

From Clue 2, the person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. So, if the owner of the chinchilla is in position 1, the person with the hobby chess is in position 2.

From Clue 6, the fan of d&b is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. So, if the owner of the chinchilla is in position 1, the fan of d&b is in position 2.

From Clue 3, the person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the fan of d&b. So, if the fan of d&b is in position 2, the person with the hobby writing is in position 1.

From Clue 4, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. So, if the owner of the chinchilla is in position 1, the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 2.

From Clue 7, the fan of dubstep is on the right of the person eating asparagus. So, the fan of dubstep is in position 4.

From Clue 8, the person eating carrot is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. So, the person eating carrot is in position 1, and the person with the hobby card-games is in position 2.

### Arranging the Information:

- **Position 1**: Gardening (from Clue 2)
- **Position 4**: Musician and Canadian (from Clues 3 and 6)
- **Position 4**: Australian (from Clue 12)

Since the Australian is on the right of the owner of the snake, and the owner of the snake is also on the far right, we need to determine who is the owner of the snake.

Since the owner of the ferret is on the right of the person eating mango (Clue 5) and the owner of the ferret is the person eating potato (Clue 4), and the person eating mango is on the left of the owner of the ferret, we can deduce:
- **Position 3**: Ferret, Potato
