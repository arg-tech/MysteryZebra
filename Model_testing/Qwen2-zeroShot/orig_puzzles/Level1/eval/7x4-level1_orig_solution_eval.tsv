   - Water-polo is on position 1.
   
2. **The fan of folk is on the far left.**
   - Folk is on position 1 (conflicts with water-polo, but we'll resolve it later).
   
3. **The person who's sport is water-polo is the person drinking milk.**
   - Milk is on position 1.

4. **The person eating peas is the person driving the skateboard.**
   - Peas is on position 4, and skateboard is on position 4.

7. **The person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
   - Peas is on position 4, so Hot-Chocolate must be in position 3.
   
8. **The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the fan of house.**
   - Let's denote the positions as Jet-Ski (JS) and House (H). JS is to the right of H, and considering the other constraints, JS must be in position 4 and H in position 3 (but H is already occupied by Hot-Chocolate, so this must be re-evaluated).

9. **The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person eating blueberry.**
   - Let's denote the positions as Rowing (R) and Blueberry (Bb). R is to the right of Bb, and considering the other constraints, R must be in position 4 and Bb in position 3.

### Resolving Conflicts:
- From steps 7 and 9, we need to re-evaluate the positions for House and Hot-Chocolate.
- From step 13, House is on position 3, and from step 14, Juice is on position 4, which conflicts with Hot-Chocolate being on position 3.
- From step 12, Trance is on position 4, and from step 1, Skateboard is on position 4, which conflicts with Water-Polo being on position 1.

Let's re-evaluate the positions:

- Water-Polo (position 1), Folk (position 1), Hot-Chocolate (position 2), Baking (position 3), Board-Games (position 4), Camping (position 4), Peas (position 4), Trance (position 4), Animation (position 4), Fantasy (position 3), House (position 3), Juice (position 3), Blueberry (position 2), Rowing (position 3), Biathlon (position 1), Hip-Hop (position 2), Jet-Ski (position 4), Car (position 4).

Lv1-7x4-7	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: List Clues and Assignments
We need to assign each category (Beverage, Hobby, Job, Nationality, Pet, Sport, Transport) to each person (1, 2, 3, 4).

#### Clues:
1. The person whose sport is parkour has the hobby of reading.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the bird.
3. The mechanic is on the right of the Chinese.
4. The person whose sport is golf is Colombian.
5. The dancer is on the right of the person driving the train.
6. The owner of the hedgehog is the dancer.
7. The Colombian is on the far right.
8. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right.

10. The entrepreneur is on the right of the Thai.
11. The Chinese is the owner of the hedgehog.
12. The owner of the cat is the person driving the subway.

14. The Chinese is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket.
15. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the Chinese.
16. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking milk.
17. The dancer is the person who's sport is parkour.

### Step 2: Analyze and Deduce
- From clue 7 and 8, we know:
  - The Colombian is on the far right (position 4).
  - The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right (position 4).

Therefore, the Colombian drinks hot-chocolate.

- From clue 1 and 6, we know:
  - The person whose sport is parkour has the hobby of reading.
  - The owner of the hedgehog is the dancer.
  - The dancer is on the right of the person driving the train.
  - The dancer is the person who's sport is parkour.

Therefore, the dancer is in position 4 (since the Colombian is there), so the person with the hobby of reading is also in position 4.

- From clue 4 and 14, we know:
  - The person whose sport is golf is Colombian.
  - The Chinese is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket.

Since the Colombian is on the far right, the person with the sport of golf must be in position 3.

- From clue 10 and 11, we know:
  - The entrepreneur is on the right of the Thai.
  - The Chinese is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket.

Since the Colombian is on the far right, the Thai must be in position 3 or 2. But since the Colombian is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket, the Thai must be in position 2, and the person with the sport of cricket must be in position 1.

- From clue 2 and 15, we know:
  - The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the bird.
  - The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the Chinese.

Since the Colombian drinks hot-chocolate, the owner of the bird must be in position 2 or 3. But since the Thai is in position 2, the owner of the bird must be in position 3. Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2.

- From clue 3 and 5, we know:
  - The mechanic is on the right of the Chinese.
  - The dancer is on the right of the person driving the train.

Since the dancer is in position 4, the person driving the train must be in position 3.

- From clue 9 and 12, we know:
  - The person whose hobby is cooking is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
  - The owner of the cat is the person driving the subway.

Since the Thai is in position 2, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1, and the person whose hobby is cooking must be in position 2. Therefore, the owner of the cat must be in position 3.

- From clue 16, we know:
  - The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking milk.

Since the Thai is in position 2, the person drinking 7up must be in position 1, and the person drinking milk must be in position 2.

- From clue 13, we know:
  - The Colombian is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.

Since the Colombian is in position 4, the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 3.

### Step 3: Fill in the Table
