13. **Clue 13**: The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person who's sport is handball.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
Let's start placing the information based on these clues.

#### Clue 4: The person who's sport is baseball is on the far right.
- This means the person with the sport ""baseball"" is in position 6.

#### Clue 9: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person who's sport is baseball.
- Since the sport ""baseball"" is in position 6, the hobby ""rock-climbing"" must also be in position 6.

#### Clue 12: The person who's sport is rugby is the person who's hobby is cooking.
- We know from Clue 10 that the person with the hobby ""cooking"" is on the left of the person with the hobby ""collecting"".
- We also know from Clue 12 that the person with the hobby ""cooking"" is the same as the person with the sport ""rugby"".

#### Clue 1: The person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person driving the helicopter.
- Since the hobby ""cooking"" (and therefore ""rugby"") is in position 4 or 5, the hobby ""collecting"" must be in position 5 or 6. But since ""rock-climbing"" is in position 6, ""collecting"" must be in position 5.

#### Clue 10: The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting.
- Since ""cooking"" is in position 4 and ""collecting"" is in position 5, the person with the hobby ""cooking"" is in position 4.

#### Clue 3: The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
- Since ""rock-climbing"" is in position 6, the person driving the scooter must be in position 4 or 5. But ""cooking"" (and therefore ""rugby"") is in position 4, so the person driving the scooter must be in position 5.

#### Clue 11: The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person driving the roller.
- Since the person driving the roller is in position 6 (because ""rock-climbing"" is in position 6), the person with the hobby ""drawing"" must be in position 3 or 4. But ""cooking"" (and therefore ""rugby"") is in position 4, so the person with the hobby ""drawing"" must be in position 3.

#### Clue 2: The person who's sport is cricket is the person who's hobby is video-games.
- The person with the hobby ""video-games"" must be in position 2 because the person with the sport ""cricket"" cannot be in position 1 (since there is no position 0).

#### Clue 6: The person driving the roller is on the right of the person driving the scooter.
- Since the person driving the scooter is in position 5 and the person driving the roller is in position 6, the person driving the roller is in position 6.

#### Clue 7: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
- Since ""rock-climbing"" is in position 6, the person with the sport ""surfing"" must be in position 4 or 5. But ""cooking"" (and therefore ""rugby"") is in position 4, so the person with the sport ""surfing"" must be in position 5.

#### Clue 5: The person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person driving the train.
- Since ""rugby"" is in position 4, the person driving the train must be in position 6.

#### Clue 8: The person driving the trike is on the left of the person who's sport is handball.
- Since the person with the sport ""handball"" must be in position 6, the person driving the trike must be in position 5.

#### Clue 13: The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person who's sport is handball.
- Since ""surfing"" is in position 5 and ""handball"" is in position 4, this condition is satisfied.
