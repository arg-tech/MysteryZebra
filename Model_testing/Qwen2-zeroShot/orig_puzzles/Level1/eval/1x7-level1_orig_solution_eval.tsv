3. The Mexican is on the right of the Italian.
4. The Dutch is on the right of the French.
5. The Thai is on the far left.
6. The Nigerian is on the right of the Dutch.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The Thai is on the far left (Clue 5)**:
   - Thai must be in position 1.
   
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   \text{Thai} & & & & & & \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **The Egyptian is in the middle (Clue 1)**:
   - The Egyptian must be in position 4.
   
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   \text{Thai} & & & \text{Egyptian} & & & \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

3. **The Egyptian is on the left of the French (Clue 2)**:
   - Since the Egyptian is in position 4, the French must be in position 5.
   
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   \text{Thai} & & & \text{Egyptian} & \text{French} & & \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

4. **The Dutch is on the right of the French (Clue 4)**:
   - The Dutch must be in position 6.
   
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   \text{Thai} & & & \text{Egyptian} & \text{French} & \text{Dutch} & \\
   \hline

   \hline
   \text{Thai} & & & \text{Egyptian} & \text{French} & \text{Dutch} & \text{Nigerian} \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

6. **The Mexican is on the right of the Italian (Clue 3)**:
   - We have positions 2 and 3 left for the Italian and Mexican.
   - Since the Nigerian is already in position 7, the Mexican cannot be there.
   - Therefore, the Mexican must be in position 3 and the Italian in position 2.
   
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   \text{Thai} & \text{Italian} & \text{Mexican} & \text{Egyptian} & \text{French} & \text{Dutch} & \text{Nigerian} \\
   \hline
   \end{array}

Lv1-1x7-2	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **The teacher is on the far right (position 7).**
2. **The analyst is on the far left (position 1).**
3. **The analyst is on the left of the manager.**
4. **The manager is on the left of the entrepreneur.**
5. **The librarian is on the right of the nurse.**
6. **The teacher is on the right of the doctor.**

We can start by placing the known positions:

- Analyst (A) is at position 1.
- Teacher (T) is at position 7.

So, the table looks like this:
```
|       |    1    |    2    |      3       |   4   |     5     |   6    |    7    |
| Job   |    A    |         |              |       |           |        |    T    |
```

Next, let's use clue 6 to place the doctor (D):
- The teacher is on the right of the doctor, so D must be in position 6.

Now the table looks like this:
```
|       |    1    |    2    |      3       |   4   |     5     |   6    |    7    |
| Job   |    A    |         |              |       |           |    D   |    T    |
```

Using clue 3, the manager (M) must be between the analyst and the entrepreneur (E), and since the analyst is at position 1, M must be at position 2 and E at position 3.

Now the table looks like this:
```
|       |    1    |    2    |      3       |   4   |     5     |   6    |    7    |
| Job   |    A    |    M    |     E        |       |           |    D   |    T    |
```

Using clue 4, the librarian (L) must be on the right of the nurse (N). Since positions 4 and 5 are still empty, L and N must occupy these positions with L to the right of N.

Let's assign L and N:
- If N is at position 4, then L must be at position 5.

Now the table looks like this:
```
|       |    1    |    2    |      3       |   4   |     5     |   6    |    7    |
| Job   |    A    |    M    |     E        |    N  |     L     |    D   |    T    |
```

This placement satisfies all the given clues. Therefore, the final solution is:

```
|       |    1    |    2    |      3       |   4   |     5     |   6    |    7    |
| Job   |    A    |    M    |     E        |    N  |     L     |    D   |    T    |

Now, let's place the other positions based on the given clues:

- Since the Italian is on the left of the Mexican and the Mexican is at position 7, the Italian must be at position 6.
- The British is in the middle (position 4).
- The Egyptian is on the left of the Australian, and since positions 1, 4, 6, and 7 are already filled, the only remaining positions for the Egyptian and the Australian are 2 and 3, respectively.

So, the final arrangement is:

   ```

3. **Clue 5**: The owner of the turtle is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
   - Since the turtle is in position 1, the hedgehog must be in position 3 or 5.
   - But since the snake is in position 4, the hedgehog cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the hedgehog must be in position 3.
   ```
   | Turtle |   2    | Hedgehog | Snake |   5   |   6   |   7   |
   ```

4. **Clue 4**: The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the lizard.

Lv1-1x7-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.
2. The person who's hobby is photography is on the far left.
3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
4. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far right.
5. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
6. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in the middle.

From clue 2, we know:
- Photography is in position 1.

From clue 6, we know:
- Skydiving is in position 4 (the middle).

From clue 3 and clue 6, we can deduce:
- Rock-climbing must be in position 5 because it is to the right of skydiving (which is in position 4).

From clue 5:
- Chess is to the right of rock-climbing, so chess must be in position 6.

From clue 4:
- Hiking is on the far right, so it must be in position 7.

Now, we have positions 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 filled. We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with the remaining hobbies: singing and writing.

From clue 1:
- Photography (in position 1) is to the left of writing, so writing must be in position 2.

This leaves us with singing for position 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Photography
- Position 2: Writing
- Position 3: Singing
- Position 4: Skydiving
- Position 5: Rock-climbing
- Position 6: Chess
- Position 7: Hiking

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-1x7-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to arrange the 7 different types of food in positions 1 through 7 based on the given clues. Let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. **The person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person eating banana.**
   - This means if banana is at position \(x\), then grapefruit must be at position \(x+1\).

2. **The person eating lemon is on the left of the person eating pepper.**
   - If lemon is at position \(y\), then pepper must be at position \(y+1\).

3. **The person eating grapes is on the far left.**
   - Grapes must be at position 1.

4. **The person eating apple is on the left of the person eating banana.**
   - If apple is at position \(z\), then banana must be at position \(z+1\).

5. **The person eating lemon is on the right of the person eating lettuce.**
   - If lettuce is at position \(w\), then lemon must be at position \(w+1\).

6. **The person eating pepper is in the middle.**
   - Pepper must be at position 4.

Now let's use these clues to determine the correct order:

- From clue 3, grapes (G) is at position 1.
- From clue 6, pepper (P) is at position 4.
- From clue 2, since pepper is at position 4, lemon (L) must be at position 3.
- From clue 5, since lemon is at position 3, lettuce (Lett) must be at position 2.
- From clue 1, since grapefruit (Grpf) is on the right of banana (Bn), and considering the remaining positions, banana must be at position 5 and grapefruit at position 6.
- From clue 4, since apple (Ap) is on the left of banana (Bn), and considering the remaining positions, apple must be at position 7.

So the arrangement is:
- Position 1: Grapes (G)
- Position 2: Lettuce (Lett)
- Position 3: Lemon (L)
- Position 4: Pepper (P)
- Position 5: Banana (Bn)
- Position 6: Grapefruit (Grpf)

Lv1-1x7-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the movie genres accordingly.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies.**
   - This means if we have ""thriller"" in position \(i\), then ""drama"" must be in position \(i+1\) or higher.

2. **The person watching sports movies is in the middle.**
   - Since there are 7 positions, ""sports"" must be in position 4 (the middle).

3. **The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies.**
   - If we have ""satire"" in position \(j\), then ""disaster"" must be in position \(j+1\) or higher.

4. **The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching sports movies.**
   - Since ""sports"" is in position 4, ""horror"" must be in position 5 or higher.

5. **The person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.**
   - If we have ""disaster"" in position \(k\), then ""crime"" must be in position \(k+1\) or higher.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **Position 4 is Sports:**
   - So, the sequence starts as: \(_ _ _ S _ _ _\)

2. **Horror is to the right of Sports:**
   - Possible positions for Horror are 5, 6, or 7.
   - Let's assume Horror is in position 5: \(_ _ _ S H _ _\)

3. **Crime is to the right of Disaster:**
   - Since Horror is in position 5, Disaster must be in position 3 or lower.
   - If Disaster is in position 3, Crime must be in position 4, but Sports is already in position 4. Therefore, Disaster must be in position 2 and Crime in position 3.
   - So, the sequence is now: \(_ D C S H _ _\)

4. **Drama is to the right of Thriller:**
   - The remaining positions are 1 and 6 or 7.
   - If Drama is in position 6 and Thriller in position 1, the sequence fits all clues.

Lv1-1x7-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the music genres accordingly:

1. **The fan of house is on the right of the fan of rock.**
   - This means rock cannot be in position 7, and house must be to the right of rock.

2. **The fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of ambient.**
   - This means d&b comes before ambient.

3. **The fan of disco is on the right of the fan of ambient.**
   - This means ambient cannot be in position 7, and disco must be to the right of ambient.

4. **The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of d&b.**
   - This means folk comes before d&b.

5. **The fan of d&b is in the middle (position 4).**
   - So, d&b is in position 4.

Now, let's use these clues to fill in the positions:

- Since d&b is in position 4, folk must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Since d&b is in the middle, ambient must be in either position 3 or 5.
- Since ambient is to the right of d&b, it can only be in position 5.
- Since house is to the right of rock, and rock cannot be in position 7, possible positions for rock are 1, 2, or 3.
- Since folk is to the left of d&b, folk can only be in position 1 or 2.
- Since disco is to the right of ambient, and ambient is in position 5, disco must be in position 6 or 7.
- Given that house must be to the right of rock and rock cannot be in position 7, if rock is in position 1, house must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But since house cannot be in position 5 (as it needs to be to the right of rock), and rock cannot be in position 3 (as house would then be in position 5), rock must be in position 1 and house in position 2.

So, we have:
- Rock in position 1
- House in position 2
- Ambient in position 5
- D&b in position 4
- Folk in position 3
- Disco in position 6
- Soul in position 7

Thus, the final solution is:

5. **The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the goat.**
   - This means the goldfish must be to the left of the goat.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Pony
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: Cat
- Position 5: ?
- Position 6: ?
- Position 7: ?

Given the constraints, let's try to fit the remaining pets:

- The goat and frog must be placed such that the goat is to the left of the frog.
- The goldfish must be to the left of the goat.

Considering the available positions:
- Position 2 and 3 can only hold the goat and frog (since they need to be next to each other).
- Position 5 and 6 can only hold the goldfish and one of the remaining pets (chinchilla or hamster).

Since the goat must be to the left of the frog, and the goldfish must be to the left of the goat, we can deduce:
- Position 2: Goldfish
- Position 3: Goat
- Position 5: Chinchilla
- Position 6: Hamster
- Position 7: Frog

Putting it all together, the final arrangement is:

```

| Pony | Goldfish | Goat | Cat | Chinchilla | Hamster | Frog |
