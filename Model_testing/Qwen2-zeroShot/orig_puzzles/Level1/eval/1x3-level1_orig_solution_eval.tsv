Lv1-1x3-1	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. The engineer is on the far left.
2. The bartender is on the right of the librarian.

Given the positions:
- Position 1 (far left): Engineer
- Position 3 (far right): Either bartender or librarian

Since the bartender must be to the right of the librarian, and position 3 can only hold one of them, we need to place the librarian in position 2 and the bartender in position 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Engineer
- Position 2: Librarian
- Position 3: Bartender

Here is the final solution table:

```
|       |    1     |     2     |     3     |
| Job   | Engineer | Librarian | Bartender |

Lv1-1x3-2	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

1. The photographer is on the far right.
2. The dancer is on the far left.

Given the table:

```
|       |   1    |   2    |      3       |
| Job   |        |        |              |
```

We can place the jobs as follows:

- Since the dancer must be on the far left (position 1), we place ""dancer"" there.
- Since the photographer must be on the far right (position 3), we place ""photographer"" there.
- This leaves position 2 for the doctor.

So, the final solution table looks like this:

```
|       |   1    |   2    |      3       |
| Job   | dancer | doctor | photographer |

Lv1-1x3-3	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given information and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

1. The person who's hobby is baking is on the far left.
2. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- From clue 1, the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 1.
- From clue 2, the person with the hobby of video-games must be to the right of the person with the hobby of reading.

So, let's place the hobbies accordingly:

- Position 1 (far left) must be ""baking"".
- Position 3 (far right) must be ""video-games"" because it is to the right of ""reading"".

This leaves position 2 for ""reading"".

Therefore, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Baking
- Position 2: Reading
- Position 3: Video-games

Here is the final solution table:

```
|         |   1    |    2    |      3      |
| Hobby   | Baking | Reading | Video-games |

Lv1-1x3-4	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We have three positions (1, 2, 3) and three nationalities: French, Japanese, and Nigerian.

From the clues:
1. The Japanese is on the far right.
2. The Japanese is on the right of the Nigerian.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the Japanese is on the far right (position 3), we know that position 3 must be Japanese.
- Since the Japanese is also on the right of the Nigerian, the Nigerian cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the Nigerian must be in position 1 or 2.
- If the Nigerian is in position 1, then the French must be in position 2 (since the Japanese is in position 3).

So, the only possible arrangement is:
- Position 1: Nigerian
- Position 2: French
- Position 3: Japanese

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |   1    |    2     |    3     |
| Nationality   | Nigerian| French   | Japanese |

Lv1-1x3-5	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given clues to determine the correct arrangement of the beverages.

1. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
2. The person drinking water is on the far right.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the person drinking water is on the far right (position 3), the beverage in position 3 must be water.
- The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Therefore, sprite must be in position 1 and almond-milk must be in position 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Sprite
- Position 2: Almond-milk
- Position 3: Water

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-1x3-6	"Certainly! Let's solve this logic puzzle step by step.

We have three people using three different means of transport: boat, car, and snowmobile. We need to determine the order of these transports based on the given clues:

1. The person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
2. The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the boat.

Let's denote:
- B for boat
- C for car
- S for snowmobile

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the snowmobile (S) must be on the left of the person driving the car (C). This gives us the initial order: S _ C

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the car (C) must be on the left of the person driving the boat (B). Combining this with the previous order, we get: S C B

So, the correct order of the transports is:
- Snowmobile (S)
- Car (C)
- Boat (B)

Now, let's put this information into the table format you provided:

```
|             |     1      |  2  |  3   |
| Transport   | Snowmobile |  Car | Boat |
```

This is the final solution table:

Lv1-1x3-7	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

1. The person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.
2. The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.

From these two statements, we can deduce the order of the movie genres from left to right as follows:
- Thriller is on the far left.
- Action is in the middle.
- Martial-arts is on the far right.

So, the order is: **Thriller -> Action -> Martial-arts**.

Now, let's place this order into the table:

```

Lv1-1x3-8	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

Given:
1. The person whose hobby is traveling is in the middle.
2. The person whose hobby is dancing is on the right of the person whose hobby is traveling.

We need to place the hobbies (dancing, drawing, and traveling) into the three positions (1, 2, and 3).

From the first clue, we know that the middle position (2) must be ""traveling"":
```
|         |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Hobby   |         | traveling |         |
```

From the second clue, the person whose hobby is dancing must be on the right of the person whose hobby is traveling. Since the middle position (2) is ""traveling"", the rightmost position (3) must be ""dancing"":
```
|         |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Hobby   |         | traveling | dancing  |
```

This leaves the leftmost position (1) for the remaining hobby, which is ""drawing"":
```
|         |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Hobby   | drawing | traveling | dancing  |
```

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-1x3-9	"Sure, let's analyze the given information step-by-step to solve the puzzle.

We have three columns (1, 2, and 3) representing three different movie genres: comedy, disaster, and time-travel. We need to determine which genre each column represents based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.
2. The person watching disaster movies is in the middle.

### Analysis:

- From clue 2, we know that the person watching disaster movies must be in column 2.
- From clue 1, the person watching comedy movies must be on the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since disaster movies are in column 2, comedy movies must be in column 1.

Therefore, the only remaining genre, time-travel, must be in column 3.

### Final Solution Table:

```
| Movie-Genre  |   1    |    2     |      3      |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------------|

1. The Turkish person is in the middle.
2. The Spanish person is on the left of the Turkish person.

Given the three positions (1, 2, 3), we can place the nationalities as follows:

- Position 1 must be the Spanish person because it is to the left of the Turkish person.
- Position 2 must be the Turkish person because it is in the middle and the Spanish person is to its left.
