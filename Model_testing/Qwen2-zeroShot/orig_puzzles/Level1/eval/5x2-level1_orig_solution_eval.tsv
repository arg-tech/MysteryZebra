Lv1-5x2-2	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The paramedic is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
2. The person driving the roller is on the far right.
3. The owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is skateboarding.
4. The owner of the ferret is the person drinking sprite.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions of the sports and beverages.
From clue 2, we know that the person driving the roller is on the far right (position 2). So, we can place the transport first:

|             |     1     |       2       |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Beverage    |          |              |
| Job         |          |              |
| Pet         |          |              |
| Sport       |          | roller       |
| Transport   |          | tram         |

From clue 3, the owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is skateboarding. So, we can place the sport:

|             |     1     |       2       |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Beverage    |          |              |
| Job         |          |              |
| Pet         |          |              |
| Sport       | skateboarding | roller       |
| Transport   |          | tram         |

From clue 4, the owner of the ferret is also the person drinking sprite. Since the paramedic is on the left of the person drinking sprite (clue 1), the paramedic must be in position 1, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 2. Therefore:

|             |     1     |       2       |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Beverage    | sprite   |              |
| Job         | paramedic |              |
| Pet         |          |              |
| Sport       | skateboarding | roller       |
| Transport   |          | tram         |

Since the paramedic is in position 1, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2 (the only other beverage option):

|             |     1     |       2       |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Beverage    | sprite   | soy-milk     |
| Job         | paramedic |              |
| Pet         |          |              |
| Sport       | skateboarding | roller       |
| Transport   |          | tram         |

#### Step 2: Determine the pet and job.
From clue 3, the owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is skateboarding. We already placed the sport in position 1, so the owner of the ferret must be in position 1:

|             |     1     |       2       |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Beverage    | sprite   | soy-milk     |
| Job         | paramedic |              |
| Pet         | ferret   |              |
| Sport       | skateboarding | roller       |
| Transport   |          | tram         |

Since the paramedic is in position 1, the librarian must be in position 2:

|             |     1     |       2       |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Beverage    | sprite   | soy-milk     |
| Job         | paramedic | librarian    |
| Pet         | ferret   |              |
| Sport       | skateboarding | roller       |
| Transport   |          | tram         |

Finally, the person who keeps the goldfish must be in position 2 since the ferret is already placed in position 1:

|             |     1     |       2       |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Beverage    | sprite   | soy-milk     |
| Job         | paramedic | librarian    |
| Pet         | ferret   | goldfish     |
| Sport       | skateboarding | roller       |
| Transport   |          | tram         |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |     1     |       2       |

Lv1-5x2-3	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating grapes is on the far left.
2. The fan of pop is on the right of the software-developer.
3. The fan of electronic is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
4. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Hobbies and Food
- From clue 4, the person with the hobby ""collecting"" is on the far left (position 1).
- From clue 1, the person eating grapes is on the far left (position 1).

Since both positions must be occupied by the same person (the person with the hobby ""collecting"" and eating grapes), we can conclude:
- **Position 1 (leftmost):** Collecting, Grapes

#### Step 2: Positioning the Jobs and Music Genres
- Since position 1 is already filled, we need to determine the remaining positions for jobs and music genres.
- From clue 2, the fan of pop is on the right of the software-developer. This means that if one person has the job as a software-developer, the other must have the job as a teacher, and the fan of pop must be in the position immediately to the right of the software-developer.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Sports
- From clue 3, the fan of electronic is on the left of the person who prefers baseball. This means that if one person prefers electronic, the other must prefer baseball, and the person who prefers baseball must be in the position immediately to the right of the person who prefers electronic.

#### Step 4: Filling in the Remaining Positions
Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Collecting, Grapes
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions based on the clues:
- Position 2: Since the fan of pop is on the right of the software-developer, we can place the software-developer in position 2 and the fan of pop in position 3.
- Position 3: The fan of electronic is on the left of the person who prefers baseball, so we can place the fan of electronic in position 2 and the person who prefers baseball in position 3.

Given the above reasoning, we can deduce:
- **Position 2:** Software-developer, Pop
- **Position 3:** Electronic, Baseball

### Final Table:

Lv1-5x2-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's sport is volleyball.
2. The person drinking cola is on the far right.
3. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person watching western movies.
4. The fan of reggae is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place Reggae and Volleyball
From clue 4, we know that the fan of reggae is on the far left. Therefore, the person in position (1, 1) prefers reggae.

From clue 1, the person whose hobby is skydiving is the same as the person whose sport is volleyball. Since the fan of reggae is on the far left, the person with volleyball cannot be in position (1, 1).

Therefore, the person with volleyball must be in position (2, 1).

So, the table now looks like this:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |    cola    |            |
| Hobby         |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |            |            |
| Music-Genre   | house      | reggae     |
| Sport         | volleyball |            |
```

#### Step 2: Place Skydiving and Cola
From clue 1, the person whose hobby is skydiving is the same as the person whose sport is volleyball. So, the person with skydiving must be in position (1, 2).

From clue 2, the person drinking cola is on the far right. So, the person with cola must be in position (1, 2), which means the person with skydiving is also in position (1, 2).

So, the table now looks like this:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |    cola    |    cola    |
| Hobby         |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |            |            |
| Music-Genre   | house      | reggae     |
| Sport         | volleyball | volleyball |
```

#### Step 3: Place Western Movies and Volleyball
From clue 3, the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the person with volleyball is in position (2, 1), the person watching western movies must be in position (1, 2).

So, the table now looks like this:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |    cola    |    cola    |
| Hobby         |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   | western    |            |
| Music-Genre   | house      | reggae     |
| Sport         | volleyball | volleyball |
```

#### Step 4: Place Card-Games and Comedy
Since we have already placed all the sports, hobbies, music genres, and one beverage, the remaining positions can be filled with the remaining elements.

- The person with cola is on the far right, so the person with 7up must be in position (1, 1).
- The person with skydiving is in position (1, 2), so the person with card-games must be in position (2, 2).
- The person with western movies is in position (1, 2), so the person with comedy must be in position (2, 1).

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |    7up     |    cola    |

### Applying Clues:

**Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is dancing (D) is on the right of the Canadian (C).
- This means C cannot be in position 2, and D must be in position 2.
- Possible arrangement: C _ | _ D

**Clue 2:** The paramedic (P) is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball (B).
- This means P cannot be in position 2, and B must be to the right of P.
- Possible arrangement: _ P | P B

**Clue 3:** The person eating pear (Pp) is on the left of the Thai (Th).
- This means Pp cannot be in position 2, and Th must be to the right of Pp.
- Possible arrangement: Pp _ | _ Th

### Combining All Clues:

- From Clue 1, we have C _ | _ D.
- From Clue 2, we have _ P | P B.
- From Clue 3, we have Pp _ | _ Th.

Combining these, we get:
- C _ | _ D
- _ P | P B
- Pp _ | _ Th

Since there are only two positions for each category, we can deduce the following:
- C must be in position 1, and D must be in position 2.
- P must be in position 1, and B must be in position 2.
- Pp must be in position 1, and Th must be in position 2.

This gives us:
- C in position 1, P in position 1, and Pp in position 1 (all conflicting, so re-evaluate).

Revising based on correct logical placement:
- C in position 1, P in position 2, and Pp in position 2 (still conflicting).

Final correct placement:
- C in position 1, P in position 2.
- Pp in position 1, Th in position 2.
- D in position 2.

Lv1-5x2-9	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify Key Information

1. **Food**:
   - Nectarine, Pepper
2. **Hobby**:
   - Collecting, Magic-Tricks
3. **Music-Genre**:
   - House, Metal
4. **Pet**:
   - Goldfish, Lizard
5. **Sport**:
   - Basketball, Rugby

### Step 2: Analyze Clues

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of Metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is Magic-Tricks.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating Pepper is on the far right.
3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the Lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is Rugby.

### Step 3: Arrange Based on Clues

#### Clue 2: The person eating Pepper is on the far right.
- This means the person in position (2, 2) eats Pepper.

#### Clue 1: The fan of Metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is Magic-Tricks.
- Since the person with the hobby of Magic-Tricks must be to the left of the fan of Metal, and given that the person in (2, 2) eats Pepper, the person in (2, 1) cannot have the hobby of Magic-Tricks (since there would be no space for the fan of Metal).

#### Clue 3: The owner of the Lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is Rugby.
- This implies that the person with the pet Lizard must be in (1, 1), and the person with the sport Rugby must be in (1, 2).

### Step 4: Fill in the Table

Given the above deductions:

|               |      1       |     2      |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Food          | Nectarine    | Pepper     |

| Pet           | Goldfish     | Lizard     |

Lv1-5x2-10	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

Given:
1. The person watching satire movies is on the left of the owner of the cat.
2. The fisherman is on the far left.
3. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
4. The person whose hobby is traveling is on the right of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Fisherman (from clue 2)
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

We also know:
- Hobbies: rock-climbing, traveling
- Jobs: fisherman, journalist
- Movie-Genres: comedy, satire
- Pets: bird, cat
- Transport: snowmobile, train

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1: Fisherman**
   - From clue 2, the fisherman is on the far left.

2. **Clue 4: Traveling is to the right of rock-climbing**
   - This means the person with the hobby ""traveling"" must be to the right of the person with the hobby ""rock-climbing"".

3. **Clue 3: Comedy is to the right of Snowmobile**
   - This means the person watching comedy movies must be to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.

4. **Clue 1: Satire is to the left of Cat**
   - This means the person watching satire movies must be to the left of the person owning the cat.

### Analyzing the Clues:

Let's place the fisherman first:
```
|       1       |       2       |       3       |       4       |       5       |
| Fisherman     |               |               |               |               |
```

Since the person with the hobby ""traveling"" must be to the right of the person with the hobby ""rock-climbing"", and considering the other clues, we can start placing the hobbies:
- If ""traveling"" is in position 3 and ""rock-climbing"" is in position 2, it satisfies clue 4.

```
|       1       |       2       |       3       |       4       |       5       |
| Fisherman     | Rock-climbing | Traveling     |               |               |
```

Now, let's place the movies:
- The person watching satire is to the left of the person owning the cat, and the person watching comedy is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.

If we place the satire and comedy genres such that the person watching satire is in position 1 or 2 and the person watching comedy is in position 4 or 5, we need to ensure the other conditions are met.

Considering the transport:
- The person driving the snowmobile must be to the left of the person watching comedy.

Let's try:
```
|       1       |       2       |       3       |       4       |       5       |
| Fisherman     | Rock-climbing | Traveling     | Comedy        | Satire        |
```

This satisfies:
- The fisherman is in position 1 (clue 2).
- Traveling is to the right of rock-climbing (clue 4).
- Satire is to the left of cat (clue 1).

Finally, the remaining job and pet:
- The journalist must be in position 2, and the person with the pet ""cat"" must be in position 5.

```
|       1       |       2       |       3       |       4       |       5       |
| Fisherman     | Journalist    | Rock-climbing | Comedy        | Cat           |
```

And the remaining pet:
- The bird must be with the person in position 4.

```
|       1       |       2       |       3       |       4       |       5       |
| Fisherman     | Journalist    | Rock-climbing | Train         | Cat           |
```

So the final solution is:
```
|               |       1       |       2       |       3       |       4       |       5       |
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Journalist    | Traveling     | Train         | Cat           |
| Job           | Fisherman     |               |               |               |               |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy        |               |               |               | Satire        |
| Pet           |               |               |               | Bird          |               |
| Transport     |               |               |               | Snowmobile    |               |
