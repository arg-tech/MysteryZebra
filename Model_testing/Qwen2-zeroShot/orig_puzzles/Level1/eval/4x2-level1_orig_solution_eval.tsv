Lv1-4x2-1	"Sure, let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.

Given:
- Two hobbies: traveling, writing
- Two jobs: designer, social-worker
- Two sports: soccer, volleyball
- Two means of transport: bike, jet-ski

Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right.
2. The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
3. The designer is on the far right.

Let's fill in the table based on these clues:

|             |       1       |     2     |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Hobby       |               | traveling |
| Job         |               | designer  |
| Sport       |               | soccer    |
| Transport   |               | jet-ski   |

Now, let's deduce the remaining information:

From clue 3, we know that the designer is on the far right (position 2). Therefore, the job in position 1 must be social-worker.

From clue 1, the hobby in position 2 is traveling. Therefore, the hobby in position 1 must be writing.

From clue 2, the person who plays soccer is to the right of the person using the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski is in position 2, the person playing soccer must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv1-4x2-2	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

Given:
1. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
2. The entrepreneur is on the far left.
3. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.

Let's denote:
- Beverage: almond-milk (A) or lemonade (L)
- Job: entrepreneur (E) or lawyer (Lr)
- Movie-Genre: action (Agt) or time-travel (Tt)
- Sport: snowboarding (Sb) or surfing (Sr)

From clue 2, we know the entrepreneur is on the far left. So, we can start with:

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Beverage      |     A        |     L       |
| Job           |     E        |     Lr      |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Sport         |             |            |

Now, let's use clue 1. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. This means the person who does snowboarding must be in position 1, and the person who watches action movies must be in position 2.

So, we update our table as follows:

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Beverage      |     A        |     L       |
| Job           |     E        |     Lr      |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Sport         |     Sb      |     Sr      |

Finally, let's use clue 3. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person in position 2 drinks lemonade, the person in position 1 must be watching action movies.

So, we update our table to reflect this:

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Beverage      |     Aagt    |     L       |
| Job           |     E        |     Lr      |
| Movie-Genre   |     Agt     |     Tt      |
| Sport         |     Sb      |     Sr      |

Thus, the final solution table is:

Lv1-4x2-3	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The fan of country is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the taxi.
3. The person eating apple is on the far left.

### Initial Setup:
We need to fill the table with the given options:
```
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Beverage      |          |           |
| Food          |          |           |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |
| Transport     |          |           |
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The person eating apple is on the far left (position 1).
   - So, `Food` for position 1 must be ""apple"".

2. **Clue 1**: The fan of country is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - This means that in either row, the country fan must be in position 1 and the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2.

3. **Clue 2**: The person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the taxi.
   - This means that in either row, the beverage ""iced-tea"" must match the transport ""taxi"".

### Assigning Values Based on Clues:

- Since the person eating apple is in position 1, we can assign ""apple"" to position 1 under ""Food"".
- We know the country fan must be in position 1, so we can assign ""country"" to position 1 under ""Music-Genre"".
- The person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2, so we can assign ""soy-milk"" to position 2 under ""Beverage"".
- The person drinking iced-tea must be the one driving the taxi, so we can assign ""taxi"" to position 2 under ""Transport"".

Given these assignments, let's place them in the table:

```
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | iced-tea  |
| Food          | apple    |           |
| Music-Genre   | country  |           |
| Transport     | taxi     |           |
```

Now, we need to determine the remaining values. Since we have only two choices left for ""Beverage"" (soy-milk and iced-tea) and ""Food"" (apple and avocado), and we already filled in ""soy-milk"" and ""apple"", the remaining values must be ""iced-tea"" and ""avocado"".

Since ""soy-milk"" is in position 2 for ""Beverage"", ""iced-tea"" must be in position 1 for ""Beverage"". And since ""apple"" is in position 1 for ""Food"", ""avocado"" must be in position 2 for ""Food"".

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | iced-tea  |
| Food          | apple    | avocado   |
| Music-Genre   | country  |           |
| Transport     | taxi     |           |
```

We still need to assign the music genre and transport for position 2. Since the person in position 1 is the fan of country, the person in position 2 cannot be the fan of country. Therefore, the person in position 2 must be the fan of ambient.

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | iced-tea  |
| Food          | apple    | avocado   |
| Music-Genre   | country  | ambient   |
| Transport     | taxi     | quad-bike |
```

This satisfies all the given conditions."	{'beverage': ['soy-milk', 'iced-tea'], 'food': ['apple', 'avocado'], 'music-genre': ['country', 'ambient'], 'transport': ['taxi', 'quad-bike']}	True	6	False
Lv1-4x2-4	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
1. The fan of punk is on the far left.
2. The nurse is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
3. The person drinking soy-milk is the person eating lemon.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the fan of punk:**
   - Since the fan of punk is on the far left, we can place ""punk"" in position (Music-Genre, 1).

2. **Identify the person drinking iced-tea:**
   - The nurse is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. This means the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position (Job, 2) because there would be no space for the nurse.
   - Let's assume the person drinking iced-tea is in (Beverage, 1). Then the nurse must be in (Job, 2).

3. **Identify the person eating lemon:**
   - The person drinking soy-milk is the person eating lemon. This means that the person eating lemon is also the one drinking soy-milk.

4. **Assign remaining options:**
   - The remaining beverage is iced-tea, so it must be in (Beverage, 2).
   - The remaining food is papaya, so it must be in (Food, 2).
   - The remaining job is security-guard, so it must be in (Job, 1).
   - The remaining music genre is techno, so it must be in (Music-Genre, 2).

### Final Table:
```
|               |       1        |    2     |

Lv1-4x2-5	"Let's break down the information and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two people.
2. Each person has:
   - A hobby (skydiving or video-games)
   - A music genre preference (classical or country)
   - A sport preference (sailing or skateboarding)
   - A mode of transport (quad-bike or roller)

### Clues:
1. The fan of classical is on the far left.
2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person driving the roller.
3. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person driving the roller.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The fan of classical is on the far left.
This tells us that the first person in the row prefers classical music.

#### Clue 2: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person driving the roller.
This means the person with skateboarding as their sport must be to the right of the person using roller as their mode of transport.

#### Clue 3: The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person driving the roller.
This means the person with video-games as their hobby must be to the right of the person using roller as their mode of transport.

Given these clues, let's assign the values step-by-step:

1. **Music Genre:**
   - Person 1 (far left) prefers classical music.
   - Therefore, Person 2 must prefer country music.

2. **Sport:**
   - The person with skateboarding must be to the right of the person with roller.
   - The person with video-games must also be to the right of the person with roller.
   
   This implies that the person with roller cannot have video-games or skateboarding. So, the person with roller must have either skydiving or sailing.

3. **Hobby:**
   - Since the person with roller cannot have video-games, they must have skydiving.
   - Therefore, the person with video-games must have sailing.

4. **Transport:**
   - The person with roller must have skydiving as their hobby.
   - The person with video-games must have sailing.
   - The person with skateboarding must be to the right of the person with roller, so they must have the remaining sport, which is skateboarding.
   - The person with country music must drive the roller.

So, the final assignments are:

- **Person 1:**
  - Hobby: Classical music (from clue 1)
  - Music Genre: Classical
  - Sport: Sailing
  - Transport: Roller

- **Person 2:**
  - Hobby: Video-games
  - Music Genre: Country
  - Sport: Skateboarding
  - Transport: Quad-bike

Lv1-4x2-7	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

We have the following categories and items:
- Food: banana, nectarine
- Music-Genre: hip-hop, r&b
- Sport: baseball, cycling
- Transport: bus, tram

And we need to fill in the table based on the provided clues:

|               |     1     |    2    |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Food          |           |         |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |
| Sport         |           |         |
| Transport     |           |         |

**Clues:**
1. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person whose sport is cycling.
2. The person driving the tram is on the far right.
3. The person driving the tram is on the right of the person eating nectarine.

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person driving the tram is on the far right (position 2 in transport).

   |               |     1     |    2    |
   |---------------|-----------|---------|
   | Food          |           |         |
   | Music-Genre   |           |         |
   | Sport         |           |         |
   | Transport     |           | tram    |

2. **Clue 3**: The person driving the tram is on the right of the person eating nectarine.

   This means the person eating nectarine must be in position 1 for transport.

   |               |     1     |    2    |
   |---------------|-----------|---------|
   | Food          |           |         |
   | Music-Genre   |           |         |
   | Sport         |           |         |
   | Transport     | nectarine | tram    |

3. **Clue 1**: The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person whose sport is cycling.

   Since the person driving the tram (in position 2) cannot be the fan of hip-hop, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 1 for music-genre.

   |               |     1     |    2    |
   |---------------|-----------|---------|
   | Food          |           |         |
   | Music-Genre   | hip-hop   | r&b     |
   | Sport         |           |         |
   | Transport     | nectarine | tram    |

4. **Determining the remaining categories:**

   - The fan of hip-hop (position 1 in music-genre) cannot be eating nectarine (since that's in position 2 of transport).
   - Therefore, the person eating nectarine must be eating banana (the only other option).

   |               |     1     |    2    |
   |---------------|-----------|---------|
   | Food          | banana    | nectarine |
   | Music-Genre   | hip-hop   | r&b     |
   | Sport         |           |         |
   | Transport     | nectarine | tram    |

5. **Final determination of sport:**

   - The person whose sport is cycling must be in position 2 (since the fan of hip-hop is in position 1 and the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person whose sport is cycling).
   - The person whose sport is baseball must be in position 1.

   |               |     1     |    2    |
   |---------------|-----------|---------|

Lv1-4x2-8	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues.

We have four columns (1 and 2) and four rows (Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Transport). Let's denote the entries as follows:

- H1, H2: Hobbies for column 1 and 2 respectively.
- J1, J2: Jobs for column 1 and 2 respectively.
- M1, M2: Movie-Genres for column 1 and 2 respectively.
- T1, T2: Transport for column 1 and 2 respectively.

**Clues:**
1. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
2. The person watching zombie movies is the entrepreneur.
3. The person watching thriller movies is on the far left.

Let's start filling in the information based on these clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3:** The person watching thriller movies is on the far left.
   - This means M1 = Thriller.

2. **Clue 2:** The person watching zombie movies is the entrepreneur.
   - Since M2 must be Zombie, J2 must be Entrepreneur.

3. **Clue 1:** The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
   - If T1 is Jet-ski, then H1 must be Board-games.

Now, we need to fill in the remaining details:

- Since J2 is Entrepreneur and J1 must be Software-developer (as there are only two jobs), we have:
  - J1 = Software-developer, J2 = Entrepreneur.

- Since M1 is Thriller and M2 is Zombie, we have:
  - M1 = Thriller, M2 = Zombie.

- We already determined that T1 is Jet-ski and T2 must be Trike (since there are only two transports):
  - T1 = Jet-ski, T2 = Trike.

- Given that H1 is Board-games and H2 must be Reading (as there are only two hobbies):
  - H1 = Board-games, H2 = Reading.

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |         1          |      2       |
| Hobby         | Board-games       | Reading      |
| Job           | Software-developer | Entrepreneur |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller          | Zombie       |
| Transport     | Jet-ski           | Trike        |

2. **Person eating spinach is on the left of the person drinking coffee.**
3. **Teacher is on the left of the person whose hobby is chess.**

Let's denote:
- Teacher as T
- Scientist as S
- Cucumber as C
- Spinach as P
- 7up as 7
- Coffee as K
- Board games as B
- Chess as Ch

Given these clues, we can start to piece together the table:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1: The teacher (T) is on the left of the person eating cucumber (C).**
   - This means T must be in position 1 and C must be in position 2 for either Beverage or Food.

2. **Clue 2: The person eating spinach (P) is on the left of the person drinking coffee (K).**
   - This means P must be in position 1 and K must be in position 2 for either Beverage or Food.

3. **Clue 3: The teacher (T) is on the left of the person whose hobby is chess (Ch).**
   - This means T must be in position 1 and Ch must be in position 2 for either Hobby or Job.

### Placing the Clues:

- From Clue 1, we know T must be in position 1 for either Beverage or Food.
- From Clue 2, we know P must be in position 1 for either Beverage or Food.
- From Clue 3, we know T must be in position 1 for either Hobby or Job.

Since T must be in position 1 in both Clue 1 and Clue 3, let's assume T is in position 1 for Beverage and Food, and check if it fits all clues.

#### Possible arrangement for Beverage and Food:

- Position 1: T (Teacher)
- Position 2: P (Spinach)

Now, we need to place the remaining items (7up, coffee, cucumber, and scientist) in positions 1 and 2 for Food and Beverage.

- From Clue 2, P (spinach) is on the left of K (coffee), so K cannot be in position 1 for Beverage, but it must be in position 2 for Beverage.
- Therefore, the only remaining item for position 1 of Beverage is 7up.
- So, position 1 of Beverage is 7up, and position 2 of Beverage is coffee.

This leaves us with:
- Position 1 of Food: spinach
- Position 2 of Food: cucumber

#### Now we need to place the hobbies and jobs:

- From Clue 3, T (teacher) is on the left of Ch (chess), so the only remaining job for position 1 is scientist.
- Therefore, position 1 of Job is scientist, and position 2 of Job is teacher.

Since we already placed the teacher in position 1 for Beverage and Food, the only remaining hobby for position 2 is chess.

Lv1-4x2-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The Polish person is the owner of the rabbit.
2. The fan of folk is on the right of the person eating artichoke.
3. The Polish person is on the right of the owner of the lizard.

### Table Setup:
|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Food          |           |           |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |
| Nationality   |           |           |
| Pet           |           |           |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The Polish person is the owner of the rabbit.
   - This means the Polish person must be in position 2 (since they own the rabbit, and the rabbit cannot be in position 1).
   - So, we have:
     |               |     1     |     2     |
     |---------------|-----------|-----------|
     | Food          |           |           |
     | Music-Genre   |           |           |
     | Nationality   |           | Polish    |
     | Pet           |           | Rabbit    |

2. **Clue 3:** The Polish person is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
   - Since the Polish person is in position 2, the owner of the lizard must be in position 1.
   - So, we have:
     |               |     1     |     2     |
     |---------------|-----------|-----------|
     | Food          |           |           |
     | Music-Genre   |           |           |
     | Nationality   | Malay     | Polish    |
     | Pet           | Lizard    | Rabbit    |

3. **Clue 2:** The fan of folk is on the right of the person eating artichoke.
   - We know there are only two types of food: artichoke and blueberry.
   - Let's assume the person in position 1 is eating artichoke. Then the person in position 2 would be the fan of folk.
   - Therefore, the person in position 1 is the fan of folk and the person in position 2 is the fan of artichoke.
   - However, since the Polish person (in position 2) is already identified as the fan of folk, the person in position 1 must be the fan of artichoke.
   - So, we have:
     |               |     1     |     2     |
     |---------------|-----------|-----------|
     | Food          | Artichoke | Blueberry |
     | Music-Genre   | Folk      | Blues     |
     | Nationality   | Malay     | Polish    |
     | Pet           | Lizard    | Rabbit    |

4. **Verification:**
   - The Polish person (position 2) owns the rabbit (Clue 1).
   - The fan of folk (position 1) is on the right of the person eating artichoke (Clue 2).
   - The Polish person (position 2) is on the right of the owner of the lizard (Clue 3).

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Food          | Artichoke | Blueberry |
| Music-Genre   | Folk      | Blues     |
| Nationality   | Malay     | Polish    |
| Pet           | Lizard    | Rabbit    |
