Lv1-1x6-1	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

1. The lawyer is on the far right.
2. The lawyer is on the right of the nurse.
3. The nurse is on the right of the videographer.
4. The security-guard is on the left of the architect.
5. The bartender is on the far left.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The bartender must be in position 1 (far left).
- The videographer must be to the immediate left of the nurse (since the nurse is to the immediate left of the lawyer).
- The lawyer must be in position 5 (far right).

Let's start placing the positions:

1. Bartender (B)
2. Videographer (V)
3. Nurse (N)
4. Lawyer (L) - must be in position 5 (far right)
5. Lawyer (L) - confirmed in position 5
6. Security-guard (SG) and Architect (A)

Now, using clue 4 (the security-guard is on the left of the architect), we need to place SG and A such that SG is to the left of A.

Since the lawyer is already in position 5, the security-guard and architect must occupy positions 4 and 6 respectively (or vice versa).

Let's test both possibilities:

- If SG is in position 4 and A is in position 6:
  - This would satisfy the condition that SG is to the left of A.
  - Therefore, the sequence would be: B, V, N, SG, L, A.

This satisfies all the given conditions:
- The bartender (B) is on the far left.
- The videographer (V) is to the immediate left of the nurse (N).
- The nurse (N) is to the immediate left of the lawyer (L).
- The security-guard (SG) is to the left of the architect (A).
- The lawyer (L) is on the far right.

So, the final solution is:

Lv1-1x6-2	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left.
   - This means the first position (position 1) is occupied by gardening.

2. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
   - Since gardening is in position 1, camping must be in position 2.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
   - Since camping is in position 2, filmmaking must be in position 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.
   - Since filmmaking is in position 3, writing must be in position 4.

5. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.
   - The only positions left are 5 and 6. Since writing is in position 4, the only options for positions 5 and 6 are sudoku and drawing. Therefore, the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 5 and the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 6.

Let's summarize the positions:
- Position 1: Gardening
- Position 2: Camping
- Position 3: Filmmaking
- Position 4: Writing
- Position 5: Sudoku

1. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is cycling is on the far left.
   - This means position 1 is cycling.

2. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the far right.
   - This means position 6 is skateboarding.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
   - Since skateboarding is in position 6, weightlifting must be in position 5.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
   - This means skiing and baseball must be in consecutive positions with skiing to the left of baseball.

5. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing.
   - This means lacrosse must be in a position to the left of skiing.

Now, let's place the sports in the correct order:

- Position 1: Cycling (from Clue 4)
- Position 6: Skateboarding (from Clue 5)
- Position 5: Weightlifting (from Clue 1)

Given that lacrosse must be to the left of skiing and skiing must be to the left of baseball, we can deduce the following:
- Position 2: Lacrosse (since it needs to be to the left of skiing)
- Position 3: Skiing
- Position 4: Baseball

So, the final arrangement is:

Lv1-1x6-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the genres accordingly.

Let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching spy movies.
2. The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person watching crime movies.
3. The person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching scientific movies.
4. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching spy movies (repeated from clue 1).
5. The person watching scientific movies is on the far left.
6. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person watching romance movies.

From clue 5, we know that the scientific genre must be in position 1.

Since the person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching spy movies (clues 1 and 4), and the person watching time-travel movies is also on the right of the person watching romance movies (clue 6), we can deduce the relative positions of these three genres. Let's denote the genres as follows:
- S for scientific
- T for time-travel
- R for romance
- C for crime
- S for spy (since there are two different genres named ""scientific"" and ""spy"")

Given that S (scientific) is on the far left, we have:
1. S

Now, let's place T (time-travel) and R (romance). Since T is on the left of S and R is on the right of T, we can place them next to each other with T on the left and R on the right:
1. S
2. T
3. R

Next, we use clue 3 which states that C (crime) is on the right of S. Since S is already in position 1, C must be in position 3 or further to the right. But we already have T and R in positions 2 and 3 respectively, so C must be in position 4:
1. S
2. T
3. R
4. C

Finally, using clue 2, we know that Z (zombie) is on the right of C. Therefore, Z must be in position 5:
1. S
2. T
3. R
4. C
5. Z

The only remaining genre is spy (S), which must be in position 6:
1. S
2. T
3. R
4. C
5. Z
6. S

So, the final solution is:

Lv1-1x6-5	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues.

1. **The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the mouse**.
2. **The owner of the dog is on the far right**.
3. **The owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the ferret**.
4. **The owner of the lizard is on the left of the owner of the mouse**.
5. **The owner of the lizard is on the far left**.

Let's start by placing the lizard and the dog since they have fixed positions:

- Lizard (L) is on the far left.
- Dog (D) is on the far right.

So, we can place these two:

| Pet   | Lizard |       |       |      | Mouse  | Dog  |

Next, we know that the owner of the mouse is to the right of the owner of the turtle (T). This means T must be placed before M.

- Mouse (M) is on the far right, so T must be somewhere between L and M.

Given that the lizard is also on the left of the mouse, T cannot be in position 2 or 3 because there would not be enough space for both L and M. Therefore, T must be in position 4.

Now our table looks like this:

| Pet   | Lizard |       | Turtle |      | Mouse  | Dog  |

We also know that the owner of the bird (B) is on the left of the owner of the ferret (F). Since B and F must be adjacent to each other and the only remaining positions are 1, 2, and 3, they must occupy these positions in order.

Given that the lizard is already in position 1, the only way to satisfy the condition that the bird is on the left of the ferret is to place them as follows:

| Pet   | Bird   | Ferret | Turtle |      | Mouse  | Dog  |

Thus, the final arrangement is:

```
| Pet   | Bird   | Ferret | Turtle | Mouse |        | Dog  |

Lv1-1x6-6	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching superhero movies is on the far left.
   - So, position 1 is ""superhero"".

2. **Clue 2:** The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching adventure movies.
   - This means if ""adventure"" is at position \(x\), ""horror"" must be at position \(x+1\).

3. **Clue 3:** The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching romance movies.
   - This means if ""horror"" is at position \(y\), ""romance"" must be at position \(y+1\) or further to the right.

4. **Clue 4:** The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person watching comedy movies.
   - This means if ""martial-arts"" is at position \(z\), ""comedy"" must be at position \(z+1\) or further to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.
   - This means if ""comedy"" is at position \(a\), ""adventure"" must be at position \(a+1\) or further to the right.

Let's start placing the genres based on these clues:

- From Clue 1, we know:
  ```
  | superhero |          |          |          |          |          |
  ```

- Let's denote the positions for ""adventure"", ""horror"", and ""romance"" as follows:
  - If ""adventure"" is at position \(x\), ""horror"" must be at position \(x+1\).
  - ""Romance"" must be to the right of ""horror"".

- Let's denote the positions for ""martial-arts"" and ""comedy"" as follows:
  - If ""martial-arts"" is at position \(z\), ""comedy"" must be at position \(z+1\) or further to the right.
  - ""Adventure"" must be to the right of ""comedy"".

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the remaining genres:

1. If ""adventure"" is at position 3 (since it has to be to the right of ""comedy""), then ""horror"" must be at position 4, and ""romance"" at position 5.
2. If ""martial-arts"" is at position 2, then ""comedy"" must be at position 3, but ""adventure"" is already at position 3, so this placement doesn't work.
3. Let's try ""adventure"" at position 4, then ""horror"" at position 5, and ""romance"" at position 6.
4. If ""martial-arts"" is at position 2, then ""comedy"" must be at position 3, which fits with ""adventure"" at position 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
```
| superhero | martial-arts | comedy | adventure | horror | romance |
```

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|               |     1     |      2       |   3    |     4     |   5    |    6    |

Lv1-1x6-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given clues to determine the correct order of the pets from left to right.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the lizard is on the far right (Position 6).
2. The owner of the ferret is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
3. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the fish.
4. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the owner of the fish.
5. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: First pet
- Position 2: Second pet
- Position 3: Third pet
- Position 4: Fourth pet
- Position 5: Fifth pet
- Position 6: Sixth pet (lizard)

Using these clues:

1. **Lizard is in position 6**:
   - Lizard = 6

2. **Turtle is on the left of the fish**:
   - Turtle < Fish

3. **Ferret is on the left of the hedgehog**:
   - Ferret < Hedgehog

4. **Lizard is on the right of the fish**:
   - Fish < Lizard (Fish must be in position 5)
   - Fish = 5

5. **Hedgehog is on the left of the chinchilla**:
   - Hedgehog < Chinchilla

Given that Fish is in position 5 and Lizard is in position 6, Turtle must be in position 4 because it is on the left of Fish.

Now we have:
- Turtle = 4
- Fish = 5
- Lizard = 6

Next, using clue 2 and 3:
- Since Turtle is in position 4 and Fish is in position 5, Ferret must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since Hedgehog is on the left of Chinchilla and Hedgehog cannot be in position 6, it can only be in position 3 if Ferret is in position 2.

Thus:
- Ferret = 2
- Hedgehog = 3
- Chinchilla = 4 (since Hedgehog < Chinchilla and Chinchilla cannot be in position 6)

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Turtle
- Position 2: Ferret
- Position 3: Hedgehog
- Position 4: Chinchilla
- Position 5: Fish
- Position 6: Lizard

| Music-Genre   | jazz | gospel | indie | classical | r&b     | salsa |
```

Here's how we can deduce this step-by-step:

1. **Salsa is on the far right**:
   - This means Salsa is in position 6.

2. **Gospel is on the left of Classical**:
   - Gospel and Classical must be adjacent with Gospel to the left of Classical.

3. **Indie is on the right of Jazz**:
   - Indie and Jazz must be adjacent with Indie to the right of Jazz.

4. **R&B is on the left of Gospel**:
   - R&B must be immediately to the left of Gospel.

5. **R&B is on the right of Indie**:
   - R&B must be immediately to the right of Indie.

By combining these clues, we can arrange the genres as follows:

- Since R&B is on the right of Indie (clue 5) and on the left of Gospel (clue 4), Indie, R&B, and Gospel must be in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
- Since Gospel is on the left of Classical (clue 2), Classical must be in position 6, which conflicts with Salsa being in position 6 (clue 1). Therefore, Classical must be in position 4, making Gospel in position 3 and R&B in position 5.
- Since Indie is on the right of Jazz (clue 3), Jazz must be in position 1, and Indie in position 3 (but Gospel is already there), so Indie must be in position 4, making Jazz in position 2.
- Finally, Salsa is in position 6.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- Position 1: Jazz
- Position 2: Gospel
- Position 3: Indie
- Position 4: Classical
- Position 5: R&B
- Position 6: Salsa

So the final solution is:

   - This means chess is in position 1.

2. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games.
   - Since chess is in position 1, video-games must be in position 2 or to the right of it.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.
   - This means singing must be in position 3 or to the right of video-games.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This means baking must be in position 4 or to the left of drawing.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This means puzzles must be in position 5 or to the left of baking.

Let's summarize the positions so far:
- Position 1: Chess (from Clue 2)
- Position 2: Video-games (must be after Chess from Clue 1)
- Position 3: Singing (must be after Video-games from Clue 3)
- Position 4: Baking (must be before Drawing from Clue 4)
- Position 5: Puzzles (must be before Baking from Clue 5)

Now we need to place drawing and puzzles in the remaining positions (6).

Since:
- Drawing must be to the right of Baking (Clue 4).
- Puzzles must be to the left of Baking (Clue 5).

The only possible positions for drawing and puzzles are 6 and 5 respectively.

So, the final arrangement is:

4. **Clue 4**: The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the trike.
5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the motorbike is on the far left.

Let's start with Clue 5:
- Motorbike (M) must be in position 1.

Next, using Clue 2:
- Airplane (A) must be to the left of Jet-ski (J).

Now, using Clue 1:
- Jet-ski (J) must be to the left of Subway (S).

Combining Clues 2 and 1:
- A -> J -> S

Since M is already in position 1, we can place A, J, and S as follows:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: J
- Position 4: S

Now, using Clue 3:
- Roller (R) is to the right of Motorbike (M). Since M is in position 1, R must be in position 5 or 6.

Using Clue 4:
- Airplane (A) is to the right of Trike (T). Since A is in position 2, T must be in position 4 or 5 or 6.

Since S is in position 4, T cannot be in position 4. Therefore, T must be in position 5 or 6. But since R must also be in position 5 or 6, and T and R cannot occupy the same position, we need to determine their exact positions.

Given that R must be to the right of M (position 1), and T must be to the right of A (position 2), the only logical positions for T and R are:
- Position 5: T
- Position 6: R
