Lv1-3x2-1	"Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step by step.

1. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the turkish.**
2. **The turkish is the person who's sport is golf.**

We need to fill in the table with the given constraints:

|               |    1    |       2       |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Beverage      |         |               |
| Nationality   |         |               |
| Sport         |         |               |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Sport for Person 2:**
   - From the second clue, the Turkish person's sport is golf.
   - Therefore, in row 3 (Sport), column 2, we can place ""golf"" for person 2.

2. **Determine the Beverage for Person 2:**
   - The Turkish person is in column 2.
   - According to the first clue, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the Turkish person.
   - This means the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in column 2.
   - Therefore, in row 1 (Beverage), column 2, we can place ""hot-chocolate"".

3. **Determine the Beverage for Person 1:**
   - Since person 2 is drinking hot-chocolate, person 1 must be drinking tea.
   - Therefore, in row 1 (Beverage), column 1, we can place ""tea"".

4. **Determine the Nationality for Person 1:**
   - The Turkish person is in column 2, so person 1 cannot be Turkish.
   - Therefore, person 1 must be Egyptian.
   - Therefore, in row 2 (Nationality), column 1, we can place ""egyptian"".

5. **Determine the Nationality for Person 2:**
   - Since person 1 is Egyptian, person 2 must be Turkish.
   - Therefore, in row 2 (Nationality), column 2, we can place ""turkish"".

6. **Determine the Sport for Person 1:**
   - Person 1 is not doing golf because the Turkish person is doing golf.
   - Therefore, person 1 must be doing biathlon.
   - Therefore, in row 3 (Sport), column 1, we can place ""biathlon"".

Now, let's put all this information into the table:

```
|               |    1    |       2       |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Beverage      |    tea  |    hot-chocolate   |
| Nationality   |  egyptian |    turkish     |
| Sport         |  biathlon |     golf      |
```

### Final Solution Table:

Lv1-3x2-2	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

We have the following information:
1. The people have 2 different hobbies: magic-tricks, singing.
2. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: adventure, martial-arts.
3. 2 different pets are kept: fish, goat.
4. The person whose hobby is singing is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.
5. The owner of the fish is on the far right.

Let's denote:
- H1 (Hobby 1) and H2 (Hobby 2)
- M1 (Movie-Genre 1) and M2 (Movie-Genre 2)
- P1 (Pet 1) and P2 (Pet 2)

From the given conditions:
- H1 = singing, H2 = magic-tricks
- M1 = adventure, M2 = martial-arts
- P1 = fish, P2 = goat
- The person with H1 (singing) is to the left of the person with M1 (adventure).
- The person with P1 (fish) is on the far right.

Given that the person with fish is on the far right, we can place P2 (goat) on the left side. This means:

| Hobby         |      1       |      2       |
| Movie-Genre   |              |              |
| Pet           |              | goat         |

Now, we need to place the hobbies and movie genres accordingly. Since the person with singing (H1) is to the left of the person with adventure (M1), and since the person with fish (P1) is on the far right, the only way to satisfy all these conditions is:

- Person 1 has singing (H1) and either adventure or martial-arts (M1 or M2).
- Person 2 has magic-tricks (H2) and the remaining movie genre (M2 or M1).

Since the person with fish is on the far right, the person with goat must be on the left. Therefore, the configuration is:

| Hobby         |      1       |      2       |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure    | martial-arts |
| Pet           | fish         | goat         |

So, the final solution table is:

```
| Hobby         |      1       |      2       |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure    | martial-arts |
| Pet           | fish         | goat         |

Lv1-3x2-3	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The dressmaker is on the far left.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the tram is on the left of the owner of the mouse.

Let's fill in the table based on these clues:

|             |     1      |      2      |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Job**     | Dressmaker | Electrician |
| **Pet**     | Mouse      | Pony        |
| **Transport**| Bus       | Tram       |

Now, let's verify the clues with this arrangement:
- **Clue 1:** The dressmaker (Job 1) is on the far left, which matches.
- **Clue 2:** The person driving the tram (Transport 2) is on the right side, and the owner of the mouse (Pet 1) is on the left side, so the tram driver is indeed to the right of the mouse owner, which matches.

Thus, the solution fits all the given clues. Here is the final solution table:

```
|             |     1      |      2      |

Lv1-3x2-4	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
2. The person who's hobby is gardening is the person drinking Fanta.

### Analysis:

#### Step 1: Identify the person with the hobby of gardening and their beverage.
- From clue 2, we know that the person with the hobby of gardening drinks Fanta.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions for the hobby and beverage.
- Since the person with the hobby of gardening is on the right (based on clue 1), the person with the hobby of camping must be on the left.
- Therefore, the left column will have the hobby of camping, and the right column will have the hobby of gardening.
- This also means the left column will have the beverage of Mirinda (since the person with the hobby of gardening drinks Fanta).

So, the table looks like this so far:
```
|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |   Mirinda  |   Fanta   |
| Hobby       |   Camping  |  Gardening|
```

#### Step 3: Determine the transport.
- From clue 1, the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
- Therefore, the person in the first column drives the helicopter, and the person in the second column uses the roller.

So, the final table is:
```
|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |   Mirinda  |   Fanta   |
| Hobby       |   Camping  |  Gardening|
| Transport   |  Helicopter|    Roller |
```

### Final Solution Table:

Lv1-3x2-5	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. The people have 2 different hobbies: board-games, traveling.
2. They keep 2 different pets: frog, guinea-pig.
3. They use 2 different means of transport: motorbike, quad-bike.
4. The owner of the guinea-pig is the person driving the quad-bike.
5. The owner of the frog is on the left of the person whose hobby is board-games.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the owner of the guinea-pig and the quad-bike.
From clue 4, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig drives the quad-bike. This gives us the following initial setup:

|             |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby       |           |             |
| Pet         | Guinea-pig|             |
| Transport   | Quad-bike |             |

#### Step 2: Determine the owner of the frog.
From clue 5, we know that the owner of the frog is on the left of the person whose hobby is board-games. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 1 (driving the quad-bike), the owner of the frog must be in position 2.

So, the owner of the frog has the hobby of board-games.

|             |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby       | Board-games| Traveling   |
| Pet         | Guinea-pig| Frog        |
| Transport   | Quad-bike | Motorbike  |

#### Step 3: Verify all clues are satisfied.
- Clue 4: The owner of the guinea-pig (position 1) is driving the quad-bike. ✔️
- Clue 5: The owner of the frog (position 2) is on the left of the person whose hobby is board-games. ✔️

All clues are satisfied with the current arrangement.

Lv1-3x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the information and constraints provided:

1. There are two people.
2. Each person has:
   - A hobby (hiking or singing)
   - A job (analyst or bartender)
   - A preferred sport (basketball or skiing)
3. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball.
4. The analyst is on the far right.

Given these constraints, we can deduce the following:

- Since the analyst is on the far right, the analyst must be in position 2 for both job and hobby.
- This means the other person (position 1) must be the bartender.
- Given that the person with the hobby of singing is on the left of the person with the sport of basketball, the person with the hobby of singing must be in position 1, and the person with the sport of basketball must be in position 2.

Now, let's assign the hobbies, jobs, and sports accordingly:

- Position 1 (left):
  - Job: Bartender
  - Hobby: Singing
  - Sport: (Not yet determined, but it cannot be basketball as the person to the right has that sport)

- Position 2 (right):
  - Job: Analyst
  - Hobby: (Not yet determined, but it cannot be singing as the person to the left has that hobby)
  - Sport: Basketball

Since the only sports left are skiing and basketball, and the person with the sport of basketball is in position 2, the remaining sport (skiing) must be assigned to the person in position 1.

So, the final assignments are:
- Position 1 (Bartender, Singing, Skiing)
- Position 2 (Analyst, Hiking, Basketball)

Now, let's fill in the table:

```
|         |     1     |     2      |

Lv1-3x2-7	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step and then present the final solution.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Information:**
   - There are two people.
   - Each has 2 different hobbies: cooking, skydiving.
   - Each has 2 different sports: sailing, skateboarding.
   - Each uses 2 different means of transport: quad-bike, roller.
   - The person whose sport is skateboarding is to the right of the person whose hobby is cooking.
   - The person using the quad-bike is on the far left.

2. **Assign Positions:**
   - Since the person using the quad-bike is on the far left, we can place them in position 1.
   - This leaves position 2 for the other person.

3. **Determine Hobbies:**
   - We know that the person with the hobby of cooking must be to the left of the person with the hobby of skydiving (since the person with skateboarding is to the right of the person with cooking).
   - Therefore, the person in position 1 (quad-bike) must have the hobby of cooking.

4. **Determine Sports:**
   - The person in position 2 (roller) must have the hobby of skydiving because the person with cooking is to the left.
   - Since the person with skateboarding is to the right of the person with cooking, the person in position 2 (roller) cannot have skateboarding as their sport.
   - Thus, the person in position 1 (quad-bike) must have the sport of skateboarding.

5. **Determine Transport:**
   - The person in position 1 (quad-bike) already has skateboarding as their sport.
   - The person in position 2 (roller) already has skydiving as their hobby.
   - Therefore, the person in position 1 (quad-bike) must use the quad-bike, and the person in position 2 (roller) must use the roller.

Lv1-3x2-8	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking tea is the person whose sport is rowing.
2. The American is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing.

### Table Layout:
|               |     1     |    2     |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Beverage      |           |          |
| Nationality   |           |          |
| Sport         |           |          |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1: The person drinking tea is the person whose sport is rowing.**
   - This means that the beverage ""tea"" and the sport ""rowing"" must be in the same column.
   
2. **Clue 2: The American is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing.**
   - This means the American (Nationality) must be in column 2 if the sport is surfing in column 1 or vice versa.

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues:

- Since the person drinking tea is the person whose sport is rowing, we can place ""tea"" and ""rowing"" in the same column. Let's assume ""tea"" is in column 1 and ""rowing"" is in column 1 for now.

- The American cannot be in column 1 because the American is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing. Therefore, the American must be in column 2.

- If the American is in column 2, then the sport in column 1 must be surfing (since the American is to the right of the person whose sport is surfing).

- Now, we have:
  - Column 1: Surfing, Tea
  - Column 2: American

- The only remaining nationality is Malaysian, which must be in column 1 since American is in column 2.

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |     1     |    2     |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Beverage      | Tea       |          |

Lv1-3x2-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step to determine the correct placement in the table.

1. **Identify the preferences:**
   - Movie-Genres: Thriller, Time-travel
   - Music-Genres: Indie, Punk
   - Transport: Taxi, Train

2. **Analyze the clues:**
   - Clue 1: The fan of punk is on the right of the person driving the train.
   - Clue 2: The person watching thriller movies is the person driving the taxi.

3. **Determine the seating arrangement based on Clue 2:**
   - Since the person watching thriller movies is the one driving the taxi, we can place ""Thriller"" under ""Movie-Genre"" and ""Taxi"" under ""Transport"".
   - This also means that the person watching time-travel movies must be on the right (since there are only two genres).

4. **Determine the music genre based on Clue 1:**
   - The fan of punk is on the right of the person driving the train.
   - Therefore, the person driving the train cannot be the fan of punk, so the fan of punk must be the one watching time-travel movies.
   - This places ""Punk"" under ""Music-Genre"" and ""Train"" under ""Transport"".

5. **Finalize the table:**
   - We now know:
     - Movie-Genre: Thriller, Time-travel
     - Music-Genre: Indie, Punk
     - Transport: Taxi, Train
   - Placing these in the table:

Lv1-3x2-10	"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- There are two different beverages: juice and lemonade.
- There are two different movie genres: adventure and scientific.
- There are two different means of transport: airplane and bike.
- The person watching scientific movies is the person drinking lemonade.
- The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person driving the bike.

Let's denote:
- Person 1 as the left person and Person 2 as the right person.
- Beverage for Person 1: B1
- Beverage for Person 2: B2
- Movie Genre for Person 1: MG1
- Movie Genre for Person 2: MG2
- Transport for Person 1: T1
- Transport for Person 2: T2

From the clues:
1. MG2 (Person 2) = ""scientific"" because the person watching scientific movies is the person drinking lemonade.
2. B2 = ""lemonade"" (from clue 1).
3. B1 = ""juice"" (since there are only two beverages and one is lemonade).

Now we need to determine the movie genre for Person 1 (MG1) and the transport for both persons (T1 and T2).

4. Since B2 (lemonade) is on the left of T2 (the person driving the bike), and B2 is already assigned to Person 2, then T1 must be the person driving the bike. So, T1 = ""bike"".

5. This leaves T2 = ""airplane"" (since there are only two means of transport).

6. Now, since B1 = ""juice"", and we need to assign a movie genre to Person 1, it must be ""adventure"" because Person 2 is watching ""scientific"" movies.

So, we have:
- B1 = ""juice""
- B2 = ""lemonade""
- MG1 = ""adventure""
- MG2 = ""scientific""
- T1 = ""bike""
- T2 = ""airplane""

Putting this into the table:
