Lv1-2x2-1	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step based on the given conditions.

We have:
- Two movie genres: epic and musical.
- Two modes of transport: subway and trike.

The condition provided is:
- The person watching epic movies is on the left of the person driving the subway.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1 (leftmost) and Position 2 (rightmost).

Now, we need to assign the movie genres and modes of transport to these positions while satisfying the condition.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1:**
   - Since the person watching epic movies must be on the left, the first position can either be ""epic"" or ""subway"".

2. **Position 2:**
   - The second position will be the remaining genre and mode of transport.

Let's start with the assumption that Position 1 is for ""epic"":
- If Position 1 is ""epic"", then Position 2 must be ""musical"".
- For the transport, since the person driving the subway must be on the right, Position 2 cannot be ""subway"". Therefore, Position 2 must be ""trike"".

So, the only valid assignment is:
- Position 1: epic
- Position 2: musical and trike

This satisfies all the given conditions.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1   |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   | epic  | musical |
| Transport     |       | trike   |
```

Here, the person watching ""epic"" movies is on the left, and the person using the ""trike"" is on the right, which fulfills the condition that the person watching ""epic"" movies is on the left of the person using the ""subway""."	{'movie-genre': ['epic', 'musical'], 'transport': ['', 'trike']}	True	2	False
Lv1-2x2-2	"Sure, let's solve the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

We have two types of food: eggplant and kiwi.
We have two types of sports: skateboarding and snowboarding.

From the given clue:
1. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding.

Let's denote:
- Person 1 (left) and Person 2 (right)
- Food options: E (eggplant), K (kiwi)
- Sport options: S (skateboarding), X (snowboarding)

Given the clue, we can set up the following possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1:
- If Person 1 does skateboarding (S), then Person 2 must be eating kiwi (K).
- This satisfies the condition that the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person doing skateboarding.

So, one possible arrangement is:
- Person 1: skateboarding (S)
- Person 2: eating kiwi (K)

### Scenario 2:
- If Person 1 does not do skateboarding (i.e., they do snowboarding (X)), then Person 2 must be eating kiwi (K).
- However, this would violate the condition because the person eating kiwi would be on the left of the person doing snowboarding, which contradicts the given clue.

Thus, Scenario 2 is invalid.

Therefore, the only valid scenario is:
- Person 1: skateboarding (S)
- Person 2: eating kiwi (K)

Now, let's fill in the table with the valid solution:

```
|         |       1       |      2       |
| Food    |     K (Kiwi)  |     E (Eggplant) |
| Sport   |     S (Skateboarding) |     X (Snowboarding) |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|         |       1       |      2       |
| Food    |     K (Kiwi)  |     E (Eggplant) |
| Sport   |     S (Skateboarding) |     X (Snowboarding) |

Lv1-2x2-3	"Sure, let's solve the logic puzzle step by step.

We have:
- Two beverages: milk and soy-milk
- Two foods: orange and spinach
- The condition: the person drinking milk is on the right of the person eating spinach

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Beverage (can be either soy-milk or milk)
- Position 2: Food (can be either orange or spinach)

Given the condition that the person drinking milk is on the right of the person eating spinach, we can deduce the following:

1. If the person at position 1 is drinking milk, then the person at position 2 must be eating spinach.
2. If the person at position 1 is drinking soy-milk, then the person at position 2 can either be eating spinach or orange.

Since there are only two beverages and two foods, and we need to satisfy the given condition, the only possible arrangement is:
- Position 1: Soy-milk
- Position 2: Spinach

This is because if position 1 were milk, then position 2 would have to be spinach, but this doesn't fit our remaining options for foods (orange is left).

So, the final solution table is:

```
|            |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage   | soy-milk |        |
| Food       |          | spinach|

Lv1-2x2-4	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues.

We have:
- Two nationalities: French and Indonesian.
- Two sports: Cycling and Parkour.

Clue: ""the Indonesian is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.""

This means:
- If the person who does cycling is in position 1, then the Indonesian must be in position 2.
- If the person who does parkour is in position 1, then the Indonesian must be in position 2.

Let's denote:
- F for French
- I for Indonesian
- C for Cycling
- P for Parkour

Given the clue, we can set up the possible configurations:

1. If the person doing Cycling (C) is in position 1, then the Indonesian (I) must be in position 2.
2. If the person doing Parkour (P) is in position 1, then the Indonesian (I) must be in position 2.

So, we have two scenarios to consider:

### Scenario 1:
- Position 1: French (F), Sport: Cycling (C)
- Position 2: Indonesian (I), Sport: Parkour (P)

### Scenario 2:
- Position 1: Indonesian (I), Sport: Parkour (P)
- Position 2: French (F), Sport: Cycling (C)

Both scenarios satisfy the given clue. However, since we need to fill both nationality and sport columns, let's present the final table with one of these scenarios:

```markdown

Lv1-2x2-5	"Certainly! Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step by step.

We have:
- Two beverages: hot-chocolate and sprite.
- Two movie genres: crime and horror.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching crime movies.

Given these constraints, we can deduce the following:

1. There are two rows for beverages (hot-chocolate and sprite) and two columns for movie genres (crime and horror).
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate must be to the left of the person watching crime movies.

Let's fill in the table based on this information:

```
|               |       1       |   2    |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | sprite |
| Movie-Genre   | horror        | crime  |
```

Hereâ€™s how we arrived at this solution:
- Since the person drinking hot-chocolate must be on the left of the person watching crime movies, we place ""hot-chocolate"" in the first column and ""sprite"" in the second column.
- Similarly, we place ""horror"" in the first row and ""crime"" in the second row.

This satisfies the condition that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching crime movies.

Final solution:

```

Lv1-2x2-6	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

We have two columns (1 and 2) for both Food and Transport. We need to place ""apple"" or ""asparagus"" in the Food column and ""helicopter"" or ""taxi"" in the Transport column, while satisfying the given condition:

1. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating asparagus.

Let's denote:
- A = Apple
- P = Asparagus
- H = Helicopter
- T = Taxi

Given the condition, we can infer that if someone is eating asparagus, the person driving the taxi must be in the second column (column 2).

So, let's consider the possible placements:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Case 1: Asparagus in Column 1**
   - If Asparagus is in column 1, then the person driving the taxi must be in column 2.
   - Therefore, Food (Column 1) = Asparagus
   - Food (Column 2) = Apple
   - Transport (Column 1) = Helicopter
   - Transport (Column 2) = Taxi

2. **Case 2: Asparagus in Column 2**
   - If Asparagus is in column 2, then the person driving the taxi must be in column 1.
   - This would violate the condition since the person driving the taxi cannot be on the left of the person eating asparagus.
   - Therefore, this case is not valid.

From the above analysis, only Case 1 is valid.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|             |     1      |   2   |
| Food        | Asparagus  | Apple |
| Transport   | Helicopter | Taxi  |
```

This configuration satisfies the condition that the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating asparagus.

```markdown
|             |     1      |   2   |
| Food        | Asparagus  | Apple |
| Transport   | Helicopter | Taxi  |

Lv1-2x2-7	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

We have:
- Two beverages: almond-milk and soy-milk.
- Two hobbies: dancing and writing.

The clue provided is: ""the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.""

Let's denote the two columns as follows:
- Column 1: The person with the hobby.
- Column 2: The person with the beverage.

Given the clue, we can deduce that if someone's hobby is writing, then the person drinking almond-milk must be in the column to their left. This means:

1. If the person in Column 1 has the hobby ""writing,"" then the person in Column 2 must be drinking almond-milk.
2. Therefore, the person in Column 2 cannot be drinking almond-milk if they have the hobby ""dancing.""

So, let's place the drinks and hobbies accordingly:

|            |      1      |    2     |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Beverage   | almond-milk | soy-milk  |
| Hobby      | writing     | dancing  |

This arrangement satisfies the given clue because the person with the hobby ""writing"" is indeed on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-2x2-8	"Sure, let's analyze the given information and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

We have two rows (Beverage and Job) and two columns (1 and 2). We need to place the following:

- Two different beverages: cola and mirinda
- Two different jobs: firefighter and writer

The clue provided is:
- The writer is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: (B1, J1)
- Position 2: (B2, J2)

From the clue, we can deduce that:
- If the person in position 1 drinks mirinda, then the person in position 2 must be a writer.
- If the person in position 2 drinks mirinda, then the person in position 1 must be a writer.

Given these constraints, let's consider the possible placements:

### Case 1: Position 1 drinks Mirinda
- B1 = Mirinda
- J1 = Writer (since the writer is to the right of the person drinking mirinda)
- This leaves Position 2 for cola and firefighter.
- B2 = Cola
- J2 = Firefighter

This gives us:
|            |      1      |   2    |
| Beverage   | Mirinda     | Cola   |
| Job        | Writer      | Firefighter |

### Case 2: Position 2 drinks Mirinda
- B2 = Mirinda
- J2 = Writer (since the writer is to the right of the person drinking mirinda)
- This leaves Position 1 for cola and firefighter.
- B1 = Cola
- J1 = Firefighter

This gives us:

Lv1-2x2-9	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

We have the following information:
- There are two nationalities: Brazilian and Colombian.
- There are two pets: Ferret and Mouse.
- The Brazilian is to the right of the owner of the Ferret.

Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), we can deduce the following:

1. Since the Brazilian must be to the right of the owner of the Ferret, the only possible arrangement is:
   - Position 1: Colombian
   - Position 2: Brazilian

2. Therefore, the owner of the Ferret must be in position 1 (Colombian) and the Brazilian must own the Mouse.

So, the final solution table looks like this:
