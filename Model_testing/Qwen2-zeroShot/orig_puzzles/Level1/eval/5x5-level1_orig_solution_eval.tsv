    - If the chinchilla is in position 1, the rock-climber must be in position 2.
    - If the chinchilla is in position 2, the rock-climber must be in position 3.

    Since the rock-climber cannot be in position 3 (because the dressmaker is there), the chinchilla must be in position 1 and the rock-climber must be in position 2.
