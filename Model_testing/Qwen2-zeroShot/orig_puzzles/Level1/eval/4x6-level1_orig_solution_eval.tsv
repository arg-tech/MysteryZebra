### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **From clue 5, the person whose sport is handball is on the far left (position 1).**
2. **From clue 4, the fan of folk is on the far right (position 6).**

#### Step 2: Use Clues 5, 6, and 13
- **Clue 5:** The person eating carrot is on the left of the person driving the car.
- **Clue 6:** The Pakistani is on the left of the Canadian.
- **Clue 13:** The person eating carrot is the person driving the roller.

Given that the Canadian is in Position 4:
- **Pakistani** must be in Position 3 (since they are on the left of the Canadian).
- **Carrot** is driven by the person in Position 3, which is the Pakistani.

Thus, **Position 3** = **Pakistani**, **Roller**.

#### Step 3: Use Clues 1, 2, 7, and 17
- **Clue 1:** The person eating avocado is on the right of the person driving the subway.
- **Clue 2:** The Chinese is on the right of the fan of disco.
- **Clue 7:** The fan of D&B is on the right of the Chinese.
- **Clue 17:** The fan of disco is on the right of the person eating carrot.

Since the person eating carrot is in Position 3 (Pakistani):
- **Disco fan** must be in Position 4 (Canadian), and **D&B fan** must be in Position 5.

Thus, **Position 4** = **Canadian**, **Potato**; **Position 5** = **D&B fan**.

#### Step 4: Use Clues 3, 8, and 12
- **Clue 3:** The person driving the train is the Italian.
- **Clue 8:** The fan of disco is the Canadian.
- **Clue 12:** The fan of blues is on the right of the Canadian.

Since the Canadian is in Position 4:
- **Blues fan** must be in Position 6.

Thus, **Position 6** = **Blues fan**.

#### Step 5: Use Clues 9, 11, and 15
- **Clue 9:** The person eating avocado is the fan of R&B.
- **Clue 11:** The person eating cabbage is on the left of the person driving the roller.
- **Clue 15:** The person driving the tram is on the left of the person eating eggplant.

Since the person eating cabbage is in Position 1:
- **Cabbage** is in Position 1.
- **Tram driver** must be in Position 2.
- **Eggplant** must be in Position 5 (since the person driving the tram is on the left of the person eating eggplant, and the person driving the tram is in Position 2).

Thus, **Position 2** = **Tram driver**; **Position 5** = **Eggplant**.

#### Step 6: Use Clues 14 and 16
- **Clue 14:** The person driving the scooter is the fan of trance.
- **Clue 16:** The British is the person driving the scooter.

Thus, **Position 1** = **Cabbage**; **Position 6** = **Blues fan**; **Position 2** = **Tram driver**; **Position 3** = **Pakistani**, **Roller**; **Position 4** = **Canadian**, **Potato**; **Position 5** = **Eggplant**; **Position 6** = **British**, **Scooter**, **Trance fan**.
