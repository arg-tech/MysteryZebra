   ```

2. **Clue 12:** The person eating cauliflower is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
   - Since the cat owner (Mechanic) is in position 1, the next person must be eating cauliflower.
   - Fishing cannot be in position 2 since the mechanic is the person with the hobby of card games, which means the hobbyist for fishing must be in position 3 or later.
   ```
   | Pet           |      1      |     2     |    3    |      4      |       5        |
   | Food          |   cauliflower|           |         |             |                |

   ```

4. **Clue 2:** The owner of the rat is on the left of the owner of the mouse.
   - The next two positions after the cat owner (Mechanic) and the person eating cauliflower (Hobby: Card-games) must be the owners of the rat and the mouse.
