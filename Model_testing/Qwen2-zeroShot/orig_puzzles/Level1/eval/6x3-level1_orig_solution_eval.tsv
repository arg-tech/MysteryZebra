8. **The person eating tomato is in the middle.**
9. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking sprite.**
10. **The person whose sport is climbing is on the far right.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Tram Driver
From clue 4, the person driving the tram is on the far right.
From clue 1, the fan of indie is driving the tram.
So, the rightmost column (3) is:
- **Tram**: (driven by the fan of indie)
- **Indie**: (music genre)
- **Apple**: (food)

#### Step 2: Positioning the Climber
From clue 10, the person whose sport is climbing is on the far right.
Since the rightmost column is already occupied by the fan of indie, the person whose sport is climbing must be in the middle or left.
Since the fan of indie is already in the rightmost column, the person whose sport is climbing must be in the middle (2).

#### Step 3: Positioning the Hot-Chocolate Drinker
From clue 9, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
From clue 7, the owner of the chinchilla is the person drinking sprite.
So, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the leftmost column (1).
From clue 7, the owner of the chinchilla drinks sprite and is in the rightmost column (3).
Thus, the leftmost column (1) is:
- **Hot-Chocolate**: (beverage)
- **Climbing**: (sport)
- **Watermelon**: (food, since it's the only one left for the middle)

#### Step 4: Positioning the Sprite Drinker
From clue 7, the owner of the chinchilla drinks sprite and is in the rightmost column (3).
Thus, the rightmost column (3) is:
- **Sprite**: (beverage)
- **Chinchilla**: (pet)
- **Apple**: (food, since it's already taken by the fan of indie)

#### Step 5: Positioning the Lemonade Drinker
From clue 3, the fan of gospel is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
From clue 5, the fan of indie is the person eating apple, so the fan of gospel cannot be eating apple.
From clue 8, the person eating tomato is in the middle.
Thus, the middle column (2) is:
- **Lemonade**: (beverage)
- **Water-Polo**: (sport)
- **Tomato**: (food)

#### Step 6: Positioning the Remaining People
From clue 6, the person driving the boat is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the leftmost column (1), the person driving the boat must be in the middle (2).
Thus, the middle column (2) is:
- **Lemonade**: (beverage)
- **Water-Polo**: (sport)
- **Tomato**: (food)

From clue 2, the person whose sport is weightlifting is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.
Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the leftmost column (1), the person whose sport is weightlifting must be in the middle (2).
Thus, the leftmost column (1) is:
- **Hot-Chocolate**: (beverage)
- **Weightlifting**: (sport)
- **Watermelon**: (food)

Finally, from clue 6, the person driving the boat is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the leftmost column (1), the person driving the boat must be in the middle (2).
Thus, the leftmost column (1) is:
- **Hot-Chocolate**: (beverage)
- **Weightlifting**: (sport)
- **Watermelon**: (food)

This is the final solution to the puzzle."	{'beverage': ['hot-chocolate', 'lemonade', 'sprite'], 'food': ['watermelon', 'tomato', 'apple'], 'music-genre': ['weightlifting', 'water-polo', 'indie'], 'pet': ['rabbit', 'chinchilla', 'turtle'], 'sport': ['climbing', 'water-polo', 'weightlifting'], 'transport': ['boat', 'motorbike', 'tram']}	True	7	False
Lv1-6x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the correct cells in the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The electrician is the turkish**.
2. **The malaysian is on the left of the person watching satire movies**.
3. **The electrician is on the left of the software-developer**.
4. **The person who's sport is handball is on the far left**.
5. **The person who's hobby is camping is the person driving the motorbike**.
6. **The turkish is on the left of the person watching zombie movies**.
7. **The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies**.
8. **The electrician is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking**.
9. **The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place the Electrician (Turkish)
From Clue 1, the electrician is the Turkish. From Clue 6, the Turkish is on the left of the person watching zombie movies. So, the Turkish cannot be in position 3.

- **Position 1: Turkish (Electrician)**

#### Step 2: Place the Handball Player
From Clue 4, the person whose sport is handball is on the far left. So, the handball player must be in position 1.

- **Position 1: Handball**

Since the handball player is in position 1, the Turkish (electrician) cannot be in position 1, which is already occupied by the handball player. This confirms that the Turkish (electrician) is in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Place the Malayan
From Clue 2, the malaysian is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the Turkish (electrician) is in position 1, the malaysian must be in position 2 or 3.

- **Position 2: Malaysian**

#### Step 4: Place the Software-Developer
From Clue 3, the electrician (Turkish) is on the left of the software-developer. Since the electrician is in position 2, the software-developer must be in position 3.

- **Position 3: Software-Developer**

#### Step 5: Place the Satire Movie Watcher
From Clue 2, the malaysian is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the malaysian is in position 2, the person watching satire movies must be in position 3, but we already know the software-developer is in position 3.

This means the satire movie watcher must be in position 3, but since the software-developer is there, it must be the Turkish (electrician).

- **Position 3: Turkish (Electrician)**

This conflicts with our earlier placement. Let's re-evaluate:
- **Position 2: Malaysian**
- **Position 3: Software-Developer**

From Clue 6, the Turkish (electrician) is on the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the Turkish (electrician) is in position 2, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 3, which is the software-developer.

- **Position 3: Software-Developer (Zombie Movies)**

Now, the person watching satire movies must be in position 1.

- **Position 1: Malaysian (Satire Movies)**

#### Step 6: Place the Comedy Movie Watcher
From Clue 7, the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the person watching satire movies is in position 1, the person watching comedy movies must be in position 2.

- **Position 2: Malaysian (Comedy Movies)**

#### Step 7: Place the Camping Hobbier
From Clue 5, the person whose hobby is camping is the person driving the motorbike. Since the Malaysian (position 2) is the one with the hobby of camping, the Malaysian drives the motorbike.

- **Position 2: Malaysian (Comedy Movies, Motorbike, Camping)**

#### Step 8: Place the Hiking Hobbier
From Clue 8, the electrician is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the electrician is in position 2, the person with the hobby of hiking must be in position 1.

- **Position 1: Handball (Comedy Movies, Motorbike, Camping)**

#### Step 9: Place the Rugby Player
From Clue 9, the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. The person with the sport of rugby must be in position 1, and the jet-ski driver must be in position 2.

- **Position 1: Handball (Comedy Movies, Motorbike, Camping)**
- **Position 2: Malaysian (Comedy Movies, Motorbike, Camping)**
- **Position 3: Software-Developer (Zombie Movies, Rugby, Jet-Ski)**

#### Step 10: Fill in the Remaining Hobbies, Jobs, and Sports
- **Hobby:**
  - Position 1: Camping (Motorbike)
  - Position 2: Hiking (Motorbike)
  - Position 3: Fishing (Jet-Ski)

- **Job:**

Lv1-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The American is on the far left.**
   - This places the American in position 1.
   
2. **The owner of the lizard is the person watching documentary movies.**
   - Since the American is in position 1, the person in position 1 cannot be the owner of the lizard or the one watching documentaries.

3. **The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the German.**
   - The German cannot be in position 3 (since there's no position to the right), so the German must be in position 1 or 2.
   - If the German were in position 1, then the American would have to be in position 2, but that would violate the rule that the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the German. So, the German must be in position 2.

4. **The person driving the train is on the left of the person watching western movies.**
   - Since the American is in position 1, the person driving the train can only be in position 1 or 2. If the person driving the train were in position 1, they would be the American, which doesn't fit any other clues. Therefore, the person driving the train must be in position 2, making the American in position 1.

5. **The owner of the rat is the person driving the bus.**
   - Since the person driving the train is in position 2, the person driving the bus must be in position 3.

6. **The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike.**
   - Since the American is in position 1, the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 1 or 2. If it were in position 2, the person with the hobby of cooking would have to be the person driving the train, which we already know is the American. Therefore, the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 1, which is the American.

7. **The Canadian is the videographer.**
   - Since the American is in position 1 and has the hobby of cooking, the Canadian must be in position 3 as the videographer.

8. **The person driving the train is on the left of the person watching western movies.**
   - We already determined that the person driving the train is in position 2. Therefore, the person watching western movies must be in position 3.

9. **The owner of the guinea-pig is the person watching western movies.**
   - From clue 7, the person watching western movies is in position 3, and since the Canadian is in position 3, the owner of the guinea-pig must be the Canadian.

10. **The owner of the lizard is the person watching documentary movies.**
    - Since the Canadian is in position 3 and watches western movies, the person in position 3 cannot be the owner of the lizard. Therefore, the person in position 2 must be the owner of the lizard.

11. **The owner of the rat is the person driving the bus.**
    - We already determined that the person driving the bus is in position 3, so the owner of the rat must be in position 3, which is the Canadian.

12. **The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the dressmaker.**
    - Since the American has the hobby of cooking, the person with the hobby of skydiving cannot be the American. The Canadian has the hobby of skydiving because the person with the hobby of skydiving must be on the right of the dressmaker, and the Canadian is in position 3.

13. **The person with the hobby of video-games is the German.**
    - Since the American has the hobby of cooking, the German must have the hobby of video-games.

3. **Job column:**
   - 1 = _, 2 = videographer, 3 = accountant
   - The Videographer is on the right of the owner of the Rabbit, and the person eating Broccoli is on the left of the Videographer.

Lv1-6x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements accordingly. Let's break down the clues step by step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person eating peach.
2. The teacher is on the right of the person driving the scooter.
3. The person whose sport is lacrosse is on the left of the fisherman.
4. The person driving the car is on the left of the person eating garlic.
5. The person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.
6. The fisherman is on the left of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
7. The fan of rock is on the far right.
8. The fan of ambient is in the middle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the music genres
- From clue 7, the fan of rock is on the far right (position 3).
- From clue 8, the fan of ambient is in the middle (position 2).

So, the order of music genres is:
- Position 1: Blues
- Position 2: Ambient
- Position 3: Rock

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of the sports
- From clue 3, the person whose sport is lacrosse is on the left of the fisherman.
- From clue 6, the fisherman is on the left of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.

This gives us:
- Position 1: Lacrosse
- Position 2: Fisherman
- Position 3: Ice-Hockey

#### Step 3: Determine the positions of the jobs
- From clue 2, the teacher is on the right of the person driving the scooter.
- We don't yet know the exact positions of the jobs, but we can start placing them based on other clues.

#### Step 4: Determine the positions of the food
- From clue 4, the person driving the car is on the left of the person eating garlic.
- From clue 5, the person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.

We need to determine which person is watching mystery movies and eating garlic. Let's assume the order for now and check consistency.

#### Step 5: Determine the positions of the movies
- From clue 1, the person watching satire movies is on the right of the person eating peach.
- From clue 5, the person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.

Let's try to place these elements step by step:

1. Assume the person watching mystery movies is in position 1.
2. Then the person eating garlic must be in position 2.
3. The person watching satire movies must be in position 3.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Mystery
- Position 2: Garlic
- Position 3: Satire

#### Step 6: Finalize the table with all information
- From clue 4, the person driving the car is on the left of the person eating garlic, so the person driving the car must be in position 1.
- From clue 2, the teacher is on the right of the person driving the scooter, so the teacher must be in position 3.
- From clue 6, the fisherman is on the left of the person whose sport is ice-hockey, so the fisherman must be in position 1.

Finally, let's place everything:
- Position 1: Car (driving the car)
- Position 2: Peach (eating peach)
- Position 3: Helicopter (driving the scooter)

Now we have the final table:

```
|               |    1     |       2       |     3      |
| Food          |  Peach   |       -       |     -      |
| Job           |  Teacher |       -       |     -      |
| Movie-Genre   |  Mystery |       -       |     Satire |
| Music-Genre   |  Blues   |       -       |     Rock   |
| Sport         |  Lacrosse|       -       |     Ice-Hockey |
| Transport     |  Car     |       -       |     Helicopter |
```

Since we still need to fill in the blanks, let's assume the remaining elements:
- The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person eating peach, so the person watching satire movies must be in position 3.
- The person driving the scooter is the teacher, so the person driving the scooter must be in position 3.
- The person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching mystery movies, so the person eating garlic must be in position 2.

Final solution:

```
|               |    1     |       2       |     3      |
| Food          |  Peach   |       Garlic  |     -      |
| Job           |  Teacher |       -       |     -      |
| Movie-Genre   |  Mystery |       -       |     Satire |
| Music-Genre   |  Blues   |       -       |     Rock   |
| Sport         |  Lacrosse|       -       |     Ice-Hockey |
| Transport     |  Car     |       -       |     Helicopter |
```

Since the remaining positions need to be filled with the remaining food, job, and transport options, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1     |       2       |     3      |
| Food          |  Peach   |       Garlic  |     Cranberry  |
| Job           |  Teacher |       Lawyer  |     Fisherman |
| Movie-Genre   |  Mystery |       -       |     Satire   |
| Music-Genre   |  Blues   |       -       |     Rock     |
| Sport         |  Lacrosse|       -       |     Ice-Hockey |
