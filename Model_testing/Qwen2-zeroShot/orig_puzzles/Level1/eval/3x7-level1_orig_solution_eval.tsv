### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 9:
- The person driving the skateboard (clue 6) is the person who's sport is handball (clue 9).

#### Clue 6 & 8:
- The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the van (clue 8).
- The person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the skateboard (clue 8).

So, we have:
```
[Skateboard] [Van]
```

#### Clue 12:
- The person driving the airplane is on the left of the person driving the skateboard (clue 12).

So, we have:
```
[Airplane] [Skateboard] [Van]
```

#### Clue 13:
- The person eating blueberry is on the right of the person driving the van (clue 13).

So, we have:
```
[Airplane] [Skateboard] [Van] [Blueberry]
```

#### Clue 5:
- The person eating grapefruit is on the left of the person eating corn (clue 5).

Since we have four positions filled, the remaining three positions are for:
```
[Airplane] [Skateboard] [Van] [Blueberry] [Grapefruit] [Corn]
```

#### Clue 10:
- The person driving the snowmobile is the person eating corn (clue 10).

So, we have:
```
[Airplane] [Skateboard] [Van] [Blueberry] [Grapefruit] [Corn] [Snowmobile]
```

#### Clue 2:
- The person who's sport is skiing is on the far right (clue 2).

So, we have:
```
[Airplane] [Skateboard] [Van] [Blueberry] [Grapefruit] [Corn] [Skiing]
```

#### Clue 14:
- The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding (clue 14).

Since the last position is already taken by skiing, and parkour cannot be in the first position (since it must be to the right of snowboarding), the only possible arrangement is:
```
[Airplane] [Skateboard] [Van] [Blueberry] [Grapefruit] [Parkour] [Snowboarding]
```

#### Remaining Clues:
- Clue 7: The person driving the train is on the left of the person driving the helicopter (clue 7).
- Clue 1: The person eating cranberry is on the left of the person driving the train (clue 1).
- Clue 3: The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person driving the helicopter (clue 3).
- Clue 4: The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person eating blueberry (clue 4).
- Clue 6: The person eating carrot is the person driving the skateboard (clue 6).
- Clue 11: The person eating avocado is on the left of the person driving the subway (clue 11).
- Clue 15: The person eating blueberry is on the right of the person driving the van (clue 15).

We can now fill in the remaining positions based on these clues:
```
[Airplane] [Cricket] [Van] [Blueberry] [Grapefruit] [Parkour] [Snowboarding]
```
- Cricket is on the left of Blueberry (clue 4).
- Van is on the left of Blueberry (clue 3).
- Airplane is on the left of Cricket (clue 11).

Thus, we have:
```
[Airplane] [Cricket] [Van] [Blueberry] [Grapefruit] [Parkour] [Snowboarding]
```

Now, let's assign the food and sports:
- Cricket -> Parkour (clue 9)
- Handball -> Skateboard (clue 9)

So, we need to fit the remaining sports and foods:
- Avocado -> Subway (clue 11)
- Grapefruit -> Carrot (clue 5)
- Cranberry -> Train (clue 1)
- Corn -> Snowmobile (clue 10)

Final arrangement:
```
[Airplane] [Cricket] [Van] [Blueberry] [Grapefruit] [Parkour] [Snowboarding]
```

Filling in the foods and sports:
```
[Airplane] [Soccer] [Van] [Blueberry] [Cranberry] [Parkour] [Skiing]
```

15. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Position of the Mexican
From Clue 9, the person watching disaster movies is the Mexican.
From Clue 3, the Mexican is on the right of the person watching crime movies.
From Clue 10, the person driving the snowmobile is in the middle (position 4).
Thus, the Mexican must be in position 3 (since they are to the right of the person watching crime movies).

#### Step 2: Determine the Person Watching Crime Movies
From Clue 3, the Mexican (position 3) is on the right of the person watching crime movies.
Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be in position 2.

#### Step 3: Determine the Person Watching Western Movies
From Clue 11, the Mexican is on the left of the person watching western movies.
Since the Mexican is in position 3, the person watching western movies must be in position 5.

#### Step 4: Determine the Person Watching Martial-Arts Movies
From Clue 15, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left.
Thus, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 1.

#### Step 5: Determine the Person Driving the Snowmobile
From Clue 10, the person driving the snowmobile is in the middle (position 4).
From Clue 7, the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the Indonesian.
Thus, the Indonesian must be in position 6.

#### Step 6: Determine the Person Driving the Train
From Clue 8, the person driving the train is on the right of the person watching crime movies.
Since the person watching crime movies is in position 2, the person driving the train must be in position 7.

#### Step 7: Determine the Person Driving the Motorbike
From Clue 1, the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the turkish.
Since the turkish cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 6 (as these are occupied), the turkish must be in position 2.
Thus, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 3 (which conflicts with the person watching crime movies). Therefore, the turkish must be in position 1 and the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2.

#### Step 8: Determine the Person Driving the Airplane
From Clue 4, the german is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
Since the german cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 6 (as these are occupied), the german must be in position 1.
Thus, the person driving the airplane must be in position 3 (which conflicts with the person watching crime movies). Therefore, the german must be in position 2 and the person driving the airplane must be in position 3.

#### Step 9: Determine the Person Driving the Roller
From Clue 6, the person driving the roller is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
Since the person watching disaster movies is the Mexican (position 3), the person driving the roller must be in position 4.

#### Step 10: Determine the Person Driving the Skateboard
From Clue 12, the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
Since the person watching satire movies cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 6 (as these are occupied), the person watching satire movies must be in position 1.
Thus, the person driving the skateboard must be in position 2 (which conflicts with the person watching crime movies). Therefore, the person watching satire movies must be in position 2 and the person driving the skateboard must be in position 3.

#### Step 11: Determine the Person Driving the Car
From Clue 5, the polish is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
Since the person watching disaster movies is the Mexican (position 3), the polish must be in position 4.
Thus, the person driving the car must be in position 5.

#### Step 12: Determine the Remaining Person
The only nationality left is Canadian, and the only genre left is Zombie.
The only remaining position is 6, which must be the person driving the car.

**Position 2:**
- Since the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person eating orange (clue 1), and the person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling (clue 15), we can place:
- **Cycling** (left) -> **Orange** (right)

**Position 3:**
- **Doctor** (clue 6)

**Position 4:**
- **Social-worker** (clue 11) -> **Rugby** (clue 13)

**Position 5:**
- **Analyst** (clue 5)

**Position 6:**
- **Journalist** (since the person eating corn is on the right of the journalist, and the person eating peach is on the left of the coach, and the person eating peach is also on the left of the person eating banana, we need to find the right fit)
- **Corn** (right of the journalist)

**Position 7:**
- **Coach** (left of the person eating banana, and the person eating peach is on the left of the coach)
- **Banana**

Now let's fill in the sports based on the remaining clues:

- **Skateboarding** (clue 4) -> **Peach**
- **Skiing** (clue 9) -> **Police-officer**

**Position 2:**
- **Cycling** (left of Orange)
- **Orange** (right of Cycling)

**Position 3: Doctor**
