Lv1-1x4-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the four different music genres (ambient, country, r&b, and soul) in positions 1 through 4 based on the given clues.

Let's analyze each clue step-by-step:

1. **The fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of soul.**
   - This means that if the fan of ambient is in position 1, then the fan of soul must be in position 2 or 3 or 4.
   - If the fan of ambient is in position 2, then the fan of soul must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the fan of ambient is in position 3, then the fan of soul must be in position 4.

2. **The fan of country is on the right of the fan of r&b.**
   - This means that if the fan of r&b is in position 1, then the fan of country must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - If the fan of r&b is in position 2, then the fan of country must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the fan of r&b is in position 3, then the fan of country must be in position 4.

3. **The fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of country.**
   - This means that if the fan of country is in position 1, then the fan of ambient must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - If the fan of country is in position 2, then the fan of ambient must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the fan of country is in position 3, then the fan of ambient must be in position 4.

Let's combine these clues to find the correct arrangement:

- From clue 1 and clue 3, we know that:
  - The fan of ambient cannot be in position 1 (because it would contradict clue 3).
  - Therefore, the fan of ambient must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

- Let's test each possibility for the fan of ambient:

  - **If the fan of ambient is in position 2:**
    - Then the fan of soul must be in position 3 or 4 (from clue 1).
    - But from clue 3, the fan of country must be in position 1, which contradicts the fact that the fan of ambient is in position 2.
    
  - **If the fan of ambient is in position 3:**
    - Then the fan of soul must be in position 4 (from clue 1).
    - From clue 3, the fan of country must be in position 1.
    - And from clue 2, the fan of r&b must be in position 2.
    - This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
      - Position 1: r&b
      - Position 2: country
      - Position 3: ambient
      - Position 4: soul

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |  1  |    2    |    3    |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | r&b | country | ambient | soul |

Lv1-1x4-2	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given conditions step by step to determine the correct arrangement of the pets.

1. The owner of the turtle is on the far right.
2. The owner of the bird is on the far left.
3. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the bird.

Given these conditions, we can deduce the following:

- The first column (position 1) must be the bird because the owner of the bird is on the far left.
- The fourth column (position 4) must be the turtle because the owner of the turtle is on the far right.
- The second or third column must be the mouse because it is on the right of the bird.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Bird
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: Turtle

Since the mouse must be to the right of the bird, it can only occupy position 2 or 3. However, if the mouse were in position 3, then the only remaining option for position 2 would be the guinea-pig. This would satisfy all the conditions.

So, let's place the pets in the appropriate positions:

- Position 1: Bird
- Position 2: Guinea-pig
- Position 3: Mouse
- Position 4: Turtle

Thus, the final solution table looks like this:

```
|       |  1   |   2   |     3      |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird | Guinea-pig | Mouse | Turtle |
```"	{'pet': ['bird', 'guinea-pig', 'mouse', 'turtle']}	True	2	False
Lv1-1x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step-by-step:

1. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking.
2. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
3. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.

From clue 1, we can deduce that:
- Puzzles (P) must be to the left of Baking (B).

From clue 2, we can deduce that:
- Board-Games (BG) must be to the left of Rock-Climbing (RC).

From clue 3, we can deduce that:
- Board-Games (BG) must be to the right of Baking (B).

Combining these deductions, we need to place the hobbies in such a way that all conditions are satisfied. Let's list out the possible positions for each hobby based on the clues:

- Clue 1: P must be to the left of B.
- Clue 2: BG must be to the left of RC.
- Clue 3: BG must be to the right of B.

Considering all these constraints, the only logical arrangement is:
- B must be between BG and P.
- BG must be to the left of RC.
- P must be to the left of B.

Therefore, the correct order from left to right is:
1. Puzzles (P)
2. Baking (B)
3. Board-Games (BG)
4. Rock-Climbing (RC)

So, the final solution table looks like this:

```
|         |    1    |   2    |      3      |       4       |

Lv1-1x4-4	"Certainly! Let's analyze and place the means of transport according to the given clues:

1. The person driving the roller is on the far left.
2. The person driving the van is on the far right.
3. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person driving the van.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Roller (far left) = Position 1
- Van (far right) = Position 4
- Jet-ski must be in Position 2 or 3 because it needs to be on the left of the van (Position 4).

Since the roller is already in Position 1 and the van is in Position 4, the only remaining positions for the jet-ski are Positions 2 or 3. Given that the jet-ski must be to the left of the van, the jet-ski must be in Position 2.

This leaves Position 3 for the bike.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Roller
- Position 2: Jet-ski
- Position 3: Bike
- Position 4: Van

Here is the final solution table:

```
|             |   1    |  2   |    3    |  4  |
| Transport   | Roller | Jet-ski | Bike | Van |

Lv1-1x4-5	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far left.
2. The person who's sport is baseball is on the far right.
3. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.

Given these clues, we can deduce the positions as follows:

- Clue 1 tells us that lacrosse is in position 1.
- Clue 2 tells us that baseball is in position 4.
- Clue 3 tells us that parkour must be to the left of baseball, so it cannot be in position 4 (since baseball is there) and must be in position 3 or 2. However, if parkour were in position 3, then lacrosse (position 1) would have to be to the left of parkour, which is not possible because lacrosse is already at position 1. Therefore, parkour must be in position 2.

So, the order from left to right is:
1. Lacrosse
2. Parkour
3. (empty)
4. Baseball

The final table looks like this:

```
|         |    1     |    2    |    3    |    4     |
| Sport   | Lacrosse | Parkour |        | Baseball |

Lv1-1x4-6	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching animation movies is on the far right.
   - This means the person watching animation movies is in column 4.

2. **Clue 2:** The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - Since the person watching animation movies is in column 4, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in column 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies.
   - Given that the person watching martial-arts movies is in column 3, the person watching musical movies must be in column 2.

Now we can fill in the table:

```
|               |   1    |    2    |      3       |     4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical| Martial-Arts| Satire      | Animation |
```

The only genre left for column 1 is satire, as all other genres are already assigned.

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |   1    |    2    |      3       |     4     |

Lv1-1x4-7	"Certainly! Let's solve this step by step based on the given clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating orange.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating peas is on the left of the person eating orange.
3. **Clue 3:** The person eating raspberry is on the left of the person eating peas.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can deduce the following order:
- Raspberry must be to the left of Peas.
- Peas must be to the left of Orange.
- Therefore, Raspberry -> Peas -> Orange.

From Clue 1, we know that Nectarine is to the right of Orange. So, combining all the information, we get:
- Raspberry -> Peas -> Orange -> Nectarine.

Now, let's place these foods in the correct positions:

```
|        |     1     |  2   |   3    |     4     |
| Food   | Raspberry | Peas | Orange | Nectarine |

Lv1-1x4-8	"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Given the constraints:
1. The person driving the skateboard is on the far left.
2. The person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
3. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the trike.

We need to place the transports (jet-ski, skateboard, tram, trike) in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

From constraint 1:
- The skateboard must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|             | Skateboard |       |         |      |
```

From constraint 3:
- The jet-ski must be to the right of the trike.

This means that the trike cannot be in position 4 because the jet-ski would not fit to its right. So, the trike can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3, but since the skateboard is already in position 1, the trike can only be in positions 2 or 3.

Let's consider these cases:

### Case 1: Trike in position 2
- If the trike is in position 2, then the jet-ski must be in position 3 (since it must be to the right of the trike).
- This leaves position 4 for the tram (since the jet-ski is in position 3).

So, the arrangement would be:
```
|             | Skateboard | Trike | Jet-ski | Tram |
```

### Case 2: Trike in position 3
- If the trike is in position 3, then the jet-ski must be in position 4 (since it must be to the right of the trike).
- This leaves position 2 for the tram (since the jet-ski is in position 4).

So, the arrangement would be:
```
|             | Skateboard | Tram  | Jet-ski | Trike|
```

However, this does not satisfy constraint 2 (the tram must be to the right of the jet-ski), so this case is invalid.

Thus, the only valid solution is from Case 1:
```
|             | Skateboard | Trike | Jet-ski | Tram |
```

Final solution:
```
|             | Skateboard | Trike | Jet-ski | Tram |

Lv1-1x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given conditions step by step:

1. The fan of reggae (R) is on the right of the fan of soul (S).
2. The fan of electronic (E) is on the left of the fan of soul (S).
3. The fan of reggae (R) is on the left of the fan of d&b (D).

Given these conditions, we can deduce the following:

- From condition 2, E must be to the left of S.
- From condition 1, R must be to the right of S.
- This means that S cannot be in position 1 or 2 because it would violate the order required by both conditions 1 and 2.

- From condition 3, R is to the left of D. Since R is to the right of S, and S cannot be in positions 1 or 2, S must be in position 3 or 4.

Let's test possible placements for S:

- If S is in position 3:
  - R must be in position 4 (since R is to the left of S).
  - E must be in position 1 (since E is to the left of S).
  - D must be in position 2 (since R is to the left of D).

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions:
- E (Electronic) is to the left of S (Soul).
- R (Reggae) is to the right of S (Soul).
- R (Reggae) is to the left of D (d&b).

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Electronic (E)
- Position 2: d&b (D)
- Position 3: Soul (S)
- Position 4: Reggae (R)

Now, let's present the final solution table:

Lv1-1x4-10	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

We have four positions (1, 2, 3, 4) and four types of transportation: bike, bus, car, and motorbike. The given conditions are:

1. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the bike.
2. The person driving the car is on the far right.
3. The person driving the motorbike is on the far left.

From condition 3, we know:
- Position 1 must be the motorbike.

From condition 2, we know:
- Position 4 must be the car.

Now, from condition 1, we know that the person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the bike. Since the bike is in position 1 and the car is in position 4, the bus must be in either position 2 or 3. Therefore, the only remaining position for the bus is position 3, and the bike must be in position 2.

So, we can fill in the table as follows:
