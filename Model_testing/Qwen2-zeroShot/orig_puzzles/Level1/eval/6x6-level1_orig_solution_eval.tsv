Finally, we need to determine the remaining columns. The person whose hobby is sudoku (Constraint 9) is the person watching satire movies, and the person whose hobby is rock-climbing (Constraint 10) is the owner of the bird. Therefore, the person watching satire movies is in position 3, and the person watching comedy movies is in position 2 (Constraint 11):

```
