### Clues:
1. The person eating cranberry is the person drinking mirinda.
2. The fan of reggae is on the far left.
3. The person drinking water is on the left of the fan of blues.

5. The person eating cauliflower is in the middle.
6. The person drinking water is the person eating pepper.
7. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in the middle.

### Step-by-step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place Reggae Fan (Clue 2)
Since the fan of reggae is on the far left, we can place that first.

|               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | Reggae |             |           |
| Food          |        |             |           |
| Hobby         |        |             |           |
| Music-Genre   |        |             |           |

#### Step 2: Place Water and Pepper (Clues 3 and 6)
The person drinking water is on the left of the fan of blues and the person drinking water is also the person eating pepper. Therefore, the person eating pepper must be in position 1, and the person drinking water must be in position 2.

|               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | Reggae |             |           |
| Food          | Pepper |             |           |
| Hobby         |        |             |           |
| Music-Genre   |        |             |           |

#### Step 3: Place Cranberry and Mirinda (Clue 1)
The person eating cranberry is the person drinking mirinda. Since the person eating pepper (position 1) cannot drink water (as they are the same person), the person eating cranberry must be in position 3 and drinking mirinda.

|               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | Reggae | Mirinda     | Cranberry |
| Food          | Pepper |             |           |
| Hobby         |        |             |           |
| Music-Genre   |        |             |           |

#### Step 4: Place Cauliflower (Clue 5)
The person eating cauliflower is in the middle, so it must be in position 2.

|               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | Reggae | Mirinda     | Cranberry |
| Food          | Pepper | Cauliflower |           |
| Hobby         |        |             |           |
| Music-Genre   |        |             |           |

#### Step 5: Place Chess (Clue 4)
The person who's hobby is chess is the person eating pepper, so the hobby for position 1 is chess.

|               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | Reggae | Mirinda     | Cranberry |
| Food          | Pepper | Cauliflower |           |
| Hobby         | Chess  |             |           |
| Music-Genre   |        |             |           |

#### Step 6: Place Woodworking (Clue 7)
The person who's hobby is woodworking is in the middle, so the hobby for position 2 is woodworking.

|               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | Reggae | Mirinda     | Cranberry |
| Food          | Pepper | Cauliflower |           |
| Hobby         | Chess  | Woodworking |           |
| Music-Genre   |        |             |           |

#### Step 7: Place Blues (Clue 3)
The person drinking water is on the left of the fan of blues. We already know the person drinking water is in position 2 (Cauliflower), so the person drinking water must be in position 1, which means the fan of blues is in position 3.

|               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | Water  | Mirinda     | Cranberry |
| Food          | Pepper | Cauliflower |           |
| Hobby         | Chess  | Woodworking |           |
| Music-Genre   |        |             |           |

#### Step 8: Place Remaining Music Genre (Clue 2)
Since the fan of reggae is in position 1, the remaining music genre is folk, which must be in position 3.

|               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | Water  | Mirinda     | Cranberry |
| Food          | Pepper | Cauliflower |           |
| Hobby         | Chess  | Woodworking |           |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae | Folk        | Blues     |

### Final Solution Table:

Lv1-4x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement for each category (Food, Hobby, Nationality, Pet). Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person eating pear is on the left of the person eating potato.**
   - This means pear is at position 1 or 2, and potato is at position 2 or 3.
   
2. **The person eating radish is on the right of the owner of the rat.**
   - This means if the rat is at position 1, radish is at position 2 or 3; if the rat is at position 2, radish is at position 3.

3. **The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the Italian.**
   - This means the Italian is at position 1 or 2, and rock-climbing is at position 2 or 3.

4. **The person whose hobby is traveling is on the left of the person whose hobby is singing.**
   - This means traveling is at position 1 or 2, and singing is at position 2 or 3.

5. **The owner of the snake is on the far left.**
   - This means the snake is at position 1.

6. **The owner of the snake is the Brazilian.**
   - This means the Brazilian is at position 1.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Snake is at position 1 and Brazilian is at position 1:**
   - Position 1: Snake (Brazilian)

2. **Using clue 6, we place the Brazilian and snake together:**
   - Position 1: Snake (Brazilian)

3. **From clue 1, pear must be at position 1 or 2, and potato must be at position 2 or 3:**
   - Since position 1 is already taken by the Brazilian with the snake, pear cannot be at position 1. Therefore, pear must be at position 2, and potato must be at position 3.

4. **From clue 2, radish is on the right of the owner of the rat:**
   - The only positions left for the rat and radish are positions 2 and 3.
   - If the rat is at position 2, then radish must be at position 3.
   - If the rat is at position 3, then radish must be at position 2, but that would contradict the order from clue 1 where pear (position 2) should be left of potato (position 3).

   Therefore, the rat must be at position 2 and radish at position 3.

5. **From clue 3, rock-climbing is on the right of the Italian:**
   - The Italian must be at position 1 or 2.
   - Since position 1 is already taken by the Brazilian, the Italian must be at position 2.
   - Therefore, rock-climbing must be at position 3.

6. **From clue 4, traveling is on the left of singing:**
   - The only positions left are 1 and 2.
   - Since the Italian is at position 2 and rock-climbing is at position 3, the only remaining options are:
     - Traveling at position 1 and singing at position 2.

7. **Final Assignment:**
   - Position 1: Snake (Brazilian)
   - Position 2: Pear (Italian, Rock-climbing)
   - Position 3: Radish (Traveling), Potato (Singing)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the person who drives the bus:**
   - From clue 1: The software-developer is the person driving the bus.
   - So, we can place:
     ```
     |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |

     ```

2. **Determine the person who drinks almond-milk:**
   - From clue 2: The person driving the subway is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
   - This means the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the subway must be in position 2 or 3.
   - From clue 3: The dancer is on the left of the person driving the bus.
   - Since the software-developer is driving the bus (position 3), the dancer must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2.

3. **Determine the person who watches zombie movies:**
   - From clue 4: The person watching zombie movies is in the middle (position 2).
   - So, the person drinking almond-milk is also watching zombie movies.

4. **Determine the person who watches adventure movies:**
   - From clue 5: The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the software-developer.
   - Since the software-developer is in position 3, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 2.
   - But we already know that position 2 is for the person drinking almond-milk and watching zombie movies.
   - This means the person watching adventure movies cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 1, which is the dancer.

5. **Determine the person who drinks mirinda:**
   - From clue 6: The person drinking mirinda is on the far right (position 3).
   - We already know the software-developer is in position 3, so this is consistent with the information.

6. **Determine the remaining job and movie genre:**
   - The only job left is the chef, and the only movie genre left is satire.
   - Since the dancer is in position 1, they watch adventure movies.
   - The person in position 2 drinks almond-milk and watches zombie movies.
   - The person in position 3 drinks mirinda and drives the bus as a software-developer.
   - Therefore, the person in position 3 must watch satire movies.

Lv1-4x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The fan of rock is on the right of the fan of punk.**
   - This means the person who likes rock is in column 2 or 3, and the person who likes punk is in column 1 or 2.

2. **The person eating tomato is on the left of the fisherman.**
   - This means the person eating tomato is in column 1 or 2, and the fisherman is in column 2 or 3.

3. **The fan of classical is on the left of the person watching horror movies.**
   - This means the person who likes classical is in column 1 or 2, and the person watching horror is in column 2 or 3.

4. **The person eating pear is the fan of rock.**
   - This means the person eating pear is in column 1, and they like rock.

5. **The person watching drama movies is on the right of the analyst.**
   - This means the person watching drama is in column 2 or 3, and the analyst is in column 1 or 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's start by placing the information from clue 4:
- The person eating pear (column 1) is the fan of rock (column 3).

Now let's use clue 1:
- Since the person who likes rock (column 3) is on the right of the fan of punk, the fan of punk must be in column 1 or 2. But since the person eating pear (column 1) is already the fan of rock, the fan of punk must be in column 2.

Next, using clue 2:
- The person eating tomato (column 1 or 2) is on the left of the fisherman (column 2 or 3). Since the fan of punk is in column 2, the person eating tomato must be in column 1, and the fisherman must be in column 3.

Now, using clue 3:
- The fan of classical is on the left of the person watching horror movies. The fan of classical must be in column 1 or 2, and the person watching horror is in column 2 or 3. Since the person eating tomato (column 1) cannot be the fan of classical (because the fan of punk is in column 2), the fan of classical must be in column 2, and the person watching horror is in column 3.

Finally, using clue 5:
- The person watching drama movies is on the right of the analyst. Since the person watching horror is in column 3, the analyst must be in column 2, and the person watching drama is in column 3.

Lv1-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching documentary movies is the fisherman.
2. **Clue 2**: The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
3. **Clue 3**: The nurse is the person who's hobby is video-games.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is video-games is on the far left.
5. **Clue 5**: The owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is cooking.
6. **Clue 6**: The person watching superhero movies is the coach.
7. **Clue 7**: The fisherman is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4 and 5:
- The person with the hobby of video-games (clue 3) must be in position 1.
- The owner of the dog (clue 5) must also be in position 1 because the person with the hobby of video-games is on the far left.

So, we can place:
```
|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Hobby         | Video-games |             |           |
| Job           | Fisherman  |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary |             |           |
| Pet           | Dog        |             |           |
```

#### Clue 1:
- The fisherman (position 1) watches documentary movies.

This confirms our placement for the fisherman and documentary movies.

#### Clue 3 and 7:
- The nurse (clue 3) has the hobby of video-games, but since the person with the hobby of video-games is already placed in position 1, the nurse cannot have this hobby.
- The fisherman (position 1) is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing (clue 7).

So, the person with the hobby of singing must be in position 3.

#### Clue 2:
- The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
- Since the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 1, the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 2 (because the owner of the hedgehog is to their right).
- The nurse (clue 3) must have the hobby of singing.

So, the person with the hobby of cooking is in position 2, and the owner of the hedgehog is in position 3.

#### Clue 6:
- The person watching superhero movies is the coach.

Since the coach is not in position 1 or 3 (video-games and singing), they must be in position 2.

Lv1-4x3-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use logical deductions to fill in the table.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **The fan of indie is on the far left.**
   - This means the first column must be the fan of indie.
   
2. **The person eating cherry is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.**
   - Since the fan of indie is in the first column, the second column cannot be the person eating cherry or the person who's sport is tennis. Therefore, the third column must be the person eating cherry, and the first column must be the person whose sport is tennis.
   
3. **The owner of the ferret is in the middle.**
   - The middle column (column 2) must be the owner of the ferret.
   
4. **The person eating spinach is on the right of the fan of gospel.**
   - Since the first column is the fan of indie, the second column must be the fan of gospel (because the person eating spinach is to the right of the fan of gospel), and the third column must be the person eating spinach.
   
5. **The owner of the frog is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.**
   - Since the first column is the fan of indie, and the third column is the person eating cherry, the second column must be the owner of the frog, and the third column must be the person whose sport is snowboarding.

Now let's fill in the table based on these deductions:

```

Lv1-4x3-7	"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We are given:
- 3 types of food: broccoli, cherry, plum
- 3 jobs: accountant, dressmaker, police-officer
- 3 movie genres: horror, mystery, spy
- 3 music genres: funk, metal, pop

And we have the clues:
1. The fan of metal is on the far left.
2. The dressmaker is on the right of the person eating cherry.
3. The police-officer is on the right of the person watching horror movies.
4. The person eating broccoli is on the right of the fan of funk.
5. The fan of pop is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.

Let's start placing the information based on these clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of metal is on the far left.
   - So, the first column must be ""metal"".

2. **Clue 2**: The dressmaker is on the right of the person eating cherry.
   - This means the person eating cherry cannot be in the last (rightmost) column.

3. **Clue 3**: The police-officer is on the right of the person watching horror movies.
   - This means the person watching horror movies cannot be in the last (rightmost) column.

4. **Clue 4**: The person eating broccoli is on the right of the fan of funk.
   - This means the fan of funk cannot be in the last (rightmost) column.

5. **Clue 5**: The fan of pop is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.
   - This means the person watching mystery movies cannot be in the last (rightmost) column.

Now let's place the elements based on these constraints:

- Since the fan of metal is in the first column, we can start with:
  ```
  |               |     1      |       2        |     3      |

  | Music-Genre   |  metal     |                |            |
  ```

- Let's consider the other clues and fill in the remaining columns.

From Clue 2, the dressmaker is to the right of the person eating cherry. We need to place the person eating cherry in one of the middle positions (since it can't be in the last column).

From Clue 3, the police-officer is to the right of the person watching horror movies. We need to place the person watching horror movies in one of the middle positions (since it can't be in the last column).

From Clue 4, the person eating broccoli is to the right of the fan of funk. We need to place the fan of funk in one of the middle positions (since it can't be in the last column).

From Clue 5, the fan of pop is to the right of the person watching mystery movies. We need to place the person watching mystery movies in one of the middle positions (since it can't be in the last column).

Let's try to fit all the pieces together:

1. Place the fan of metal in the first column.
2. Place the person eating cherry in the second column (since the dressmaker must be to the right).
3. Place the person watching horror movies in the second column (since the police-officer must be to the right).
4. Place the fan of funk in the second column (since the person eating broccoli must be to the right).
5. Place the person watching mystery movies in the second column (since the fan of pop must be to the right).

This leaves us with:
```

Lv1-4x3-8	"Let's break down the clues and systematically fill out the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person driving the car is on the far right.
2. The owner of the rabbit is the person driving the van.
3. The person whose hobby is woodworking is in the middle.
4. The person watching spy movies is on the left of the person whose hobby is magic tricks.
5. The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the person watching family movies.
6. The person driving the car is the owner of the fish.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person Driving the Car (Clue 1):**
   - The person driving the car is on the far right.
   - So, let's place ""car"" in column 3 for the ""Transport"" row.

2. **Owner of the Rabbit (Clue 2):**
   - The owner of the rabbit is the person driving the van.
   - Therefore, the van must be driven by someone who owns a rabbit.
   - Since the car is already driven by someone, the van must be driven by someone in column 1 or 2.

3. **Hobby of Woodworking (Clue 3):**
   - The person whose hobby is woodworking is in the middle.
   - This means woodworking is in column 2.

4. **Spy Movies Position (Clue 4):**
   - The person watching spy movies is on the left of the person whose hobby is magic tricks.
   - Since woodworking is in column 2, the person with woodworking as a hobby can't be in column 1 or 3 (because there would be no space to the left or right).
   - Therefore, the person watching spy movies must be in column 1 and the person whose hobby is magic tricks must be in column 3.

5. **Rabbit Owner Position (Clue 5):**
   - The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the person watching family movies.
   - Since the person watching spy movies is in column 1, the owner of the rabbit must be in column 1 or 2.
   - But we know that the owner of the rabbit drives the van, so the rabbit owner must be in column 1.

6. **Fish Ownership (Clue 6):**
   - The person driving the car is the owner of the fish.
   - We know the car is driven by someone in column 3.
   - Therefore, the person in column 3 owns the fish.

Now, let's fill in the table based on these deductions:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
| Hobby         | woodworking | magic tricks |        -     |
| Movie-Genre   | spy        | -           | family       |
| Pet           | rabbit     | -           | fish         |
| Transport     | van        | -           | car          |
```

### Final Solution Table:

Lv1-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the ship is in the middle.
   - This means the person driving the ship is in position 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the goldfish is on the far right.
   - This means the owner of the goldfish is in position 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is cooking is the person driving the roller.
   - This means the person with the hobby ""cooking"" is in the position where the roller is used.

4. **Clue 4:** The accountant is the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - This means the accountant has the pet ""guinea-pig"".

5. **Clue 5:** The software-developer is on the far left.
   - This means the software-developer is in position 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is writing is on the far right.
   - This means the person with the hobby ""writing"" is in position 3.

From Clues 2 and 6, we can see that:
- Position 3 is the owner of the goldfish and the person with the hobby ""writing"".

Now let's summarize what we know so far:

|             |         1          |     2      |    3     |
|-------------|--------------------|------------|----------|
| Hobby       |                    |            | writing  |
| Job         | software-developer |            |          |
| Pet         |                    |            | goldfish |
| Transport   | bus                | ship       |          |

From Clue 5, the software-developer is in position 1, and from Clue 4, the accountant is the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the accountant cannot be in position 3 (because it's occupied by the person with the hobby ""writing""), the accountant must be in position 1 or 2. But since the software-developer is in position 1, the accountant must be in position 2.

So, the accountant is in position 2, and the owner of the guinea-pig is the accountant.

|             |         1          |     2      |    3     |

| Transport   | bus                | ship       |          |

From Clue 3, the person with the hobby ""cooking"" is the person driving the roller. Since the roller is in position 2, the person with the hobby ""cooking"" must be in position 2. But we already placed the software-developer in position 1 and the accountant in position 2. So the person with the hobby ""cooking"" must be the software-developer.

Since the software-developer is in position 1, the person with the hobby ""chess"" must be in position 3.

|             |         1          |     2      |    3     |
|-------------|--------------------|------------|----------|
| Hobby       | chess              | cooking    | writing  |

| Transport   | bus                | ship       | roller   |

Finally, the remaining job for the first position is the accountant, and the remaining pet for the first position is the goat.

Lv1-4x3-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person watching martial-arts movies is the owner of the goat.
2. The owner of the lizard is on the far left.
3. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the goat.
4. The electrician is on the far right.
5. The chef is on the left of the Russian.
6. The French is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions of the pets and movie genres.
- From clue 2: The owner of the lizard is on the far left (position 1).
- From clue 3: The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the goat. Since the owner of the goat is in position 3 (because the owner of the lizard is in position 1), the owner of the bird must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the pet distribution is:
  - Position 1: Lizard
  - Position 2: Bird
  - Position 3: Goat

#### Step 2: Determine the movie genres.
- From clue 1: The person watching martial-arts movies is the owner of the goat. So, the owner of the goat watches martial-arts movies.
- Therefore, the movie genre distribution is:
  - Position 1: Lizard, Martial-Arts
  - Position 2: Bird, ?
  - Position 3: Goat, Martial-Arts

Since the owner of the bird can't watch martial-arts (as the goat is already watching them), the bird must watch either epic or mystery. The remaining movie genre for position 2 will be the other one.

#### Step 3: Determine the jobs and nationalities.
- From clue 4: The electrician is on the far right (position 3). This means the electrician is the person who keeps the goat and watches martial-arts.
- From clue 5: The chef is on the left of the Russian. This means the chef cannot be in position 3 (since the electrician is there) and must be in position 1 or 2. Also, the Russian cannot be in position 1.
- From clue 6: The French is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. This means the French cannot be in position 3 (since the electrician is there).

Given these constraints, let's assign the jobs and nationalities:

- Position 1: Lizard, Bird, ? (Not Electrician, not Russian)
- Position 2: Bird, Epic/Mystery, ? (Not Electrician, not Russian)
- Position 3: Goat, Martial-Arts, Electrician (Russian)

Since the French must be on the left of the mystery watcher and the electrician is in position 3, the French cannot be in position 3. Also, the Russian must be to the right of the French.

- If the French is in position 1, then the mystery watcher must be in position 2, which contradicts the bird being in position 2. Thus, the French must be in position 2.

Therefore, the distribution is:
- Position 1: Lizard, Bird, Chef (French)
- Position 2: Bird, Epic, Scientist (French)
- Position 3: Goat, Martial-Arts, Electrician (Russian)
