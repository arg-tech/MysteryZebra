### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the pony is on the right of the person eating lime.
2. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person whose hobby is camping.
3. The person eating banana is the owner of the pony.
4. The person whose hobby is puzzles is the owner of the guinea-pig.
5. The person eating lime is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The person eating lime is on the far left.
   - This means:
     - **Food 1**: Lime
     - **Hobby 1**: (Unknown)
     - **Pet 1**: (Unknown)

2. **Clue 3**: The person eating banana is the owner of the pony.
   - This means:
     - **Food 2**: Banana
     - **Hobby 2**: (Unknown)
     - **Pet 2**: Pony

3. **Clue 4**: The person whose hobby is puzzles is the owner of the guinea-pig.
   - This means:
     - **Food 3**: (Unknown)
     - **Hobby 3**: Puzzles
     - **Pet 3**: Guinea-pig

4. **Clue 2**: The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person whose hobby is camping.
   - Since the owner of the guinea-pig (Pet 3) is on the right of the person whose hobby is camping, and we know that the person with hobby puzzles (Pet 3) has the guinea-pig, the person with hobby camping must be in the middle.
   - Therefore:
     - **Hobby 2**: Camping
     - **Pet 2**: (Unknown)

5. **Clue 1**: The owner of the pony is on the right of the person eating lime.
   - Since the person eating lime (Food 1) is on the far left, and the owner of the pony (Pet 2) is on the right of this person, the owner of the pony must be in position 3.
   - Therefore:
     - **Food 3**: Banana
     - **Hobby 3**: (Unknown)
     - **Pet 3**: Pony

6. **Remaining Assignments**:
   - The only food left is kale for the middle position (Food 2).
   - The only hobby left is reading for the middle position (Hobby 2).

So, the final solution is:

```
|         |    1    |    2    |     3      |
| Food    |   Lime  |  Kale   |  Banana    |
| Hobby   |   (any) | Reading |  Camping   |
| Pet     |   (any) | Guinea-pig|  Pony     |
```

Given the constraints and logical deductions, the final solution can be summarized as:

```
|         |    1    |    2    |     3      |
| Food    |   Lime  |  Kale   |  Banana    |
| Hobby   |   (any) | Reading |  Camping   |
| Pet     |   (any) | Guinea-pig|  Pony     |

Lv1-3x3-2	"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We have three columns (1, 2, 3) and three rows (Hobby, Movie-Genre, Pet). The given conditions are:

1. The owner of the hedgehog is on the far right.
2. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
3. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
4. The owner of the dog is on the right of the person watching family movies.

Let's denote:
- Hobbies as C (card-games), G (gardening), V (video-games)
- Movie-Genres as A (action), F (family), S (sports)
- Pets as D (dog), H (hamster), He (hedgehog)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Condition 1: The owner of the hedgehog is on the far right.
This means column 3 has He (hedgehog).

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
Hobby & C & G & V \\
Movie-Genre & A & F & S \\
Pet & D & H & He \\
\end{array}
\]

#### Condition 3: The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
Since V (video-games) must be to the right of G (gardening), and we already placed V in column 3, G must be in column 1.

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
Hobby & G & C & V \\
Movie-Genre & ? & ? & S \\
Pet & D & H & He \\
\end{array}
\]

#### Condition 2: The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
Since S (sports) must be to the right of V (video-games), and V is in column 3, S must be in column 2.

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
Hobby & G & C & V \\
Movie-Genre & ? & S & A \\
Pet & D & H & He \\
\end{array}
\]

#### Condition 4: The owner of the dog is on the right of the person watching family movies.
Since D (dog) must be to the right of F (family), and F is in column 2, D must be in column 3. However, column 3 already has He (hedgehog), so D must be in column 1, and F must be in column 2.

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
Hobby & G & C & V \\
Movie-Genre & D & F & A \\
Pet & D & H & He \\
\end{array}
\]

Now, we need to place the remaining pet, which is the hamster (H), in column 2.

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
Hobby & G & C & V \\
Movie-Genre & D & F & A \\
Pet & D & H & He \\
\end{array}
\]

Lv1-3x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate values in the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **The fan of funk is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.**
2. **The fan of dubstep is on the far left.**
3. **The person driving the airplane is on the far left.**
4. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.**
5. **The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person driving the trike.**

Let's start by placing the information from the clues into the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the airplane is on the far left.
So, for position 1 (far left):
- **Transport**: Airplane
- **Music-Genre**: Blank
- **Sport**: Blank

#### Clue 2:
- The fan of dubstep is on the far left.
So, for position 1 (far left):
- **Music-Genre**: Dubstep

Combining these two clues, we get:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep |            |            |
| Sport         |         |            |            |
| Transport     | Airplane|            |            |
```

#### Clue 5:
- The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person driving the trike.
So, for position 3 (rightmost):
- **Transport**: Trike
- **Sport**: Ice-hockey

Since the person driving the trike is also doing ice-hockey, we can fill in that information:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep |            |            |
| Sport         |         |            | Ice-hockey |
| Transport     | Airplane|            | Trike      |
```

#### Clue 4:
- The person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
So, for position 2:
- **Sport**: Cycling

And since the trike is on the right of the cyclist:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep |            |            |
| Sport         | Cycling |            | Ice-hockey |
| Transport     | Airplane|            | Trike      |
```

#### Clue 1:
- The fan of funk is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
So, for position 2:
- **Music-Genre**: Funk

This places funk in position 2:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep | Funk       |            |
| Sport         | Cycling |            | Ice-hockey |
| Transport     | Airplane|            | Trike      |
```

Now, the only genre left is gospel for position 3:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep | Funk       | Gospel     |
| Sport         | Cycling | Parkour   | Ice-hockey |
| Transport     | Airplane| Skateboard | Trike      |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep | Funk       | Gospel     |

Lv1-3x3-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
2. The person who's hobby is fishing is in the middle.
3. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the dancer.
4. The person drinking milk is on the right of the paramedic.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
Clue 2 states that the person with the hobby of fishing is in the middle (position 2).

|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   |              | Fishing |                 |
| Hobby      |              | Fishing |                 |
| Job        |              |         |                 |

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
Clue 1 states that the person drinking milk is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since position 2 is occupied by fishing, the person with puzzles must be in position 3 or 1.

If the person with puzzles is in position 3, then the person drinking milk must be in position 1. If the person with puzzles is in position 1, then the person drinking milk cannot be in position 2 (which is occupied by fishing), so it would be in position 3.

Let's test both scenarios:

- **Scenario 1: Person with puzzles in position 3**
  - Position 1: Milk
  - Position 2: Fishing
  - Position 3: Puzzles

- **Scenario 2: Person with puzzles in position 1**
  - This scenario is not possible because the person drinking milk would need to be in position 3, but position 3 is occupied by puzzles.

So, we conclude:
- Position 1: Milk
- Position 2: Fishing
- Position 3: Puzzles

|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   | Milk         | Fishing | Puzzles          |
| Hobby      |              | Fishing |                 |
| Job        |              |         |                 |

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
Clue 3 states that the person drinking 7up is on the left of the dancer. Given the positions, the person drinking 7up must be in position 1 and the dancer in position 3.

- Position 1: Milk (from Clue 1)
- Position 2: Fishing
- Position 3: Puzzles (from Clue 1)

Since the person drinking 7up is on the left of the dancer, and the only available position for 7up is position 1 (Milk), this means the person drinking 7up cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the only logical placement is:

- Position 1: 7up (since it must be on the left of the dancer)
- Position 3: Dancer (since it must be on the right of the person drinking 7up)

|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   | 7up          | Fishing | Puzzles          |
| Hobby      |              | Fishing |                 |
| Job        |              |         | Dancer           |

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
Clue 4 states that the person drinking milk is on the right of the paramedic. Given the current arrangement:

- Position 1: 7up
- Position 2: Fishing
- Position 3: Puzzles (and the person drinking milk)

The only remaining beverage for the paramedic is milk, and it must be in position 2.

- Position 2: Milk
- Position 3: Puzzles (as per Clue 1)

Thus, the paramedic drinks milk and is in position 2.

|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   | 7up          | Milk    | Puzzles          |
| Hobby      |              | Fishing |                 |
| Job        |              |         | Dancer           |

#### Step 5: Determine Hobbies and Jobs
- Position 2 (Milk) is the paramedic.
- Position 1 (7up) is the dancer.
- Position 3 (Puzzles) is the person with the hobby of puzzles.

Since the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 2, the remaining hobbies are magic tricks and puzzles. The person with the hobby of puzzles is in position 3, so the remaining hobby (magic tricks) must be in position 1.

|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   | 7up          | Milk    | Puzzles          |
| Hobby      | Magic Tricks | Fishing | Puzzles          |
| Job        | Dancer       | Paramedic | Project Manager |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   | 7up          | Milk    | Puzzles          |
| Hobby      | Magic Tricks | Fishing | Puzzles          |

Lv1-3x3-5	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of jazz is on the far left.
   - This means the first column (1) is the fan of jazz.

2. **Clue 2:** The fan of d&b is the owner of the dog.
   - We'll denote the fan of d&b as ""d&b fan"" and the owner of the dog as ""Dog owner.""

3. **Clue 3:** The fan of d&b is on the far right.
   - This means the third column (3) is the fan of d&b.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can conclude:
- The first column (1) cannot be the fan of d&b because it is the fan of jazz.
- The third column (3) is the fan of d&b.

4. **Clue 4:** The person eating papaya is in the middle.
   - This means the second column (2) is the one eating papaya.

5. **Clue 5:** The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person eating cabbage.
   - This means the third column (3) is the owner of the lizard and the person eating cabbage must be in the first column (1).

Let's summarize what we have so far:

|               |    1     |   2    |  3   |
|---------------|----------|--------|------|
| Food          | Cabbage  | Papaya | Lizard |
| Music-Genre   | Jazz     |        | d&b   |
| Pet           | Dog      |        | Lizard |

Now, we need to fill in the remaining details for the second column (2):

- The person eating papaya (2nd column) cannot be the fan of jazz (1st column) or d&b (3rd column). Therefore, the person eating papaya must be the fan of metal.

So, the final table looks like this:

|               |    1     |   2    |  3   |
|---------------|----------|--------|------|
| Food          | Cabbage  | Papaya | Lizard |
| Music-Genre   | Jazz     | Metal  | d&b   |
| Pet           | Dog      |        | Lizard |

Since the person eating papaya is in the middle (2nd column), the pet in the 2nd column must be the hedgehog (the only pet left).

Final solution table:

```
|               |    1     |   2    |  3   |

Lv1-3x3-6	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

1. **The person driving the taxi is the entrepreneur.**
   - This means the entrepreneur is in one of the positions (1, 2, or 3) and is driving the taxi.

2. **The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing.**
   - This means if someone's sport is sailing, they must be to the left of the person driving the skateboard.

3. **The person who's sport is water-polo is in the middle.**
   - This means the person with water-polo as their sport is in position 2.

4. **The photographer is on the right of the person driving the car.**
   - This means the person driving the car must be in position 1, and the photographer must be in position 2 or 3.

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- From clue 3, the person with water-polo is in position 2.
- From clue 1, the entrepreneur is driving the taxi, which means the entrepreneur is not in position 2 (since water-polo is there).
- From clue 4, the photographer is on the right of the person driving the car. So, the car driver must be in position 1, and the photographer must be in position 2 or 3. Since position 2 is already occupied by water-polo, the photographer must be in position 3.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Car driver (not the entrepreneur)
- Position 2: Water-polo
- Position 3: Photographer

From clue 2, the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the photographer is in position 3, the person driving the skateboard cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the person driving the skateboard must be in position 1, and the person with sailing must be in position 2. But position 2 is already occupied by water-polo, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions.

Since the photographer is in position 3 and the car driver is in position 1, the only logical placement for the entrepreneur is in position 3 because the entrepreneur is driving the taxi (clue 1).

Now we need to place the remaining job and sport:
- The entrepreneur is in position 3, so the taxi is driven by the entrepreneur.
- The photographer is in position 3, so the photographer is not the entrepreneur and must be in position 1 or 3. Since the entrepreneur is in position 3, the photographer must be in position 1.
- The car driver is in position 1, and the person with water-polo is in position 2.

Thus, the remaining job (doctor) must be in position 2.

Final solution:

Lv1-3x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to arrange the three nationalities (American, Mexican, Spanish), sports (Baseball, Surfing, Weightlifting), and transportation methods (Bus, Scooter, Van) according to the given clues. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The American is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
   - This means if Surfing is in position 2, then American must be in position 3.
   
2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the bus is on the right of the Mexican.
   - This means if Mexican is in position 1, then Bus must be in position 3.
   
3. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the Spanish.
   - This means if Weightlifting is in position 1 or 2, then Spanish must be in position 2 or 3.
   
4. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the person driving the van.
   - This means if Weightlifting is in position 1, then Van must be in position 3.
   
5. **Clue 5**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the Mexican.
   - This means if Mexican is in position 1, then Weightlifting must be in position 2.

Let's start with the most restrictive clues and build our solution:

- From Clue 2, if Mexican is in position 1, then Bus must be in position 3.
- From Clue 5, if Mexican is in position 1, then Weightlifting must be in position 2 (since it has to be on the right of the Mexican).
- From Clue 3, if Weightlifting is in position 2, then Spanish must be in position 3.
- From Clue 1, if the American is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing, then Surfing cannot be in position 3 (since the American would be in position 3). So Surfing must be in position 1.
- Therefore, the American must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Surfing
- Position 2: Weightlifting
- Position 3: American

Now, let's place the transportation:
- From Clue 2, since Mexican is in position 1, Bus must be in position 3. But we already have American in position 3, so this doesn't fit. Hence, Mexican cannot be in position 1.

Given that Mexican cannot be in position 1, let's try Mexican in position 2:
- If Mexican is in position 2, then from Clue 5, Weightlifting must be in position 3.
- From Clue 1, the American must be in position 3.
- From Clue 3, the Spanish must be in position 1.
- From Clue 4, the Van must be in position 3, but we already have American in position 3, so this doesn't fit either.

Given these constraints, the only logical arrangement that fits all the clues is:

- Position 1: Spanish
- Position 2: Surfing
- Position 3: American

And for transportation:
- From Clue 2, since Mexican is not in position 1 or 2, and Bus must be on the right of the Mexican, the Bus must be in position 3, which conflicts with the American. So, let's re-evaluate.

Re-evaluating:
- If Mexican is in position 3, then from Clue 2, Bus must be in position 1.
- From Clue 5, Weightlifting must be in position 2.
- From Clue 3, Spanish must be in position 1.
- From Clue 1, the American must be in position 3.

So the correct arrangement is:

- Position 1: Spanish
- Position 2: Surfing

Lv1-3x3-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 3**: The person eating cauliflower is the one watching satire movies.
2. **Clue 1**: The person eating cauliflower is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
3. **Clue 2**: The person eating potato is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
4. **Clue 3** (repeated): The person watching satire movies is the person eating cauliflower.
5. **Clue 4**: The person watching satire movies is on the left of the person whose sport is skiing.
6. **Clue 5**: The person whose sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person eating watermelon.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we can deduce that:
- The person eating cauliflower is watching satire movies.
- The person watching satire movies (who is also eating cauliflower) is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
- Therefore, the person watching satire movies is in position 1, and the person watching thriller movies is in position 3.

Now let's place the remaining items:

- From Clue 2, the person eating potato must be in position 2 because they are on the left of the person watching satire movies (position 1).
- From Clue 5, the person whose sport is snowboarding must be in position 1 because the person eating watermelon (who is on the right of the person with snowboarding) is in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Eating potato, watching satire movies, and doing snowboarding.
- Position 2: Eating cauliflower, watching satire movies.
- Position 3: Eating watermelon, watching thriller movies, and doing skiing.

To summarize the table:

```

| Movie-Genre   | satire   | satire       | thriller   |
| Sport         | snowboarding | snowboarding | skiing    |

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-3x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The australian is the person driving the helicopter.
2. The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
3. The person who's sport is sailing is in the middle.
4. The british is on the left of the australian.
5. The australian is on the left of the person driving the train.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Position of the Australian
From clue 1 and clue 4:
- The australian cannot be in position 1 (because the British is on the left of the australian).
- The australian must be in position 2 or 3.

From clue 5:
- The australian is on the left of the person driving the train.
- Therefore, the australian must be in position 2, and the person driving the train must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Nationality   |    ?     |   australian |    ?      |
| Sport         |    ?     |   ?        |    ?      |
| Transport     |    ?     |   helicopter |  train    |
```

#### Step 2: Determine the Sport of the Australian
From clue 3:
- The person who's sport is sailing is in the middle.
- Since the australian is in position 2, the sport of the australian cannot be sailing (as it would violate clue 3).

From clue 2:
- The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
- And the person who's sport is sailing is in the middle (position 2).

Therefore, the sport of the australian must be basketball (since it is not sailing and not lacrosse).

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Nationality   |    ?     |   australian |    ?      |
| Sport         |    ?     |   basketball |    lacrosse|
| Transport     |    ?     |   helicopter |  train    |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the Nationality of the Australian
From clue 4:
- The australian is on the left of the person driving the train.
- Therefore, the australian must be the australian.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Nationality   |   british |   australian |    russian |
| Sport         |    ?     |   basketball |    lacrosse|
| Transport     |    ?     |   helicopter |  train    |
```

#### Step 4: Determine the Sport of the British
From clue 2:
- The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
- Since the australian has basketball and lacrosse is in position 3, the sport of the British must be sailing.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Nationality   |   british |   australian |    russian |
| Sport         |   sailing |   basketball |    lacrosse|
| Transport     |    ?     |   helicopter |  train    |
```

#### Step 5: Determine the Sport of the Russian
Since the only remaining sport is lacrosse, the sport of the Russian must be lacrosse.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Nationality   |   british |   australian |    russian |
| Sport         |   sailing |   basketball |    lacrosse|
| Transport     |    ?     |   helicopter |  train    |
```

#### Step 6: Determine the Transport for Each Person
From clue 1:
- The australian is driving the helicopter.
- Therefore, the transport for the australian is helicopter.

From clue 5:
- The australian is on the left of the person driving the train.
- Therefore, the person driving the train must be the russian.

So, we have:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Nationality   |   british |   australian |    russian |
| Sport         |   sailing |   basketball |    lacrosse|
| Transport     |   train   |   helicopter |  train    |
```

This violates the condition that each person uses a unique mode of transport. Let's correct this:

Since the australian is already using the helicopter, the train must be used by the russian. This means the British must use the trike.

So, the final solution is:
```
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Nationality   |   british |   australian |    russian |
| Sport         |   sailing |   basketball |    lacrosse|
| Transport     |   trike   |   helicopter |  train    |
```

Lv1-3x3-10	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
2. The owner of the rat is in the middle.
3. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the owner of the snake.
4. The person drinking coffee is in the middle.
5. The owner of the goat is the person drinking 7up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Owner of the Rat
- Clue 2 states that the owner of the rat is in the middle.
- Therefore, the owner of the rat must be in position 2 (Pet column).

#### Step 2: Beverage and Sport for the Owner of the Rat
- Clue 1 states that the owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
- This means the person with soccer as their sport cannot be in position 3 (rightmost), so it must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the owner of the rat is in position 2, the person with soccer as their sport must be in position 1.
- Clue 3 states that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the owner of the snake.
- This means the person with lacrosse cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since position 1 is already taken by soccer, the lacrosse sport must be in position 2.
- Therefore, the snake must be in position 3 (since it has to be to the left of lacrosse).

#### Step 3: Beverage for the Owner of the Rat
- Clue 5 states that the owner of the goat is the person drinking 7up.
- Therefore, the owner of the rat cannot be drinking 7up.
- The person drinking coffee is in the middle (Clue 4).
- Since the owner of the rat is in the middle (position 2), they must be drinking coffee.

#### Step 4: Beverage for the Remaining People
- The person in position 1 is drinking 7up (owner of the goat).
- The person in position 3 is drinking sprite (since it's the only one left).

### Final Table:

```
|            |   1    |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage   | 7up    |  Coffee  | Sprite  |
| Pet        | Goat   |  Rat     | Snake   |
| Sport      | Soccer | Lacrosse | Cricket |
