Lv5-2x4-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
   - This means that if someone is drinking hot-chocolate, they must be in a position to the left of the person drinking lemonade.

2. **The Nigerian is on the left or right of the Brazilian.**
   - This means the Brazilian and Nigerian cannot be in the same position; they must be adjacent to each other.

3. **The Brazilian is in an odd position.**
   - The possible positions for the Brazilian are 1 or 3 (since these are the only odd-numbered positions).

4. **The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the Nigerian.**
   - This means the Nigerian must be in a position to the right of the person drinking water.

5. **The Brazilian is the person drinking lemonade.**
   - Therefore, the Brazilian is drinking lemonade, and the person in the position where the Brazilian is must be drinking lemonade.

6. **The person drinking sprite is the French.**
   - This means the French person is drinking sprite.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **From Clue 5:** The Brazilian is the person drinking lemonade.
   - Position 1 must be either Brazil or Lemonade.
   
2. **From Clue 3:** The Brazilian is in an odd position.
   - So, the Brazilian can only be in position 1 or 3.

3. **From Clue 2:** The Nigerian is on the left or right of the Brazilian.
   - If the Brazilian is in position 1, then the Nigerian could be in position 2.
   - If the Brazilian is in position 3, then the Nigerian could be in position 2 or 4.

4. **From Clue 4:** The person drinking water is to the left of the Nigerian.
   - If the Nigerian is in position 2, then the person drinking water must be in position 1.
   - If the Nigerian is in position 4, then the person drinking water must be in position 3.

5. **From Clue 1:** The person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - Since the Brazilian is the person drinking lemonade, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1 if the Brazilian is in position 3.

6. **From Clue 6:** The person drinking sprite is the French.
   - This means the French person is drinking sprite.

### Final Placement:
Given all the constraints, let's place the information:

- **Position 1:** Brazilian (drinking Lemonade)
- **Position 2:** Nigerian
- **Position 3:** Hot-Chocolate
- **Position 4:** Water

This fits all the given clues:
- The Brazilian is in an odd position (position 1).
- The Nigerian is to the right of the Brazilian.
- The person drinking water is to the right of the Nigerian.
- The person drinking lemonade (Brazilian) is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

### Final Table:
```

Lv5-2x4-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the nationalities and pets accordingly. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the table.

### Clues:
1. The Egyptian is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the horse.
2. The Malaysian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the horse.
3. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the goat.
4. The owner of the bird is on the right of the Malaysian.
5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the Australian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The Egyptian is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the horse.
This means the order could be:
- Bird - Egyptian - Horse
or
- Horse - Egyptian - Bird

#### Clue 2: The Malaysian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the horse.
This means the Malaysian cannot be in the same position as or to the right of the horse.

#### Clue 3: The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the goat.
This means the order must be:
- Goat - Bird

#### Clue 4: The owner of the bird is on the right of the Malaysian.
This means the Malaysian cannot be in the same position as or to the right of the bird.

#### Clue 5: The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the Australian.
This means the order must be:
- Chinchilla - Australian

Now, let's try to fit these clues into the table:

1. **Clue 5** tells us that the chinchilla must be on the left of the Australian. This gives us:
   - Position 1: Chinchilla
   - Position 4: Australian

2. **Clue 3** tells us that the goat must be to the left of the bird. Given the positions from Clue 5, this leaves:
   - Position 2: Goat
   - Position 3: Bird

3. **Clue 1** tells us that the Egyptian is between the bird and the horse. Given the positions of the bird and the horse (positions 3 and 4), this means:
   - Position 2: Goat
   - Position 3: Bird
   - Position 4: Horse
   - Position 1: Egyptian

4. **Clue 2** confirms that the Malaysian is to the left of the horse, which fits with our current placement:
   - Position 1: Malaysian
   - Position 2: Goat
   - Position 3: Bird
   - Position 4: Horse

5. **Clue 4** is already satisfied by our current placement since the Malaysian (Position 1) is to the left of the bird (Position 3).

So, the final solution is:

```

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person eating corn is the person driving the car.
2. The person driving the train is on the right of the person eating corn.
3. The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.
4. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person eating peach.
5. The person eating potato is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train.
6. The person eating corn is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- **Corn** -> **Car**
  - This gives us: 
    ```
    |             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
    | Food        |      |         |           |        |
    | Transport   |      |         |           | Car    |
    ```

#### Clue 2:
- The person driving the train is on the right of the person eating corn.
  - Since corn is at position 1, the person driving the train must be at position 2, 3, or 4.
  - This gives us:
    ```
    |             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
    | Food        | C    |         |           |        |
    | Transport   | T    |         |           | Car    |
    ```

#### Clue 3:
- The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.
  - The person driving the bus cannot be at position 1 (since it must be to the right or left of someone eating peach).
  - Possible positions for the bus are 2, 3, or 4.
  - The quad-bike can only be at positions 1, 2, or 3.
  - This gives us:
    ```
    |             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
    | Food        | C    |         |           |        |
    | Transport   | T    |         |           | Car    |
    ```

#### Clue 4:
- The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person eating peach.
  - Peach cannot be at position 1 (since the bus must be to its left or right).
  - Possible positions for peach are 2, 3, or 4.
  - If peach is at position 2, the bus can be at position 1 or 3.
  - If peach is at position 3, the bus can be at position 2 or 4.
  - If peach is at position 4, the bus can be at position 3.
  - Let's try position 2 for peach and position 1 for the bus:
    ```
    |             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
    | Food        | C    | P      |           |        |
    | Transport   | T    | B      |           | Car    |
    ```

#### Clue 5:
- The person eating potato is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train.
  - Train is at position 2, so potato must be at position 3 or 4.
  - Let's try position 3 for potato:
    ```
    |             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
    | Food        | C    | P      | Po     |        |
    | Transport   | T    | B      |         | Car    |
    ```

#### Clue 6:
- The person eating corn is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.
  - Corn is at position 1, so the quad-bike must be at position 2, 3, or 4.
  - Quad-bike cannot be at position 2 (since bus is there), so it must be at position 3 or 4.
  - Let's try position 4 for the quad-bike:
    ```
    |             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
    | Food        | C    | P      | Po     | Pe    |
    | Transport   | T    | B      | Q      | Car    |
    ```

Now, we need to assign the remaining foods to the remaining positions:

- Remaining food: **peach**
- Peach must be at position 3 (since it's to the right of the bus).

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        | C    | P      | Po     | Pe    |
| Transport   | T    | B      | Q      | Car    |

Lv5-2x4-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.
2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies.
3. The person who's hobby is card-games is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching epic movies.
4. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies.
5. The person watching romance movies is the person who's hobby is skydiving.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 5:
- The person with the hobby of skydiving has the hobby of romance.
- Therefore, Skydiving -> Romance.

#### Clue 1:
- Card-games is on the left of singing.
- This means if we place Card-games in position 1, then singing must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- If we place Card-games in position 2, then singing must be in position 3 or 4.
- If we place Card-games in position 3, then singing must be in position 4.

#### Clue 3:
- Card-games is between the person watching romance (Skydiving) and the person watching epic movies.
- Since Skydiving is Romance, this means Card-games must be in position 1, and Epic must be in position 3 or 4.

#### Combining Clues 1 and 3:
- If Card-games is in position 1, then Epic can only be in position 3 or 4.
- Since Skydiving (Romance) is between Card-games and Epic, Epic cannot be in position 3 (because it would not leave room for Skydiving). Thus, Epic must be in position 4.

- Therefore, the sequence so far is:
  - Position 1: Card-games
  - Position 2: (unknown)
  - Position 3: (unknown)
  - Position 4: Epic

#### Clue 2:
- Woodworking is to the right of Family movies.
- Given the positions we have, Family cannot be in position 4 (Epic), so Family must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 4:
- Family is on the left or right of Romance.
- Since Romance is in position 4, Family must be in position 3.

- Therefore, the sequence is:
  - Position 1: Card-games
  - Position 2: Family
  - Position 3: Romance
  - Position 4: Epic

#### Final Verification:
- Card-games (position 1) is indeed on the left of singing (position 2, 3, or 4).
- Woodworking is to the right of Family (position 3).
- Card-games is between Romance (position 3) and Epic (position 4).
- Family is on the left of Romance.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | Card-games| Family     | Romance | Epic       |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |         |             |

Lv5-2x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and systematically place the food and movie genres in the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person eating kale is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies.**
   - This means that if someone is eating kale, they must be in a column to the left of the column where disaster movies are being watched.

2. **The person eating kale is on the left or right of the person eating eggplant.**
   - This means kale and eggplant cannot be in the same row but can be in adjacent columns.

3. **The person eating eggplant is somewhere to the left of the person eating banana.**
   - This means that if someone is eating eggplant, they must be in a column to the left of the column where banana is being eaten.

4. **The person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.**
   - This means that if someone is watching disaster movies, they must be in a column to the left of the column where western movies are being watched.

5. **The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person eating corn.**
   - This means that if someone is watching disaster movies, they must be in a column adjacent to the column where corn is being eaten.

6. **The person eating kale is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.**
   - This means that if someone is eating kale, they must be in a column to the right of the column where mystery movies are being watched.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 4, we know:
   - Disaster movies (D) < Western movies (W)

2. From clue 5, we know:
   - Disaster movies (D) is next to Corn (C)

3. From clue 1, we know:
   - Kale (K) < Disaster movies (D)

4. From clue 3, we know:
   - Eggplant (E) < Banana (B)

5. From clue 6, we know:
   - Kale (K) > Mystery movies (M)

Given these clues, let's try to place them in the table:

### Initial Placement:

1. Since Disaster movies must be to the left of Western movies and next to Corn, let's start with:
   - Disaster movies (D) in column 1, Corn (C) in column 2.
   - Western movies (W) in column 4.

2. Now, since Kale must be to the left of Disaster movies, it must be in column 1 or 2. But column 1 is occupied by Disaster movies, so:
   - Kale (K) in column 2.

3. Since Eggplant must be to the left of Banana and Kale is in column 2, Eggplant must be in column 1 and Banana in column 3.

4. Finally, Mystery movies must be to the left of Kale, so:
   - Mystery movies (M) in column 1.

### Final Table:

|               |    1     |   2    |    3     |    4    |
| Food          |  Kale    |  Eggplant |  Banana  |  ?      |
| Movie-Genre   |  Mystery |  Disaster |  ?       |  Western |

We still need to fill in the remaining cells for food and movie genres. Since we have used all the given information and constraints, the remaining cells should logically fit based on the clues provided.

### Final Solution:

```plaintext
|               |    1     |   2    |    3     |    4    |
| Food          |  Kale    |  Eggplant |  Banana  |  Corn   |
| Movie-Genre   |  Mystery |  Disaster |  Corn    |  Western |

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv5-2x4-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The police-officer is in an odd position (1 or 3).
2. **Clue 2:** The electrician is somewhere to the left of the turkish.
3. **Clue 3:** The turkish is between the police-officer and the thai.
4. **Clue 4:** The paramedic is on the right of the japanese.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The police-officer must be in position 1 or 3.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- If the police-officer is in position 1, then the turkish must be in position 2 (since the turkish is between the police-officer and the thai).
- This means the thai must be in position 3.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Since the turkish is in position 2, the electrician must be in position 1 (because the electrician is to the left of the turkish).

This conflicts with the police-officer being in position 1. Therefore, the police-officer cannot be in position 1.

**Conclusion from Clues 1 and 3:**
- The police-officer must be in position 3.
- The turkish must be in position 2.
- The thai must be in position 4.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2 Again**
- Now, the turkish is in position 2, so the electrician must be in position 1 (to the left of the turkish).

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- The paramedic is on the right of the japanese. With positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 filled as follows:
  - Position 1: Electrician
  - Position 2: Turkish
  - Position 3: Police-officer
  - Position 4: Thai

The only remaining positions for the japanese and the paramedic are 1 and 2, but since the electrician is already in position 1, the japanese must be in position 4 and the paramedic in position 1.

However, this doesn't fit as the paramedic needs to be on the right of the japanese. Therefore, the correct placement should be:
- Japanese in position 1
- Paramedic in position 2

So, the final arrangement is:

- Position 1: Japanese
- Position 2: Paramedic
- Position 3: Police-officer
- Position 4: Thai

Now let's fill in the nationalities based on the job assignments:
- The electrician is to the left of the turkish, so the electrician can be either Japanese or Russian.
- The paramedic is on the right of the japanese, so the paramedic can be Thai or Turkish.

Given the positions:
- Japanese (Position 1) -> Electrician
- Paramedic (Position 2) -> Thai
- Police-officer (Position 3)
- Thai (Position 4)

We need to assign the nationalities:
- Japanese (Position 1) -> Electrician -> Japanese
- Paramedic (Position 2) -> Thai
- Police-officer (Position 3) -> Russian
- Thai (Position 4) -> Turkish

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Electrician | Paramedic  | Police-officer | Thai      |
| Nationality   | Japanese   | Thai       | Russian        | Turkish   |

Lv5-2x4-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The owner of the hamster is the fan of salsa.
2. The fan of ambient is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the snake.
3. The owner of the goldfish is in an even position.
4. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient.
5. The fan of ambient is in an even position.
6. The fan of jazz is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- The owner of the hamster is the fan of salsa.
  - This means: **Hamster -> Salsa**

#### Clue 2:
- The fan of ambient is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the snake.
  - Let's denote this as: **Ambient -> X, Hip-Hop -> Y, Snake -> Z**
  - And we know that Ambient is between Hip-Hop and Snake.
  - Possible order: Hip-Hop -> Ambient -> Snake or Snake -> Ambient -> Hip-Hop.

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the goldfish is in an even position.
  - This means: **Goldfish -> 2 or 4**

#### Clue 4:
- The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient.
  - This means: **Turtle -> < Ambient**

#### Clue 5:
- The fan of ambient is in an even position.
  - This means: **Ambient -> 2 or 4**

#### Clue 6:
- The fan of jazz is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster (who is the fan of salsa).
  - This means: **Jazz -> Adjacent to Hamster** (i.e., Jazz -> 1 or 3)

### Analyzing Positions:

Since the owner of the goldfish is in an even position (Clue 3), and the fan of ambient is also in an even position (Clue 5), the only possible positions for both are 2 and 4. 

Let's assume:
- **Ambient -> 2**
- **Goldfish -> 4**

Given that the owner of the turtle is to the left of the fan of ambient (Clue 4), the only possible position for the owner of the turtle is 1.

Now, we have:
- **Turtle -> 1**
- **Ambient -> 2**
- **Goldfish -> 4**

From Clue 1, the owner of the hamster is the fan of salsa. Since the owner of the hamster cannot be in position 2 (Ambient) or 4 (Goldfish), the only remaining position is 3.

Thus, the owner of the hamster is in position 3, making the owner of the hamster the fan of salsa.

This leaves us with:
- **Hamster -> Salsa**
- **Owner of Hamster -> 3**

From Clue 6, the fan of jazz must be adjacent to the owner of the hamster (who is in position 3). Therefore, the fan of jazz can be in position 2 or 4. But since position 2 is already taken by the fan of ambient, the fan of jazz must be in position 4, which is taken by the goldfish.

So, the fan of jazz must be in position 1.

Now we have:
- **Jazz -> 1**

Finally, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 3 (since the owner of the hamster is in position 3).

So, the fan of hip-hop is in position 3.

### Final Table:

Lv5-2x4-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The librarian is on the right of the scientist.
   - This means the scientist must be in position 1 and the librarian in position 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the left of the mechanic.
   - This means the mechanic cannot be in positions 1 or 2, and the strawberry eater must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the person eating pear.
   - This means the strawberry eater and the pear eater must be next to each other.

4. **Clue 4:** The person eating mango is on the left of the person eating strawberry.
   - This means the strawberry eater must be in position 2, 3, or 4, and the mango eater must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (depending on the strawberry eater).

5. **Clue 5:** The mechanic is somewhere to the left of the designer.
   - This means the designer cannot be in position 1 or 2, and the mechanic must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the jobs and foods:

- From Clue 1, we know:
  - Scientist in position 1
  - Librarian in position 2

- From Clue 5, since the designer cannot be in position 1 or 2, and the mechanic must be to the left of the designer, we can place:
  - Mechanic in position 1 or 2
  - Designer in position 3 or 4

- From Clue 4, the strawberry eater must be to the right of the mango eater. Since the strawberry eater cannot be in position 1 (as the mechanic is to the left), the strawberry eater must be in position 2, 3, or 4. The mango eater must be to the left of this position.

- From Clue 3, the strawberry and pear eaters must be next to each other. If the strawberry eater is in position 2, the pear eater must be in position 1 (but that would conflict with the mechanic being to the left of the designer). Therefore, the strawberry eater must be in position 3 or 4, and the pear eater in position 2.

- Given the above, let's try:
  - Scientist in position 1
  - Librarian in position 2
  - Mechanic in position 3 (to the left of the designer)
  - Designer in position 4

Now, we need to assign the foods:
- The strawberry eater is in position 3, so the mango eater must be in position 2.
- The pear eater is in position 2, so the strawberry eater must be in position 3.
- The mechanic is in position 3, so the designer is in position 4.

We still need to place carrot and the remaining food (mango or strawberry) in positions 1 and 4. Since the strawberry eater is in position 3, the mango eater must be in position 2. Therefore, the remaining foods are carrot and pear.

- Position 1: Carrot (mechanic)
- Position 2: Mango (designer)
- Position 3: Strawberry (librarian)
- Position 4: Pear (scientist)

So, the final solution is:

```
|        |     1     |     2      |    3     |    4     |
| Food   |   Carrot  |   Mango    | Strawberry | Pear    |
| Job    | Mechanic  | Designer   | Librarian | Scientist |

Lv5-2x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each item based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person eating potato is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.**
   - This means the order for these two must be: Almond-milk (left) -> Potato (right).

2. **The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking milk.**
   - This means the order for these two must be: Iced-tea (left) -> Milk (right).

3. **The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.**
   - This means the order for these two must be: Almond-milk (left) -> Iced-tea (right).

4. **The person drinking cola is somewhere to the right of the person eating tomato.**
   - This means the order for these two must be: Tomato (left) -> Cola (right).

5. **The person eating pear is somewhere to the right of the person eating lemon.**
   - This means the order for these two must be: Lemon (left) -> Pear (right).

6. **The person eating lemon is somewhere to the left of the person eating potato.**
   - This means the order for these two must be: Lemon (left) -> Potato (right).

### Combining the Clues:
- From clue 1: Almond-milk (left) -> Potato (right).
- From clue 3: Almond-milk (left) -> Iced-tea (right).
  - Combining both, we get: Almond-milk (left) -> Iced-tea (right) -> Potato (right).

- From clue 2: Iced-tea (left) -> Milk (right).
  - Combining with previous, we get: Almond-milk (left) -> Iced-tea (right) -> Milk (right).

- From clue 4: Tomato (left) -> Cola (right).
- From clue 5: Lemon (left) -> Pear (right).
  - From clue 6: Lemon (left) -> Potato (right).
    - Combining all, we get: Lemon (left) -> Potato (right).

### Final Arrangement:
We now have:
- Almond-milk (1st)
- Iced-tea (2nd)
- Milk (3rd)
- Cola (4th)

And:
- Lemon (1st)
- Potato (2nd)
- Pear (3rd)
- Tomato (4th)

Since we have 4 positions for each category (beverage and food), and the clues indicate specific positions, we can place them as follows:

|            |      1      |    2     |   3    |  4   |
| Beverage   | Almond-milk | Iced-tea |  Milk  |  Cola|
| Food       | Lemon       | Potato   |  Pear  | Tomato|

### Final Solution Table:
```
|            |      1      |    2     |   3    |  4   |
| Beverage   | Almond-milk | Iced-tea |  Milk  |  Cola|
| Food       | Lemon       | Potato   |  Pear  | Tomato|

Lv5-2x4-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.**
2. **The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea.**
3. **The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the person drinking iced-tea.**
4. **The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.**
5. **The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.
   - This means Surfing and Cola must be in adjacent positions with Surfing to the left of Cola.

2. **Clue 1:** The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.
   - Since Surfing and Cola are adjacent, Mirinda can be either to the left or right of Surfing (but not between Surfing and Cola).

3. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
   - This means Soccer and Weightlifting must be in adjacent positions with Soccer to the right of Weightlifting.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea.
   - This means Soccer and Tea must be in adjacent positions with Soccer to the left of Tea.

5. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - This means Iced-tea and Weightlifting must be in adjacent positions with Iced-tea to the left of Weightlifting.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit everything into the 4 positions:

- Let's assume the order is as follows:
  - Position 1: Surfing
  - Position 2: Mirinda (since it must be adjacent to Surfing)
  - Position 3: Weightlifting
  - Position 4: Soccer (since it must be to the right of Weightlifting)

Now we need to place the beverages:
- Since Surfing is in position 1, Cola must be in position 2 (because Surfing is to the left of Cola).
- Mirinda is in position 2, so it cannot be Cola.
- Iced-tea must be in position 3 because Weightlifting is to its right.
- This leaves Tea for position 4.

So, the final arrangement should be:
- Position 1: Surfing
- Position 2: Mirinda
- Position 3: Weightlifting
- Position 4: Soccer

And the beverages:
- Position 1: Cola
- Position 2: Iced-tea
- Position 3: Tea
- Position 4: Mirinda

However, this does not satisfy all the conditions. Let's re-evaluate:

- If Surfing is in position 1, then Cola must be in position 2.
- Mirinda must be either in position 2 or 4.
- If Mirinda is in position 4, then Iced-tea must be in position 3.
- Soccer and Weightlifting must be in positions 2 and 3, but this conflicts with the positions of Mirinda and Iced-tea.

Re-evaluating, let's try:
- Surfing in position 1, Cola in position 2.
- Mirinda in position 3.
- Weightlifting in position 4.
- Soccer in position 2.

This satisfies all conditions:
- Surfing (1) -> Cola (2)
- Mirinda (3) -> somewhere to the left or right of Surfing
- Weightlifting (4) -> somewhere to the right of Iced-tea
- Soccer (2) -> somewhere to the right of Weightlifting
- Surfing (1) -> somewhere to the left of Cola

Final solution:

|            |    1     |       2       |   3    |     4      |
| Beverage   | Cola     | Iced-tea      | Tea    | Mirinda   |
| Sport      | Surfing  | Soccer        | Weightlifting | Water-polo |

```
|            |    1     |       2       |   3    |     4      |
| Beverage   | Cola     | Iced-tea      | Tea    | Mirinda   |
| Sport      | Surfing  | Soccer        | Weightlifting | Water-polo |
