### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person eating raspberry.
   - So, the person eating raspberry is skateboarding.

2. **Clue 8:** The person eating raspberry is in the middle.
   - Therefore, Raspberry (R) is in position 2.

3. **Clue 5 again:** The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person eating raspberry.
   - So, the sport for position 2 is skateboarding.

4. **Clue 10:** The fan of r&b is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
   - Let's denote the person who's hobby is puzzles as Puzzles (P).

5. **Clue 1:** The person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
   - Since Raspberry is in position 2, Spy (S) can be in position 1 or 3.

6. **Clue 2:** The fan of jazz is on the far left.
   - Jazz (J) is in position 1.

7. **Clue 3:** The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the fan of r&b.

Now, let's place everything based on these clues:

Since:
- Coffee (C) is driven by roller.

- Zucchini is to the right of Board-Games.
- Tea is to the left of Board-Games.
- Spy is either in Position 1 or 3 (but we already have Jazz and Disaster).

For the remaining positions:
- **Position 4:** Biathlon (B) (since it must be to the left of Ship)

- From clue 6, the fan of pop is to the right of the person driving the trike.
- The only remaining positions for these are 2 and 3.
