- Since the Canadian is on the left of the Indonesian, the Indonesian cannot be in position 1 either.
- The Canadian is also on the right of the accountant, so the accountant must be in a position before the Canadian.
- The Canadian is to the left of the fan of jazz, so the fan of jazz cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The Canadian is to the left of the fan of jazz, and the fan of jazz is to the right of the Dutch (position 2), so the Canadian cannot be in position 2.
- The Canadian is to the left of the fan of jazz, and the fan of jazz is to the right of the Dutch (position 2), so the Canadian cannot be in position 3.
- The Canadian is to the left of the fan of jazz, and the fan of jazz is to the right of the Dutch (position 2), so the Canadian cannot be in position 4.
- The Canadian is to the left of the fan of jazz, and the fan of jazz is to the right of the Dutch (position 2), so the Canadian cannot be in position 5.
- The Canadian is to the left of the fan of jazz, and the fan of jazz is to the right of the Dutch (position 2), so the Canadian cannot be in position 6.

### Explanation:

1. **Positioning the American and Water:**
   - Clue 26 and Clue 11 indicate that the American is either at position 1 or 7, and the person drinking water is also at position 1 or 7.

Let's assume the American is at position 1 and the person drinking water is at position 7 (this can be adjusted later if needed).

2. **Positioning the Chinese and Rowing:**
   - Clue 5 and Clue 21 indicate that the Chinese is the person whose sport is rowing. This places the Chinese in position 3.

3. **Positioning the Dutch and Iced-tea:**
   - Clue 13 and Clue 34 indicate that the Dutch is the person drinking iced-tea. This places the Dutch in position 4.

4. **Positioning the Japanese and Skateboarding:**
   - Clue 8 and Clue 22 indicate that the Japanese is the person whose sport is skateboarding. This places the Japanese in position 6.
