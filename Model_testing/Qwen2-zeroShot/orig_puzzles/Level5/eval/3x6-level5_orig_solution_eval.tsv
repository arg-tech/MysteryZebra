| A |   |   |   |   | E |
```

3. **Clue 8**: The entrepreneur is the Colombian.

    - The German cannot be in position 6 (entrepreneur).
    - The Chinese cannot be in position 1 (architect).

12. **Clue 14**: The Chinese is on the left or right of the Japanese.
    - The Japanese cannot be in position 1 (architect).
    - The Chinese cannot be in position 6 (entrepreneur).

13. **Clue 3**: The writer is on the left or right of the photographer.
    - The writer is already in position 2.
    - The photographer must be in position 4 or 5.

14. **Clue 5**: The British is on the right of the architect.

Lv5-3x6-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and placing the information into the table.

### Initial Setup:
We have:
- 6 foods: apricot, asparagus, pear, pepper, radish, tomato
- 6 movie genres: crime, drama, family, musical, thriller, time-travel
- 6 music genres: blues, country, d&b, gospel, house, reggae

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish.
2. **Clue 2**: The person watching drama movies is on the far left.
3. **Clue 3**: The fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan of gospel is on the right of the person eating radish.
5. **Clue 5**: The person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the person eating tomato.
6. **Clue 6**: The person eating radish is the fan of d&b.
7. **Clue 7**: The person watching family movies is the fan of blues.
8. **Clue 8**: The person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person watching family movies.
9. **Clue 9**: The fan of country is on the far right.
10. **Clue 10**: (Rephrasing Clue 7)
11. **Clue 11**: (Rephrasing Clue 8)
12. **Clue 12**: The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
13. **Clue 13**: The person eating tomato is on the right of the person watching thriller movies.
14. **Clue 14**: The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating pear.
15. **Clue 15**: The person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the fan of country.
16. **Clue 16**: The person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.
17. **Clue 17**: The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person eating pear.
18. **Clue 18**: The person eating asparagus is on the left of the fan of house.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From **Clue 2**, the person watching drama movies is on the far left (Position 1).
2. From **Clue 7** and **Clue 10**, the person watching family movies is the fan of blues (Position 2, Music-Genre: blues).
3. From **Clue 6**, the person eating radish is the fan of d&b (Position 3, Food: radish, Music-Genre: d&b).
4. From **Clue 4**, the fan of gospel is on the right of the person eating radish (Position 4, Music-Genre: gospel).
5. From **Clue 3**, the fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues (Position 5, Music-Genre: reggae).
6. From **Clue 9**, the fan of country is on the far right (Position 6, Music-Genre: country).

Now we need to place the remaining food and movie genres.

7. From **Clue 1**, the person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish. Since radish is in position 3, pepper must be in positions 4, 5, or 6.
8. From **Clue 14**, the person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating pear. Since the person watching family movies is in position 2, the person eating pear must be in position 1 or 2, but since position 2 is already occupied, pear must be in position 1.
9. From **Clue 17**, the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person eating pear. Since pear is in position 1, crime must be in position 1 (but it’s already taken by pear, so this is a contradiction). Let's re-evaluate:
   - Position 1: Pear (Food), Crime (Movie)
   - Position 2: Family (Movie), Blues (Music)
   - Position 3: Radish (Food), D&B (Music)
   - Position 4: Pepper (Food), Gospel (Music)
   - Position 5: Reggae (Music)
   - Position 6: Country (Music)

10. From **Clue 12**, the person watching musical movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Musical cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3, so it must be in position 4, 5, or 6. Time-travel must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Given the placements, time-travel must be in position 3, and musical in position 4.

11. From **Clue 13**, the person eating tomato is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Thriller cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Tomato must be in position 4, 5, or 6. Given the placements, thriller must be in position 3, and tomato in position 4.

12. From **Clue 8**, the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person watching family movies. Apricot can be in position 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Given the placements, apricot must be in position 5.

13. From **Clue 16**, the person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies. This is already satisfied with radish in position 3 and family in position 2.

14. From **Clue 15**, the person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the fan of country. This is already satisfied with pear in position 1 and country in position 6.

15. From **Clue 18**, the person eating asparagus is on the left of the fan of house. Asparagus can be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Given the placements, asparagus must be in position 2, and house in position 5.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1    |    2    |   3    |     4     |      5      |    6    |
