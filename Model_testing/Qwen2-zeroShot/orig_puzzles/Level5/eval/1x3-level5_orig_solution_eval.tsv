Lv5-1x3-1	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The person watching epic movies is on the far right.
2. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the person watching epic movies is on the far right (position 3), the person in position 3 watches epic movies.
- This leaves positions 1 and 2 for the other two genres: romance and superhero.
- The person watching superhero movies must be to the left of the person watching romance movies. Therefore, the person in position 1 must be watching superhero movies, and the person in position 2 must be watching romance movies.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Superhero
- Position 2: Romance
- Position 3: Epic

Here is the final solution table:

```

We have three positions (1, 2, 3) and three music genres: blues, rock, and soul. The clues given are:

1. The fan of rock is on the right of the fan of blues.
2. The fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the fan of soul.

Let's break down these clues:

1. If the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of blues, then the possible orders for rock and blues could be:
   - Blues in position 1, Rock in position 2 or 3.
   - Blues in position 2, Rock in position 3.

2. If the fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the fan of soul, then the possible orders for soul and blues could be:
   - Soul in position 1, Blues in position 2 or 3.
   - Soul in position 2, Blues in position 3.

Combining both clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the fan of rock must be to the right of the fan of blues, and the fan of blues must be to the right of the fan of soul, the only order that fits all the clues is:
  - Soul in position 1
  - Blues in position 2
  - Rock in position 3

So, the final arrangement is:

Lv5-1x3-3	"Certainly! Let's solve the logic puzzle step-by-step.

We have three people and three types of food:
- Broccoli (B)
- Grapes (G)
- Raspberry (R)

The given conditions are:
1. The person eating grapes (G) is on the right of the person eating broccoli (B).
2. The person eating raspberry (R) is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes (G).

Let's analyze these conditions:

1. Since G must be to the right of B, we can place B first and then G.
2. R must be to the right of G, so if G is already to the right of B, R must be to the right of G.

Given these constraints, the only possible order is:
- B (Broccoli) at position 1
- G (Grapes) at position 2
- R (Raspberry) at position 3

So, the final arrangement is:
- Person 1 eats Broccoli (B)
- Person 2 eats Grapes (G)
- Person 3 eats Raspberry (R)

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv5-1x3-4	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

We have three genres: scientific, sports, and thriller. We need to place these genres in columns 1, 2, and 3 such that:
1. The person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching scientific movies.
2. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching sports movies.

Let's denote the genres as follows:
- S for scientific
- T for thriller
- P for sports

From the clues:
1. T must be to the left of S.
2. S must be to the left of P.

Given these constraints, we can deduce the order:
- T < S < P

So, the only possible arrangement is:
- Column 1: T (thriller)
- Column 2: S (scientific)
- Column 3: P (sports)

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-1x3-5	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step.

We have three positions (1, 2, 3) and three types of food: banana (B), carrot (C), and watermelon (W). The clues given are:

1. The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the person eating carrot.
2. The person eating banana is between the person eating watermelon and the person eating carrot.

Let's analyze these clues:

- From clue 1, we know that W must be to the left of C. This means if W is in position 1, C must be in position 2 or 3. If W is in position 2, C must be in position 3.
- From clue 2, B is between W and C. This means B cannot be at either end but must be in the middle if W and C are on either side of it.

Given these constraints, let's test possible configurations:

1. If W is in position 1:
   - C must be in position 3 (since W is to the left of C).
   - B must be in position 2 (to be between W and C).

   So, the configuration would be: W (1), B (2), C (3).

2. If W is in position 2:
   - This would place C in position 3, and B would need to be in position 1, which contradicts clue 2 because B cannot be at the start.

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- Position 1: Watermelon (W)
- Position 2: Banana (B)
- Position 3: Carrot (C)

So, the final solution table is:

```
|        |     1      |   2    |   3    |
| Food   |   Watermelon | Banana | Carrot |

Lv5-1x3-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. **The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.**
   - This means that the person drinking tea cannot be exactly in the middle of the person drinking milk.

2. **The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk.**
   - This narrows it down further, indicating that the person drinking tea must be in one of the first two positions (leftmost or second from the left) if the person drinking milk is in the third position.

3. **The person drinking milk is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking tea.**
   - This means that the person drinking milk is in the middle position (position 2), with the person drinking juice and the person drinking tea occupying the other two positions.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person drinking milk must be in position 2.
- Since the person drinking milk is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking tea, and the person drinking tea is to the left of the person drinking milk, the person drinking juice must be in position 3, and the person drinking tea must be in position 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Tea
- Position 2: Milk
- Position 3: Juice

Here is the final solution table:

```

1. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
2. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the hamster is to the right of the rabbit, and to the left of the goat, the only possible order is: Rabbit, Hamster, Goat.

Therefore, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Rabbit
- Position 2: Hamster
- Position 3: Goat

Lv5-1x3-8	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step:

1. The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person eating raspberry.
2. The person eating apple is on the left of the person eating raspberry.

Given that there are only three positions (1, 2, and 3), we can deduce the following:

- From condition 1, if the person eating raspberry is in position 1 or 2, then the person eating asparagus must be in position 2 or 3, respectively.
- From condition 2, the person eating apple must be in position 1 or 2, and it must be to the left of the person eating raspberry.

Let's test the possible placements:

### Scenario 1:
- If the person eating raspberry is in position 1, then the person eating asparagus must be in position 2 or 3.
  - If the person eating asparagus is in position 2, then the person eating apple must be in position 3 (since the apple must be to the left of the raspberry).
    - This arrangement satisfies both conditions: 
      - Asparagus (2) is to the right of Raspberry (1).
      - Apple (3) is to the left of Raspberry (1).

### Scenario 2:
- If the person eating raspberry is in position 2, then the person eating asparagus must be in position 3.
  - If the person eating asparagus is in position 3, then the person eating apple must be in position 1 (since the apple must be to the left of the raspberry).
    - This arrangement also satisfies both conditions:
      - Asparagus (3) is to the right of Raspberry (2).
      - Apple (1) is to the left of Raspberry (2).

### Scenario 3:
- If the person eating raspberry is in position 3, this would violate condition 1 because there would be no position to the right for asparagus.

Thus, the valid arrangements are:

1. Raspberry (1), Apple (3), Asparagus (2)
2. Raspberry (2), Apple (1), Asparagus (3)

Since we need to provide a single solution based on the given constraints, we can choose either one. For simplicity, let's use the first arrangement:

Lv5-1x3-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
2. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: First column
- Position 2: Second column
- Position 3: Third column

Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. From clue 1, we know that if someone's hobby is chess, they must be to the right of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
2. From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is hiking must be to the left of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.

Combining these two clues, we can infer the following order:
- Hiking must be to the left of filmmaking.
- Filmmaking must be to the left of chess.

Thus, the only possible order is:
- Hiking (leftmost)
- Filmmaking (middle)
- Chess (rightmost)

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Hiking
- Position 2: Filmmaking
- Position 3: Chess

### Final Solution Table:

Lv5-1x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.

1. The person watching satire movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
2. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies.

From these clues, we can deduce the order of the movie genres:

- Since the person watching comedy movies must be on the left of the person watching satire movies, and the person watching satire movies must be on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies, the only possible order is:
  - Comedy (leftmost)
  - Satire (middle)
  - Martial-arts (rightmost)

So, the order of the movie genres from left to right is: **Comedy, Satire, Martial-arts**.

Now, let's fill in the table with the genres based on the order we have determined:
