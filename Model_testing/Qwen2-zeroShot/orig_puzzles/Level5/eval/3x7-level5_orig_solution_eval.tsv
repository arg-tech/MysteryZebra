21. **Clue 21**: The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning Coffee and Satire**:
   - From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we know:
     - Coffee < Satire < Water
     - Since Coffee must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6) and Coffee < Satire < Water, the only possible positions for Coffee, Satire, and Water are:
       - Coffee = 2, Satire = 4, Water = 6

2. **Positioning Western Movies and Iced-tea**:
   - From Clue 6 and Clue 21, we know:
     - Western < Iced-tea < Water
     - Since Water is at 6, Western must be before 4 (Coffee) and Iced-tea must be after Coffee but before Water (6). Thus, Western can only be at 1, and Iced-tea at 4 (Coffee is already there).

3. **Positioning Comedy and Grapefruit**:
   - From Clue 3, we know:
     - Comedy < Grapefruit
     - From Clue 5, Grapefruit < Mango
     - From Clue 11, Apricot > Cucumber
     - So, the order for these is:
       - Cucumber < Comedy < Grapefruit < Mango

4. **Positioning Animation and Onion**:
   - From Clue 12, Animation is on the far right (7).
   - From Clue 17, Animation > Onion
     - So, Onion must be in one of the first 6 positions, and Animation must be 7.

5. **Positioning Garlic**:
   - From Clue 16, Garlic is in the middle (4), which is already taken by Coffee.

6. **Positioning Fanta and Lemonade**:
   - From Clue 14, Fanta is next to Lemonade.
   - From Clue 18, Lemonade > Sports.
     - Possible pairs for Fanta and Lemonade are (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (6, 7).
     - Considering all constraints, the pair (3, 4) fits best as it avoids conflicts with other clues.

7. **Final Arrangement**:
   - Putting everything together, we get:
     - Coffee = 2
     - Satire = 4
     - Water = 6
     - Western = 1
     - Iced-tea = 4 (Coffee is already there, so this is adjusted)
     - Cucumber = 1
     - Comedy = 3
     - Grapefruit = 5
     - Mango = 6
     - Onion = 2
     - Fanta = 3
     - Lemonade = 4
     - Sports = 5
     - Animation = 7

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |    4     |    5    |     6      |     7     |

Lv5-3x7-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each hobby, movie genre, and music genre into the correct positions based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is skydiving.
2. **Clue 2:** The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
3. **Clue 3:** The fan of hip-hop is in the middle.

15. **Clue 15:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.
16. **Clue 16:** The fan of jazz is on the left of the person watching action movies.
17. **Clue 17:** The person watching martial-arts movies is in an odd position.
18. **Clue 18:** The fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies.
19. **Clue 19:** The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the right of the fan of metal.
20. **Clue 20:** The person whose hobby is singing is the fan of blues.

### Filling in the Table:

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct information:

- **Clue 3:** The fan of hip-hop is in the middle (position 4).
- **Clue 20:** The person whose hobby is singing is the fan of blues (Hobby: Singing, Music-Genre: Blues).

Now, let's use these to deduce other positions:

- **Clue 8:** The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of jazz. Since hip-hop is in position 4, jazz must be in either position 5 or 6.
- **Clue 16:** The fan of jazz is on the left of the person watching action movies. So, if jazz is in position 5, action movies must be in position 6.
- **Clue 11:** The person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is photography. If we place photography in position 1, martial-arts can only be in position 3 or 4 (but 4 is taken by hip-hop), so it must be in position 5.
- **Clue 17:** The person watching martial-arts movies is in an odd position. We already placed martial-arts in position 5, which is an odd position.
- **Clue 15:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies. Since puzzles cannot be in position 4 (hip-hop) or 5 (martial-arts), and considering the left or right placement, puzzles could be in position 1, 2, or 3. Romance movies must be to the right of puzzles.
- **Clue 5:** The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is chess. Chess can be in position 1, 2, or 3. Disaster movies must be to the right of chess.
- **Clue 7:** The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is collecting. Collecting can be in position 1, 2, or 3. Documentary movies must be to the right of collecting.

  - Gardening > Zombie Movies (Clue 3) → Gardening = 6, Zombie Movies = 5
  - Coffee > Reading (Clue 11) → Coffee = 4
  - Cola > Fanta (Clue 2) → Cola = 6, Fanta = 5
  - Fanta > Soy-milk (Clue 13) → Already placed
  - Board-Games = 7 (Clue 10)

This doesn't work as it conflicts with other placements.

- If Romance Movies = 3:
  - Tea > Romance Movies (Clue 7) → Tea = 4
  - 7up > Romance Movies (Clue 5) → 7up = 5
  - 7 > Romance Movies (Clue 15) → 7 = 6
  - Superhero Movies < Reading (Clue 18) → Superhero Movies = 1, Reading = 2

  - Gardening > Zombie Movies (Clue 3) → Gardening = 6, Zombie Movies = 5
  - Coffee > Reading (Clue 11) → Coffee = 4
  - Cola > Fanta (Clue 2) → Cola = 6, Fanta = 5
  - Fanta > Soy-milk (Clue 13) → Already placed
  - Board-Games = 7 (Clue 10)

This works out well.
