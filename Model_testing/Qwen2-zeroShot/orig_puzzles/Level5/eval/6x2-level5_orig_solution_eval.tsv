Lv5-6x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly in the table. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clue Analysis

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's sport is swimming is the person driving the snowmobile.
   - This means the person who drives the snowmobile also does swimming.

2. **Clue 2**: The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
   - This means the person drinking sprite is not in column 2 (rightmost column).

3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
   - Since the person driving the snowmobile also does swimming (from Clue 1), and they can be either left or right of the owner of the goldfish.

4. **Clue 4**: The person eating blueberry is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
   - This means the person watching time-travel movies is not in column 2 (rightmost column).

5. **Clue 5**: The person eating blueberry is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - This means the person drinking hot-chocolate is not in column 2 (rightmost column).

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Identify Swimming and Snowmobile
- From Clue 1, the person who drives the snowmobile also does swimming.
- We don't know yet if the person driving the snowmobile is in column 1 or column 2, but we know they do swimming.

#### Step 2: Identify Jet-Ski and Sprite
- From Clue 2, the person drinking sprite is not in column 2.
- Therefore, the person drinking sprite must be in column 1.

#### Step 3: Identify Blueberry and Time-Travel Movies
- From Clue 4, the person eating blueberry is to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
- Therefore, the person watching time-travel movies cannot be in column 2.

#### Step 4: Identify Hot-Chocolate and Blueberry
- From Clue 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate is not in column 2.
- Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in column 1.

#### Step 5: Identify Goldfish and Swimming/Snowmobile
- From Clue 3, the person driving the snowmobile (who does swimming) is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
- Since the person driving the snowmobile is in column 1 (because they do swimming), the owner of the goldfish must be in column 2.

Lv5-6x2-3	"Sure, let's solve this step by step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The Argentine is the person driving the bus.
   - This means the Argentine is in one of the two columns (1 or 2) and the transport is bus.

2. **Clue 2**: The engineer is somewhere to the right of the Argentine.
   - This means if the Argentine is in column 1, the engineer must be in column 2.
   - If the Argentine is in column 2, there would be no room for the engineer to be to the right.

3. **Clue 3**: The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the person eating broccoli.
   - This means the watermelon eater must be in a position before the broccoli eater.

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching adventure movies is in an even position.
   - This means the person watching adventure movies must be in either position 2 or 4.

5. **Clue 5**: The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is the person watching thriller movies.
   - This means the person with rock-climbing as a hobby must also watch thrillers.

Let's start by placing the Argentine and the engineer based on Clues 1 and 2:

- Since the Argentine drives the bus, we can place the Argentine in column 1 and the engineer in column 2.
- This satisfies Clue 2.

Next, we'll consider the food preferences based on Clue 3:

- The person eating watermelon is to the left of the person eating broccoli.
- Therefore, if the Argentine eats broccoli, the person eating watermelon must be in column 1.
- But since the Argentine is in column 1, the person eating watermelon cannot be in column 1, so the person eating watermelon must be in column 1 and the person eating broccoli in column 2.

Now, let's place the movie genres based on Clue 4:

- The person watching adventure movies is in an even position.
- Since the person eating watermelon is in column 1 and the person eating broccoli is in column 2, the person watching adventure movies must be in column 2.
- This means the person watching thriller movies must be in column 1.

Finally, let's place the hobbies and nationalities based on Clue 5:

- The person with rock-climbing as a hobby is watching thrillers.
- Since the person watching thrillers is in column 1, the person with rock-climbing as a hobby is in column 1.
- The remaining hobby, drawing, must be in column 2.
- The remaining nationality, Nigerian, must be in column 1 (since Argentine is already assigned).
- The remaining nationality, Argentine, must be in column 2.
- The remaining job, journalist, must be in column 1 (since engineer is already assigned).
- The remaining job, engineer, must be in column 2.

### Final Solution Table:

Lv5-6x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each category based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues one by one and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The mechanic is on the right of the owner of the dog.**
   - This means if the mechanic is in position 2, the owner of the dog must be in position 1.
   
2. **The person eating peas is on the far right.**
   - This means the person eating peas must be in position 2.

3. **The German is on the far left.**
   - This means the German must be in position 1.

4. **The fan of indie is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.**
   - This means if the person driving the taxi is in position 1, the fan of indie must be in position 2. If the person driving the taxi is in position 2, the fan of indie must be in any position to the right of that (which is not possible since there are only two positions).

Given these constraints, let's start placing the information in the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Nationality:**
   - The German must be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the Russian must be in position 2.

2. **Food:**
   - The person eating peas must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person eating blueberry must be in position 1.

3. **Job:**
   - The mechanic must be on the right of the owner of the dog.
   - Since the German is in position 1, the German cannot be the mechanic or the owner of the dog.
   - Therefore, the Russian must be the mechanic or the owner of the dog.
   - Since the person eating peas is in position 2, the Russian must be the owner of the dog.
   - Therefore, the German must be the mechanic.

4. **Music-Genre:**
   - The fan of indie must be to the right of the person driving the taxi.
   - Since the German is the mechanic and the Russian is the owner of the dog, the German must be driving the taxi.
   - Therefore, the Russian must be the fan of indie.

5. **Pet:**
   - The Russian is the owner of the dog.
   - Therefore, the German must be the owner of the pony.

6. **Transport:**
   - The German is driving the taxi.
   - Therefore, the Russian must be using the ship.

Lv5-6x2-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements accordingly. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

### Clues:
1. The dressmaker is on the right of the photographer.
2. The person eating apple is on the left of the person watching drama movies.
3. The photographer is on the left or right of the Thai.
4. The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is reading.

### Initial Setup:
We have two columns (1 and 2) and six categories (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Nationality). We will fill in the table as we deduce the correct placements based on the clues.

|               |      1       |      2      |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Beverage      |              |             |
| Food          |              |             |
| Hobby         |              |             |
| Job           |              |             |
| Movie-Genre   |              |             |
| Nationality   |              |             |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1: The dressmaker is on the right of the photographer.
This means:
- If the photographer is in column 1, the dressmaker must be in column 2.
- If the photographer is in column 2, the dressmaker must be in column 1.

#### Clue 2: The person eating apple is on the left of the person watching drama movies.
This means:
- The person eating apple must be in a column before the person watching drama movies.

#### Clue 3: The photographer is on the left or right of the Thai.
This means:
- The photographer and Thai cannot be in the same column.
- The photographer can be either left or right of the Thai.

#### Clue 4: The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is reading.
This means:
- The person drinking milk must be in a column before the person with the hobby of reading.

### Deduction Process:

Let's start placing elements based on these clues.

1. **Clue 1**: The dressmaker and photographer relationship.
2. **Clue 2**: Apple and drama movie preference.
3. **Clue 3**: Photographer and Thai relationship.
4. **Clue 4**: Milk and reading hobby relationship.

Since we have limited information, let's assume some initial placements and see if they fit all the clues.

#### Initial Assumption:
- Let's assume the photographer is in column 1 and the dressmaker is in column 2.
- This satisfies Clue 1.

Now, we need to place other elements while ensuring all clues are met.

- Since the photographer is in column 1, the Thai could be in column 1 or 2. However, since the photographer and Thai cannot be in the same column, the Thai must be in column 2.

- Now, the person eating apple must be on the left of the person watching drama movies. Let's place them in columns 1 and 2 respectively.

- The person drinking milk must be to the left of the person whose hobby is reading. Let's place these in columns 1 and 2 respectively.

Given these constraints, one possible arrangement that fits all the clues is:

|               |      1       |      2      |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Beverage      | milk         | almond-milk |
| Food          | apple        | plum        |
| Hobby         | reading      | cooking     |
| Job           | dressmaker   | photographer|
| Movie-Genre   | drama        | spy         |
| Nationality   | Thai         | dutch       |

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |      1       |      2      |

Lv5-6x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's break down the clues one by one:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The person eating apricot is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.**
   - This means if someone eats apricot, they must be in a position that is to the right of someone who prefers volleyball.

2. **The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the fan of reggae.**
   - This means if someone drinks almond-milk, they must be in a position that is to the right of someone who listens to reggae.

3. **The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the left of the project-manager.**
   - This means if someone owns a rabbit, they must be in a position that is to the left of someone who has a job as a project-manager.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Rabbit Owner and Project-Manager
From Clue 3, the owner of the rabbit must be to the left of the project-manager. Therefore, the rabbit owner can only be in positions 1 or 2, and the project-manager must be in the next position (2 or 1 respectively).

#### Step 2: Positioning the Apricot Eater and Volleyball Lover
From Clue 1, the person eating apricot must be to the right of the person who prefers volleyball. Therefore, if the volleyball lover is in position 1, the apricot eater must be in position 2. If the volleyball lover is in position 2, there is no valid position for the apricot eater because it would violate the ""to the right"" condition.

Thus, the volleyball lover must be in position 1, and the apricot eater must be in position 2.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Almond-Milk Drinker and Reggae Listener
From Clue 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be to the right of the fan of reggae. Since we have already placed the apricot eater in position 2, the reggae listener cannot be in position 2. The only remaining position for the reggae listener is position 1, and thus the almond-milk drinker must be in position 2.

#### Step 4: Filling in the Remaining Positions
We now have the following tentative placements:
- Position 1: Volleyball lover, Reggae listener, Almond-milk drinker, Rabbit owner.
- Position 2: Apricot eater, Project-manager.

We need to fill in the remaining categories (beverage, food, job, music genre, pet, sport) for both positions.

Since the only remaining beverage is iced-tea, the iced-tea must be in position 2 (as the almond-milk is in position 2).

The only remaining food is lemon, so the lemon must be in position 1.

The only remaining job is paramedic, so the paramedic must be in position 1.

The only remaining music genre is techno, so the techno must be in position 2.

The only remaining sport is tennis, so the tennis must be in position 1.
