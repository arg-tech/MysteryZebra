#### Positioning Polish and Van
- Polish can only be in positions 4 or 6.
- The person driving the van must be next to the person eating eggplant (3), and the person eating pomegranate must be to the left of the dancer (5).

Let's assume Polish is in position 4:
- The person driving the van must be in position 3 or 5.
- If the van is in position 3, the person eating eggplant must be in position 2.
- If the van is in position 5, the person eating eggplant must be in position 4, which is not possible since Polish is there.

Thus, the van must be in position 3, and the person eating eggplant must be in position 2.

#### Positioning Dancer and Pomegranate
- The dancer eats lettuce, so let's place that.
- The person eating pomegranate must be to the left of the dancer (5), so it can be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Pomegranate
- Position 2: Eggplant
- Position 3: Van
- Position 4: Polish
- Position 5: ?
- Position 6: Analyst

#### Positioning British and Skatedboard
- The British must be to the left of the person driving the skateboard (5), and the person driving the skateboard must be in position 6.
- The person driving the taxi must be between the scientist and the person driving the skateboard (2).

Thus, the person driving the skateboard is in position 6, and the person driving the taxi must be in position 5.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Pomegranate
- Position 2: Eggplant
- Position 3: Van
- Position 4: Polish
- Position 5: Taxi
- Position 6: Skatedboard

#### Positioning Other Elements
- The person driving the tram must be between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the van (2). So, the jet-ski must be in position 2.
- The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the chef (16), so the chef must be in position 3.
- The person eating blueberry is on the left of the Polish (15), so the person eating blueberry must be in position 1.
- The person eating cabbage must be to the right of the person eating pomegranate (18), so the person eating cabbage must be in position 2.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Blueberry
- Position 2: Cabbage
- Position 3: Jet-ski
- Position 4: Polish
- Position 5: Taxi
- Position 6: Skatedboard

#### Nationalities and Jobs
- The person driving the van must be on the left or right of the person eating eggplant (6), and the person driving the van must be the Indonesian (17).
- The person driving the tram must be between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the van (10), and the person driving the tram must be the Russian (20).

So, we have:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 12**: The person with the hobby of writing is on the far left (position 1).
   - Writing: Position 1

2. **Clue 4**: The person driving the taxi is on the far right (position 6).
   - Taxi: Position 6

3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the taxi is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).
   - Since the taxi is in position 6, we need to check other clues for consistency.

4. **Clue 10**: The person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the boat.
   - This implies the person driving the boat is on the left of the person driving the van.

5. **Clue 17**: The person driving the van is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian.
   - The Indonesian cannot be in position 6 because the van is to the right of them and the van is in position 6.

   - Video-games: Position 1, 3, or 5 (but position 1 is taken by writing).

   - Video-games: Position 3 (since it can't be position 1 or 5)

8. **Clue 11**: The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is singing.
   - Since video-games is in position 3, the singing must be in an adjacent position (position 2 or 4).

9. **Clue 13**: The person whose hobby is singing is on the right of the person whose hobby is gardening.
   - If singing is in position 4, gardening must be in position 3 (but video-games is already there). Therefore, singing must be in position 2, and gardening must be in position 1.

10. **Clue 16**: The person whose hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
    - Singing is in position 2, so the owner of the horse must be in position 1.

11. **Clue 2**: The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
    - Horse is in position 1, so the filmmaking must be in position 2.

12. **Clue 20**: The owner of the pony is the person driving the bus.
    - Bus: Position 4

13. **Clue 14**: The person whose hobby is video-games is between the Indonesian and the owner of the hamster.

14. **Clue 19**: The person driving the subway is between the person whose hobby is singing and the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
    - Subway: Position 3 (video-games is in position 3, so it fits).

15. **Clue 9**: The Polish is on the right of the Colombian.
    - Since the Polish cannot be in position 6 (occupied by taxi), they must be in position 5, and the Colombian in position 4.

16. **Clue 6**: The Spanish is on the left of the owner of the dog.
    - Since the Spanish cannot be in position 1 (occupied by writing) or 4 (occupied by Colombian), they must be in position 2, and the owner of the dog in position 4.

17. **Clue 5**: The person driving the subway is on the left of the owner of the dog.
    - Sub: Position 3, Dog: Position 4 (consistent).

18. **Clue 7**: The owner of the dog is in an even position.
    - Dog: Position 4 (consistent).

19. **Clue 8**: The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the person driving the boat.
