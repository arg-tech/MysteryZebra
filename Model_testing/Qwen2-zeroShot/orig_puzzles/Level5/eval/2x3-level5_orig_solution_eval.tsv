Lv5-2x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and place the information into the table step-by-step.

### Clue Breakdown:

1. **The person who's sport is baseball is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means the sport ""baseball"" must be in position 1 or 3.

2. **The owner of the dog is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.**
   - This means if someone plays badminton, the dog owner must be to their right.

3. **The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog.**
   - This means the turtle owner must be to the right of the dog owner.

### Initial Setup:
Let's set up the table with the possible positions for sports and pets.

|         |     1      |   2    |    3     |
|---------|------------|--------|----------|
| Pet     |            |        |          |
| Sport   |            |        |          |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The sport ""baseball"" must be in position 1 or 3.
   - Let's start by placing ""baseball"" in position 1.
   - If we place ""baseball"" in position 1, then the remaining sports (badminton and soccer) must go in positions 2 and 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The owner of the dog is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
   - If ""badminton"" is in position 2, then the dog owner must be in position 3.
   - If ""badminton"" is in position 3, then the dog owner must be in position 2.
   - Since the owner of the turtle is to the right of the dog owner (Clue 3), the only way to satisfy both clues is to have ""badminton"" in position 2 and ""soccer"" in position 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog.
   - With ""badminton"" in position 2 and ""soccer"" in position 3, the dog owner must be in position 2 (since the turtle owner must be to the right of the dog owner).

4. **Assigning Pets**:
   - We now know that the dog owner is in position 2.
   - The turtle owner must be in position 3 (to the right of the dog owner).
   - The remaining pet, the chinchilla, must be in position 1.

### Final Table:

Lv5-2x3-2	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
1. The beverages are: cola, hot-chocolate, juice.
2. The movie genres are: family, satire, scientific.
3. Constraints:
   - The person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person drinking juice.
   - The person drinking juice is to the right of the person watching satire movies.
   - The person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - The person watching family movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Beverage Order
From constraint 3: ""the person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking cola.""
This means cola must be to the left of juice.

From constraint 1: ""the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person drinking juice.""
This means juice must be to the left of hot-chocolate.

From these two constraints, we can deduce the order of beverages:
- Cola (leftmost)
- Juice (middle)
- Hot-Chocolate (rightmost)

So, the beverage order is:
1. Cola
2. Juice
3. Hot-Chocolate

#### Step 2: Determine the Movie Genre Order
From constraint 2: ""the person drinking juice is to the right of the person watching satire movies.""
This means satire must be to the left of juice.

From constraint 4: ""the person watching family movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies.""
This means family must be to the left of scientific.

Given the order from beverage preferences, we can place the movie genres as follows:
- Since satire is to the left of juice, and juice is the second beverage, satire must be the first movie genre.
- Family must be to the left of scientific, and since satire is already placed, family must be the first movie genre, and scientific must be the last.

So, the movie genre order is:
1. Family
2. Satire
3. Scientific

### Final Table:

```
|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | Cola   | Juice  | Hot-Chocolate |
| Movie-Genre   | Family | Satire | Scientific    |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | Cola   | Juice  | Hot-Chocolate |

Lv5-2x3-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the correct arrangement of nationalities and pets. Let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. **The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rat.**
2. **The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat.**
3. **The Chinese is somewhere to the right of the Nigerian.**
4. **The Russian is on the left of the Chinese.**

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Top row (Nationality)
- Position 2: Middle row (Pet)
- Position 3: Bottom row (Nationality)

From Clue 4, we know:
- The Russian must be in Position 1.
- The Chinese must be in Position 3.

Now, let's consider Clues 1 and 2 together:
- The owner of the hamster is to the right of the owner of the rat.
- The owner of the mouse is to the left of the owner of the rat.

This means the order for the pets must be:
- Mouse (leftmost)
- Rat (middle)
- Hamster (rightmost)

From Clue 3:
- The Chinese is to the right of the Nigerian.

Given that the Russian is in Position 1 and the Chinese is in Position 3, the Nigerian must be in Position 2.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Russian
- Position 2: Nigerian
- Position 3: Chinese

And the pets:
- Position 2: Mouse
- Position 3: Rat
- Position 1: Hamster

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1     |    2    |    3    |
| Nationality   | Russian  | Nigerian| Chinese |

Lv5-2x3-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating corn is somewhere to the left of the person eating plum.
2. The person whose sport is biathlon is in the middle.
3. The person eating plum is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is biathlon.
4. The person eating corn is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is golf.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2: Biathlon is in the middle.
This means the person with biathlon must be in position 2.

#### Clue 3: Plum is to the right of biathlon.
Since biathlon is in position 2, plum must be in position 3.

#### Clue 1: Corn is to the left of plum.
Given that plum is in position 3, corn must be in position 1.

#### Clue 4: Corn is to the right of golf.
Since corn is in position 1 and plum is in position 3, golf must be in position 2 (the only remaining position).

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Corn
- Position 2: Golf
- Position 3: Plum
- Sport in position 2 is biathlon (from Clue 2)

Now let's fill in the sports:
- Position 1: Corn
- Position 2: Golf (biathlon)
- Position 3: Plum

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Corn
- Position 2: Golf (biathlon)
- Position 3: Plum

### Final Table:

```

| Food    |  Corn  |  Plum    |  Tomato|
| Sport   |  Golf  | Biathlon|  Soccer|
```

Note: We had three types of food but only two were specified (corn and plum), so the third type, tomato, is assumed to fit into the remaining slot.

```

Lv5-2x3-5	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We have the following constraints:
1. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.
2. The person driving the trike is the Egyptian.
3. The Turkish person is somewhere to the right of the Egyptian.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1: Leftmost
- Position 2: Middle
- Position 3: Rightmost

Given these constraints, we can deduce the following:

1. The person in position 1 drives the scooter.
2. The person in position 3 drives the trike (since the trike driver is the Egyptian).
3. The person in position 2 must be the remaining nationality and the remaining transport mode.

From constraint 3, the Turkish person must be in position 2 or 3, but since the trike driver (Egyptian) is in position 3, the Turkish person must be in position 2.

So, we can fill in the table as follows:

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Nationality   |   Turkish | Spanish  |   Egyptian |
| Transport     |  Scooter | Trike    |  Quad-bike |

Now, let's verify:
- The person in position 1 (leftmost) is driving the scooter.
- The person in position 3 (rightmost) is driving the trike and is the Egyptian.
- The person in position 2 (middle) is the Turkish person, who is to the right of the Egyptian (who is in position 3).

The final solution table is:

```
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Nationality   |   Turkish | Spanish  |   Egyptian |

Lv5-2x3-6	"Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the table step-by-step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the fan of techno.
2. The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.
3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: Rock-climbing and Techno
- The person with rock-climbing as a hobby prefers techno.

#### Clue 2: Dubstep and Dancing
- The person who prefers dubstep is to the left of the person who dances.

#### Clue 3: Rock-climbing and Dancing
- The person who prefers rock-climbing is to the right of the person who dances.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can deduce that the order must be:
- Dancing (left)
- Rock-climbing (right)

Since the person who prefers dubstep is to the left of the dancer, and the person who prefers rock-climbing is to the right of the dancer, the only possible order for the hobbies is:
- Dancing
- Dubstep
- Rock-climbing

Now, let's assign the music genres based on these hobbies:

- The person who dances cannot like techno (from Clue 1).
- The person who dances must like either dubstep or metal.
- The person who likes dubstep is to the left of the dancer, so the person who dances must like metal.
- Therefore, the person who dances likes metal.

This leaves us with:
- The person who dances: Metal
- The person who likes dubstep: Must be to the left of the dancer, so it must be the first position.
- The person who likes rock-climbing: Techno (from Clue 1).

So, the order of hobbies and their corresponding music genres is:
1. Dancing - Metal
2. Dubstep - ?
3. Rock-climbing - Techno

Since the person who likes dubstep is to the left of the person who dances, the only remaining genre for dubstep is techno.

Lv5-2x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
2. The security-guard is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.
3. The software-developer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** Skiing (S) must be to the right of Badminton (B).
   - This means B cannot be in the last position if S is in the middle or last position.
   
2. **Clue 2:** Security-guard (SG) is to the left of Volleyball (V).
   - This means SG cannot be in the last position if V is in the middle or last position.
   
3. **Clue 3:** Software-developer (SD) is to the right of Volleyball (V).
   - This means SD cannot be in the first position if V is in the first position.

Let's start by placing these constraints in the table:

|         |       1        |     2      |         3          |
| Job     |                |            |                    |
| Sport   |                |            |                    |

### Step 1: Positioning Badminton and Skiing

Since Skiing must be to the right of Badminton, we can start with the following possibilities:

- If Badminton is in position 1, then Skiing can only be in position 2 or 3.
- If Badminton is in position 2, then Skiing can only be in position 3.

### Step 2: Positioning Security-guard and Volleyball

- Security-guard must be to the left of Volleyball.
- Software-developer must be to the right of Volleyball.

   - If Skiing is in position 2, Volleyball can only be in position 3.
   - Security-guard can be in position 1 or 2.
   - Software-developer must be in position 3.

2. **Badminton in Position 2:**
   - Skiing must be in position 3.
   - Volleyball can be in position 1 or 3.
   - Security-guard can be in position 1.
   - Software-developer must be in position 3.

Given the constraints, let's try the first configuration:

- Place Badminton in position 1.
- Place Skiing in position 2.
- Place Volleyball in position 3.
- Security-guard in position 1.
- Software-developer in position 3.

This satisfies all the given clues:
- Badminton (B) in position 1.
- Skiing (S) in position 2 (to the right of Badminton).
- Security-guard (SG) in position 1 (to the left of Volleyball).
- Software-developer (SD) in position 3 (to the right of Volleyball).

### Final Table:

Lv5-2x3-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and determine the positions step-by-step.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the fisherman.
2. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
3. The designer is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading.
4. The designer is somewhere to the left of the fisherman.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the fisherman.
   - This means the person with the hobby of drawing cannot be in position 3 (since there would be no one to the right).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
   - This means the person with the hobby of reading must be in position 1 or 2, and the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The designer is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading.
   - This means the designer can be in any position except directly in front of the person with the hobby of reading (since they must be adjacent).

4. **Clue 4:** The designer is somewhere to the left of the fisherman.
   - This means the fisherman cannot be in position 1 (since the designer would not be to the left of him).

### Possible Configurations:

Let's test possible configurations based on these clues:

#### Hypothesis 1:
- **Hobby 1:** Reading
- **Hobby 2:** Drawing
- **Hobby 3:** Baking

- **Job 1:** Designer
- **Job 2:** Fisherman
- **Job 3:** Pilot

- **Analysis:**
  - Clue 1: The person with the hobby of drawing (Hobby 2) is on the left of the fisherman (Job 2). This works since Hobby 2 is in position 2 and Job 2 is in position 3.
  - Clue 2: The person with the hobby of drawing (Hobby 2) is on the right of the person with the hobby of reading (Hobby 1). This works since Hobby 1 is in position 1 and Hobby 2 is in position 2.
  - Clue 3: The designer (Job 1) is on the left or right of the person with the hobby of reading (Hobby 1). This works since Job 1 is in position 1.
  - Clue 4: The designer (Job 1) is to the left of the fisherman (Job 2). This works since Job 1 is in position 1 and Job 2 is in position 3.

This configuration satisfies all the clues.

Lv5-2x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person driving the airplane.
2. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
3. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking coffee.
4. The person driving the scooter is in an odd position (i.e., position 1 or 3).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
Since the person driving the scooter is in an odd position, it can only be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
If the person driving the scooter is in position 1, then the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 2 or 3. If the person driving the scooter is in position 3, then the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
If the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person driving the airplane, then the person driving the airplane cannot be in position 3 if the person drinking lemonade is in position 2 or 3. This implies that the person driving the airplane must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 4: Combine Clues 1 and 4
If the person driving the scooter is in position 1, then the person driving the airplane cannot be in position 1 (since the person drinking lemonade would have to be in position 2 or 3). Therefore, the person driving the airplane must be in position 2 or 3. But since the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person driving the airplane, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3, which contradicts the position of the scooter being 1. Hence, the person driving the scooter must be in position 3.

#### Step 5: Determine Positions for Scooter and Quad-Bike
If the person driving the scooter is in position 3, then the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1 or 2. Since the person driving the scooter is in an odd position, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 2.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 3
The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking coffee. Given the positions, this means the person drinking 7up must be in position 1 and the person drinking coffee must be in position 2.

#### Step 7: Finalize the Table
Given all the clues, we can now fill in the table:

|             |     1     |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage    |  7up      |  Coffee  | Lemonade |

Lv5-2x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The mechanic is on the far left or far right.
2. The fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the fan of house.
3. The fan of house is between the fan of salsa and the fan of reggae.
4. The freelancer is on the left of the mechanic.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Clue 1:** The mechanic is on the far left or far right.
- This means the mechanic can be in position 1 or 3.

**Clue 2:** The fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the fan of house.
- This means if House is at position \(x\), Salsa must be at position \(y\) where \(x < y\).

**Clue 3:** The fan of house is between the fan of salsa and the fan of reggae.
- This means if House is at position \(x\), Salsa at \(y\), and Reggae at \(z\), then \(x < y < z\) or \(z < y < x\).

**Clue 4:** The freelancer is on the left of the mechanic.
- This means if the mechanic is at position 1 or 3, the freelancer must be at position 2.

### Analyzing Possible Positions:

#### Case 1: Mechanic at Position 1
- Freelancer must be at position 2 (since the freelancer is to the left of the mechanic).
- The only remaining position for the mechanic is 3.
- Now we need to place the music genres such that Clues 2 and 3 are satisfied.

- If House is at position 2:
  - Salsa must be at position 3 (since it must be to the right of House).
  - Reggae must be at position 1 (but this contradicts the mechanic being at position 1).
  
- If House is at position 3:
  - Salsa must be at position 2 (since it must be to the right of House).
  - Reggae must be at position 1 (but this contradicts the mechanic being at position 1).

Since both sub-cases lead to contradictions, **Mechanic cannot be at position 1**.

#### Case 2: Mechanic at Position 3
- Freelancer must be at position 2 (since the freelancer is to the left of the mechanic).
- The only remaining position for the mechanic is 1.
- Now we need to place the music genres such that Clues 2 and 3 are satisfied.

- If House is at position 1:
  - Salsa must be at position 2 (since it must be to the right of House).
  - Reggae must be at position 3 (since it must be to the right of Salsa).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- Mechanic is at position 3.
- Freelancer is at position 2.
- House is at position 1.
- Salsa is at position 2.
- Reggae is at position 3.
