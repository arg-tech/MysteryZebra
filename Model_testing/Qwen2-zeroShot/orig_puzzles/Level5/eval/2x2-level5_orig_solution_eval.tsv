Lv5-2x2-1	"Certainly! Let's break down the information provided and solve the puzzle step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two jobs: designer and dressmaker.
2. There are two music genres: dubstep and reggae.
3. The dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the positions:**
   - Since there are only two columns (1 and 2), and we need to place two different jobs and two different music genres, each column must contain one job and one music genre.

2. **Analyze the condition:**
   - The dressmaker must be to the left of the person who likes dubstep. This means that if the dressmaker is in column 1, the person who likes dubstep must be in column 2. If the dressmaker is in column 2, then the person who likes dubstep cannot be in column 1 (since there would be no room for the designer or reggae).

3. **Possible arrangements:**
   - If the dressmaker is in column 1, the person in column 2 must like dubstep.
   - If the dressmaker is in column 2, the person in column 1 must like reggae (since the person who likes dubstep must be to the right).

4. **Assigning the remaining jobs and music genres:**
   - If the dressmaker is in column 1, the designer must be in column 2 and must like reggae.
   - If the dressmaker is in column 2, the designer must be in column 1 and must like dubstep.

Given these constraints, let's fill in the table:

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Job           | Dressmaker | Designer |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae     | Dubstep  |
```

or

```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Job           | Designer   | Dressmaker |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep    | Reggae   |
```

Since both arrangements satisfy the given conditions, we can present either as a valid solution. Here is the first arrangement:

```
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Job           | Dressmaker | Designer |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae     | Dubstep  |

Lv5-2x2-2	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two different pets: goat and lizard.
2. There are two different means of transport: airplane and motorbike.
3. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat.

### Initial Setup:
We need to place the pets and transportation methods in the grid:

|             |    1     |     2     |
| Pet         |          |           |
| Transport   |          |           |

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions:**
   - Position 1 and Position 2 for both pets and transports.

2. **Assign the pets:**
   - We have two pets: goat and lizard.
   - Let's denote them as G (goat) and L (lizard).

3. **Assign the transports:**
   - We have two transports: airplane (A) and motorbike (M).
   - Let's denote them as A (airplane) and M (motorbike).

4. **Apply the given condition:**
   - The person driving the airplane is to the left of the owner of the goat.

### Possible Assignments:

Let's test each possible assignment while keeping the condition in mind.

#### Scenario 1:
- Assume Position 1 has the airplane (A).
- According to the condition, the goat must be in Position 2 (since the airplane is to the left of the goat).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Airplane (A)
- Position 2: Goat (G)

Now, we need to assign the lizard and motorbike:
- Position 1 can't have the motorbike because it needs to be to the left of the goat.
- Therefore, Position 2 must have the motorbike (M), and Position 1 must have the lizard (L).

Final arrangement:
- Position 1: Lizard (L)
- Position 2: Goat (G)
- Position 1: Airplane (A)
- Position 2: Motorbike (M)

This satisfies all conditions:
- The airplane is to the left of the goat.
- The lizard is not driving the airplane.
- The goat is not driving the airplane.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |    1     |     2     |
| Pet         |  Lizard  |  Goat     |
| Transport   |  Airplane| Motorbike |

Lv5-2x2-3	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

Given:
1. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: r&b, rock.
2. The people use 2 different means of transport: boat, subway.
3. The fan of r&b is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.

Let's denote:
- R&B fan as ""R""
- Rock fan as ""K""
- Boat driver as ""B""
- Subway rider as ""S""

We need to place these into the table such that all conditions are satisfied.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions**:
   - There are two rows (Music-Genre and Transport) and two columns (1 and 2).

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The fan of R&B (R) must be to the right of the person driving the boat (B). This means if B is in position 1, R must be in position 2. If B is in position 2, R can be in either position 1 or 2.

3. **Possible Configurations**:
   - Let's consider the possible configurations for B and R, keeping in mind that K and S will fill the remaining slots.

### Configuration 1:
- Assume B is in position 1:
  - R must be in position 2.
  - This leaves K and S for positions 1 and 2 in the other row.

### Configuration 2:
- Assume B is in position 2:
  - R can be in position 1 or 2.
  - If R is in position 1, K and S will fill the remaining slots.
  - If R is in position 2, K and S will fill the remaining slots.

Let's try both configurations:

#### Configuration 1:
- B in position 1, R in position 2:
  - Possible arrangement:
    - Music-Genre: R | K
    - Transport: B | S

#### Configuration 2:
- B in position 2, R in position 1:
  - Possible arrangement:
    - Music-Genre: R | K
    - Transport: S | B

- B in position 2, R in position 2 (invalid since R must be to the right of B):
  - Not possible.

### Final Valid Solution:
The only valid configuration based on the given constraints is:

- Music-Genre: R | K
- Transport: B | S

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |  1   |   2    |
| Music-Genre   |  R   |  K     |
| Transport     |  B   |  S     |

Lv5-2x2-4	"Certainly! Let's break down the information given and place it into the table accordingly.

We have two columns (1 and 2) and two rows (Movie-Genre and Music-Genre). We need to fill these based on the clues provided:

1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: musical, zombie.
2. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: classical, gospel.
3. The fan of gospel is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies.

Let's start by placing the movie genres:

- Since the person who watches musical movies must be to the left of the person who listens to gospel music, we can place ""musical"" in column 1 and ""zombie"" in column 2 for the movie genre row.

Next, let's place the music genres:

- Since the person who listens to gospel music must be to the right of the person who watches musical movies, we can place ""gospel"" in column 2 and ""classical"" in column 1 for the music genre row.

So, the final table will look like this:

```
|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   |   musical |  zombie |
| Music-Genre   |  classical|  gospel |

Lv5-2x2-5	"Certainly! Let's analyze the given information and fill out the table step-by-step.

We have:
- Two nationalities: German and Mexican
- Two means of transport: Bus and Ship

The clue provided is:
- The German is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship.

Given the structure of the table:

|               |    1    |   2    |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| Nationality   |         |        |
| Transport     |         |        |

Let's break down the clue:
- The German must be in position 2 because they are to the right of the person driving the ship.

This means:
- Position 1 must be occupied by the person driving the ship.
- Position 2 must be occupied by the German.

Since there are only two nationalities and two means of transport, the remaining nationality (Mexican) will go into the other transport slot.

Therefore, the Mexican will drive the bus (since the German is driving the ship).

So, the final table looks like this:

```
|               |    1    |   2    |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| Nationality   | Mexican | German |
| Transport     | Ship    | Bus    |

Lv5-2x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the information given and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

### Given Information:
1. There are two different beverages: almond-milk and milk.
2. There are two different jobs: pilot and project-manager.
3. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the pilot.

### Possible Arrangements:

We need to place the beverages and jobs in the grid such that the third condition is satisfied.

#### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Person drinking almond-milk must be to the right of the pilot.**
   - This means if the pilot is in position 1, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2.
   - If the pilot is in position 2, there would be no room for the person drinking almond-milk to be to the right of the pilot.

So, we can conclude:
- The pilot must be in position 1.
- The person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2.

2. **Assigning the remaining beverage and job:**
   - Since the person in position 1 (pilot) drinks milk (the only other option after assigning almond-milk to position 2), the person in position 2 must drink almond-milk.
   - The person in position 2 (project-manager) drinks almond-milk, and the person in position 1 (pilot) drinks milk.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |   1   |        2        |
| Beverage   |  Milk | Almond-milk     |
| Job        | Pilot | Project-manager |
```

### Final Answer:

```
|            |   1   |        2        |
| Beverage   |  Milk | Almond-milk     |
| Job        | Pilot | Project-manager |

Lv5-2x2-7	"Certainly! Let's break down the given information and constraints to solve the puzzle.

We have:
- Two beverages: iced-tea and tea.
- Two movie genres: crime and romance.
- The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.

We need to fill the table accordingly:

|               |   1   |    2     |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Beverage      |       |          |
| Movie-Genre   |       |          |

Given that the person drinking tea must be to the left of the person watching romance movies, there are only two possible configurations for this pair:

1. Tea in position 1, Romance in position 2.
2. Iced-tea in position 1, Tea in position 2, with Romance in position 2 (but this would violate the condition since it places Tea and Romance in the same position).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:

Lv5-2x2-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish.

### Analysis:

Given that there are only two columns (1 and 2) and two rows (Beverage and Pet), we can represent the possible combinations as follows:

|            |   1   |    2     |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Beverage   |       |          |
| Pet        |       |          |

We need to place ""soy-milk"" and ""water"" in the Beverage column and ""fish"" and ""hedgehog"" in the Pet column while satisfying the given clue.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish.
   - This means if the fish is in column 1, then soy-milk must be in column 2.
   - If the fish is in column 2, then soy-milk could be in either column 1 or 2, but it must still be to the right of the fish.

Let's consider the possibilities:

- **If the fish is in column 1:**
  - Then soy-milk must be in column 2.
  - Water would have to be in column 1 for beverages.
  - Hedgehog would have to be in column 2 for pets.

This gives us:
|            |   1   |    2     |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Beverage   | water | soy-milk |
| Pet        | fish  | hedgehog |

- **If the fish is in column 2:**
  - Soy-milk could be in either column 1 or 2, but it must still be to the right of the fish.
  - However, since there is no column to the right of column 2, this scenario is not possible.

Thus, the only valid solution is:

|            |   1   |    2     |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Beverage   | water | soy-milk |
| Pet        | fish  | hedgehog |

### Final Solution:

```
|            |   1   |    2     |
|------------|-------|----------|
