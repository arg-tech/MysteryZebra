Lv5-4x3-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the Japanese.**
   - This means the Japanese cannot be in position 3 (the last position).

2. **The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hamster.**
   - This means the owner of the hamster cannot be in position 1.

3. **The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the Thai.**
   - This means the Thai cannot be in position 3 (the last position).

4. **The Japanese is in an odd position.**
   - The Japanese can only be in position 1 or 2.

5. **The Thai is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.**
   - This means the person drinking water cannot be in position 3 (the last position).

6. **The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.**
   - This means the person drinking sprite must be in a position to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

7. **The person eating cranberry is between the person eating corn and the owner of the snake.**
   - This means the person eating corn must be to the left of the person eating cranberry, and the owner of the snake must be to the right of the person eating cranberry.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Japanese
- Since the Japanese is in an odd position, they can only be in position 1 or 2.
- If the Japanese were in position 1, then the person drinking sprite would have to be in position 2 or 3. However, since the Thai cannot be in position 3 (clue 3), the sprite drinker cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the Japanese must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- **Position 1: Japanese**

#### Step 2: Positioning the Sprite Drinker
- The person drinking sprite must be to the right of the Japanese.
- Therefore, the sprite drinker must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Thai
- The Thai cannot be in position 3 (clue 3).
- The Thai must be to the right of the person drinking water (clue 5).
- Therefore, the Thai can only be in position 2.

So, we have:
- **Position 2: Thai**

#### Step 4: Positioning the Water Drinkers
- The person drinking water cannot be in position 3 (clue 5).
- The person drinking water must be to the left of the Thai.
- Therefore, the person drinking water must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- **Position 1: Japanese (drinking water)**
- **Position 2: Thai**

#### Step 5: Positioning the Sprite Drinker
- The sprite drinker must be to the right of the Japanese.
- Therefore, the sprite drinker must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- **Position 3: Sprite**

#### Step 6: Positioning the Ferret Owner
- The owner of the ferret must be to the right of the Thai (clue 3).
- Therefore, the owner of the ferret must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- **Position 3: Sprite (drinking by the owner of the ferret)**

#### Step 7: Filling in the Remaining Information
- We now know the beverage for positions 1, 2, and 3.
- The remaining beverages are almond-milk and corn.
- The person drinking almond-milk must be to the left of the person drinking sprite (clue 6).
- Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1 (Japanese), and the person drinking corn must be in position 2 (Thai).

So, we have:
- **Position 1: Japanese (drinking water, eating corn)**
- **Position 2: Thai (eating corn)**
- **Position 3: Sprite (drinking by the owner of the ferret, eating watermelon)**

- The remaining pet is the hamster, which must be owned by the person in position 2 (Thai).

So, we have:
- **Position 1: Japanese (drinking water, eating corn)**
- **Position 2: Thai (eating corn, owning the hamster)**
- **Position 3: Sprite (drinking by the owner of the ferret, eating watermelon)**

- The remaining food is the cranberry, which must be eaten by the person in position 3 (Thai).

So, we have:
- **Position 1: Japanese (drinking water, eating corn)**
- **Position 2: Thai (eating corn, owning the hamster, eating cranberry)**
- **Position 3: Sprite (drinking by the owner of the ferret, eating watermelon)**

- The remaining nationality is the Chinese, which must be the person in position 1 (Japanese).

So, we have:
- **Position 1: Japanese (drinking water, eating corn, nationality: Chinese)**
- **Position 2: Thai (eating corn, owning the hamster, eating cranberry, nationality: Thai)**
- **Position 3: Sprite (drinking by the owner of the ferret, eating watermelon, nationality: Japanese)**

- The remaining pet is the snake, which must be owned by the person in position 3 (Sprite).

So, we have:
- **Position 1: Japanese (drinking water, eating corn, nationality: Chinese)**
- **Position 2: Thai (eating corn, owning the hamster, eating cranberry, nationality: Thai)**
- **Position 3: Sprite (drinking almond-milk, eating watermelon, owning the snake, nationality: Japanese)**

Lv5-4x3-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
3. **Clue 3:** The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues.
5. **Clue 5:** The fan of reggae is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning Hobbies
- From Clue 1, rock-climbing must be in position 1, and sudoku must be in position 3.
- This means the hobby sequence is: Rock-climbing (1), _, Sudoku (3).

#### Step 2: Positioning Pets
- From Clue 2, the mouse must be to the left of the chinchilla.
- Given the hobby positions, the mouse and chinchilla cannot be in positions 3 and 1 respectively because rock-climbing (1) and sudoku (3) are fixed.
- Therefore, the mouse and chinchilla must be in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- Since rock-climbing (1) cannot be the owner of the mouse, the mouse must be in position 2 and the chinchilla in position 3.
- This means the pet sequence is: Mouse (2), Chinchilla (3).

#### Step 3: Positioning Beverages
- From Clue 3, the person drinking milk must be to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
- Since the chinchilla is in position 3, milk must be in position 3.
- This leaves 7up and sprite for positions 1 and 2.
- From Clue 4, the person drinking sprite must be to the right of the fan of blues.
- Since milk (which is not sprite) is in position 3, sprite must be in position 2.
- This leaves 7up for position 1.
- This means the beverage sequence is: 7up (1), Sprite (2), Milk (3).

#### Step 4: Positioning Music-Genres
- From Clue 5, the fan of reggae must be to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku.
- Since the hobby sequence is rock-climbing (1), _, Sudoku (3), reggae must be in position 1.
- This leaves blues and folk for positions 2 and 3.
- From Clue 4, the person drinking sprite (position 2) must be to the right of the fan of blues.
- Therefore, blues must be in position 2 and folk in position 3.
- This means the music-genre sequence is: Reggae (1), Blues (2), Folk (3).

Lv5-4x3-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:
1. **The fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the fan of hip-hop.**
2. **The person watching western movies is the Spanish.**
3. **The person watching western movies is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.**
4. **The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person eating cauliflower.**
5. **The Turkish is on the far right.**
6. **The person watching epic movies is on the right of the Spanish.**
7. **The person eating peas is somewhere to the left of the fan of hip-hop.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The Turkish is on the far right.
   - This means the Turkish person is in position 3 for all categories (food, movie genre, music genre).

2. **Clue 2 & Clue 3:** The person watching western movies is the Spanish and is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.
   - Since the Spanish is on the left of the fan of hip-hop, and the Turkish is on the far right, the Spanish must be in position 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 6:** The person watching epic movies is on the right of the Spanish.
   - If the Spanish is in position 1, then the person watching epic movies must be in position 2 or 3. But since the Turkish is in position 3, the Spanish must be in position 1 and the person watching epic movies must be in position 2.
   - If the Spanish is in position 2, then the person watching epic movies would have to be in position 3, but this contradicts clue 5 (Turkish is in position 3). So, the Spanish must be in position 1 and the person watching epic movies must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 2 & Clue 3 Revisited:** The person watching western movies is the Spanish and is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.
   - With the Spanish in position 1, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2 or 3. Since the person watching epic movies is in position 2, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 3 (Turkish is in position 3, so it fits).

5. **Clue 1 & Clue 7:** The fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the fan of hip-hop, and the person eating peas is somewhere to the left of the fan of hip-hop.
   - Since the fan of hip-hop is in position 3, the fan of reggae must be in position 1 or 2. Given that the Spanish is in position 1, the fan of reggae cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the fan of reggae must be in position 2.
   - The person eating peas must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Spanish is in position 1 and the fan of reggae is in position 2, the person eating peas must be in position 1.

6. **Clue 4:** The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person eating cauliflower.
   - The person eating cauliflower must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Spanish is in position 1 and the person eating peas is in position 1, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2. Therefore, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 3 (Turkish is in position 3).

7. **Clue 4 Revisited:** The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person eating cauliflower.
   - With the person eating cauliflower in position 2 and the person watching fantasy movies in position 3, the person eating mango (the remaining food) must be in position 1.

8. **Final Assignment:**
   - Position 1: Spanish, eating mango, watching fantasy movies.
   - Position 2: Turkish, eating cauliflower, watching epic movies.
   - Position 3: Argentine, eating peas, watching western movies.

   Let's denote:
   - Trike (Tr) as right of Jet-ski (J)
   - Airplane (A) as left of Mystery (M)

### Arranging the Information:

Given the constraints, let's start with the sports:
- Since C is left of Su, and S is left of J, we can place them in order. Also, since S is either left or right of T, we need to consider both possibilities.

#### Scenario 1: S is left of T
- S (left), T (middle), C (right), Su

#### Scenario 2: T is left of S
- T (left), S (middle), C (right), Su

Now, let's consider the movie genres:
- F is left of Soul (Soul), and also left or right of M.

#### Scenario 1: F is left of Soul
- F (left), Soul (middle), M (right)

#### Scenario 2: F is right of Soul
- M (left), Soul (middle), F (right)

Finally, let's consider the transport:
- Tr is right of J, and A is left of M.

#### Scenario 1: A is left of M
- A (left), M (middle), Soul (right), Tr (right of J)

#### Scenario 2: A is left of F
- A (left), F (middle), Soul (right), Tr (right of J)

Combining all these, we need to fit everything together:

Lv5-4x3-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The Polish is on the left of the person eating pomegranate.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the owner of the rat.
3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the rat is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person who's sport is volleyball.
4. **Clue 4**: The person eating lettuce is on the right of the owner of the fish.
5. **Clue 5**: The owner of the fish is somewhere to the left of the Polish.
6. **Clue 6**: The Pakistani is on the far left.

From Clue 6, we know:
- **Position 1 (leftmost)**: Pakistani

From Clue 5, since the Pakistani is on the far left, the owner of the fish must be to the left of the Polish. Given that the Pakistani cannot be the owner of the fish (as there is no position to the left of the Pakistani), the owner of the fish must be in Position 2 or 3.

From Clue 1, the Polish must be to the right of the person eating pomegranate. Since the Pakistani is in Position 1, the Polish must be either in Position 2 or 3, with the person eating pomegranate to the left of the Polish.

From Clue 3, the owner of the rat is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person who's sport is volleyball. This means the order must be: Weightlifting, Rat, Volleyball.

From Clue 4, the person eating lettuce is on the right of the owner of the fish. Therefore, if the owner of the fish is in Position 2, the person eating lettuce must be in Position 3. If the owner of the fish is in Position 3, then the person eating lettuce would be in Position 4, which is not possible as there are only three positions.

Combining all these clues, let's try to place the items:

- **Position 1 (Pakistani)**: Can't be the owner of the fish.
- **Position 2 (Fish owner)**: Must be to the left of the Polish.
- **Position 3 (Person eating pomegranate)**: Must be to the left of the Polish.
- **Position 4 (Lettuce eater)**: Must be to the right of the Fish owner.

Given the above, let's deduce further:

- The Polish must be in Position 3 because the person eating pomegranate (Position 2) is to the left of the Polish.
- The person who's sport is volleyball must be in Position 4 because the owner of the rat (in Position 3) is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person who's sport is volleyball.

Now, let's fill in the table based on these deductions:

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |     4     |
|---------------|---------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Food          |               | Pomegranate |            | Lettuce   |
| Nationality   | Pakistani     |          | Polish      |           |
| Pet           |               |          | Rat         |           |
| Sport         |               |          | Weightlifting | Volleyball |

Since the Polish is in Position 3 and the person eating pomegranate is in Position 2, the only sport left for Position 1 is weightlifting. The owner of the rat (Position 3) is between weightlifting and volleyball, so the only sport left for Position 4 is volleyball.

Finally, the person eating lettuce (Position 4) is to the right of the fish owner (Position 2). The only food left is lettuce.

So, the final solution is:

Lv5-4x3-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each clue and systematically place the information into the table.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating strawberry.**
2. **The person watching action movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating corn.**
3. **The fan of classical is on the left of the person eating corn.**
4. **The person whose sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is swimming.**
5. **The person whose sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical.**
6. **The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions based on the clues:
- From clue 2, ""The person watching action movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating corn.""
- From clue 3, ""The fan of classical is on the left of the person eating corn.""

This means that the person eating corn must be in position 3 (the rightmost position), because it is the only position that can accommodate both the fan of classical and the person watching action movies to its left.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3     |
| Food          |            |           | strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   | action     |           | sports   |
| Music-Genre   | classical  |           |          |
| Sport         | swimming   |           | biathlon|
```

#### Step 2: Place the sports and music genres:
- From clue 4, ""The person whose sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is swimming.""
- From clue 6, ""The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa.""

Since the person eating strawberry is in position 3, the person watching sports movies must be in position 1 or 2. Let’s assume the person watching sports movies is in position 1 (we will verify later if necessary).

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3     |
| Food          |            |           | strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   | sports     |           | sports   |
| Music-Genre   | classical  |           |          |
| Sport         | swimming   |           | biathlon|
```

Now, from clue 6, ""The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa,"" we know the person watching sports movies (position 1) must be to the left of the fan of salsa.

From clue 5, ""The person whose sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical,"" and since the fan of classical is in position 3, the person with lacrosse must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is taken by the person watching sports movies, so the person with lacrosse must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3     |
| Food          |            | lacrosse  | strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   | sports     |           | sports   |
| Music-Genre   | classical  |           |          |
| Sport         | swimming   | lacrosse  | biathlon|
```

Finally, from clue 5, ""The person whose sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical,"" and since the fan of classical is in position 3, the lacrosse must be in position 2.

And from clue 6, ""The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa,"" and since the person watching sports movies is in position 1, the fan of salsa must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3     |
| Food          | corn       | lacrosse  | strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   | sports     |          action| sports   |
| Music-Genre   | classical  | disco      |          |
| Sport         | swimming   | lacrosse  | biathlon|
```

We need to fill in the remaining genres:
- The person watching action movies must be in position 2 (since it's to the left of corn).
- The fan of classical is in position 3.
- The person watching sports movies is in position 1 (as per clue 6).

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |    3     |
| Food          | corn       | lacrosse  | strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   | sports     | action    | sports   |
| Music-Genre   | classical  | disco     | salsa    |
| Sport         | swimming   | lacrosse  | biathlon|
```"	{'food': ['corn', 'lacrosse', 'strawberry'], 'movie-genre': ['sports', 'action', 'sports'], 'music-genre': ['classical', 'disco', 'salsa'], 'sport': ['swimming', 'lacrosse', 'biathlon']}	True	2	False
Lv5-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Summary:
1. The person eating tomato is on the far left or far right.
2. The person whose hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is dancing.
3. The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person whose hobby is dancing.
4. The person eating tomato is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapefruit.
5. The owner of the ferret is on the far left or far right.
6. The Argentine is on the far left.
7. The owner of the goat is between the owner of the lizard and the person eating grapefruit.
8. The Dutch is on the far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 6 and Clue 8
- **Clue 6:** The Argentine is on the far left.
- **Clue 8:** The Dutch is on the far right.

So, we can place these two directly:
```
|       |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Food  |            |         |         |
| Hobby |            |         |         |
| Nat.  | Argentine  |         | Dutch   |
| Pet   |            |         |         |
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- **Clue 1:** The person eating tomato is on the far left or far right.
Since the Argentine is already on the far left, the person eating tomato must be on the far right (position 3).

So, we update our table:
```
|       |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Food  |            |         | tomato  |
| Hobby |            |         |         |
| Nat.  | Argentine  |         | Dutch   |
| Pet   |            |         |         |
```

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 5
- **Clue 5:** The owner of the ferret is on the far left or far right.
Since the Argentine is on the far left and the person eating tomato is on the far right, the owner of the ferret must be in position 2.

So, we update our table:
```
|       |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Food  |            |         | tomato  |
| Hobby |            |         |         |
| Nat.  | Argentine  |         | Dutch   |
| Pet   | ferret     |         |         |
```

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 7
- **Clue 7:** The owner of the goat is between the owner of the lizard and the person eating grapefruit.
This means the owner of the goat must be in position 2 (since positions 1 and 3 are taken by the Argentine and the person eating tomato respectively).

So, we update our table:
```
|       |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Food  |            | goat    | tomato  |
| Hobby |            |         |         |
| Nat.  | Argentine  |         | Dutch   |
| Pet   | ferret     |         |         |
```

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 4
- **Clue 4:** The person eating tomato is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapefruit.
Since the person eating tomato is in position 3, the person eating grapefruit must be in position 1.

So, we update our table:
```
|       |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Food  | grapefruit | goat    | tomato  |
| Hobby |            |         |         |
| Nat.  | Argentine  |         | Dutch   |
| Pet   | ferret     |         |         |
```

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 3
- **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is dancing.
- **Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person whose hobby is dancing.

Given that the Argentine is on the far left and the Dutch is on the far right, the only positions left for hobbies are 2 and 3. Since the person whose hobby is writing must be to the left of the person whose hobby is dancing, and the person whose hobby is puzzles must be to the left of the person whose hobby is dancing, we can place the hobbies as follows:

- Position 2: puzzles
- Position 3: writing

So, we update our table:
```
|       |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Food  | grapefruit | goat    | tomato  |
| Hobby | puzzles    |         | writing |
| Nat.  | Argentine  |         | Dutch   |
| Pet   | ferret     |         |         |
```

#### Step 7: Determine the Pets
- The owner of the goat is between the owner of the lizard and the person eating grapefruit.
- The only pet left is the lizard, so the owner of the lizard must be in position 2.

So, we update our table:
```
|       |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Food  | grapefruit | goat    | tomato  |
| Hobby | puzzles    |         | writing |
| Nat.  | Argentine  |         | Dutch   |
| Pet   | ferret     | lizard  |         |
```

- The remaining pet is the ferret, which must belong to the Argentine (since the ferret is already assigned to position 1).

So, we update our table:
```
|       |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Food  | grapefruit | goat    | tomato  |
| Hobby | puzzles    |         | writing |
| Nat.  | Argentine  |         | Dutch   |
| Pet   | ferret     | lizard  | goat    |
```

Finally, the complete table is:

```
|       |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Food  | grapefruit | goat    | tomato  |
| Hobby | puzzles    |         | writing |
| Nat.  | Argentine  |         | Dutch   |
| Pet   | ferret     | lizard  | goat    |

Lv5-4x3-9	"Let's break down the clues step by step and use logical deduction to fill in the table.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
2. The fan of house is the person who's sport is cricket.
3. The person eating spinach is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
4. The person eating pomegranate is the person who's hobby is reading.
5. The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient.
6. The person eating kale is on the right of the fan of house.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 4:
- **Pomegranate** → **Reading**

So, we can place ""Pomegranate"" in position 1 under ""Food"" and ""Reading"" in position 1 under ""Hobby"".

```
|               |      1       |    2    |      3      |
| Food          | Pomegranate  |         |             |
| Hobby         | Reading      |         |             |
| Music-Genre   |              |         |             |
| Sport         |              |         |             |
```

#### Clue 2:
- **House** → **Cricket**

So, we can place ""House"" in position 1 under ""Music-Genre"" and ""Cricket"" in position 1 under ""Sport"".

```
|               |      1       |    2    |      3      |
| Food          | Pomegranate  |         |             |
| Hobby         | Reading      |         |             |
| Music-Genre   | House        |         |             |
| Sport         | Cricket      |         |             |
```

#### Clue 6:
- **Kale** → **House's fan (Cricket)**'s right

Since ""House"" is in position 1 for ""Music-Genre"", the fan of ""House"" (which is ""Cricket"") must be in position 1 for ""Sport"". Therefore, ""Kale"" must be in position 2 for ""Food"".

```
|               |      1       |    2    |      3      |
| Food          | Pomegranate  | Kale    |             |
| Hobby         | Reading      |         |             |
| Music-Genre   | House        |         |             |
| Sport         | Cricket      |         |             |
```

#### Clue 3:
- The person eating spinach is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.

Since ""Snowboarding"" must be in position 3 for ""Sport"", the person eating spinach must be in position 3 for ""Food"".

```
|               |      1       |    2    |      3      |
| Food          | Pomegranate  | Kale    | Spinach     |
| Hobby         | Reading      |         |             |
| Music-Genre   | House        |         |             |
| Sport         | Cricket      |         | Snowboarding|
```

#### Clue 1:
- The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.

Since ""Pomegranate"" is in position 1 for ""Food"", the person with ""Drawing"" as a hobby must be in position 2 or 3 for ""Hobby"".

#### Clue 5:
- The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient.

Since ""Drawing"" must be to the right of ""Ambient"", ""Ambient"" must be in position 1 for ""Music-Genre"" and ""Drawing"" in position 2 for ""Hobby"".

```
|               |      1       |    2    |      3      |
| Food          | Pomegranate  | Kale    | Spinach     |
| Hobby         | Reading      | Drawing |             |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient      | House   |             |
| Sport         | Cricket      |         | Snowboarding|
```

#### Final Check:
- Clue 6 confirms that ""Kale"" is correctly placed to the right of ""Cricket"".

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|               |      1       |    2    |      3      |
| Food          | Pomegranate  | Kale    | Spinach     |
| Hobby         | Reading      | Drawing |             |

Lv5-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The fan of house is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
2. **Clue 2**: The fan of house is somewhere to the right of the fan of jazz.
3. **Clue 3**: The Thai is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
4. **Clue 4**: The Thai is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the Australian.
6. **Clue 6**: The person eating pear is between the person who's hobby is writing and the person eating lettuce.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 5:
- The person with the hobby of video-games is on the right of the Australian.
- This means the Australian cannot be in position 3 (the rightmost position).

#### Clue 3 & Clue 4:
- The Thai is on the right of the person with the hobby of video-games.
- The Thai is also somewhere to the right of the person with the hobby of skydiving.
- Therefore, the person with the hobby of skydiving must be on the left of the Thai, and the person with the hobby of video-games must be on the right of the Thai.

#### Clue 1 & Clue 2:
- The fan of house is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
- The fan of house is to the right of the fan of jazz.

#### Clue 6:
- The person eating pear is between the person who's hobby is writing and the person eating lettuce.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the elements:

1. Let's assume the Thai is in position 3 (since they need to be to the right of the person with the hobby of video-games, who can't be in position 3).
2. Since the Thai is in position 3, the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 2.
3. The person with the hobby of skydiving must be in position 1 because it needs to be to the left of the Thai.

So far, we have:
- Position 1: Skydiving
- Position 2: Video-games
- Position 3: Thai

Now, using Clue 5, the Australian cannot be in position 3 (Thai) or position 2 (video-games), so the Australian must be in position 1, but that conflicts with the skydiving. Thus, the Australian must be in position 2, which is not possible since the video-games are already there. So, the Australian must be in position 3 (Thai).

This leaves us with:
- Position 1: Skydiving
- Position 2: Video-games
- Position 3: Australian

Now, using Clue 3 and Clue 4, the Thai (position 3) must be to the right of the person with the hobby of video-games (position 2). This fits perfectly.

Next, let's place the food:
- Clue 6 states that the person eating pear is between the person who's hobby is writing and the person eating lettuce.
- If the person with the hobby of writing is in position 1, then the person eating pear must be in position 2, and the person eating lettuce must be in position 3.

But we already placed the video-games in position 2 and the Australian in position 3. So, the writing must be in position 3, pear in position 2, and lettuce in position 1.

Finally, using Clue 1 and Clue 2:
- The fan of house must be either in position 1 or 2, and it must be to the right of the fan of jazz.
- Since the person eating raspberry is in position 1, the fan of house must be in position 2, and the fan of jazz must be in position 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Skydiving, Australian, Lettuce, Jazz
- Position 2: Video-games, Writing, Pear, House
- Position 3: Thai, Skydiving, Raspberry

Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |
| Food          | Lettuce    | Pear        | Raspberry |
| Hobby         | Skydiving  | Writing     | Video-games|
| Music-Genre   | Jazz       | House       |           |
| Nationality   | Australian | Thai        |           |
