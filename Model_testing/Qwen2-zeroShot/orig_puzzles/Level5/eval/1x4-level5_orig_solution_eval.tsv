Lv5-1x4-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and place the means of transport in the correct positions.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.**
   - This means the taxi cannot be in position 4 (the last position), and the airplane must be to the right of the taxi.

2. **The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.**
   - This means the ship must be to the right of the airplane.

3. **The person driving the airplane is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the helicopter.**
   - This means the order must be taxi, airplane, helicopter, or taxi, airplane, helicopter with some other arrangement that fits within the constraints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 1, the taxi cannot be in position 4.
2. From clue 2, the ship must be to the right of the airplane.
3. From clue 3, the airplane must be between the taxi and the helicopter.

Let's start by placing the taxi and the airplane based on these clues:

- If we place the taxi in position 1, then the airplane must be in position 2 or 3 (because it needs to be between the taxi and the helicopter, and to the right of the taxi).
- If we place the taxi in position 2, then the airplane must be in position 3 (because it needs to be between the taxi and the helicopter, and to the right of the taxi).

Let's try placing the taxi in position 1 and see if we can fit everything:

- Position 1: Taxi
- Position 2: Airplane
- Position 3: Helicopter
- Position 4: Ship

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The taxi is in position 1.
- The airplane is in position 2, which is to the right of the taxi.
- The airplane is in position 2, which is to the left of the ship in position 4.
- The airplane is between the taxi in position 1 and the helicopter in position 3.

Thus, the final solution is:

```

Lv5-1x4-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far left or far right.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3** tells us that the person with rock-climbing can only be in position 1 (far left) or 4 (far right).

2. **Clue 4** states that the person with rock-climbing is to the right of the person with reading. This means if rock-climbing is in position 4, then reading cannot be in position 4 or 3. If rock-climbing is in position 1, then reading must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 1** states that the person with rock-climbing is to the right of the person with writing. This means if rock-climbing is in position 4, then writing must be in position 1, 2, or 3. If rock-climbing is in position 1, then writing must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 2** states that the person with writing is to the right of the person with filmmaking. This means writing cannot be in position 1, and filmmaking must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

### Combining the Clues:

- If rock-climbing is in position 1 (far left):
  - Writing must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1).
  - Filmmaking must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4 since rock-climbing is in 1).
  - Reading must be in position 2 or 3 (since rock-climbing is in 1 and it has to be to the right of reading).

Let's test this configuration:
- Position 1: Rock-climbing
- Position 2: Writing
- Position 3: Filmmaking
- Position 4: Reading

This satisfies all the given clues:
- Clue 1: Rock-climbing (1) is to the right of writing (2).
- Clue 2: Writing (2) is to the right of filmmaking (3).
- Clue 3: Rock-climbing is at the far left (1).
- Clue 4: Rock-climbing (1) is to the right of reading (4).

### Final Solution Table:

Lv5-1x4-3	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. **The dressmaker is on the right of the librarian.**
   - This means the librarian cannot be in position 4 (the far right), and the dressmaker must be in a position to the right of the librarian.

2. **The dressmaker is on the far left or far right.**
   - From this clue, we know that the dressmaker can only be in positions 1 or 4.

3. **The architect is the architect.**
   - This is just stating that the person in position 3 is an architect.

4. **The architect is somewhere to the right of the writer.**
   - Since the architect is in position 3, the writer must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine these clues:

- The dressmaker can only be in position 1 or 4.
- If the dressmaker is in position 1, then the librarian must be in position 2 or 3, but since the architect is in position 3, the librarian cannot be in position 3. So, the librarian must be in position 2, and the dressmaker is in position 1.
- This leaves position 4 for the writer, and position 3 for the architect.

So, the arrangement is:
- Position 1: Dressmaker
- Position 2: Librarian
- Position 3: Architect
- Position 4: Writer

Final solution table:

```

Lv5-1x4-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and determine the correct order of hobbies for the four positions.

### Clues:
1. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
2. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
3. The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 2:
- Skydiving must be to the left of Sudoku.
- Possible positions for Skydiving and Sudoku: (Skydiving, Sudoku) = (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)

#### Clue 1:
- Given Clue 2, we can narrow down the possible positions further:
  - If Skydiving is at position 1, Sudoku can only be at position 2, 3, or 4.
  - If Skydiving is at position 2, Sudoku can only be at position 3 or 4.
  - If Skydiving is at position 3, Sudoku can only be at position 4.
  
  Let's consider these cases:
  - **Case 1:** Skydiving at 1, Sudoku at 2, 3, or 4.
  - **Case 2:** Skydiving at 2, Sudoku at 3 or 4.
  - **Case 3:** Skydiving at 3, Sudoku at 4.

#### Clue 3:
- Baking must be to the right of Sudoku.
- This means if Sudoku is at 2, Baking can be at 3 or 4.
- If Sudoku is at 3, Baking can only be at 4.
- If Sudoku is at 4, Baking cannot be placed as there are no positions to the right.

### Combining All Clues:
- From Clue 2 and Clue 1, the most consistent and logical order that satisfies all clues is:
  - Skydiving at 1, Sudoku at 2, Baking at 3, Video-games at 4.

### Final Solution Table:

```

```

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:
- Skydiving (1) is to the left of Sudoku (2).
- Sudoku (2) is to the left of Baking (3).
- Baking (3) is to the right of Sudoku (2).

Thus, the final solution is:

```

Lv5-1x4-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the given clues step-by-step and place the movie genres in their respective positions.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The person watching crime movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching epic movies.
2. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.
3. The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1:
- This means that if we denote the order as S (scientific), C (crime), E (epic), A (action), then the possible orders are:
  - S, C, E, A
  - E, C, S, A

#### Clue 2:
- The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.
  - Therefore, S must be before A.

#### Clue 3:
- The person watching scientific movies is to the right of the person watching epic movies.
  - Therefore, E must be before S.

Combining these clues, we can deduce the only possible order that satisfies all conditions:
- E must come before S.
- S must come before A.
- C must be between S and E.

Given these constraints, the only valid order is:
- E, C, S, A

### Final Solution Table:

Lv5-1x4-6	"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement of hobbies.

1. The person who's hobby is chess is in an even position.
   - This means chess can be in either position 2 or 4.

2. The person who's hobby is writing is on the far left or far right.
   - This means writing can be in position 1 or 4.

3. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess.
   - If chess is in position 2, then sudoku must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If chess is in position 4, then sudoku must be in position 3 (since it cannot be in position 4 as it would violate the rule that it must be to the right of chess).

4. The person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This means baking cannot be in position 4 if sudoku is in position 3 (because it would violate the rule that sudoku must be to the right of baking).

Given these constraints, let's test the possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Chess in Position 2
- If chess is in position 2, then:
  - Writing must be in position 1 (since it is on the far left).
  - Sudoku must be in position 3 or 4.
  - Baking must be in position 1 or 2 (but we already placed writing in position 1), so it must be in position 1 (which is not possible since writing is there).

### Scenario 2: Chess in Position 4
- If chess is in position 4, then:
  - Writing must be in position 1.
  - Sudoku must be in position 3.
  - Baking must be in position 2 or 3 (but we already placed sudoku in position 3), so it must be in position 2.

This scenario fits all the conditions:
- Chess is in an even position (4).
- Writing is on the far left (1).
- Sudoku is on the right of chess (3).
- Sudoku is to the right of baking (2).

So the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Writing
- Position 2: Baking
- Position 3: Sudoku
- Position 4: Chess

Here is the final solution table:

```
|         |   1    |   2   |   3    |    4    |
| Hobby   | Writing| Baking| Sudoku | Chess   |

Lv5-1x4-7	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The Indian is somewhere to the left of the British.
2. **Clue 2**: The French is somewhere to the left of the Nigerian.
3. **Clue 3**: The British is between the French and the Nigerian.

Let's denote the positions as follows:
- Position 1
- Position 2
- Position 3
- Position 4

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3 Analysis:
- The British is between the French and the Nigerian.
- This means the order must be French, British, Nigerian or Nigerian, British, French. However, since we have only one British, the order can only be French, British, Nigerian.

#### Combining Clues 1 and 3:
- From Clue 1, the Indian is to the left of the British.
- From Clue 3, the British is between the French and the Nigerian.
- Therefore, the only possible arrangement that satisfies both Clue 1 and Clue 3 is:
  - French (F)
  - British (B)
  - Nigerian (N)
  - Indian (I)

#### Verifying with Clue 2:
- Clue 2 states the French is to the left of the Nigerian.
- In our arrangement, French (F) is indeed to the left of the Nigerian (N).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: French
- Position 2: British
- Position 3: Nigerian
- Position 4: Indian

Lv5-1x4-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and use the given clues to determine the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 2:** The person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the train.
   - This means the train cannot be in the last position (4), and the boat must be in a position to the right of the train.

2. **Clue 3:** The person driving the boat is in an odd position.
   - Therefore, the boat can only be in positions 1 or 3.

3. **Clue 4:** The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat.
   - If the boat is in position 1, the bike can be in positions 1 or 2 (but not 1 since it would violate the condition that the bike is to the left of the boat).
   - If the boat is in position 3, the bike can be in positions 1 or 2.

4. **Clue 1:** The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person driving the boat.
   - If the boat is in position 1, the roller can be in position 2.
   - If the boat is in position 3, the roller can be in position 2 or 4.

Now let's consider the possible positions for each vehicle:

- **If the boat is in position 1:**
  - The train must be in position 2 (since the boat is to the right of the train).
  - The bike can be in position 2 (but that would place the bike next to the train, which contradicts Clue 4).
  - The bike must be in position 2, but this creates a conflict with the bike being to the left of the boat.
  - Therefore, the boat cannot be in position 1.

- **If the boat is in position 3:**
  - The train must be in position 2 (since the boat is to the right of the train).
  - The bike can be in position 1 or 2.
  - The roller can be in position 2 or 4.

Let's test the positions:
- If the bike is in position 1, then the roller must be in position 4 (since it has to be either to the left or right of the boat).

So the arrangement would be:
- Position 1: Bike
- Position 2: Train
- Position 3: Boat
- Position 4: Roller

This satisfies all the conditions:
- Clue 2: The boat is to the right of the train.
- Clue 3: The boat is in an odd position.
- Clue 4: The bike is to the left of the boat.
- Clue 1: The roller is to the right of the boat.

Final Solution Table:

Lv5-1x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step-by-step and place the hobbies in the correct order.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.**
2. **The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is traveling.**
3. **The person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.**
4. **The person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.**

From clues 1 and 2, we can infer that:
- Traveling must be to the left of puzzles.
- Puzzles must be to the right of traveling.

This means the order involving traveling and puzzles must be: **Traveling, Puzzles**.

From clues 3 and 4, we can infer that:
- Hiking must be to the left of magic-tricks.
- Traveling (which is to the right of magic-tricks) must be to the right of magic-tricks.

Combining all these clues, we need to fit hiking, magic-tricks, traveling, and puzzles into the order where:
- Hiking is to the left of magic-tricks.
- Traveling is to the left of puzzles.
- Traveling is to the right of magic-tricks.

Given these constraints, the only possible order is:
- Hiking (leftmost)
- Magic-Tricks (next to the right of hiking)
- Traveling (next to the right of magic-tricks)
- Puzzles (rightmost)
