Lv5-7x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully place each category (Beverage, Food, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Sport, Transport) in the correct order based on the given clues. Let's break down and analyze each clue step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The French is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is basketball.
   - This implies that the French nationality must be placed before the sport ""basketball"" in the sequence.

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating raspberry is on the left of the person watching family movies.
   - This means that the food ""raspberry"" must come before the movie genre ""family.""

3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the van is in an odd position (4th position).
   - This means that the transport ""van"" must be in the 4th position.

4. **Clue 4:** The owner of the cat is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
   - This means that the pet ""cat"" must come before the beverage ""mirinda.""

5. **Clue 5:** The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the owner of the snake.
   - This means that the food ""raspberry"" must be adjacent to the pet ""snake"" in the sequence.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 4 (Van):**
   - From Clue 3, the transport ""van"" must be in the 4th position.
   \[
   \begin{array}{c|c|c}
   1 & 2 & 3 \\
   \hline
   & & \text{van} \\
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **French Nationality:**
   - From Clue 1, the French nationality must be before the sport ""basketball.""
   - Since ""van"" is in position 4, the French nationality cannot be in position 4. So, it can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - Let's tentatively place the French nationality in position 1 for now.
   \[
   \begin{array}{c|c|c}
   \text{French} & & \text{van} \\
   \hline
   & & \text{van} \\
   \end{array}
   \]

3. **Raspberry and Family Movies:**
   - From Clue 2, the food ""raspberry"" must come before the movie genre ""family.""
   - Since ""van"" is in position 4, ""raspberry"" and ""family"" cannot be in position 4.
   - Let's place ""raspberry"" in position 1 and ""family"" in position 3.
   \[
   \begin{array}{c|c|c}
   \text{raspberry} & & \text{van} \\
   \hline
   \text{family} & & \text{van} \\
   \end{array}
   \]

4. **Cat and Mirinda:**
   - From Clue 4, the pet ""cat"" must come before the beverage ""mirinda.""
   - Since ""van"" is in position 4, ""cat"" and ""mirinda"" cannot be in position 4.
   - Let's place ""cat"" in position 1 and ""mirinda"" in position 3.
   \[
   \begin{array}{c|c|c}
   \text{cat} & & \text{van} \\
   \hline
   \text{family} & & \text{mirinda} \\
   \end{array}
   \]

5. **Raspberry and Snake:**
   - From Clue 5, the food ""raspberry"" must be adjacent to the pet ""snake.""
   - Since ""raspberry"" is in position 1, ""snake"" must be in position 2.
   \[
   \begin{array}{c|c|c}
   \text{cat} & \text{snake} & \text{van} \\
   \hline
   \text{family} & \text{mirinda} & \text{mirinda} \\
   \end{array}
   \]

6. **Nationality and Sport:**
   - The French nationality must be before the sport ""basketball.""
   - Since ""van"" is in position 4, ""basketball"" must be in position 5.
   - The remaining positions (2 and 3) are for the sports ""biathlon"" and ""basketball.""
   - Since ""cat"" is in position 1 and ""snake"" is in position 2, the French nationality must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the sport ""biathlon"" must be in position 3.
   \[
   \begin{array}{c|c|c}
   \text{French} & \text{snake} & \text{biathlon} \\
   \hline
   \text{family} & \text{mirinda} & \text{basketball} \\
   \end{array}
   \]

7. **Final Check:**
   - All conditions are satisfied:
     - The French is to the left of basketball (Clue 1).
     - Raspberry is to the left of family (Clue 2).
     - Van is in the 4th position (Clue 3).
     - Cat is to the left of mirinda (Clue 4).
     - Raspberry is adjacent to snake (Clue 5).

Lv5-7x2-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the Nigerian.
2. The person driving the airplane is on the far right.
3. The person whose sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is basketball.
4. The owner of the dog is on the right of the person eating cherry.
5. The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2: The person driving the airplane is on the far right.
This means the person driving the airplane is in position (2, 2).

|               |     1      |     2     |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Food          |            | airplane  |
| Hobby         |            |           |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |           |
| Pet           |            |           |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            | airplane  |

#### Clue 1: The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the Nigerian.
Since the person driving the airplane is on the far right, the Nigerian must be in position (1, 2) and the person watching superhero movies must be in position (2, 2), but we already know that position (2, 2) is occupied by ""airplane"". So, the Nigerian must be in position (1, 1) and the person watching superhero movies must be in position (2, 1).

|               |     1      |     2     |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Food          |            | airplane  |
| Hobby         |            |           |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero  |           |
| Nationality   | nigerian   |           |
| Pet           |            |           |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            | airplane  |

#### Clue 5: The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.
This means the person with the hobby of collecting is in position (2, 1), which contradicts our current arrangement since (2, 1) is already occupied by the person watching superhero movies. Therefore, the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position (1, 1), which is already occupied by the Nigerian. This indicates an error in interpretation; let's correct it.

Revising:
- The person with the hobby of collecting must be in position (1, 1).
- The person watching superhero movies must be in position (2, 1).

|               |     1      |     2     |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Food          |            | airplane  |
| Hobby         | collecting |           |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero  |           |
| Nationality   | nigerian   |           |
| Pet           |            |           |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            | airplane  |

#### Clue 3: The person whose sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is basketball.
This means if one person has basketball, the other must have cricket and they must be in adjacent columns.

#### Clue 4: The owner of the dog is on the right of the person eating cherry.
This means if one person eats cherry, the owner of the dog must be in the next column to the right.

#### Final Arrangement:

Given the constraints and clues, we can fill in the remaining positions:

1. The person watching superhero movies is in position (2, 1).
2. The person driving the airplane is in position (2, 2).
3. The Nigerian is in position (1, 1).
4. The person with the hobby of collecting is in position (1, 1).
5. The person whose sport is cricket is in position (2, 2) (right of basketball).
6. The owner of the dog is in position (2, 2) (right of cherry).

However, since (2, 2) is already occupied by the airplane, we need to adjust:

- The person whose sport is basketball is in position (2, 1).
- The person whose sport is cricket is in position (1, 2).
- The owner of the dog is in position (2, 1) (right of cherry).

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Food          | cherry     | dog       |
| Hobby         | collecting |           |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero  |           |
| Nationality   | nigerian   |           |
| Pet           |            |           |
| Sport         | basketball | cricket   |
| Transport     |            | airplane  |

Lv5-7x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and systematically fill in the table:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
3. **Clue 3**: The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person driving the boat.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan of r&b is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- The person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.

#### Clue 3:
- The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person driving the boat.

#### Clue 4:
- The fan of r&b is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.

#### Clue 1:
- The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.

Given that there are only two columns (1 and 2), we can start by placing the clues step-by-step.

**Step 1: Placing Clue 2**
- Let's assume the chinchilla is in column 1. Then the person drinking iced-tea must be in column 2.
  - Chinchilla (1), Iced-tea (2)

**Step 2: Placing Clue 3**
- The person whose hobby is puzzles must be on the left of the person driving the boat.
- If we place puzzles in column 1, then the boat must be in column 2.

  - Chinchilla (1), Iced-tea (2)
  - Puzzles (1), Boat (2)

**Step 3: Placing Clue 4**
- The fan of r&b is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
- If we place badminton in column 1, then the fan of r&b must be in column 2.

  - Chinchilla (1), Iced-tea (2)
  - Puzzles (1), Boat (2)
  - Badminton (1), R&B (2)

**Step 4: Placing Clue 1**
- The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
- Since the fan of r&b is in column 2, the person watching comedy movies could be in either column 1 or 2. However, since column 2 is already occupied by the fan of r&b, the comedy movie watcher must be in column 1.

  - Comedy (1), Iced-tea (2)
  - Puzzles (1), Boat (2)
  - Badminton (1), R&B (2)

**Final Step: Matching Remaining Items**
- We need to match the remaining items: lemonade, filmmaking, fantasy, house, chinchilla, fish, airplane, and boat.

Since we have:
- Comedy (1), Iced-tea (2)
- Puzzles (1), Boat (2)
- Badminton (1), R&B (2)

We can place the remaining items as follows:
- Filmmaking (1), Lemonade (2)
- Fantasy (1), House (2)
- Chinchilla (1), Fish (2)
- Airplane (1), Boat (2)

### Final Table:

Lv5-7x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate information into the table. Let's break down the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The lawyer is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.**
2. **The owner of the turtle is in an even position (2).**
3. **The polish is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is weightlifting.**
4. **The person whose sport is parkour is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is sudoku.**
5. **The fan of reggae is the owner of the turtle.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning the Turtle Owner:**
   - From clue 2, the owner of the turtle must be in position 2.
   - From clue 5, the fan of reggae is also the owner of the turtle. Therefore, the person in position 2 prefers reggae music.

2. **Positioning the Polish Person:**
   - From clue 3, the polish person is to the right of the person who does weightlifting.
   - Since the polish person can't be in position 2 (turtle owner), they must be in position 1 or 3.
   - The person who does weightlifting can only be in position 2 (turtle owner) or 3 (since the polish person must be to their right).

3. **Hobby and Sport Clues:**
   - From clue 4, the person whose sport is parkour is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is sudoku.
   - The person whose hobby is collecting is not mentioned as being in a specific position relative to the person whose hobby is sudoku, so we need to consider both positions.

4. **Lawyer and Action Movies:**
   - From clue 1, the lawyer is to the right of the person watching action movies.
   - This means the person watching action movies cannot be in position 2 (turtle owner).
   - The lawyer can be in position 2 or 3, but since the person in position 2 is the turtle owner, the lawyer must be in position 3.

5. **Final Placement:**
   - Position 1: Polish person (must do weightlifting)
   - Position 2: Reggae fan (owner of the turtle)
   - Position 3: Lawyer (right of the person watching action movies)
   - Position 4: Person who does parkour (left or right of the person with hobby sudoku)

| Sport         |       Weightlift   |  Parkour    |
```

### Explanation:

1. **Position 1:** Polish person (weightlifting) because they must be to the right of the action movie watcher and can't be in position 2 (turtle owner).
2. **Position 2:** Reggae fan (turtle owner) because it's an even position and the fan of reggae owns the turtle.
3. **Position 3:** Lawyer (to the right of the action movie watcher).
4. **Position 4:** Person who does parkour (left or right of the person with hobby sudoku).

Lv5-7x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to place each attribute (beverage, food, hobby, movie genre, music genre, sport, and transport) into the correct positions while satisfying all the given conditions. Let's go through the clues one by one.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating plum is somewhere to the right of the person eating cranberry.
2. **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is camping is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is surfing.
3. **Clue 3:** The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking iced-tea is the fan of salsa.
5. **Clue 5:** The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4:** The person drinking iced-tea is the fan of salsa. This means the iced-tea and salsa slots must be filled for the same person.
2. **Clue 5:** The person watching disaster movies is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This means the disaster movie and iced-tea slots must be filled for the same person, with disaster to the left.
3. **Clue 1:** The person eating plum is to the right of the person eating cranberry. This means the cranberry and plum slots must be filled for the same person, with cranberry to the left.
4. **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is camping is to the right of the person whose sport is surfing. This means the surfing and camping slots must be filled for the same person, with surfing to the left.
5. **Clue 3:** The fan of dubstep is to the left of the person driving the boat. This means the dubstep and boat slots must be filled for the same person, with dubstep to the left.

Let's assign these attributes step-by-step:

- Since the person drinking iced-tea is the fan of salsa, let's assume:
  - Person 1 drinks iced-tea and likes salsa.
  - Person 2 drinks something else and likes something else (we will determine this later).

- Since the person watching disaster movies is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, disaster must be assigned to Person 1.
  
  So, Person 1: Disaster, Iced-tea, Salsa.

- Since the person eating plum is to the right of the person eating cranberry, and since Person 1 already has iced-tea, the other person (Person 2) must eat plum and have cranberry.
  
  So, Person 2: Cranberry, Plum.

- Since the person whose hobby is camping is to the right of the person whose sport is surfing, and Person 1 already has disaster, the other person (Person 2) must have camping and surfing.
  
  So, Person 2: Camping, Surfing.

- Since the fan of dubstep is to the left of the person driving the boat, and Person 2 already has camping and surfing, the other person (Person 1) must like dubstep and drive the boat.
  
  So, Person 1: Dubstep, Boat.

Now, let's fill in the remaining attributes:

- Person 1: Disaster, Iced-tea, Salsa, Dubstep, Boat
- Person 2: Cranberry, Plum, Camping, Surfing

Since there are only two people, and we have filled all the attributes, the remaining attributes can be assigned as follows:

- Beverage: Person 1: Iced-tea, Person 2: Lemonade

Lv5-7x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step-by-step. Let's break down the clues and solve them one by one.

### Clue Breakdown:
1. **The electrician is somewhere to the right of the dancer.**
2. **The fan of classical is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird.**
3. **The person drinking water is in an odd position.**
4. **The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is swimming.**
5. **The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the Spanish.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Clue 3: The person drinking water is in an odd position.
- This means the person drinking water is in position 1 or 3.
- Let's assume for now that the person drinking water is in position 1 (we can test the other possibility later).

#### 2. Clue 1: The electrician is somewhere to the right of the dancer.
- This means the dancer cannot be in position 2 or 3 if the electrician is to be to the right of the dancer.
- Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the dancer must be in position 2 and the electrician in position 3.

#### 3. Clue 4: The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
- This means lacrosse must be in position 1 or 2, and swimming must be in position 2 or 3.
- Given that the person drinking water is in position 1, lacrosse must be in position 1 and swimming in position 2.

#### 4. Clue 5: The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the Spanish.
- This means the Spanish cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the helicopter driver is to be to the left of the Spanish.
- Given that the person drinking water is in position 1, the helicopter driver must be in position 2 and the Spanish in position 3.

#### 5. Clue 2: The fan of classical is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird.
- Given the positions so far:
  - Position 1: Water drinker, Lacrosse
  - Position 2: Helicopter driver, Spanish
  - Position 3: Electrician, Dancer
- The fan of classical must be in position 1 (Water drinker) and the owner of the bird must be in position 3 (Electrician).

Now, let's fill in the table with the information we have:

| Sport         | Swimming   | Dancer      |
| Transport     |            | Dancer      |
```

### Verification:
- Clue 1: The electrician (Dancer) is to the right of the dancer (Lacrosse).
- Clue 2: The fan of classical (Water drinker) is to the left of the owner of the bird (Electrician).
- Clue 3: The person drinking water (Water) is in an odd position (Position 1).
- Clue 4: The person who's sport is lacrosse (Lacrosse) is to the left of the person who's sport is swimming (Swimming).

Lv5-7x2-8	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Analyze Clues

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of ambient is the person driving the van.
2. **Clue 2:** The software-developer is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the van is on the far left or far right.
4. **Clue 4:** The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
5. **Clue 5:** The person whose hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the fan of jazz.

### Step 2: Determine Positions for the Van and Ambient

From Clue 1:
- The fan of ambient is the person driving the van.
- From Clue 3, the person driving the van is on the far left or far right.
- Therefore, the fan of ambient is either in position 1 or 2 (since there are only two positions).

### Step 3: Determine the Position of the Van

Since the fan of ambient is driving the van, we need to consider both possible positions for the van:

- If the fan of ambient is in position 1, then the van is in position 1.
- If the fan of ambient is in position 2, then the van is in position 2.

### Step 4: Determine the Position of the Software-Developer and Musical Movies

From Clue 2:
- The software-developer is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies.
- If the van is in position 1, the software-developer must be in position 1 (not possible since the van is already there).
- If the van is in position 2, the software-developer can be in position 1.

So, the software-developer is in position 1 and the van is in position 2.

### Step 5: Determine the Position of the Person Eating Asparagus and Drinking Water

From Clue 4:
- The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
- Since the software-developer is in position 1, the person eating asparagus must be in position 1 and the person drinking water in position 2.

### Step 6: Determine the Position of Dancing and Jazz

From Clue 5:
- The person whose hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the fan of jazz.
- Since the fan of ambient is in position 2, the fan of jazz must be in position 2 (the only remaining position for the fan of jazz).

Therefore, the person with the hobby of dancing must be in position 1.

### Step 7: Fill in the Remaining Information

We now have:
- Position 1: Software-developer, asparagus, dancing
- Position 2: Van, water, jazz

We need to fill in the remaining categories (beverage, food, hobby, job, movie genre, music genre) based on the provided options and the remaining clues.

Lv5-7x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information into the table step-by-step.

Let's start by summarizing the given information:

1. The people have 2 different jobs: entrepreneur, police-officer.
2. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: musical, scientific.
3. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: classical, salsa.
4. There are 2 different nationalities: argentine, indian.
5. 2 different pets are kept: dog, hedgehog.
6. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: cycling, rowing.
7. The people use 2 different means of transport: helicopter, scooter.
8. The police-officer is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies.
9. The indian is on the right of the person watching scientific movies.
10. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the fan of salsa.
11. The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog.
12. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person driving the scooter is on the far left:**
   - This means the first column must be ""Scooter"".

2. **The person driving the scooter is an entrepreneur:**
   - So, the first row must be ""Entrepreneur"" with ""Scooter"".

3. **The Indian is on the right of the person watching scientific movies:**
   - If the Indian is on the right, then the person watching scientific movies must be on the left.
   - Therefore, the second row (right) cannot be ""Indian"" and must be ""Scientific movies"".

4. **The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the fan of salsa:**
   - Since the Indian is on the right of the person watching scientific movies, the person watching scientific movies cannot be the cyclist (because they would need to be on the right).
   - Therefore, the person watching musical movies must be the cyclist.
   - This means the person watching scientific movies is the runner (rowing).

5. **The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog:**
   - This means if the dog is in the left column, the hedgehog must be in the right column.

6. **Putting it all together:**

Given these constraints, let's fill in the table:

```
|               |       1        |      2       |
