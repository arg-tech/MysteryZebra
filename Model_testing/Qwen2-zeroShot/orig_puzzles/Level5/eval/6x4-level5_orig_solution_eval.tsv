8. **Clue 8**: The owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - Cola must be in position 1 or 2, and the owner of the frog must be in a position to the right of that.

9. **Clue 7**: The person watching family movies is on the right of the owner of the frog.
   - Since the owner of the frog is to the left of the person watching family movies, and the person watching family movies is not in position 4 (because the lawyer is there), the owner of the frog must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

10. **Clue 16**: The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing.
    - Lemonade must be in position 1 or 2, and the person's sport is surfing must be in a position to the right of that.

Now, let's fill in the remaining categories:

  - Therefore, surf must be in position 3, and sailing must be in position 2.

- **Beverage**:
  - Hot-chocolate must be in position 1 or 2.
  - Lemonade must be in position 1 or 2.
  - Since hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing, and surfing is in position 3, hot-chocolate must be in position 1.

From Clue 10 and 11, we know:
- The Indonesian has the hobby of woodworking and watches western movies.

From Clue 1, the Malaysian is in Position 2 or 4.

Now let's look at other clues:

From Clue 14, the owner of the pony is on the left of the fan of trance. So, the owner of the pony is on the left of the Pakistani.

From Clue 7, the person watching romance movies is the Pakistani. So, the Pakistani watches romance movies.

From Clue 9, the fan of folk is between the Pakistani and the person driving the bike. Since the Pakistani watches romance movies, the person driving the bike must be to the right of the Pakistani (because the Pakistani is in Position 3).

From Clue 8, the person driving the bike is on the left or right of the fan of folk. Given that the person driving the bike is to the right of the Pakistani, the fan of folk must be in Position 2.

From Clue 12, the person who's hobby is traveling is the Pakistani. Therefore, the person in Position 3 has the hobby of traveling.

From Clue 15, the Malaysian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish. Since the Malaysian is in Position 2 or 4, and the owner of the fish drives the tram (Clue 17), the Malaysian must be in Position 2.

From Clue 1, the Malaysian is in an even position. So, the Malaysian is in Position 4.

From Clue 10, the Indonesian has the hobby of woodworking and watches western movies. Since the Malaysian is in Position 4, the Indonesian must be in Position 1.

From Clue 6, the Pakistani is on the left or right of the fan of folk. Since the fan of folk is in Position 2 and the Pakistani is in Position 3, the Pakistani is to the right of the fan of folk.

From Clue 17, the owner of the fish is the person driving the tram. The person driving the tram is in Position 3, so the person in Position 3 is the owner of the fish.

Let's summarize the findings:

- Position 1: Indonesian (Hobby: Woodworking, Movie-Genre: Western)
- Position 2: Malaysian (Hobby: Unknown, Movie-Genre: Adventure, Music-Genre: Folk, Nationality: Malaysian, Pet: Fish, Transport: Tram)
- Position 3: Pakistani (Hobby: Traveling, Movie-Genre: Romance, Music-Genre: Trance, Nationality: Pakistani, Pet: Pony, Transport: Bike)
- Position 4: Malaysian (Hobby: Unknown, Movie-Genre: Epic, Music-Genre: Unknown, Nationality: Malaysian, Pet: Chinchilla, Transport: Car)

We still need to determine the exact hobbies, movie genres, music genres, and pets for Positions 1 and 2. From the remaining clues and the process of elimination:
