Lv5-4x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle and use the given clues to fill out the table step-by-step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin.
2. The person watching satire movies is the Pakistani.
3. The person whose hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person watching satire movies is the Pakistani.
   - This means the Pakistani watches satire movies.

2. **Clue 1**: The Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin.
   - Since the Pakistani is on the right, the person eating pumpkin must be on the left.

3. **Clue 3**: The person whose hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
   - This means if one person has the hobby of filmmaking, the other person with the hobby of skydiving must be on the right.

Given that we have two columns (1 and 2), let's assign the people to the columns based on the clues:

- **Column 1** must be the person eating pumpkin because the Pakistani (who watches satire) is on the right.
- **Column 2** must be the Pakistani (who watches satire).

Now, let's fill in the rest of the information:

- Since the person in Column 1 eats pumpkin, the person in Column 2 cannot eat pumpkin (as per Clue 1).
- Therefore, the person in Column 2 must eat blueberry.
- The person in Column 2 (Pakistani) watches satire movies (from Clue 2).

Next, we need to determine the hobbies:

- The person in Column 1 (eating pumpkin) can either have the hobby of filmmaking or skydiving.
- The person in Column 2 (Pakistani) must have the hobby of skydiving (since the skydiver is to the right of the filmmaker, and the Pakistani is in Column 2).

So, the person in Column 1 has the hobby of filmmaking.

Finally, we need to assign the movie genres and nationalities:

- Since the Pakistani (Column 2) watches satire movies, the person in Column 1 must watch musical movies (the only other genre).

- The person in Column 1 (eating pumpkin, watching musicals, and having filmmaking as a hobby) must be Argentine (since the Pakistani is in Column 2 and we have two nationalities).

- The person in Column 2 (eating blueberry, watching satire, and having skydiving as a hobby) must be Pakistani.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Food          | pumpkin    | blueberry |

Lv5-4x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the given clues and systematically place the information into the table.

### Clues Recap:
1. **Food**: There are two types of food - pomegranate and zucchini.
2. **Movie-Genre**: There are two genres - comedy and epic.
3. **Pet**: There are two pets - cat and rabbit.
4. **Transport**: There are two means of transport - bus and snowmobile.
5. **Clue 1**: The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
6. **Clue 2**: The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the positions**:
    - Since there are only two columns (1 and 2), we need to place each item in one of these two positions.
    - Let's denote the positions as follows:
        - Position 1: Left column
        - Position 2: Right column

2. **Clue 1 Analysis**:
    - The person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
    - This means if someone is eating pomegranate, they cannot be in position 2 (right column) because the person driving the snowmobile must be to their right.

3. **Clue 2 Analysis**:
    - The person watching epic movies is to the left of the owner of the rabbit.
    - This means if someone is watching epic movies, they cannot be in position 2 (right column) because the owner of the rabbit must be to their right.

4. **Combining Clues**:
    - From Clue 1, if someone is eating pomegranate, they must be in position 1.
    - From Clue 2, if someone is watching epic movies, they must be in position 1.
    - Therefore, position 1 must be occupied by either someone eating pomegranate or someone watching epic movies.

5. **Assigning Values**:
    - Since both pomegranate and epic movies need to be placed in position 1, and we have only two positions, one of them must go in position 1 and the other in position 2.
    - Let's assume:
        - Position 1: Pomegranate
        - Position 2: Epic Movies

6. **Remaining Items**:
    - Food: Zucchini (must go in position 2)
    - Movie-Genre: Comedy (must go in position 1)
    - Pet: Rabbit (must go in position 2)
    - Transport: Bus (must go in position 1)

7. **Final Table**:
```
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          |   Zucchini  |  Pomegranate|
| Movie-Genre   |    Comedy    |   Epic     |
| Pet           |   Rabbit    |     Cat    |
| Transport     |    Bus      | Snowmobile |

Lv5-4x2-3	"Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
2. The entrepreneur is somewhere to the left of the fan of house.
3. The mechanic is the person driving the ship.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
The mechanic is the person driving the ship. This gives us:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         |              |          |
| Job           |              | mechanic |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |
| Transport     | ship         |          |
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The entrepreneur is somewhere to the left of the fan of house. This means the entrepreneur cannot be in position 2 (since the mechanic is there). So, the entrepreneur must be in position 1, and the fan of house can be in either position 1 or 2. Since we already know the mechanic is in position 2, the fan of house must be in position 1:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         |              |          |
| Job           | entrepreneur | mechanic |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |
| Transport     | ship         |          |
```

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Given that the entrepreneur is in position 1 and the mechanic is in position 2, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person with the hobby of puzzles is in position 1 and the person with the hobby of chess is in position 2:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         | puzzles     | chess    |
| Job           | entrepreneur | mechanic |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |
| Transport     | ship         |          |
```

#### Step 4: Assign Remaining Hobbies and Genres
We now need to assign the remaining job (entrepreneur) and music genre (house and trance).

Since the entrepreneur is in position 1, the remaining job for position 2 is the mechanic. We also know the fan of house is in position 1 and the fan of trance is in position 2:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         | puzzles     | chess    |
| Job           | entrepreneur | mechanic |
| Music-Genre   | house       | trance   |
| Transport     | ship         |          |
```

Finally, the transport for the entrepreneur (position 1) should be the ship, as the mechanic (position 2) is driving the ship:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         | puzzles     | chess    |
| Job           | entrepreneur | mechanic |
| Music-Genre   | house       | trance   |
| Transport     | ship         | ship     |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         | puzzles     | chess    |
| Job           | entrepreneur | mechanic |

Lv5-4x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information step by step.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
2. The person whose hobby is collecting is on the far right.
3. The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The person with the hobby of collecting is on the far right (position 2).
   - This means:
   |               |    1    |     2      |
   | Hobby         |    C    |    D       |

2. **Clue 1**: The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
   - Since the person with the hobby of collecting is in position 2, the person driving the jet-ski cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 1.
   - This means:
   |               |    1    |     2      |
   | Beverage      |    J    |    7       |
   | Hobby         |    C    |    D       |

3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.
   - From the previous step, we know that the person drinking 7up is in position 2.
   - This means the person watching epic movies must be in position 1.
   - This means:
   |               |    1    |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   |    E    |    W       |
   | Beverage      |    J    |    7       |
   | Hobby         |    C    |    D       |

4. **Remaining Variables**:
   - We need to assign the remaining variables (drawing and western) to the remaining positions.
   - The only beverage left is coffee.
   - The only genre left is western.
   - Therefore:
   |               |    1    |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   |    E    |    W       |
   | Beverage      |    J    |    7       |
   | Hobby         |    C    |    D       |
   | Transport     |    B    |    S       |

Lv5-4x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down and analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The firefighter is on the right of the person eating asparagus.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who prefers surfing is in an odd position (1 or 3).
3. **Clue 3:** The scientist is somewhere to the left of the Colombian.

We need to place four people into two columns (1 and 2) for each category (Food, Job, Nationality, Sport). Let's start with the given clues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 2:
- Surfing is in an odd position (1 or 3).

Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), the only way for surfing to be in an odd position is if it is in position 1. Therefore, we can place ""Surfing"" in position 1.

#### Clue 1:
- The firefighter is on the right of the person eating asparagus.

Given that Surfing is in position 1, the firefighter cannot be in position 1 because the firefighter must be on the right of the person eating asparagus. Thus, the firefighter must be in position 2.

#### Clue 3:
- The scientist is somewhere to the left of the Colombian.

This means the scientist must be in position 1 and the Colombian in position 2, or the scientist in position 2 and the Colombian in position 1. However, since we already placed Surfing in position 1 and the firefighter in position 2, the scientist must be in position 1 and the Colombian in position 2.

### Assigning Remaining Categories:

Now we have:
- Position 1: Surfing, Scientist
- Position 2: Asparagus, Colombian, Firefighter

We have two remaining categories: Tomato and Firefighter.

#### Food:
- We know one person eats Asparagus, so the other must eat Tomato.

#### Job:
- We know one person is a Firefighter, so the other must be a Scientist.

So, we can fill in the table as follows:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Tomato    | Asparagus   |
| Job           | Scientist | Firefighter |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Canadian    |
| Sport         | Surfing   | Cycling     |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Tomato    | Asparagus   |
| Job           | Scientist | Firefighter |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Canadian    |
| Sport         | Surfing   | Cycling     |

Lv5-4x2-6	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of hip-hop is on the far left.
2. **Clue 2:** The firefighter is the person drinking sprite.
3. **Clue 3:** The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.

Let's fill in the table with the given information and deduce the rest.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1:**
   - The fan of hip-hop is on the far left.
   - This means the first column (position 1) is for the person who likes hip-hop.

2. **Clue 2:**
   - The firefighter is the person drinking sprite.
   - This means the person drinking sprite must be in the same row as the firefighter.

3. **Clue 3:**
   - The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
   - This means the cucumber-eater cannot be in the rightmost column (position 2) if the mirinda-drinker is in position 2.

Now, let's assign the known information to the table:

```
|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |     Sprite  |       Mirinda   |
| Food          |    Cucumber |         Tomato  |
| Job           | Firefighter |   Project-Manager |
| Music-Genre   |    Hip-Hop  |        Metal    |
```

- **Beverage:**
  - Clue 2 tells us that the firefighter drinks sprite, so the firefighter is in the second row and first column.
  - The other beverage (mirinda) must be in the second row and second column.

- **Food:**
  - Clue 3 tells us that the cucumber-eater is to the left of the mirinda-drinker.
  - Since the mirinda-drinker is in the second column, the cucumber-eater must be in the first column.
  - Therefore, the cucumber-eater is in the third row and first column, and the tomato-eater is in the third row and second column.

- **Job:**
  - We know the firefighter is in the second row and first column, so the other job (project-manager) must be in the second row and second column.

- **Music-Genre:**
  - Clue 1 tells us that the first column is for the person who likes hip-hop.
  - Therefore, the person in the fourth row and first column likes hip-hop.
  - The other person (in the fourth row and second column) must like metal.

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |     Sprite  |       Mirinda   |
| Food          |    Cucumber |         Tomato  |

Lv5-4x2-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Given Information:
1. There are two beverages: Coffee and Sprite.
2. There are two hobbies: Camping and Photography.
3. There are two jobs: Coach and Paramedic.
4. There are two pets: Fish and Horse.

### Clues:
1. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish.
2. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the coach.
3. The person drinking coffee has the hobby of camping.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The person drinking coffee has the hobby of camping.
   - This means that the person drinking coffee cannot be in the ""Photography"" column because there can only be one hobby per row.

2. **Clue 1**: The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish.
   - This implies that if someone is drinking coffee, the owner of the fish must be to their right in the same row or in a row below them.

3. **Clue 2**: The owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the coach.
   - This means the coach cannot be in the rightmost column (2) of any row where the fish is present.

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- Since the person drinking coffee has the hobby of camping, we can place ""Camping"" in the ""Hobby"" column for the person drinking coffee.

- Let's assume the person drinking coffee is in row 1 (Beverage). Then the owner of the fish must be in the same row or in row 2 (Hobby).

- The coach cannot be in the rightmost column (2) of any row where the fish is present.

### Possible Arrangement:

1. **Row 1 (Beverage):**
   - Coffee (since the person drinking coffee has the hobby of camping)
   - Sprite (remaining beverage)

2. **Row 2 (Hobby):**
   - Camping (since the person drinking coffee has this hobby)
   - Photography (remaining hobby)

3. **Row 1 (Job):**
   - Coach (must be to the left of the owner of the fish)
   - Paramedic (remaining job)

4. **Row 2 (Pet):**
   - Fish (owner of the fish is to the right of the coach)
   - Horse (remaining pet)

### Final Table:

```

| Job        | Coach   | Paramedic   |
| Pet        | Fish    | Horse       |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues:
- The person drinking coffee (Coffee) is to the left of the owner of the fish (Fish).
- The owner of the fish (Fish) is to the right of the coach (Coach).
- The person drinking coffee has the hobby of camping (Camping).

Lv5-4x2-8	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Nationality:**
   - The Polish is on the right of the British.
   - Therefore, we can place them as:
     - Row 1: British (left), Polish (right)
     - Row 2: British (left), Polish (right)

2. **Music-Genre:**
   - The fan of gospel is on the left or right of the person who prefers weightlifting.
   - Since we need to place two genres (electronic and gospel) and two sports (baseball and weightlifting), let's consider the possibilities for the positions.

3. **Sport:**
   - The fan of electronic is somewhere to the right of the firefighter.
   - This means the firefighter cannot be in the last column if the electronic fan is in that column.

### Possible Configurations:

#### Configuration 1:
- Row 1: British (Firefighter), Polish (Fisherman)
- Row 2: British (Fisherman), Polish (Firefighter)

This configuration does not satisfy the condition that the fan of electronic is to the right of the firefighter.

#### Configuration 2:
- Row 1: British (Firefighter), Polish (Fisherman)
- Row 2: British (Fisherman), Polish (Weightlifter)

This configuration satisfies the condition that the fan of electronic is to the right of the firefighter.

Now, let's assign the music-genre and sport based on the given conditions:

- Row 1 (British):
  - If the British is a Firefighter, the fan of electronic must be to the right.
  - Therefore, the first column (firefighter) must be electronic.

- Row 2 (Polish):
  - The Polish person is a Fisherman.
  - The fan of gospel must be on the left or right of the weightlifter.
  - Therefore, the second column (fisherman) must be gospel.

So, the final configuration is:

- Row 1: British (Firefighter, Electronic)
- Row 2: Polish (Fisherman, Gospel)

### Final Solution Table:

1. **Beverages:**
   - There are two different beverages: 7up and milk.
   - We can place these in positions 1 and 2.

2. **Movie-Genres:**
   - There are two different movie genres: action and fantasy.
   - According to clue 1, the person watching fantasy movies must be to the right of the person drinking milk. This means if milk is in position 1, then fantasy must be in position 2. If milk is in position 2, then fantasy must be in position 1.

3. **Music-Genres:**
   - There are two different music genres: funk and hip-hop.
   - According to clue 2, the fan of funk must be to the right of the Malaysian. This means if the Malaysian is in position 1, then funk must be in position 2. If the Malaysian is in position 2, then funk must be in position 1.

4. **Nationality:**
   - There are two nationalities: Malaysian and Pakistani.
   - Since the Malaysian must be to the left of funk (clue 2), and since the person watching fantasy movies is to the right of the person drinking milk (clue 1), we can deduce the arrangement.

Let's start with the possible arrangements for the first row:

- If milk is in position 1, then fantasy must be in position 2.
- If milk is in position 2, then fantasy must be in position 1.

Let's test each case:

**Case 1: Milk in position 1, Fantasy in position 2**

|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Beverage      |   Milk    |   7up     |
| Movie-Genre   |  Fantasy  |   Action  |
| Music-Genre   |    ?      |    ?      |
| Nationality   |    ?      |    ?      |

Now, we need to place the Malaysian and Pakistani, and the music genres.

- The Malaysian must be to the left of funk (clue 2).
- The person watching fantasy movies (position 2) is to the right of the person drinking milk (position 1).

This fits our conditions. So, let's place the Malaysian and Pakistani:

If the Malaysian is in position 1, then funk must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Beverage      |   Milk    |   7up     |
| Movie-Genre   |  Fantasy  |   Action  |
| Music-Genre   |   Funk    |  Hip-Hop  |
| Nationality   |  Malaysian|  Pakistani|

**Case 2: Milk in position 2, Fantasy in position 1**

|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Beverage      |   7up     |   Milk    |
| Movie-Genre   |  Fantasy  |   Action  |
| Music-Genre   |    ?      |    ?      |
| Nationality   |    ?      |    ?      |

Again, we need to place the Malaysian and Pakistani, and the music genres.

- The Malaysian must be to the left of funk (clue 2).
- The person watching fantasy movies (position 1) is to the right of the person drinking milk (position 2).

This does not fit our conditions because the Malaysian cannot be to the left of funk while being to the right of the person drinking milk.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:

|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Beverage      |   Milk    |   7up     |
| Movie-Genre   |  Fantasy  |   Action  |
| Music-Genre   |   Funk    |  Hip-Hop  |
| Nationality   |  Malaysian|  Pakistani|

### Final Solution:

```
|               |     1     |     2     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Beverage      |   Milk    |   7up     |
| Movie-Genre   |  Fantasy  |   Action  |
| Music-Genre   |   Funk    |  Hip-Hop  |
| Nationality   |  Malaysian|  Pakistani|

Lv5-4x2-10	"Certainly! Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

Given:
1. The person watching family movies is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
2. The fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting.

We need to place the hobbies, movie genres, music genres, and sports in the correct order based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching family movies is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - This means that if we denote the positions as follows:
     - Position 1: Biathlon
     - Position 2: Family Movies

2. **Clue 2**: The fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting.
   - This means that if we denote the positions as follows:
     - Position 1: Collecting
     - Position 2: d&b

Now let's try to fit all the information into the table while adhering to these constraints.

### Initial Setup:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         |    Baking  |  Collecting  |
| Movie-Genre   |    Horror  |    Family  |
| Music-Genre   |    Dubstep|     d&b   |
| Sport         |   Parkour |   Biathlon |
```

### Applying Clues:
1. **Clue 1**: The person watching family movies (Position 2) is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon (Position 1).
   - This fits perfectly with our initial setup.

2. **Clue 2**: The fan of d&b (Position 2) is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (Position 1).
   - This also fits perfectly with our initial setup.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         |  Collecting |  Baking  |
| Movie-Genre   |    Horror  |    Family  |
| Music-Genre   |    Dubstep|     d&b   |
| Sport         |   Parkour |   Biathlon |
```

This arrangement satisfies both clues given in the puzzle."	{'hobby': ['collecting', 'baking'], 'movie-genre': ['horror', 'family'], 'music-genre': ['dubstep', 'd&b'], 'sport': ['parkour', 'biathlon']}	True	6	False
