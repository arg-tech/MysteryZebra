Lv5-4x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct job, movie genre, sport, and mode of transport in the appropriate cells. Let's start by organizing the clues and solving step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 15 and 1:** The firefighter is on the far right (position 7) and the person driving the boat is also on the far right.
   - This means both positions 1 and 7 must be occupied by either the firefighter or the person driving the boat.
   - Since the person driving the boat (clue 25) is watching mystery movies (clue 22), and the firefighter is on the far right (clue 15), the person driving the boat cannot be the firefighter. Thus, the firefighter must be in position 7.
   - Therefore, the person driving the boat is in position 1.

2. **Clue 2 and 1:** The person whose sport is rowing is in position 7.
   - Since position 7 is the firefighter, the person whose sport is rowing must be the firefighter.
   - Therefore, the firefighter is in position 7 with sport = rowing.

3. **Clue 15 and 1:** The person driving the boat is in position 1 and the person whose sport is rowing is in position 7.
   - Therefore, the person driving the boat is the firefighter.

4. **Clue 22 and 25:** The person driving the boat (firefighter) is watching mystery movies.
   - Therefore, the movie genre for position 1 is mystery.

5. **Clue 3 and 7:** The scientist is somewhere to the right of the videographer and the scientist is on the right of the accountant.
   - Since the scientist is on the right of the accountant, the scientist must be in one of the positions from 4 to 7.
   - The scientist cannot be in position 7 because it is the firefighter.
   - Therefore, the scientist can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

6. **Clue 4 and 12:** The person watching romance movies is the person whose sport is skiing and the person driving the motorbike is the person watching adventure movies.
   - Therefore, the movie genre for position 4 is romance, and the sport for position 4 is skiing.

7. **Clue 5 and 10:** The person whose sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is water-polo and the person driving the train is on the right of the accountant.
   - The person driving the train is in an even position, so it could be in positions 2, 4, 6.
   - Since the accountant is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is soccer, and the person driving the train is on the right of the accountant, the accountant cannot be in positions 5 or 7.
   - Therefore, the accountant must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, but since the accountant is not in position 1 (boat driver), the accountant can be in positions 2 or 3.

8. **Clue 6 and 19:** The person whose sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the coach and the coach is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus.
   - The coach is in an even position (clue 20), so the coach can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.
   - Since the coach is to the right of the person driving the bus, the person driving the bus must be in a position to the left of the coach.
   - Therefore, if the coach is in position 2, the person driving the bus is in position 1.
   - If the coach is in position 4, the person driving the bus is in position 2 or 3.
   - If the coach is in position 6, the person driving the bus is in position 2, 3, or 4.

9. **Clue 7 and 8:** The scientist is on the right of the accountant and the paramedic is somewhere to the right of the scientist.
   - The scientist cannot be in position 7 (firefighter).
   - The scientist must be in positions 4, 5, or 6.
   - Therefore, the paramedic must be in positions 5, 6, or 7.

10. **Clue 9 and 14:** The person whose sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is soccer and the accountant is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is soccer.
