Lv5-1x5-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. The fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the fan of d&b.
2. The fan of pop is in an odd position.
3. The fan of funk is on the far right (position 5).
4. The fan of r&b is between the fan of pop and the fan of techno.
5. The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan of pop.

From clue 3, we know:
- Funk is in position 5.

From clue 2, we know:
- Pop is in an odd position (1, 3).

From clue 5, since r&b is to the left of pop and pop is in an odd position, r&b must be in an even position (2 or 4). But from clue 4, r&b is also between pop and techno. So, if pop is in position 1, then r&b must be in position 2 and techno in position 3. If pop is in position 3, then r&b would have to be in position 2 and techno in position 4, but this would violate clue 4 as it would place r&b after pop. Therefore, pop must be in position 1 and r&b in position 2, with techno in position 3.

From clue 1, the fan of funk is to the right of the fan of d&b, and from clue 3, funk is in position 5. Therefore, d&b must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since positions 1, 2, and 3 are already occupied by pop, r&b, and techno respectively, d&b must be in position 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: d&b
- Position 2: r&b
- Position 3: techno
- Position 4: d&b
- Position 5: funk

Now, let's fill in the table:

```

| Music-Genre   |  d&b   |  r&b | techno | d&b | funk |
```

Lv5-1x5-2	"Let's analyze and solve the logic puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

1. The freelancer is somewhere to the right of the teacher.
2. The teacher is on the right of the paramedic.
3. The dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the freelancer.
4. The teacher is on the left or right of the paramedic (redundant with clue 2).
5. The freelancer is somewhere to the right of the teacher (redundant with clue 1).
6. The coach is on the left of the dressmaker.

From clues 1, 2, and 5, we can deduce that the sequence must be something like:
- Teacher -> Paramedic -> Freelancer -> Dressmaker -> Coach

However, clue 3 states that the dressmaker is to the right of the freelancer, which contradicts our initial sequence. Therefore, we need to adjust our sequence.

Given the constraints, let's try to place each job correctly:

- The teacher cannot be in position 5 because there would be no room for the paramedic and the freelancer to the right of the teacher.
- The coach must be to the left of the dressmaker.

Considering all these points, the only feasible arrangement that fits all clues is:
- Position 1: Coach
- Position 2: Teacher
- Position 3: Paramedic
- Position 4: Freelancer
- Position 5: Dressmaker

Let's verify this arrangement:
1. The freelancer (Position 4) is to the right of the teacher (Position 2).
2. The teacher (Position 2) is to the right of the paramedic (Position 3).
3. The dressmaker (Position 5) is to the right of the freelancer (Position 4).
4. The teacher (Position 2) is to the right of the paramedic (Position 3), which is consistent.
5. The freelancer (Position 4) is to the right of the teacher (Position 2).
6. The coach (Position 1) is to the left of the dressmaker (Position 5).

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv5-1x5-3	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step based on the given conditions:

1. The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person watching epic movies.
2. The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies.
3. The person watching mystery movies is in an even position.
4. The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies.
5. The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching mystery movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Condition 1 and 2**: Crime must be to the left of Epic, and Fantasy must be to the right of Epic.
   - Possible positions for Crime, Epic, and Fantasy: (1, 2, 3) or (2, 3, 4) or (3, 4, 5).

2. **Condition 3**: Mystery is in an even position (2 or 4).
3. **Condition 4 and 5**: Comedy is either to the left or right of Mystery, but it must be to the right of Mystery.

### Let's try different combinations:

#### Case 1: Mystery in position 2
- If Mystery is in position 2, then Comedy can only be in position 4 (since it must be to the right of Mystery).
- Now we need to place Crime, Epic, and Fantasy in the remaining positions (1, 3, 5).
- Since Crime must be to the left of Epic, and Fantasy must be to the right of Epic:
  - If we place Crime in position 1 and Epic in position 3, Fantasy would be in position 5.

So, one possible arrangement could be:
- Position 1: Crime
- Position 2: Mystery
- Position 3: Epic
- Position 4: Comedy
- Position 5: Fantasy

This satisfies all the conditions:
- Crime is to the left of Epic.
- Fantasy is to the right of Epic.
- Mystery is in an even position.
- Comedy is to the right of Mystery.
- Comedy is to the right of Mystery.

Lv5-1x5-5	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the correct order of sports:

1. **The person who's sport is parkour is on the far left.**
   - This means parkour is in position 1.

2. **The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.**
   - This means surfing comes before weightlifting.

3. **The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf.**
   - This means biathlon comes before golf.

4. **The person who's sport is surfing is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person who's sport is biathlon.**
   - This means the order must be: biathlon, surfing, weightlifting.

Given these constraints, we can place the sports as follows:

- Position 1: Parkour (from clue 1)
- Positions 2, 3, and 4 need to fit the order biathlon, surfing, weightlifting.
- Since biathlon must come before golf (clue 3), and surfing is between biathlon and weightlifting (clue 4), we can place them in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- The only remaining position is 5, which must be golf.

So, the order is:
1. Parkour
2. Biathlon
3. Surfing
4. Weightlifting
5. Golf

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv5-1x5-6	"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct order of hobbies.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting**.
   - This means Collecting must be before Fishing.

2. **The person who's hobby is photography is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games**.
   - This means Photography and Board-Games can be adjacent or not, but one must be to the left or right of the other.

3. **The person who's hobby is traveling is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is board-games**.
   - This means Traveling must be in the middle if Fishing and Board-Games are on either side.

4. **The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling**.
   - This reinforces that Fishing and Traveling cannot be adjacent and one must be to the left or right of the other.

5. **The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games**.
   - This means Board-Games must be before Traveling.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. From clue 5, Board-Games (BG) must be before Traveling (T).
2. From clue 3, Traveling (T) is between Fishing (F) and Board-Games (BG). So, we can place them as F-T-BG or BG-T-F.
3. From clue 4, Fishing (F) is on the left or right of Traveling (T), which fits with the above placement.
4. From clue 1, Collecting (C) must be before Fishing (F).

Given these constraints, let's try the possible orderings:

- If F-T-BG is true:
  - C must be before F, so C, F, T, BG, and the remaining hobby (Photography (P)) would fit in the middle.
  - The sequence could be: C, P, F, T, BG or C, F, T, BG, P.

- If BG-T-F is true:
  - C must be before F, so C, BG, T, F, and the remaining hobby (P) would fit.
  - The sequence could be: C, P, BG, T, F or C, BG, T, F, P.

Given all the clues, the most consistent and valid order is:

- C, P, F, T, BG

This satisfies all the conditions:
- C is before F.
- P is on the left or right of BG.
- F is on the left or right of T.
- T is between F and BG.
- BG is before T.

2. The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical.
3. The fan of house is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues.
4. The fan of ambient is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
5. The fan of ambient is between the fan of classical and the fan of house.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 1:
- The fan of classical is between the fan of ambient and the fan of r&b.
- Possible order: [ambient, classical, r&b] or [r&b, classical, ambient]

#### Clue 2:
- The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical.
- This means r&b cannot be immediately to the left of classical; it must be before classical.

#### Combining Clue 1 and Clue 2:
- The only possible order that satisfies both is: [ambient, classical, r&b].

#### Clue 4:
- The fan of ambient is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
- This is already satisfied by our current order [ambient, classical, r&b].

#### Clue 5:
- The fan of ambient is between the fan of classical and the fan of house.
- This means the order must be: [house, ambient, classical, r&b].

#### Clue 3:
- The fan of house is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues.
- This means house must be before blues.

### Final Order:
Combining all clues, we get:
- House (leftmost)

Lv5-1x5-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues:

1. **The person driving the train is in the middle.**
   - This means the train must be in position 3.

2. **The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship.**
   - This means the ship cannot be in position 5 and the skateboard must be in a position to the right of the ship.

3. **The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.**
   - This means the snowmobile cannot be in position 4 or 5 and the ship must be to the right of the snowmobile.

4. **The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.**
   - This means the trike must be in a position to the right of the skateboard.

5. **The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the skateboard.**
   - This is redundant with clue 4 and doesn't provide new information.

Now let's arrange the transports based on these clues:

- Position 3 must be the train (from clue 1).
- The ship must be to the left of the skateboard (clue 2).
- The snowmobile must be to the left of the ship (clue 3).
- The trike must be to the right of the skateboard (clue 4).

Given these constraints, we can start placing the transports:

1. Since the snowmobile must be to the left of the ship, and the ship must be to the left of the skateboard, the only possible positions for these three transports are 1, 2, and 4.
2. The trike must be to the right of the skateboard, so it must be in position 5.
3. Therefore, the only position left for the trike is 5.

So, the sequence is:
- Position 1: Snowmobile
- Position 2: Ship
- Position 3: Train
- Position 4: Skateboard
- Position 5: Trike

Final solution table:

Lv5-1x5-9	"Let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step to determine the correct order of transportation means.

1. **Condition 1:** The person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train.
   - This implies that if the train is at position \(x\), then the roller must be at position \(y\) where \(y > x\).

2. **Condition 2:** The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - This means the ship and the snowmobile can be next to each other or separated by one position.

3. **Condition 3:** The person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - If the snowmobile is at position \(a\), then the ship must be at position \(b\) where \(b > a\).

4. **Condition 4:** The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person driving the train.
   - Similar to Condition 1, if the train is at position \(x\), then the helicopter must be at position \(y\) where \(y = x \pm 1\).

5. **Condition 5:** The person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the helicopter.
   - If the ship is at position \(c\), then the helicopter must be at position \(d\) where \(c < d\).

Given these conditions, let's try to place the transports in an order that satisfies all the conditions:

- From Conditions 1 and 4, we know that the train and the helicopter must be adjacent to each other (either train-helicopter or helicopter-train).
- From Condition 3, the ship must be to the right of the snowmobile.
- From Condition 5, the ship must be to the left of the helicopter.

Considering these constraints, let's start placing them:

1. Place the train and the helicopter as adjacent:
   - Possible pairs: (Train, Helicopter) or (Helicopter, Train)

2. Place the ship and the snowmobile with the ship to the right of the snowmobile:
   - Possible pairs: (Snowmobile, Ship)

Now, let's combine these observations:

- If we place (Train, Helicopter) and (Snowmobile, Ship):
  - We need to fit these into the five positions while maintaining the relative order.

Let's test the possible placements:

- **Position 1: Train**
  - Position 2: Helicopter
  - Position 3: Snowmobile
  - Position 4: Ship
  - Position 5: Roller

This configuration satisfies:
1. The roller is to the right of the train.
2. The ship is to the right of the snowmobile.
3. The ship is to the left of the helicopter.
4. The train and helicopter are adjacent.

Thus, the final solution is:

Lv5-1x5-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the sports in the correct positions. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cricket.
   - This means Cricket cannot be in position 5, and Basketball must be placed after Cricket.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf.
   - This means Golf cannot be in position 1, and Basketball must be placed before Golf.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is cricket is in an odd position.
   - This means Cricket can only be in position 1, 3, or 5.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cricket.
   - This means Biathlon must be in a position before Cricket.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is golf is on the far left or far right.
   - This means Golf is either in position 1 or 5.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - This means Biathlon must be in a position before Cricket.

Let's start placing the sports based on these clues:

- From Clue 5, Golf must be in position 1 or 5.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 2, Basketball must be placed after Cricket and before Golf.
- From Clue 3, Cricket can only be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- From Clue 4, Biathlon must be in a position before Cricket.
- From Clue 6, Cricket is on the right of Biathlon.

Given that Golf is either in position 1 or 5, let's consider both possibilities:

### Case 1: Golf in position 1
- If Golf is in position 1, then Cricket cannot be in position 1 (Clue 3), so Cricket must be in position 3 or 5.
- If Cricket is in position 5, then Basketball must be in a position after Cricket but before Golf (impossible since Golf is in position 1).
- Therefore, Cricket must be in position 3.
- Since Biathlon must be before Cricket (Clue 4) and on the left of Cricket (Clue 6), Biathlon must be in position 2.
- This leaves Basketball in position 4.

So, the sequence would be:
1. Golf
2. Biathlon
3. Cricket
4. Basketball
5. Surfing

### Case 2: Golf in position 5
- If Golf is in position 5, then Cricket must be in position 1 or 3 (Clue 3).
- If Cricket is in position 1, then Basketball must be in a position after Cricket but before Golf (positions 2 or 3).
- However, Biathlon must be before Cricket (Clue 4) and on the left of Cricket (Clue 6), which conflicts with Cricket being in position 1.
- Therefore, Cricket must be in position 3.
- Biathlon must be in position 2.
- This leaves Basketball in position 4.

So, the sequence would be:
1. Cricket
2. Biathlon
3. Cricket
4. Basketball
5. Golf

But this conflicts with Clue 1, as the same person cannot have two sports.

Thus, the only valid solution is from Case 1:
