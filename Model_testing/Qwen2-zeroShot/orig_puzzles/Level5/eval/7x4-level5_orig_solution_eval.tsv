### Placing the Information:

1. From Clue 8, we know that the person eating pomegranate is in position 4.
2. From Clue 20, the person eating cherry is the person whose sport is surfing, so the person eating cherry must be in position 1.

4. From Clue 5, the person eating tomato is to the left of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking milk is in position 2, the person eating tomato must be in position 3, and the person drinking water must be in position 4 (but since cherry is in position 4, this is not possible). Therefore, the person drinking water must be in position 3, and the person eating tomato must be in position 2 (which conflicts with the rat). This needs re-evaluation.

18. **Clue 18:** The person eating pepper is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
19. **Clue 19:** The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the analyst.
20. **Clue 20:** The fan of indie is on the far right.
21. **Clue 21:** The fan of metal is the Italian.

### Analysis and Filling:

#### Step 1: Identify the positions for the Dutch and the Italian:
- **Clue 2:** The owner of the lizard (Dutch) is in one of the positions.
- **Clue 7:** The person drinking mirinda is on the far left or far right.
- **Clue 14:** The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the Italian.
- **Clue 21:** The Italian is the fan of metal, which must be on the far right.

So, the Italian is in position 4 and drinks mirinda.

#### Step 2: Determine the Dutch:
- Since the Italian is in position 4, the Dutch must be in position 1 or 3.
- **Clue 2:** The Dutch owns the lizard.
- **Clue 17:** The owner of the lizard (Dutch) is somewhere to the left of the analyst.
- **Clue 10:** The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the analyst.
- **Clue 19:** The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the analyst.

Given these constraints, the Dutch cannot be in position 3 because it would place the analyst in a position where the guinea-pig owner would not fit. Therefore, the Dutch is in position 1.

#### Step 3: Determine the positions for the other individuals:
- **Clue 5:** The French is on the far left or far right.
- Since the Dutch is in position 1, the French must be in position 4.
- **Clue 20:** The fan of indie is on the far right.
- So, the fan of indie is the French in position 4.

#### Step 4: Determine the remaining positions:
- **Clue 6:** The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the Dutch.
- **Clue 8:** The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the French.
- Given the Dutch is in position 1 and the French is in position 4, the person drinking sprite must be in position 3.
- **Clue 15:** The person eating corn is in an even position.
- Therefore, the person eating corn is in position 2.

#### Step 9: Determine the sports and genres:
- **Clue 16:** The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient.
- **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient.
- **Clue 9:** The writer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cricket.
- **Clue 10:** The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the analyst.
- **Clue 11:** The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
- **Clue 12:** The person eating lime is the person drinking juice.
- **Clue 13:** The writer is the owner of the lizard.
- **Clue 14:** The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the Italian.
- **Clue 18:** The person eating pepper is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.

By process of elimination and logical placement:
- The writer is in position 3 (since the person drinking sprite is in position 3).
- The owner of the lizard (writer) is the Italian.
- The person drinking juice (eating lime) is in position 2.
- The person eating pepper is in position 1.
- The person who's sport is cricket is in position 2 (since the writer is in position 3 and the person drinking sprite is in position 3).
- The person who's sport is skateboarding is in position 4.
- The fan of ambient is in position 2 (since the person who's sport is cricket is in position 2 and the person who's sport is skateboarding is in position 4).

Lv5-7x4-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 6**: The person eating potato is the Italian.
2. **Clue 10**: The person eating potato is on the far right.
   - Therefore, the Italian is in position 4.

3. **Clue 17**: The person eating kale is the person drinking water.
4. **Clue 1**: The person drinking water is on the left or right of the Italian (position 4).
   - Since the Italian is in position 4, the person drinking water must be in position 3.

5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person eating kale.
   - Since the person drinking water (kale) is in position 3, the person drinking 7up must be in position 4. But we already know that position 4 is occupied by the Italian. So, the person drinking 7up must be in position 2.

6. **Clue 3**: The person drinking almond-milk is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person drinking fanta.
7. **Clue 4**: The person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry.
8. **Clue 7**: The American is on the left or right of the person drinking water (position 3).
   - Since the person drinking water (kale) is in position 3, the American can be in position 2 or 4. But position 4 is occupied by the Italian, so the American must be in position 2.

9. **Clue 2**: The lawyer is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.
10. **Clue 8**: The person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water (position 3).
    - Therefore, the person watching musical movies must be in position 4, which is the Italian. This contradicts our earlier placement. Let's re-evaluate:
    - The person watching musical movies must be in position 4, but since the Italian is there, it must be someone else. The person watching musical movies must be in position 5, but we only have 4 positions. Thus, we need to place the person watching musical movies in position 4, and the Italian must be in another position.

11. **Clue 9**: The person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water (position 3).
    - Therefore, the person driving the ship must be in position 4, which is the Italian. This is consistent with Clue 6.

12. **Clue 11**: The person driving the van is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing.
13. **Clue 12**: The Argentine is somewhere to the right of the scientist.

15. **Clue 14**: The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person eating blueberry.
16. **Clue 15**: The person driving the van is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies.
17. **Clue 16**: The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the Argentine.
18. **Clue 18**: The manager is on the left or right of the Italian (position 4).

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining elements:

- Position 1: The person eating blueberry.
- Position 2: The American (drinking 7up).
- Position 3: The person drinking water (kale).
- Position 4: The Italian (driving the ship).

We need to place the remaining elements:
- Sport: soccer, cycling, parkour, sailing.
- Movie-Genre: adventure, comedy, musical, scientific.
- Nationality: American, Argentine, Australian, Italian.
- Beverage: 7up, almond-milk, fanta, water.
- Food: blueberry, kale, pineapple, potato.
- Job: accountant, lawyer, manager, scientist.

Based on the clues:
