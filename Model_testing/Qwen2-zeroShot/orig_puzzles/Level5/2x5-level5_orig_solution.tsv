Lv5-2x5-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the hobbies and sports accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The person who's hobby is reading is in an odd position (i.e., position 1 or 3 or 5).
2. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour.
3. The person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position (i.e., position 1 or 3 or 5).
4. The person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games (i.e., positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
5. The person who's hobby is singing is on the far right (position 5).
6. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
7. The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is handball (i.e., positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
8. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Hobbies and Sports Based on Clues
1. **Hobby Reading** must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
2. **Hobby Chess** must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
3. **Hobby Singing** must be in position 5.
4. **Hobby Sudoku** must be to the right of **Hobby Video-Games**.
5. **Sport Snowboarding** must be to the left of **Sport Parkour**.
6. **Sport Snowboarding** must be to the right of **Sport Weightlifting**.
7. **Sport Volleyball** must be to the right of **Sport Handball**.
8. **Sport Parkour** must be to the right of **Hobby Reading**.

Given that **Singing** is in position 5, we can start placing other elements:

#### Step 2: Placing the Known Elements
- **Position 5**: Singing (S)

Now, let's consider the positions for **Reading**, **Chess**, **Sudoku**, and **Video-Games**:

- **Reading** and **Chess** must be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Since **Singing** is in position 5, **Reading** and **Chess** must be in positions 1 or 3.
- **Sudoku** must be to the right of **Video-Games**. So, if **Video-Games** is in position 1, **Sudoku** must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But since **Singing** is in position 5, **Sudoku** cannot be in position 5. Thus, **Video-Games** must be in position 1, and **Sudoku** must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Let's try placing **Reading** and **Chess**:

- If **Reading** is in position 1, then **Chess** must be in position 3.
- If **Reading** is in position 3, then **Chess** must be in position 1.

Since **Reading** and **Chess** must be in odd positions and they cannot both be in position 3 (as **Singing** is in position 5), **Reading** must be in position 1 and **Chess** must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- **Position 1**: Reading (R)
- **Position 3**: Chess (C)
- **Position 5**: Singing (S)

#### Step 3: Placing the Remaining Elements
- **Sudoku** must be to the right of **Video-Games**. Given the positions, **Video-Games** can be in position 1 or 3. Since **Reading** is in position 1 and **Chess** is in position 3, **Video-Games** must be in position 1 (already taken) or 3 (already taken). Thus, **Video-Games** must be in position 2 and **Sudoku** must be in position 4.

So, we have:
- **Position 2**: Video-Games (V)
- **Position 4**: Sudoku (Su)

#### Step 4: Placing the Sports
- **Snowboarding** must be to the left of **Parkour** and to the right of **Weightlifting**.
- **Volleyball** must be to the right of **Handball**.

Since **Parkour** must be to the right of **Reading** (which is in position 1), **Parkour** must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But **Video-Games** is in position 2, so **Parkour** must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Given **Reading** is in position 1, **Parkour** must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Since **Chess** is in position 3, **Parkour** must be in position 4 or 5. But **Singing** is in position 5, so **Parkour** must be in position 4.

Thus, **Snowboarding** must be in position 2 (left of **Parkour**), and **Weightlifting** must be in position 1 (right of **Snowboarding**).

So, we have:
- **Position 1**: Weightlifting (W)
- **Position 2**: Snowboarding (Sw)
- **Position 3**: Parkour (P)
- **Position 4**: Sudoku (Su)
- **Position 5**: Singing (S)

Finally, **Volleyball** must be to the right of **Handball**. Since **Parkour** is in position 3, **Volleyball** must be in position 4 or 5. But **Sudoku** is in position 4, so **Volleyball** must be in position 5, and **Handball** must be in position 4.

So, we have:
- **Position 4**: Handball (Hb)
- **Position 5**: Volleyball (Vb)

Lv5-2x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding items in the correct positions. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
4. **Clue 4:** The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person driving the roller.
5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the tram is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller.
6. **Clue 6:** The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the tram.
7. **Clue 7:** The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies.
8. **Clue 8:** The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies.
9. **Clue 9:** The person watching animation movies is in the middle.
10. **Clue 10:** The person watching animation movies is between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the tram.
11. **Clue 12:** The person watching action movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies.

### Initial Placement:

From Clue 9, the person watching animation movies must be in position 3 (since it's in the middle).

From Clue 10, the person watching animation movies is between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the tram. Therefore:
- The person driving the snowmobile must be either 1 or 2.
- The person driving the tram must be either 4 or 5.
- The person watching animation movies must be 3.

Let's denote the person watching animation movies as ""A"", the person driving the snowmobile as ""S"", and the person driving the tram as ""T"".

### Placing Animation Movies:

- Animation Movies: 3 (A)
- Snowmobile: S (1 or 2)
- Tram: T (4 or 5)

### Considering Clues 1, 2, and 3:

- Roller (R) is to the right of Action (A).
- Tram (T) is to the right of Jet-ski (J).
- Jet-ski (J) is to the right of Snowmobile (S).

Since Animation is in 3, and Roller is to the right of Action, Roller cannot be 3, 4, or 5. So, it must be 1 or 2. Tram must be to the right of Jet-ski, and Jet-ski must be to the right of Snowmobile.

### Placing Snowmobile and Tram:

- Since Tram is to the left of Roller, and Roller is to the right of Action, the only logical placement for Snowmobile and Tram is:
  - Snowmobile (S): 1
  - Tram (T): 5
  - Roller (R): 2

This satisfies all the conditions for Clues 1, 2, and 3.

### Final Placement:

- Animation Movies: 3 (A)
- Snowmobile: 1 (S)
- Tram: 5 (T)
- Roller: 2 (R)

### Considering Clues 4 and 5:

- Documentary (D) must be to the left of Roller (R), so Documentary must be 1 or 2. Since Snowmobile is 1, Documentary must be 2.
- Jet-ski (J) must be to the right of Snowmobile, so Jet-ski must be 4.

### Final Placement:

- Documentary: 2 (D)
- Jet-ski: 4 (J)
- Action: 1 (Action)
- Animation: 3 (A)
- Musical: 5 (Musical)

### Considering Clues 6 and 7:

- Jet-ski is on the left or right of Tram, which is true since Jet-ski is 4 and Tram is 5.
- Snowmobile is on the left or right of Animation, which is true since Snowmobile is 1 and Animation is 3.
- Animation is on the left or right of Documentary, which is true since Animation is 3 and Documentary is 2.

### Final Table:

```plaintext
###############
| Movie-Genre | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Transport   | Snowmobile | Jet-ski | Animation | Documentary | Tram |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------|------------|------|

Each genre and mode of transport is correctly placed according to the given clues."
Lv5-2x5-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking tea is in the middle.
2. The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.
3. The person whose hobby is gardening is the person drinking almond-milk.
4. The person whose hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is dancing.
5. The person whose hobby is card-games is the person whose hobby is card-games (redundant).
6. The person whose hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is reading.
7. The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person whose hobby is gardening.
8. The person whose hobby is board-games is between the person drinking cola and the person drinking almond-milk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking tea is in the middle (position 3).
   - Beverage: Tea (Beverage 3)
   
2. **Clue 3**: The person whose hobby is gardening is the person drinking almond-milk.
   - Beverage: Almond-milk (Beverage 2 or 4, but not 3 because it's tea)
   - Hobby: Gardening (Hobby 2 or 4, but not 3 because it's middle)

3. **Clue 6**: The person whose hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is reading.
   - Since the person with gardening is in position 2 or 4, the person with reading must be in position 4 or 5.
   - If gardening is in position 2, then reading must be in position 4 or 5.
   - If gardening is in position 4, then reading must be in position 5.

4. **Clue 7**: The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person whose hobby is gardening.
   - If gardening is in position 2, then mirinda must be in position 4 or 5.
   - If gardening is in position 4, then mirinda must be in position 5.
   - Since reading is in position 4 or 5 and mirinda cannot be in the same position as reading, we need to place them correctly.

5. **Clue 2**: The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.
   - Fanta must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 if card-games is in positions 2, 3, or 4.

6. **Clue 4**: The person whose hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is dancing.
   - This means card-games and dancing are adjacent or separated by one person.

7. **Clue 8**: The person whose hobby is board-games is between the person drinking cola and the person drinking almond-milk.
   - Since almond-milk is in position 2, and board-games is between cola and almond-milk, cola must be in position 1 or 4.

Let's try to fit all these pieces together:

- **Position 3** (middle) is Tea.
- **Position 2** is Almond-milk (gardening hobby).
- **Position 4 or 5** is Reading (garden hobby is left of reading).
- **Position 4 or 5** is Mirinda (right of gardening).

Since Reading and Mirinda cannot occupy the same position, and considering other constraints, let's assume:
- **Position 4** is Reading (garden hobby).
- **Position 5** is Mirinda.

Now, let's fill in the rest:
- **Position 1 or 4** for Card-games and Dancing (adjacent or separated by one).
- **Position 1 or 4** for Board-games, between Cola and Almond-milk.

Given fanta is to the left of card-games, and considering the constraints, let's place:
- **Position 1** is Fanta.
- **Position 2** is Almond-milk (gardening hobby).
- **Position 3** is Tea.
- **Position 4** is Reading.
- **Position 5** is Mirinda.

Finally, placing board-games and card-games:
- **Position 1** is Fanta.
- **Position 2** is Almond-milk (gardening hobby).
- **Position 3** is Tea.
- **Position 4** is Reading.
- **Position 5** is Mirinda.

Board-games and card-games can be:
- **Position 1** (Fanta) and **Position 2** (Almond-milk) are not possible for board-games and card-games.
- **Position 2** (Almond-milk) and **Position 3** (Tea) are not possible.
- **Position 3** (Tea) and **Position 4** (Reading) are not possible.
- **Position 4** (Reading) and **Position 5** (Mirinda) are not possible.
- **Position 1** (Fanta) and **Position 4** (Reading) could work for card-games and dancing.

Thus, the final solution is:

```
|            |    1    |     2      |      3      |      4      |    5    |
| Beverage   |  Fanta  |  Almond-milk |  Tea       |  Card-games |  Mirinda |
| Hobby      |  Board-games |  Gardening |  Dancing |  Reading  |  Card-games |
```"
Lv5-2x5-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the clues and fill in what we know:

1. **Clue 5:** The Italian is the fan of pop.
   - So, the Italian is in one of the positions where pop is listed.

2. **Clue 3 & 5:** The fan of pop is the Italian.
   - This confirms that the Italian is in the pop position.

3. **Clue 8:** The Canadian is on the left of the fan of classical.
   - Since the Canadian is in an even position (Clue 6), the possible positions for the Canadian are 2 or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of d&b.
   - Salsa must be to the left of d&b.

5. **Clue 1:** The Russian is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa.
   - If salsa is in position 2, then the Russian must be in position 1.

6. **Clue 2:** The British is on the left or right of the fan of gospel.
   - Since the British is not necessarily adjacent to the fan of gospel but can be anywhere to the left or right.

7. **Clue 6:** The British is on the left or right of the Canadian.
   - Since the Canadian is in an even position (2 or 4).

8. **Clue 7:** The Canadian is on the left of the fan of classical.
   - If the Canadian is in position 2, the fan of classical could be in position 3, 4, or 5.

9. **Clue 9:** The fan of salsa is in an odd position.
   - Salsa can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

10. **Clue 10:** The fan of gospel is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa.
    - Gospel must be to the left of salsa.

### Step 2: Assign values based on the constraints:

- From Clue 3, the Italian is in the pop position (position 3).
- From Clue 8, the Canadian must be in position 2.
- From Clue 7, since the Canadian is in position 2, the fan of classical must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- From Clue 5, the Italian is in the pop position (position 3), which matches with Clue 3.
- From Clue 9, the fan of salsa must be in an odd position, so it can be in position 1 or 3. But position 3 is already taken by the Italian, so salsa must be in position 1.
- From Clue 4, salsa (position 1) must be to the left of d&b, so d&b must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But position 2 is taken by the Canadian, so d&b must be in position 4 or 5.
- From Clue 1, the Russian must be in position 1 or 2, but position 1 is taken by salsa, so the Russian must be in position 2.
- From Clue 6, the British can be in any position to the left or right of the Canadian (in position 2). Since the Russian is in position 2, the British cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the British must be in position 4 or 5.
- From Clue 10, gospel must be to the left of salsa (position 1). So, gospel must be in position 4 or 5. Since the British is in position 4 or 5, gospel must be in position 4 and the British in position 5.

### Final Solution:

|               |    1    |    2    |    3    |    4     |     5      |

6. The person eating papaya is on the right of the person eating artichoke.
7. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 6: Person with sport cycling is on the right of the person with sport skiing.
This means that if we denote the positions as 1 to 5, the person with sport skiing cannot be in position 5 (the last one), and the person with sport cycling cannot be in position 1 (the first one).

#### Clue 2: Person with sport lacrosse is on the right of the person eating papaya.
This means that if the person eating papaya is in position \(i\), then the person with sport lacrosse must be in position \(i+1\).

#### Clue 3: Person with sport lacrosse is between the person eating radish and the person with sport ice-hockey.
This means that if the person eating radish is in position \(j\) and the person with sport ice-hockey is in position \(k\), then the person with sport lacrosse must be in position \(j+1\) or \(k-1\).

#### Clue 6: Person with sport cycling is on the right of the person with sport skiing.
This means that if the person with sport skiing is in position \(m\), then the person with sport cycling must be in position \(m+1\).

#### Clue 1: Person with sport skiing is on the left or right of the person eating artichoke.
This means the person eating artichoke can be adjacent to the person with sport skiing.

#### Clue 4: Person eating pear is on the left or right of the person eating radish.
This means the person eating radish can be adjacent to the person eating pear.

#### Clue 5: Person with sport cycling is somewhere to the left of the person eating papaya.
This means the person eating papaya cannot be in position 1, and the person with sport cycling must be in a position before the person eating papaya.

#### Clue 6: Person eating papaya is on the right of the person eating artichoke.
This means the person eating artichoke must be in a position before the person eating papaya.

#### Possible Arrangements:
Given these constraints, let's try to fit everything into a possible arrangement:

1. Let's start with the person eating artichoke and place them in position 1 for simplicity.
2. The person eating papaya must be after the person eating artichoke, so they could be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
3. The person with sport cycling must be to the left of the person eating papaya.
4. The person with sport skiing must be either to the left or right of the person eating artichoke.
5. The person with sport lacrosse must be between the person eating radish and the person with sport ice-hockey.
6. The person eating pear must be next to the person eating radish.

### Final Arrangement:
- Position 1: Artichoke (to satisfy clue 6)
- Position 2: Radish (to satisfy clue 4)
- Position 3: Ice-hockey (to satisfy clue 3)
- Position 4: Lacrosse (to satisfy clue 2 and clue 3)
- Position 5: Skiing (to satisfy clue 1 and clue 7)

Now we need to fill in the sports:
- Position 1: Artichoke, Sport: Skiing (from clue 1)
- Position 2: Radish, Sport: Ice-hockey (from clue 3)
- Position 3: Papaya, Sport: Lacrosse (from clue 2 and clue 3)
- Position 4: Pear, Sport: Cycling (from clue 5)
- Position 5: Cabbage, Sport: Rowing (the only remaining sport)

So, the final arrangement is:

```

9. **Clue 9:** The person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies.
10. **Clue 10:** The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.
11. **Clue 11:** The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Clue 6:** The person driving the taxi is on the far left or far right. This means either position 1 or 5 is occupied by the taxi driver.
2. **Clue 4:** The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the left of the person driving the airplane. So, if the taxi is in position 1, the airplane must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Clue 3:** The person watching superhero movies is in an odd position (1 or 3 or 5) and is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike.
4. **Clue 10:** The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since the superhero movies are in an odd position, the van must be in an even position (2, 4).

Let's start with the taxi:
- If the taxi is in position 1, then the airplane must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- If the taxi is in position 5, then the airplane must be in position 4.

Let's assume the taxi is in position 1:
- Then the airplane must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- The superhero movies must be in an odd position (1 or 3 or 5) and somewhere to the left of the motorbike driver.
- The van must be in an even position (2, 4).

Let's try the taxi in position 1 and airplane in position 2:
- Superhero movies can be in position 3 or 5.
- Van can be in position 4.
- Motorbike must be in position 5 (since it has to be to the right of the superhero movies).

Now let's fit the remaining clues:
- Clue 7: Helicopter is to the left of mystery movies, so helicopter cannot be in position 5 (where the motorbike is). So, helicopter must be in position 3 or 4.
- Clue 8: Mystery movies are to the right of motorbike, so mystery movies must be in position 5.
- Clue 5: Mystery movies are to the right of van, so van must be in position 4.
- Clue 1: Crime movies are to the left or right of mystery movies, so crime movies can be in position 1 or 2.
- Clue 11: Fantasy is to the left of comedy, so fantasy must be in position 1 or 2, and comedy must be in position 2 or 3.
- Clue 9: Fantasy is to the left or right of comedy, so if fantasy is in position 1, comedy must be in position 2. If fantasy is in position 2, comedy must be in position 3.

So, the only fitting arrangement is:
- Position 1: Taxi
- Position 2: Airplane
- Position 3: Helicopter
- Position 4: Van
- Position 5: Motorbike (superhero movies)

Now, let's fit the movies:
- Position 1: Taxi (van)
- Position 2: Airplane
- Position 3: Helicopter (fantasy)
- Position 4: Van (comedy)
- Position 5: Motorbike (superhero)

And the remaining movies:
- Position 1: Taxi (van)
- Position 2: Airplane (crime)
- Position 3: Helicopter (fantasy)
- Position 4: Van (comedy)
- Position 5: Motorbike (superhero)

So, the final solution is:

```
|               |    1    |   2    |     3      |     4     |    5     |
| Movie-Genre   |  Crime  | Fantasy|  Mystery   |  Comedy   | Superhero|
| Transport     |  Taxi   |  Airplane| Helicopter|  Van     |  Motorbike|

   - Therefore, the order for House, Punk, and Indie must be either Punk-House-Indie or Punk-Indie-House.

3. From clue 2 and 7, we can infer:
   - Classical must be to the right of Indie.
   - d&b must be to the right of Classical.
   - Therefore, the order for Classical, Indie, and d&b must be Classical-Indie-d&b.

4. Combining these two sets of information:
   - House (milk) must be between Punk and Indie, and Punk must be on the left side of House.
   - Therefore, the only possible order is Punk-House-Indie-Classical-d&b.

5. From clue 6, we know:
   - Hot-chocolate is to the left of Indie.
   - Therefore, Hot-chocolate must be in positions 1 or 2.

6. From clue 4, we know:
   - Soy-milk is to the left of d&b.
   - Therefore, Soy-milk cannot be in position 5.

7. From clue 8, we know:
   - Fanta is to the left of Classical.
   - Therefore, Fanta must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

8. Let's fill in the table based on the above deductions:

|               |       1       |   2   |   3   |     4     |   5   |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | fanta | milk  | soy-milk  | d&b   |
| Music-Genre   | classical     | indie | punk  | house     | d&b   |

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |       1       |   2   |   3   |     4     |   5   |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | fanta | milk  | soy-milk  | d&b   |
| Music-Genre   | classical     | indie | punk  | house     | d&b   |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv5-2x5-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the foods and nationalities accordingly. Let's break down the clues step-by-step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person eating cranberry is the person eating cranberry** - This is redundant and doesn't provide new information.
2. **The person eating strawberry is on the left of the Nigerian** - This means if someone is eating strawberry, they must be seated to the left of the Nigerian.
3. **The person eating cranberry is on the left of the person eating spinach** - The cranberry eater is to the left of the spinach eater.
4. **The person eating kiwi is on the left of the person eating strawberry** - The kiwi eater is to the left of the strawberry eater.
5. **The Nigerian is on the right of the Australian** - The Nigerian is to the right of the Australian.
6. **The Argentine is somewhere to the right of the person eating lemon** - The Argentine is to the right of the lemon eater.
7. **The person eating strawberry is between the person eating cranberry and the Italian** - The strawberry eater is sandwiched between the cranberry eater and the Italian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 7, we know that the sequence for the seats must be: Cranberry (C) -> Strawberry (S) -> Italian (I).
2. From clue 4, the sequence must also include: Kiwi (K) -> Strawberry (S).
3. Combining clues 4 and 7, we get: Kiwi (K) -> Strawberry (S) -> Italian (I).
4. From clue 2, the sequence must be: [Something] -> Strawberry (S) -> Nigerian (N).
5. From clue 3, the sequence must be: Cranberry (C) -> Spinach (P) -> [Something].
6. From clue 5, the sequence must be: Australian (A) -> Nigerian (N).
7. From clue 6, the sequence must be: Lemon (L) -> [Something] -> Argentine (Arg).

Now, let's piece it all together:

- Since the Argentine is to the right of the lemon eater, and the Nigerian is to the right of the Australian, we can place them as follows:
  - If we place the Argentine and the lemon eater, the only way to satisfy all conditions is:
    - Lemon (L)
    - [Something]
    - Argentine (Arg)

- The Nigerian must be to the right of the Australian, so we have:
  - Australian (A)
  - Nigerian (N)

- Now, placing the rest of the sequence:
  - Cranberry (C)
  - Spinach (P)
  - Strawberry (S)
  - Italian (I)
  - Kiwi (K)

So, the final arrangement is:

- 1: Lemon (L)
- 2: Argentine (Arg)
- 3: Australian (A)
- 4: Nigerian (N)
- 5: Cranberry (C)

- 1: Lemon (L)
- 2: Argentine (Arg)
- 3: Australian (A)
- 4: Nigerian (N)
- 5: Cranberry (C)

- 1: Lemon (L)
- 2: Argentine (Arg)
- 3: Australian (A)
- 4: Nigerian (N)
- 5: Cranberry (C)

Lv5-2x5-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **The Spanish is between the person drinking Fanta and the Turkish.**
   - This means the Spanish person must be in one of the middle positions (2, 3, or 4) with Fanta and Turkish on either side.
   
2. **The person drinking Almond-Milk is on the far left or far right.**
   - This means Almond-Milk can only be in position 1 or 5.
   
3. **The Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian.**
   - The Spanish person cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the Indonesian is in position 1 or 2.
   
4. **The Spanish is in an odd position.**
   - The possible positions for the Spanish are 1, 3, or 5.
   
5. **The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Juice.**
   - This means the Indonesian cannot be in the first position if the person drinking juice is in the first position.
   
6. **The Australian is on the far left.**
   - The Australian must be in position 1.
   
7. **The person drinking Water is the Spanish.**
   - This means the Spanish is drinking Water.
   
8. **The person drinking Cola is on the left or right of the person drinking Almond-Milk.**
   - If Almond-Milk is in position 1, Cola can be in position 2 or 5. If Almond-Milk is in position 5, Cola can be in position 4 or 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1:**
   - Australian (Clue 6)
   - Since the Australian is in position 1, Almond-Milk must be in position 5 (Clue 2).

2. **Position 5:**
   - Almond-Milk (from above)
   - Water is the Spanish (Clue 7), so the Spanish is in position 5.
   - The Spanish is in an odd position (Clue 4), so this fits.

3. **Position 3:**
   - Spanish is in position 5, so it must be between Fanta and Turkish (Clue 1).
   - Therefore, Fanta and Turkish must be in positions 2 and 4, but not in their original order.

4. **Position 2 and 4:**
   - Fanta and Turkish need to be placed such that the Spanish is between them.
   - Since the Spanish is in position 5, Fanta and Turkish can only be in positions 2 and 4.
   
5. **Position 2:**
   - If Fanta is in position 2, then Turkish must be in position 4.
   - If Turkish is in position 2, then Fanta must be in position 4.

6. **Indonesian and Juice:**
   - The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Juice (Clue 5).
   - The Spanish is in position 5, which is the far right, so the Indonesian must be in position 3 and the person drinking Juice must be in position 2 or 4.
   - If Fanta is in position 2, then the Indonesian cannot be in position 2 because the person drinking Juice would have to be in position 1, which is not possible since the Australian is already there.
   - Therefore, Fanta must be in position 4 and Turkish in position 2.
   - The Indonesian must be in position 3, and the person drinking Juice must be in position 2.

7. **Cola:**
   - The person drinking Cola is on the left or right of the person drinking Almond-Milk (Clue 8).
   - Since Almond-Milk is in position 5, Cola must be in position 4 or 2.
   - Fanta is in position 4, so Cola must be in position 2.

### Final Table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |    4    |      5      |
| Beverage      | Australian | Cola      | Indonesian | Fanta  | Spanish (Water) |
| Nationality   | Australian | Indonesian | Indonesian | Spanish | Spanish        |
```

This solution fits all the given clues."
Lv5-2x5-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and use the given constraints to fill in the table.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The person eating grapes is on the right of the person eating lemon.**
   - This means the order for food must be: Lemon, Grapes.

2. **The person eating plum is on the left of the person eating banana.**
   - This means the order for food must be: Plum, Banana.

3. **The person eating plum is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies.**
   - This implies that the person watching scientific movies cannot be in position 5 (the last position), and the person eating plum must be to the right of them.

4. **The person watching satire movies is in an odd position.**
   - The odd positions are 1, 3, and 5. So, the person watching satire movies can be in these positions.

5. **The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.**
   - This means the person watching romance movies cannot be in the last position, and the person watching scientific movies must be to the right.

6. **The person watching romance movies is in an even position.**
   - The even positions are 2 and 4. So, the person watching romance movies must be in one of these positions.

7. **The person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating eggplant.**
   - This means the order for food must be: Family, Eggplant, with the person watching family movies to the left of the person eating eggplant.

### Combining the Constraints:

From constraint 1 and 2, we know:
- Lemon, Grapes
- Plum, Banana

From constraint 3, we know:
- Plum must be to the right of someone watching scientific movies.

From constraint 4 and 5, we know:
- Satire is in an odd position.
- Romance is in an even position and to the left of scientific.

From constraint 6 and 7, we know:
- Family is to the left of Eggplant.

Given all these constraints, let's try to place each element:

- Since Plum and Banana must be next to each other and Plum must be to the right of someone watching scientific movies, and Plum must be to the left of Banana, the only possible positions for Plum and Banana are 3 and 4 respectively.
- This leaves positions 1, 2, and 5 for the other foods and genres.

- Since Romance is in an even position and to the left of Scientific, and Satire is in an odd position, the only possible positions for Romance and Scientific are 2 and 4 or 4 and 2, but since Plum is in 3, Scientific must be in 4 and Romance in 2.
- This leaves positions 1 and 5 for Lemon and Eggplant, with Family to the left of Eggplant.

So, the final arrangement should be:

- Position 1: Family, Eating Lemon
- Position 2: Romance, Watching Movies
- Position 3: Plum, Eating Grapes
- Position 4: Scientific, Watching Movies
- Position 5: Banana, Eating Eggplant

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1    |    2    |     3      |     4     |   5    |
| Food          | Lemon  |         | Grapes     |           | Eggplant |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance|         | Satire     | Scientific|         |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given constraints."
