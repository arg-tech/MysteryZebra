- So, the person eating cherry is also driving the boat.

From Clue 12:
- The person drinking water is on the right of the person eating peas.
- Since the person eating cherry (and drinking water) is driving the boat, the person eating peas must be in position 1 or 2 (leftmost).

From Clue 13:

Lv5-5x4-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Position of Thriller Movie Watcher**: The person watching thrillers is on the far right (position 4).
   - **Hobby: ?**
   - **Job: ?**
   - **Movie-Genre: Thriller**
   - **Nationality: ?**
   - **Transport: ?**

2. **Musician Position**: The musician is on the left of the Canadian.
   - Since the musician cannot be in position 4 (thriller watcher), let's place them in positions 1 or 2.

3. **Helicopter Driver Position**: The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the British.
   - This means the British cannot be in position 4 (thriller watcher).

4. **Car Driver**: The American drives the car.
   - The American must be in position 4 (thriller watcher) since they drive the car, which contradicts the earlier point about the musician being on the left of the Canadian. Let's re-evaluate:
     - If the American is in position 4, then the musician must be in position 3 (since they need to be on the left of the Canadian).

5. **Analyst Position**: The analyst is in an odd position (positions 1 or 3).
   - Given that the American is in position 4, the analyst must be in position 1 or 3.

6. **British Occupation**: The British is the architect.

7. **Video-Games Hobbist Position**: The person with the hobby of video-games is between the person with the hobby of skydiving and the German.
   - Since the German cannot be in position 4 (thriller watcher), the video-games hobbist must be in position 2, and the skydiving hobbist must be in position 1, making the German in position 3.

8. **Motorbike Driver Position**: The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.
   - The person watching epic movies is the American, so the motorbike driver must be in position 2 or 4. But position 4 is already taken by the thriller watcher, so it must be in position 2.

9. **Epic Movie Watcher**: The person watching epic movies is the American.
   - The American must be in position 4 (already determined).

10. **Skydiving Hobbist Position**: The person with the hobby of skydiving is on the far left (position 1).
    - This aligns with the previous deduction.

11. **Baking Hobbist Position**: The person with the hobby of baking is on the left or right of the person watching action movies.
    - The action movie watcher is the German, so the baking hobbist must be in position 3.

12. **Action Movie Watcher**: The person watching action movies is the German.
    - The German must be in position 3 (baking hobbist).

13. **Motorbike Driver**: The person driving the motorbike is the American.
    - The American must be in position 4 (already determined).

14. **Baking Hobbist Position**: The baking hobbist must be in position 3 (action movie watcher).
