Lv5-1x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and arrange the given clues step by step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. The lawyer is on the left of the accountant.
2. The dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the manager.
3. The nurse is on the left of the lawyer.
4. The coach is somewhere to the left of the musician.
5. The accountant is on the right of the lawyer.
6. The musician is on the far right.
7. The dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the coach.
8. The coach is somewhere to the right of the lawyer.
9. The manager is on the right of the dressmaker.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **From clue 6:** The musician (M) must be in position 7.
   ```
   |       |   1   |   2    |     3      |   4   |     5      |    6    |    7     |
   |       |       |        |            |       |            |         | M       |
   ```

2. **From clue 5 and 1:** The lawyer (L) is on the left of the accountant (A), and A is on the right of L. Therefore, L and A must occupy positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
   - If L is in 1, A must be in 2.
   - If L is in 2, A must be in 3.
   Let's test both possibilities.

3. **From clue 3:** The nurse (N) is on the left of the lawyer (L).
   - If L is in 1, N must be in 1, but that's not possible since L is in 1.
   - If L is in 2, N must be in 1.
   So, N is in 1, L is in 2, and A is in 3.
   ```
   | N     | L     | A      |     3      |   4   |     5      |    6    | M       |
   ```

4. **From clue 2:** The dressmaker (D) is somewhere to the left of the manager (M).
   - D must be in 4, 5, or 6.
   - M must be in 5, 6, or 7 (but 7 is occupied by M).

5. **From clue 4:** The coach (C) is somewhere to the left of the musician (M).
   - C must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

6. **From clue 7:** The dressmaker (D) is somewhere to the right of the coach (C).
   - If C is in 1, D must be in 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - If C is in 2, D must be in 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - If C is in 3, D must be in 4, 5, or 6.
   - If C is in 4, D must be in 5 or 6.
   - Since M is in 7, D cannot be in 7.

7. **From clue 8:** The coach (C) is somewhere to the right of the lawyer (L).
   - C must be in 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - Since L is in 2, C must be in 3, 4, 5, or 6.

8. **From clue 9:** The manager (M) is on the right of the dressmaker (D).
   - If D is in 4, M must be in 5.
   - If D is in 5, M must be in 6.
   - If D is in 6, M must be in 7 (but 7 is already occupied by M).

Combining all clues, let's place the remaining jobs:

- If D is in 4, M must be in 5.
- C must be in 3 (since itâ€™s to the left of M and to the right of L).

So, the arrangement is:
```
| N     | L     | C      | D      |  M   |     5      |    6    | M       |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|       |   1   |   2    |     3      |   4   |     5      |    6    |    7     |
| Nurse | Lawyer| Coach  | Dressmaker | Manager| Musician   |         | Musician |

Lv5-1x7-2	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to solve this puzzle.

1. **Clue 3:** The owner of the guinea-pig is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
2. **Clue 4:** The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the bird.
3. **Clue 5:** The owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the dog.
4. **Clue 6:** The owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony.
5. **Clue 7:** The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the hamster.
6. **Clue 8:** The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the owner of the bird (redundant with Clue 4, but useful for verification).
7. **Clue 9:** The owner of the hamster is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the goldfish.
8. **Clue 10:** The owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (redundant with Clue 6, but useful for verification).
9. **Clue 11:** The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster (redundant with Clue 9, but useful for verification).

Given that the guinea-pig must be in an odd position, let's start by placing it in position 1:

- **Position 1:** Guinea-Pig

Now, we need to place the other pets based on the given clues:

- **Clue 4:** The owner of the bird must be to the right of the guinea-pig.
- **Clue 5:** The owner of the bird must be to the left of the owner of the dog.
- **Clue 7:** The owner of the hamster must be between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the goldfish.
- **Clue 9:** The owner of the hamster must be between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the goldfish.

Since the guinea-pig is in position 1, the hamster and goldfish must be in positions 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Let's consider these possibilities:

- If the hamster is in position 2 and the goldfish is in position 3:
  - Position 2: Hamster
  - Position 3: Goldfish

- If the hamster is in position 3 and the goldfish is in position 4:
  - Position 3: Hamster
  - Position 4: Goldfish

However, since the bird must be to the right of the guinea-pig and to the left of the dog, the only possible positions for the bird and dog are 2 and 4 or 4 and 6. Let's test both scenarios:

**Scenario 1:**
- **Position 1:** Guinea-Pig
- **Position 2:** Hamster
- **Position 3:** Goldfish
- **Position 4:** Bird
- **Position 5:** Pony
- **Position 6:** Dog
- **Position 7:** Cat

Checking the clues:
- **Clue 6:** The owner of the cat is to the right of the owner of the pony (Cat in 7, Pony in 5, valid).
- **Clue 7:** The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the hamster (Goldfish in 3, Hamster in 2, invalid).

**Scenario 2:**
- **Position 1:** Guinea-Pig
- **Position 2:** Bird
- **Position 3:** Hamster
- **Position 4:** Goldfish
- **Position 5:** Pony
- **Position 6:** Dog
- **Position 7:** Cat

Checking the clues:
- **Clue 6:** The owner of the cat is to the right of the owner of the pony (Cat in 7, Pony in 5, valid).
- **Clue 7:** The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the hamster (Goldfish in 4, Hamster in 3, valid).

This scenario satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the final solution is:

```

Lv5-1x7-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. **The Indian is between the Thai and the American**:
   - This means we have the sequence: Thai, Indian, American.

2. **The American is on the right of the Indian**:
   - This confirms the sequence from clue 1 and adds that American is to the right of Indian. So, Thai, Indian, American.

3. **The German is on the far right**:
   - This means the last position (7th) is occupied by the German.
   - So, Thai, Indian, American, _, _, _, German.

4. **The Colombian is between the Brazilian and the Thai**:
   - This means we have one of these sequences: Thai, Colombian, Brazilian or Brazilian, Colombian, Thai.

5. **The Malaysian is on the right of the American**:
   - This means the position immediately to the right of the American must be occupied by the Malaysian.
   - So, Thai, Indian, American, Malaysian.

6. **The Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the Colombian**:
   - This means the sequence Thai, Indian, American, Malaysian, Brazilian, Colombian, German fits the criteria.

7. **The American is on the left or right of the Indian**:
   - This is already satisfied by the sequence Thai, Indian, American, Malaysian, Brazilian, Colombian, German.

Given all the clues, we can now place the nationalities in their respective positions:

- The first position must be Thai because it's the only nationality that can start the sequence without contradicting any clues.
- The second position is Indian because it follows Thai and is followed by American.
- The third position is American because it follows Indian and is followed by Malaysian.
- The fourth position is Malaysian because it follows American.
- The fifth position is Brazilian because it is to the left of Colombian and follows Malaysian.
- The sixth position is Colombian because it follows Brazilian.
- The seventh position is German because it is on the far right.

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

1. The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the fan of gospel.
2. The fan of metal is somewhere to the right of the fan of gospel.
3. The fan of metal is on the right of the fan of gospel.
4. The fan of ambient is in the middle (position 4).
5. The fan of techno is on the far left or far right.
6. The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of ambient.
7. The fan of dubstep is on the right of the fan of ambient.
8. The fan of metal is on the left or right of the fan of house.
9. The fan of gospel is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Ambient is in the middle (position 4)**:
   - Ambient is in position 4.

2. **Techno is on the far left or far right**:
   - Since Techno can be either at position 1 or 7, we will consider both possibilities.

3. **Gospel is to the left of Dubstep**:
   - This means Dubstep cannot be in position 1, and Gospel must be to the left of Dubstep.

4. **Metal is to the right of Gospel**:
   - This means Metal cannot be in positions 1 or 2 if Gospel is to the left of it.

5. **Dubstep is to the right of Ambient**:
   - Since Ambient is in position 4, Dubstep must be in positions 5, 6, or 7.

6. **House is on the left or right of Ambient**:
   - House can be in positions 3, 5, 6, or 7.

7. **Metal is to the left or right of House**:
   - Metal can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.

### Testing Possibilities:

Let's start with the possibility that Techno is on the far left (position 1):

- **Position 1: Techno**
- **Position 4: Ambient**

Since Gospel is to the left of Dubstep and Dubstep is to the right of Ambient, let's try:

- **Position 2: Gospel**
- **Position 5 or 6 or 7: Dubstep**

Since Metal is to the right of Gospel and also to the right of Dubstep, let's try:

- **Position 3: Metal**

Now, House can be in positions 6 or 7 (since it's on the left or right of Ambient).

- **Position 6: House**
- **Position 7: Trance**

This satisfies all conditions:

- Techno (1)
- Gospel (2)
- Metal (3)
- Ambient (4)
- Dubstep (5)
- House (6)
- Trance (7)

### Final Solution Table:

Lv5-1x7-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place the nationalities in positions 1 through 7 based on the given clues. Let's analyze each clue step-by-step:

1. **The Mexican is in an even position** (positions 2 or 4 or 6).
2. **The Indian is on the left of the Canadian**.
3. **The Egyptian is in an even position** (positions 2 or 4 or 6).
4. **The Turkish is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian**.
5. **The Mexican is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian**.
6. **The Pakistani is on the left or right of the Egyptian**.
7. **The Turkish is between the Mexican and the Indian**.
8. **The Indian is somewhere to the right of the Mexican**.

Let's start placing the nationalities:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 3, the Mexican and Egyptian must be in positions 2, 4, or 6.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 5, the Mexican must be to the left of the Egyptian.
- Therefore, the possible positions for the Mexican and Egyptian are:
  - Mexican in 2, Egyptian in 4
  - Mexican in 2, Egyptian in 6
  - Mexican in 4, Egyptian in 6

We will test these possibilities one by one.

### Testing Possibility 1: Mexican in 2, Egyptian in 4
- The Indian must be to the left of the Canadian (Clue 2).
- The Pakistani must be on the left or right of the Egyptian (Clue 6), so it can be in 3, 5, or 6.
- The Turkish must be between the Mexican and the Indian (Clue 7), so the Indian must be in 3 or 5.
- The Indian cannot be in 5 because the Pakistani must be in 5 or 6, and there would not be enough space for the Indian and the Turkish.

So, let's try:
- Mexican in 2, Egyptian in 4, Indian in 3, Canadian in 5, Pakistani in 6, Turkish in 1.

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
1. Mexican in 2 (even position)
2. Indian (3) is on the left of Canadian (5)
3. Egyptian in 4 (even position)
4. Turkish (1) is to the left of Egyptian (4)

6. The person who's hobby is traveling is in an odd position.

Given these clues, let's place the hobbies step-by-step:

- From clue 3, we know that the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 7.
- From clue 1, the person with the hobby of singing is in position 4 (the middle).
- From clue 2, the person with the hobby of drawing must be either in position 1 or 6 (since the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 7).

- From clue 4 and clue 5, the person with the hobby of traveling must be to the left of the person with the hobby of dancing, and the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be to the right of the person with the hobby of dancing. This means the person with the hobby of traveling and the person with the hobby of dancing cannot be in positions 1 and 7 because the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 7, and the person with the hobby of singing is in position 4.

- From clue 6, the person with the hobby of traveling must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

Let's start placing the hobbies:

1. Since the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 7, and the person with the hobby of drawing must be either in position 1 or 6, and considering the person with the hobby of traveling must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), let's try:
   - Position 1: Drawing
   - Position 3: Traveling
   - Position 5: Dancing
   - Position 6: Magic-Tricks

Now, let's fit the remaining hobbies:

- Position 1: Drawing
- Position 2: Filmmaking (not yet placed)

Lv5-1x7-8	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The Egyptian is on the left of the Indian.
2. The Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Thai.
3. The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the Thai.
4. The Pakistani is on the left of the Turkish.
5. The Indonesian is on the left or right of the Pakistani.
6. The Spanish is on the right of the Turkish.
7. The Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian.
8. The Egyptian is on the far left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The Egyptian is on the far left** (Clue 8):
   - Position 1: Egyptian

2. **The Pakistani is on the left of the Turkish** (Clue 4):
   - Since the Egyptian is already in position 1, the next possible positions for Pakistani and Turkish are 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, etc., but not before the Egyptian.
   - Let's tentatively place Pakistani in position 2 and Turkish in position 3.

3. **The Indonesian is on the left or right of the Pakistani** (Clue 5):
   - If Pakistani is in position 2, Indonesian can be in position 1 (but it's already taken by the Egyptian) or 3.
   - If Pakistani is in position 3, Indonesian can be in position 2 (but it's already taken by Pakistani) or 4.
   - Therefore, let's place Indonesian in position 4.

4. **The Spanish is on the right of the Turkish** (Clue 6):
   - If Turkish is in position 3, Spanish must be in position 5 or 6 or 7.
   - Let's place Spanish in position 6.

5. **The Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Thai** (Clue 2):
   - If Spanish is in position 6, Thai must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - But position 1 is taken by Egyptian, and position 2 is taken by Pakistani, so Thai must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Since Indonesian is in position 4, Thai must be in position 5.

6. **The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the Thai** (Clue 3):
   - We have Indonesian in position 4 and Thai in position 5, which satisfies this clue.

7. **The Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian** (Clue 7):
   - We have Pakistani in position 2 and Indonesian in position 4, which satisfies this clue.

Now, we need to fill in the remaining position (position 7), which is empty.

### Final Arrangement:
- Position 1: Egyptian
- Position 2: Pakistani
- Position 3: Turkish
- Position 4: Indonesian
- Position 5: Thai
- Position 6: Spanish
- Position 7: (Empty)

Since there is no specific nationality mentioned for position 7, we leave it as ""empty"".

3. **Clue 6:** Drama is on the left of the musical movies, so musical must be in positions 5, 6, or 7. Since we already have a value for position 4, let's try position 7 for musical.
   
   |               |   1   |   2   |    3    |    4    |    5    |     6     |   7    |
   | Movie-Genre   |       |       | **Drama** | **Romance** |         |           | **Musical** |

4. **Clue 2:** Romance is on the left of fantasy movies, so fantasy must be in positions 5, 6, or 7. Since position 5 is taken, let's try position 6 for fantasy.
   
   |               |   1   |   2   |    3    |    4    |    5    |     6     |   7    |
   | Movie-Genre   |       |       | **Drama** | **Romance** |         | **Fantasy** | **Musical** |

5. **Clue 4:** Horror is on the right of animation, so animation must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, and horror must be in positions 5, 6, or 7. Since positions 5 and 6 are taken, let's try position 1 for animation.
   
   |               |   1   |   2   |    3    |    4    |    5    |     6     |   7    |
   | Movie-Genre   | **Animation** |       | **Drama** | **Romance** |         | **Fantasy** | **Musical** |

6. **Clue 3:** Animation is on the right of crime movies, so crime must be in positions 1 or 2, and animation is in position 1. This leaves position 2 for crime.
   
   |               |   1   |   2   |    3    |    4    |    5    |     6     |   7    |
   | Movie-Genre   | **Crime** | **Animation** | **Drama** | **Romance** |         | **Fantasy** | **Musical** |

7. **Clue 1:** Crime is on the left of drama, which matches our current arrangement.

8. **Clue 7:** Drama is on the left of crime, which also matches our current arrangement.

Thus, the final solution is:

```

Lv5-1x7-10	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of hip-hop.
2. The fan of gospel is on the right of the fan of funk.
3. The fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the fan of hip-hop (redundant with clue 1).
4. The fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of ambient.
5. The fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of ambient.
6. The fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk.
7. The fan of hip-hop is in an odd position.

First, let's list the music genres and their positions:
- Ambient
- D&B
- Funk
- Gospel
- Hip-hop
- Metal
- Reggae

From Clue 7, we know that the fan of hip-hop is in an odd position. The possible odd positions are 1, 3, 5, or 7.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 4: The fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of ambient.
- This means ambient cannot be in position 7 (since hip-hop would have to be to its right).

#### Clue 5: The fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of ambient.
- This means gospel cannot be in position 7 (since ambient would have to be to its right).

#### Clue 7: The fan of hip-hop is in an odd position.
- Possible positions for hip-hop: 1, 3, 5.

Let's test each possibility:

**Case 1: Hip-hop is in position 1**
- From Clue 4, ambient must be in position 2.
- From Clue 5, gospel must be in position 1 or 2 (but it can't be in position 1 as hip-hop is there). So, gospel must be in position 2 (which conflicts with ambient being there already).

**Case 2: Hip-hop is in position 3**
- From Clue 4, ambient must be in position 2.
- From Clue 5, gospel must be in position 1.
- From Clue 1, the fan of d&b must be in position 4 or 5 or 6 or 7.
- From Clue 2, the fan of gospel must be on the right of the fan of funk. Since gospel is in position 1, funk must be in position 2 (which conflicts with ambient already being there).

**Case 3: Hip-hop is in position 5**
- From Clue 4, ambient must be in position 4.
- From Clue 5, gospel must be in position 3.
- From Clue 1, the fan of d&b must be in position 6 or 7.
- From Clue 2, the fan of gospel must be on the right of the fan of funk. Since gospel is in position 3, funk must be in position 2.
- From Clue 6, the fan of reggae must be in position 6 or 7. Since d&b is in position 6 or 7, reggae must be in position 7.
- This leaves metal in position 1.

So, the arrangement is:
1. Metal
2. Funk
3. Gospel
4. Ambient
5. Hip-hop
6. D&B
7. Reggae

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |   1   |  2   |   3    |    4    |    5    |  6  |   7    |
| Music-Genre   | Metal | Funk | Gospel | Ambient | Hip-hop | D&B | Reggae |
