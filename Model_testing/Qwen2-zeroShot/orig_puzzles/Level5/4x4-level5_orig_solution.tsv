Lv5-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the bike is the fan of electronic.
   - Bike → Electronic Fan

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating cucumber is the fan of house.
   - Cucumber → House Fan

3. **Clue 3**: The owner of the bird is on the right of the person driving the ship.
   - Bird → Right of Ship Driver

4. **Clue 4**: The owner of the cat is on the right of the fan of blues.
   - Cat → Right of Blues Fan

5. **Clue 5**: The person eating banana is on the right of the fan of electronic.
   - Banana → Right of Electronic Fan

6. **Clue 6**: The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the ship.
   - Bus Driver → Right of Ship Driver

7. **Clue 7**: The person driving the airplane is on the left or right of the fan of electronic.
   - Airplane Driver → Left or Right of Electronic Fan

8. **Clue 8**: The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan of house.
   - R&B Fan → Left of House Fan

9. **Clue 9**: The fan of r&b is on the left or right of the fan of blues.
   - R&B Fan → Left or Right of Blues Fan

10. **Clue 10**: The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat.
    - Turtle Owner → Right of Goat Owner

11. **Clue 11**: The person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person eating papaya.
    - Ship Driver → Right of Papaya Eater

### Deductions and Final Placement:

From Clues 1 and 5:
- Since the Electronic Fan drives the bike, the person eating banana must be on their right, which means the person eating banana cannot be the Electronic Fan.
- Therefore, the person eating banana can only be the person who eats apple or cucumber (but not cucumber because cucumber is the House Fan).

From Clues 2 and 3:
- The person eating cucumber is the House Fan, so they cannot be the person eating banana.
- Thus, the person eating banana must be the Apple Eater.

From Clues 4 and 6:
- The Cat Owner is on the right of the Blues Fan, and the Bus Driver is on the right of the Ship Driver.
- This implies that the Blues Fan cannot be the Ship Driver, and the Cat Owner cannot be the Ship Driver either.

From Clues 7, 8, 9, and 10, 11:
- The R&B Fan is to the left of the House Fan, and the R&B Fan is also to the left or right of the Blues Fan.
- The Turtle Owner is to the right of the Goat Owner, and the Ship Driver is to the right of the Papaya Eater.

Combining all the clues and deductions:

1. **Apple Eater** (Banana Eater)
2. **Electronic Fan** (Bike Driver)
3. **House Fan** (Cucumber Eater)
4. **Blues Fan**

Using these placements and the remaining constraints:

- The R&B Fan must be the first position since it is to the left of the House Fan.
- The Blues Fan cannot be in the second position as the R&B Fan is already there.
- The Blues Fan must be the third position.
- The House Fan is the fourth position.

- The Goat Owner is the first position since the Turtle Owner is to the right of the Goat Owner.
- The Bird Owner is the fourth position (right of the Ship Driver).
- The Cat Owner is the third position (right of the Blues Fan).

- The Ship Driver is the second position.
- The Bus Driver is the third position (right of the Ship Driver).

- The Airplane Driver is the first position (left or right of the Electronic Fan).

Final placement:

|               |     1      |    2     |   3   |    4     |
| Food          | Apple      | Banana   | Cucumber | Papaya  |
| Music-Genre   | R&B        | Electronic | House  | Blues   |
| Pet           | Goat       | Bird     | Cat     | Turtle  |

   - Clue 10: The owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola.
   - Clue 11: The person driving the car is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - Since the skateboard is at 1, the car must be at 2 (since it's on the left of the iced-tea drinker).

6. **Person Watching Crime Movies**:
   - Clue 7: The person watching crime movies is between the person watching mystery movies and the person drinking cola.
   - Since the mystery movies are at 3 (dog owner) and the person drinking cola must be at 4 (since the goldfish owner is somewhere to the right of the cola drinker and the mystery movies are to the right of the skateboard driver), the crime movies must be at 2 (car driver).

7. **Owner of the Dog**:

   - The cola drinker must be at 4 (since the goldfish owner is to the right of the cola drinker and the mystery movies are at 3).

9. **Roller Driver**:
   - Clue 8: The owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller.
   - Since the goldfish owner is at 2, the roller driver must be at 4 (cola drinker).

    - The almond milk drinker is the goldfish owner, so at 2.
    - The iced tea drinker is at 3 (dog owner).
    - The cola drinker is at 4 (mystery movies).
    - The iced tea drinker must be at 1 (since the car driver is at 2 and the iced tea drinker is to the right of the dog owner).

### Final Table:

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv5-4x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement for each category (Food, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet). Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching adventure movies.
   - This means the order for movie genres is: Adventure, Martial-Arts.

2. **Clue 2:** The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies.
   - This doesn't give us a direct order but indicates that the owner of the turtle is adjacent to the person watching satire movies.

3. **Clue 3:** The fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the fan of hip-hop.
   - This means the order for music genres is: Hip-Hop, Blues.

4. **Clue 4:** The fan of techno is somewhere to the right of the owner of the turtle.
   - This means the owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of techno.

5. **Clue 5:** The person eating plum is on the left of the person eating apricot.
   - This means the order for food is: Plum, Apricot.

6. **Clue 6:** The owner of the turtle is between the fan of techno and the fan of rock.
   - This means the order for music genres is: Rock, Techno, Turtle (owner).

7. **Clue 7:** The fan of blues is on the right of the owner of the dog.
   - This means the owner of the dog is on the left of the fan of blues.

8. **Clue 8:** The owner of the dog is somewhere to the left of the owner of the lizard.
   - This means the order for pets is: Dog, Lizard.

9. **Clue 9:** The owner of the dog is in an even position.
   - Since there are 4 positions, the owner of the dog must be in position 2.

10. **Clue 10:** The owner of the turtle is on the left of the person eating apricot.
    - This reinforces that the owner of the turtle is in an odd position and the person eating apricot is in an even position.

11. **Clue 11:** The person watching martial-arts movies is the owner of the dog.
    - From Clue 1, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. So, if the owner of the dog (position 2) is watching martial-arts, then the person watching adventure movies must be in position 1.

12. **Clue 12:** The person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating pumpkin.
    - This means the person eating pumpkin must be in an even position. Given the owner of the dog is in position 2, the only even position left is position 4. Therefore, the person eating pumpkin must be in position 4.

Now, let's put all these together:

- **Movie-Genres:** Adventure, Martial-Arts
- **Music-Genres:** Hip-Hop, Blues, Rock, Techno
- **Pets:** Dog, Lizard, Turtle, Pony
- **Food:** Plum, Apricot, Pumpkin, Radish

Using the clues:
- Position 1: Adventure, Plum, Dog
- Position 2: Martial-Arts, Apricot, Lizard
- Position 3: ?, ?, ?
- Position 4: Satire, Pumpkin, Pony

We still need to determine the music genre and pet for position 3:
- The owner of the turtle is in an odd position and between the fan of techno and the fan of rock. The only odd position left is position 3.
- Therefore, the owner of the turtle is in position 3, and the fan of techno is in position 4.

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |     1     |      2       |   3    |    4    |
| Food          | Plum      | Apricot      |        | Pumpkin |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Martial-Arts |        | Satire  |
| Music-Genre   | Hip-Hop   | Blues        | Rock   | Techno  |
| Pet           | Dog       | Lizard       | Turtle | Pony    |

Lv5-4x4-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step by step.

Let's start with the given clues and fill in the table accordingly:

1. **Clue 8:** The musician is on the far left.
   - **Musician** |      1      |    2     |       3        |      4      |
   - **Beverage** |             |          |                |             |

12. **Clue 13:** The fan of metal is somewhere to the left of the firefighter.
13. **Clue 12:** The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

Now let's use these clues to fill in the table:

- From Clue 8, we know the musician is in position 1.
- From Clues 1 and 2, the fan of reggae must be in position 1 or 2 (since the firefighter must be to the right of the fan of reggae, and the writer must be to the right of the fan of reggae). Since the musician is in position 1, the fan of reggae cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2.
- From Clue 13, the fan of metal must be to the left of the firefighter. Since the fan of reggae is in position 2, the fan of metal must be in position 1 (which is already taken by the musician), so the fan of metal must be in position 3 or 4. But since the firefighter must be to the right of the fan of reggae, the fan of metal cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 3.
- From Clue 6, the fan of metal is on the left or right of the fan of reggae, which is true for positions 1 and 3.
- From Clue 7, the person drinking mirinda is between the fan of metal and the person drinking sprite. Since the fan of metal is in position 3, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 4.
- From Clue 9, the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the fan of pop. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2, the fan of pop must be in position 3 or 4. But since the fan of metal is in position 3, the fan of pop must be in position 4.
- From Clue 11, the fan of pop is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the fan of pop is in position 4, the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 3.
- From Clue 10, the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 4, the person drinking cola must be in position 2.
- From Clue 5, the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is in position 2, the person who's sport is baseball must be in position 1.
- From Clue 4, the person who's sport is handball is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 3 or 4. But since the person who's sport is tennis is in position 3, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 4.
- From Clue 3, the person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the police-officer. Since the person who's sport is handball is in position 4, the police-officer must be in position 3.
- From Clue 12, the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.
- From Clue 1, the fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the firefighter. Since the fan of reggae is in position 2, the firefighter must be in position 3.
- From Clue 10, the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 4, the person drinking cola must be in position 2.
- From Clue 10, the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 4, the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

Finally, we can assign the remaining beverages, jobs, and music genres:

- **Beverage**
  - Position 1: almond-milk
  - Position 2: mirinda
  - Position 3: sprite
  - Position 4: cola
- **Job**
  - Position 1: firefighter
  - Position 2: musician
  - Position 3: police-officer
  - Position 4: writer
- **Music-Genre**
  - Position 1: reggae

  - Position 3: pop
  - Position 4: country
- **Sport**
  - Position 1: baseball
  - Position 2: handball
  - Position 3: tennis
  - Position 4: lacrosse

2. The fan of techno is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
3. The person who's hobby is camping is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
4. The fan of ambient is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
5. The person driving the roller is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
6. The person driving the skateboard is in an odd position (1 or 3).
7. The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
8. The person watching action movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
9. The person driving the taxi is the fan of dubstep.
10. The fan of d&b is in an even position (2 or 4).
11. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
12. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Hobby Order:**
   - Camping < Photography
   - Camping < Fishing
   - Fishing < Magic-Tricks

2. **Movie-Genre Order:**
   - Disaster < Action
   - Disaster < Magic-Tricks
   - Zombie < Taxi

3. **Music-Genre Order:**
   - Ambient < Fishing
   - D&B < Dubstep

4. **Transport Order:**
   - Roller < Disaster
   - Skateboard (Odd position)
   - Taxi < Disaster

From clue 6, the person driving the skateboard must be in position 1 or 3. From clue 8, the person watching action movies must be to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. This means that the person with the hobby of fishing cannot be in position 1, as there would be no room for the person watching action movies to the left of them. Therefore, the person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 3 or 4.

Since the person with the hobby of fishing is to the right of the person with the hobby of camping (clue 3), and camping is to the left of fishing (clue 1), the only possible positions for camping and fishing are:
- Camping: 1
- Fishing: 3

Now, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be to the right of the fan of dubstep (clue 11) and to the right of the person watching disaster movies (clue 12). Since the person with the hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in position 1 or 2 (as there would be no room for the fan of dubstep to the right), the only possible position for the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is position 4.

Thus, the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 2.

### Position Summary:
- Position 1: Camping
- Position 2: Photography
- Position 3: Fishing
- Position 4: Magic-Tricks

### Movie-Genres:
- From clue 2, the fan of techno is to the right of the person watching disaster movies.
- From clue 5, the person driving the roller is to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
- From clue 7, the person watching zombie movies is to the left of the person driving the taxi.
- From clue 9, the person driving the taxi is the fan of dubstep.

Thus, the order must be:
- Disaster < Action
- Disaster < Magic-Tricks
- Zombie < Taxi

So:
- Disaster: 1 or 2
- Action: 2 or 3
- Zombie: 1 or 2
- Taxi: 4

Given the constraints, the only valid order is:
- Disaster: 1
- Action: 2
- Zombie: 2
- Taxi: 4

### Music-Genres:
- From clue 4, the fan of ambient is to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
- From clue 10, the fan of d&b is in an even position.

Thus, the order must be:
- Ambient: 1 or 2
- D&B: 2 or 4
- Dubstep: 4

Given the constraints, the only valid order is:
- Ambient: 1
- D&B: 2
- Dubstep: 4

### Transport:
- From clue 6, the person driving the skateboard is in an odd position.
- From clue 10, the fan of d&b is in an even position.

Thus, the order must be:
- Helicopter: 1
- Roller: 2
- Skateboard: 3
- Taxi: 4

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1    |     2      |      3       |      4       |
| Hobby         | Camping | Photography| Fishing      | Magic-Tricks |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster| Action     | Zombie       | Taxi         |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | D&B        | Dubstep      | Techno       |

12. The person eating cabbage is in an even position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the position of the person eating cabbage
- From constraint 12, the person eating cabbage is in an even position. So, it must be in position 2 or 4.

#### Step 2: Determine the person eating cabbage
- From constraint 9, the fan of dubstep is the person eating cabbage. Therefore, the person eating cabbage is in position 2 (since it has to be in an even position).

So, we have:
```
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |
| Food          |         | Lime      |          |            |

| Transport     |         | Motorbike |          |            |
```

#### Step 3: Determine the positions for other items based on constraints
- From constraint 1, the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person eating lime. Since the person eating lime is in position 2, the motorbike driver must be in position 4.
```
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |

| Transport     |         | Motorbike |          | Jet-ski    |
```

- From constraint 3, the person driving the jet-ski is between the person watching musical movies and the person eating cucumber. This means the person watching musical movies must be in position 3, and the person eating cucumber must be in position 1.
```
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |

| Transport     |         | Motorbike | Jet-ski  |            |
```

- From constraint 5, the person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep. Since the fan of dubstep is in position 2, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 1.
```
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |
| Food          | Cucumber| Lime      | Musical  |            |

| Transport     |         | Motorbike | Jet-ski  |            |
```

- From constraint 6, the fan of salsa is the fan of salsa. We need to place the remaining items (action, d&b, hip-hop, and onion) in the remaining positions.
- From constraint 7, the fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the scooter must be in position 1 (as there are no other options), the fan of d&b must be in position 3.
```
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |
| Food          | Cucumber| Lime      | Onion    |            |

| Transport     | Scooter | Motorbike | Jet-ski  |            |
```

- From constraint 8, the fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of salsa. This is already satisfied since the fan of d&b is in position 3 and the fan of salsa is in position 1.
- From constraint 10, the fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of d&b. This is already satisfied as hip-hop is in position 3 and d&b is in position 3.
- From constraint 11, the person watching action movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since the person watching thriller movies is in position 1, the person watching action movies must be in position 1.
```
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |
| Food          | Onion   | Lime      | Onion    |            |

| Transport     | Scooter | Motorbike | Jet-ski  |            |
```

This solution satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the final table is:

```

Lv5-4x4-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fan of country is on the left or right of the fisherman.
2. **Clue 2:** The person whose hobby is collecting is somewhere to the right of the fisherman.
3. **Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is reading.
4. **Clue 4:** The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
5. **Clue 5:** The entrepreneur is the fan of r&b.
6. **Clue 6:** The fan of gospel is between the person drinking iced-tea and the paramedic.
7. **Clue 7:** The person whose hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is reading. (This is the same as Clue 3, so it doesn't provide new information.)
8. **Clue 8:** The entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
9. **Clue 9:** The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
10. **Clue 10:** The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the fan of gospel.
11. **Clue 11:** The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fisherman.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Place the Fan of R&B
- From Clue 5: The entrepreneur is the fan of r&b.
- From Clue 11: The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fisherman.

So, the fan of r&b cannot be in position 4, and must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Also, the fisherman cannot be in position 1.

#### Step 2: Place the Fisherman
- From Clue 1: The fan of country is on the left or right of the fisherman.
- From Clue 2: The person whose hobby is collecting is somewhere to the right of the fisherman.
- From Clue 8: The entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
- From Clue 9: The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.

Since the entrepreneur is the fan of r&b, the fisherman must be in position 2 or 3 (because the fan of r&b is not in position 4).

#### Step 3: Place the Person Whose Hobby is Magic-Tricks
- From Clue 9: The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
- Since the entrepreneur (fan of r&b) is in position 2 or 3, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks can be in position 1 or 2.

If the fisherman is in position 3, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 2 (since the entrepreneur is in position 3).

#### Step 4: Place the Entrepreneur
- The entrepreneur is the fan of r&b and is in position 3.
- From Clue 8: The entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 2.

#### Step 5: Place the Fan of Country
- The fan of country is on the left or right of the fisherman.
- The fisherman is in position 3, so the fan of country can be in position 1 or 2.

Since the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 2, the fan of country must be in position 1.

#### Step 6: Place the Person Whose Hobby is Collecting
- The person whose hobby is collecting is somewhere to the right of the fisherman.
- The fisherman is in position 3, so the person whose hobby is collecting must be in position 4.

#### Step 7: Place the Person Who Drinks Cola
- The person who drinks cola is on the right of the person who drinks 7up.
- The person who drinks 7up must be in position 1 or 2, and the person who drinks cola must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the fan of country is in position 1 and the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 2, the person who drinks 7up must be in position 1, and the person who drinks cola must be in position 2.

#### Step 8: Place the Person Who Drinks Iced Tea
- The fan of gospel is between the person who drinks iced tea and the paramedic.
- The person who drinks iced tea must be in position 3 or 4, and the fan of gospel must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the person who drinks cola is in position 2 and the fan of gospel must be between the person who drinks iced tea and the paramedic, the person who drinks iced tea must be in position 3, and the fan of gospel must be in position 4.

#### Step 9: Place the Paramedic
- The fan of gospel is between the person who drinks iced tea and the paramedic.
- The person who drinks iced tea is in position 3, and the fan of gospel is in position 4, so the paramedic must be in position 1.
