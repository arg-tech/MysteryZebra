Lv5-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The freelancer is on the right of the writer.
   - This means the writer cannot be in position 3, and the freelancer must be in position 2 or 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who's sport is snowboarding is the person who's hobby is board-games.
   - This means the hobby ""board-games"" and the sport ""snowboarding"" belong to the same person.

3. **Clue 3:** The freelancer is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is soccer.
   - This means the order of sports for the three positions is: [baseball, freelancer, soccer] or [soccer, freelancer, baseball].

4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is singing is the person who's sport is soccer.
   - This means the hobby ""singing"" and the sport ""soccer"" belong to the same person.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
   - Since the person with the hobby ""board-games"" plays snowboarding (from Clue 2), and baseball must be to the right of this person (Clue 5), baseball can only be in position 3.

Now let's piece together the information:

- From Clue 5, baseball is in position 3.
- From Clue 4, the person with the hobby ""singing"" is in position 3 (since they play soccer).
- From Clue 3, the freelancer is between baseball and soccer, so the freelancer must be in position 2.
- From Clue 1, the writer cannot be in position 3, and the freelancer (position 2) is on the right of the writer, so the writer must be in position 1.
- From Clue 2, the person with the hobby ""board-games"" plays snowboarding. Since baseball is in position 3, and soccer is in position 3 (Clue 4), board-games must be in position 1 (writer).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Writer, Hobby: Board-games, Sport: Snowboarding
- Position 2: Freelancer, Sport: Baseball
- Position 3: Person, Hobby: Singing, Sport: Soccer

Now we need to assign the jobs:
- From Clue 1, the freelancer is on the right of the writer, which fits our assignment.
- From Clue 4, the person with the hobby ""singing"" is the person who's sport is soccer, so the job must be freelancer.
- The remaining job, photographer, must go to the writer.

Thus, the final solution is:

```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the fan of trance.**
   - This means the fan of trance cannot be in position 3, and the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2 or 3.

2. **The fan of blues is on the right of the fan of disco.**
   - This means the fan of disco cannot be in position 3, and the fan of blues must be in position 2 or 3.

3. **The person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of puzzles cannot be in position 3, and the person drinking water must be in position 2 or 3.

4. **The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an even position.**
   - This means the person with the hobby of rock-climbing must be in position 2.

5. **The fan of disco is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.**
   - This means the person drinking hot-chocolate and the fan of disco must be next to each other (positions 1 & 2 or 2 & 3).

### Initial Setup:
Given the constraints, let's start filling in the table.

#### Position 2 (rock-climbing):
- Since the person with rock-climbing is in an even position, they must be in position 2.
  - Position 2: Rock-climbing

#### Fan of Disco:
- The fan of disco must be next to the person drinking hot-chocolate, and since position 2 is taken by rock-climbing, the fan of disco can only be in position 1.
  - Position 1: Fan of Disco

#### Person Drinking Hot-Chocolate:
- Since the fan of disco is in position 1, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2 (but we already know that position is rock-climbing), so it must be in position 3.
  - Position 3: Hot-Chocolate

#### Fan of Blues:
- The fan of blues must be on the right of the fan of disco, so they must be in position 2.
  - Position 2: Fan of Blues

#### Person Drinking Water:
- The person drinking water must be to the right of the person with the hobby of puzzles, and since the person with rock-climbing is in position 2, the person with puzzles must be in position 1.
  - Position 1: Puzzles
- Therefore, the person drinking water must be in position 3.
  - Position 3: Water

#### Music-Genres:
- The fan of disco is in position 1, so the music genre for position 1 is Trance.
- The fan of blues is in position 2, so the music genre for position 2 is Disco.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3, so the music genre for position 3 is Blues.

### Final Table:

Lv5-3x3-3	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person eating plum is the journalist.
2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess.
3. The person who's hobby is chess is between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the freelancer.
4. The person eating radish is the person who's hobby is chess.
5. The journalist is somewhere to the left of the freelancer.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: The person eating plum is the journalist.
- This means the journalist eats plum.

#### Clue 4: The person eating radish is the person who's hobby is chess.
- So, the person with the hobby of chess eats radish.

#### Clue 3: The person who's hobby is chess is between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the freelancer.
- Let's denote the positions as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.
- From clue 2, we know that the person with the hobby of woodworking is either to the left or right of the person with the hobby of chess.
- Combining clues 2 and 3, we can deduce that the person with the hobby of woodworking cannot be in position 2 because then there would be no space for the person with the hobby of chess and the freelancer to fit the requirement of being between them. Therefore, the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in position 1 or 3.
- If the person with the hobby of woodworking is in position 1, then the person with the hobby of chess must be in position 2 (since they need to be between the person with the hobby of woodworking and the freelancer). The freelancer must be in position 3.
- If the person with the hobby of woodworking is in position 3, then the person with the hobby of chess must be in position 2 (since they need to be between the person with the hobby of woodworking and the freelancer). The freelancer must be in position 1.
- Since the journalist is to the left of the freelancer (clue 5), the only possible arrangement is:
  - Position 1: Woodworking
  - Position 2: Chess
  - Position 3: Freelancer

#### Clue 5: The journalist is somewhere to the left of the freelancer.
- This confirms our previous deduction.

#### Final Assignments:
- Position 1: Woodworking
- Position 2: Chess
- Position 3: Freelancer

From Clues 1 and 4:
- Position 2 (Chess) eats radish.
- Position 1 (Woodworking) is the journalist.

So, Position 3 (Freelancer) must eat plum.

### Final Solution Table:
```

Lv5-3x3-4	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The fan of soul is between the person eating plum and the person eating artichoke.**
   - This implies the order could be Plum -> Soul -> Artichoke or Artichoke -> Soul -> Plum.

2. **The person driving the jet-ski is the person eating artichoke.**
   - So, the person eating artichoke is in column 3 (jet-ski).

3. **The fan of techno is on the far left or far right.**
   - So, either column 1 or column 3 is the fan of techno.

4. **The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the taxi.**
   - Since the person driving the jet-ski is in column 3, the person driving the taxi must be in column 1 or 2.

5. **The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the fan of punk.**
   - The person eating artichoke is in column 3, so the fan of punk must be in column 1 or 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From clue 2, we know that the person eating artichoke is in column 3.
2. From clue 4, since the person driving the jet-ski (column 3) is on the right of the person driving the taxi, the taxi driver must be in column 1 or 2. Let's assume the taxi driver is in column 1 for now.
3. From clue 3, the fan of techno is on the far left or far right. Since the taxi driver is in column 1, the fan of techno must be in column 3 (since column 1 is already occupied by the taxi driver).
4. From clue 1, the fan of soul is between the person eating plum and the person eating artichoke. Since the person eating artichoke is in column 3, the fan of soul must be in column 2, and the person eating plum must be in column 1.
5. From clue 5, the person eating artichoke is to the right of the fan of punk. Since the person eating artichoke is in column 3, the fan of punk must be in column 1.

Now let's fill in the table based on these deductions:

|               |  1   |  2   |     3     |

Lv5-3x3-5	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step and use the given constraints to determine the correct placement for each person, job, movie genre, and sport.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. The freelancer is on the left or right of the coach.
2. The freelancer is on the far right.
3. The person who prefers surfing is somewhere to the left of the person who prefers satire movies.
4. The person who prefers soccer is somewhere to the left of the person who prefers surfing.
5. The coach is the person watching western movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 2:
- The freelancer is on the far right.
  - So, the arrangement must be: [Coach, Security Guard, Freelancer]

#### Clue 5:
- The coach is the person watching western movies.
  - Therefore, the coach is in position 1 and is watching western movies.

#### Combining Clues 1 and 2:
- Since the freelancer is on the far right (position 3) and the coach is on the left (position 1), the security guard must be in position 2.
- The arrangement so far is:
  - Position 1: Coach (watches western movies)
  - Position 2: Security Guard
  - Position 3: Freelancer

#### Clue 3 and 4:
- The person who prefers surfing is to the left of the person who prefers satire movies.
- The person who prefers soccer is to the left of the person who prefers surfing.
  
Since we know the freelancer is in position 3, let's assign the sports and movie genres based on these clues.

1. **Surfing** must be in position 1 or 2 because it is to the left of the person who prefers satire movies.
2. **Soccer** must be in position 1 or 2 because it is to the left of the person who prefers surfing.

Given that the coach is in position 1 and watches western movies, the only remaining options for sports and movie genres are:
- Position 2: Security Guard
- Position 3: Freelancer

Since the freelancer is on the far right and cannot have soccer or surfing (because those positions would violate the left-of constraints), the freelancer must watch satire movies.

Thus, the only options left are:
- Position 1 (Coach): Western movies, Surfing
- Position 2 (Security Guard): Epic movies, Soccer
- Position 3 (Freelancer): Satire movies, Snowboarding

### Final Solution Table:

2. The Thai is between the Manager and the French.
3. The person driving the trike is the same as the one mentioned in clue 1.
4. The Dressmaker is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
5. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the Dressmaker.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 2**: The Thai is between the Manager and the French.
   - This means the order could be either: Manager, Thai, French or French, Thai, Manager.

2. **Clue 1**: The French is on the left of the person driving the trike.
   - Since the Thai is between the Manager and the French, the only possible order for these three is: Manager, Thai, French.
   - Therefore, the French must be on the far right (position 3).

3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the trike is the person mentioned in clue 1.
   - So, the person driving the trike is in position 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The Dressmaker is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
   - Since the French is in position 3, the Dressmaker must be in position 1 (leftmost) because it's the only remaining position that allows the Dressmaker to be on the left of the snowmobile driver.

5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the Dressmaker.
   - Given the Dressmaker is in position 1, the snowmobile driver must be in position 2.

6. **Assigning Jobs and Nationalities**:

     - Position 1: Dressmaker
     - Position 2: Snowmobile Driver
     - Position 3: Trike Driver (French)

1. **The fan of hip-hop is between the person watching sports movies and the person watching time-travel movies.**
2. **The fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies.**
3. **The freelancer is somewhere to the left of the person watching time-travel movies.**
4. **The person watching sports movies is the chef.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the person watching sports movies.
- From point 4, we know that the chef is watching sports movies.
- So, we can place ""sports"" under ""Movie-Genre"" for the chef.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of the other genres.
- From point 1, the fan of hip-hop is between the person watching sports movies and the person watching time-travel movies.
- This means the sequence must be: sports -> hip-hop -> time-travel or time-travel -> hip-hop -> sports.
- Since the chef (who watches sports) is fixed, the sequence must be: sports -> hip-hop -> time-travel.

#### Step 3: Place the genres based on the sequence.
- The chef (Job: chef) watches sports movies.
- The fan of hip-hop watches hip-hop music.
- The person who watches time-travel movies must watch reggae music (from point 2).

#### Step 4: Determine the job positions.
- From point 3, the freelancer is somewhere to the left of the person watching time-travel movies.
- Since the person watching time-travel movies is in position 3, the freelancer must be in position 1.
- This leaves the software-developer in position 2.

3. **The person drinking tea is the australian.**
4. **The person drinking tea is on the right of the nigerian.**
5. **The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is cooking.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3: The person drinking tea is the australian.**
   - This means the australian drinks tea.
   
2. **Clue 4: The person drinking tea is on the right of the nigerian.**
   - Since the australian drinks tea, the australian must be on the right of the nigerian.
   - Therefore, the nigerian cannot be in position 3 (rightmost), so they must be in position 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 2: The nigerian is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.**
   - If the nigerian is in position 1, then the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If the nigerian is in position 2, then the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 3.
   - Given that the australian (who drinks tea) is on the right of the nigerian, if the nigerian is in position 1, the australian would be in position 2, but there would be no room for the person with the hobby of cooking in position 3. Thus, the nigerian must be in position 2, and the australian must be in position 3.

4. **Clue 1: The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is cooking.**
   - Since the nigerian is in position 2 and the australian is in position 3, the person with the hobby of cooking must be in position 1 (left of the nigerian).
   - The person drinking mirinda must be either in position 1 or 3. But since the person with the hobby of cooking is in position 1, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3.

5. **Clue 5: The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is cooking.**
   - The person with the hobby of cooking is in position 1, so the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 2.

Lv5-3x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step based on the given clues.

### Clues:
1. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient.
2. The British is somewhere to the right of the fan of folk.
3. The owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the fan of folk.
4. The owner of the cat is the Brazilian.
5. The fan of folk is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Brazilian
From clue 4, we know that the Brazilian owns the cat.

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of the British and the Fan of Folk
Clue 2 states that the British is to the right of the fan of folk. Clue 3 states that the owner of the cat (the Brazilian) is to the right of the fan of folk. Since the Brazilian is already identified as owning the cat, the fan of folk cannot be in position 3 (rightmost).

Therefore, the fan of folk must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 3: Analyze the Snake Owner's Position
Clue 1 states that the owner of the snake is to the left of the fan of ambient. Clue 5 states that the fan of folk is to the left of the snake owner. This means the snake owner must be in position 3 (since the snake owner is to the right of the fan of folk, and the fan of folk cannot be in position 3).

So, the snake owner is in position 3.

#### Step 4: Determine the Music Genres
Since the snake owner is in position 3, the fan of folk must be in position 1 or 2. Given that the fan of folk is to the left of the snake owner (position 3), the fan of folk must be in position 1.

This leaves the fan of ambient in position 2.

#### Step 5: Assign Nationalities and Pets
- The Brazilian owns the cat (clue 4).
- The British is to the right of the fan of folk (clue 2). Since the fan of folk is in position 1, the British must be in position 2.
- The remaining nationality (Australian) must be in position 3.

Now let's summarize the information:
