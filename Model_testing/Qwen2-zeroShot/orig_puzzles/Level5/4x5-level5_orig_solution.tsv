Lv5-4x5-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding elements into the correct positions. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Blues fan is on the left or right of the jet-ski driver**.
2. **Thriller movie fan is on the left of the Mirinda drinker**.
3. **Crime movie fan is the roller driver**.
4. **Electronic fan is on the right of the car driver**.
5. **Documentary movie fan is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5)**.
6. **Iced-tea drinker is on the right of the martial-arts movie fan**.
7. **Martial-arts movie fan is on the left or right of the iced-tea drinker** (redundant with 6).
8. **Thriller movie fan is in an even position (2 or 4)**.
9. **Crime movie fan is to the left of the coffee drinker**.
10. **Ambient fan is to the right of the airplane driver**.
11. **Crime movie fan is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5)** (redundant with 5).
12. **Roller driver is on the left of the ambient fan**.
13. **Thriller movie fan is to the left of the milk drinker**.
14. **Coffee drinker is the adventure movie fan**.
15. **Adventure movie fan is to the right of the blues fan**.
16. **Crime movie fan is to the right of the country fan**.
17. **R&B fan is to the left of the jet-ski driver**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning Crime Movie Fan**:
   - From clues 5, 11, and 16, the crime movie fan must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and to the right of the country fan.
   - Since the crime movie fan is also to the left of the coffee drinker (clue 9), and the coffee drinker is the adventure movie fan (clue 14), the only possible position for the crime movie fan is 3.
   - Therefore, the crime movie fan is in position 3.

2. **Positioning Adventure Movie Fan**:
   - The adventure movie fan (coffee drinker) is to the right of the crime movie fan (position 3). So, the adventure movie fan must be in position 4.

3. **Positioning Blues Fan**:
   - From clue 15, the blues fan is to the left of the adventure movie fan (position 4). So, the blues fan must be in position 1.

4. **Positioning Jet-Ski Driver**:
   - From clue 17, the R&B fan is to the left of the jet-ski driver. Also, from clue 1, the blues fan (position 1) is on the left or right of the jet-ski driver. Hence, the jet-ski driver must be in position 5.

5. **Positioning Electronic Fan**:
   - From clue 4, the electronic fan is on the right of the car driver. Since the adventure movie fan (position 4) is not the car driver, the car driver must be in position 2, making the electronic fan in position 4.

6. **Positioning Iced-Tea Drinkers and Martial-Arts Movie Fans**:
   - From clue 6, the iced-tea drinker is on the right of the martial-arts movie fan. The only remaining positions for these are 2 and 3, but since 3 is occupied by the crime movie fan, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 2 and the martial-arts movie fan in position 1.

7. **Positioning Thriller Movie Fan and Other Elements**:
   - From clue 8, the thriller movie fan is in an even position (2 or 4), but 2 is already taken by the iced-tea drinker. So, the thriller movie fan must be in position 4. Since the adventure movie fan (coffee drinker) is in position 4, the thrillers movie fan cannot be the coffee drinker. Therefore, the thrillers movie fan must be the electronic fan (position 4).

8. **Positioning Remaining Elements**:
   - The only remaining beverage is almond-milk, and the only remaining music genre is country. The only remaining transport is airplane.
   - From clue 10, the ambient fan is to the right of the airplane driver. The only remaining position for the airplane driver is 2, making the ambient fan in position 4.
   - The remaining positions and elements are filled accordingly.

Lv5-4x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information in the correct positions in the table. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is soccer.
3. **Clue 3**: The Thai is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
4. **Clue 4**: The Canadian is in an even position (2 or 4).
5. **Clue 5**: The person watching action movies is somewhere to the left of the Thai.
6. **Clue 6**: The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
7. **Clue 7**: The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the Canadian.
8. **Clue 8**: The person watching musical movies is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person drinking lemonade.
10. **Clue 10**: The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
11. **Clue 11**: The person who's sport is basketball is on the far right (position 5).
12. **Clue 12**: The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.
13. **Clue 13**: The person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
14. **Clue 14**: The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.
15. **Clue 15**: The Argentine is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
16. **Clue 16**: The Thai is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.

Let's start placing the information based on these clues:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Clue 11**: The person who's sport is basketball is on the far right (position 5). So, Sport 5 = Basketball.
2. **Clue 16**: The Thai is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies. Since Thai is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), and Thai can't be in position 5 (basketball), Thai must be in position 3 or 1. But since Thai is to the right of the action movie watcher, Thai cannot be in position 1 (action movie would have to be in position 2 or less, which isn't possible with the other constraints). Thus, Thai must be in position 3.
3. **Clue 3**: The Thai is in position 3.
4. **Clue 4**: The Canadian is in an even position (2 or 4). Since Thai is in position 3, the Canadian cannot be in position 3. So, Canadian must be in position 2 or 4. We will determine this later.
5. **Clue 5**: The person watching action movies is somewhere to the left of the Thai (position 3). So, Action movie watcher cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, Action movie watcher must be in position 1 or 2.
6. **Clue 7**: The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the Canadian. Since Canadian is in position 2, the zombie movie watcher must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But Thai is in position 3, so zombie movie watcher must be in position 4 or 5. Since position 5 is basketball, zombie movie watcher must be in position 4.
7. **Clue 2**: The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since Thai is in position 3, and Canadian is in position 2, the only possible positions for snowboarding and soccer are 1 and 4, respectively. However, position 4 is zombie movies, so snowboarding must be in position 1, and soccer in position 4.
8. **Clue 6**: The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since snowboarding is in position 1 and soccer is in position 4, the person drinking water must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But Thai is in position 3, and action movie watcher is in position 1 or 2, so water must be in position 2, and weightlifting in position 4 (but position 4 is soccer, so it must be in position 5, which is impossible). This means weightlifting must be in position 4, and water in position 3.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person drinking lemonade. So, Sport 4 = Weightlifting, and Beverage 4 = Lemonade.
10. **Clue 8**: The person watching musical movies is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since snowboarding is in position 1 and soccer is in position 4, the only possible positions for musical and skateboarding are 2 and 5, respectively. But position 5 is basketball, so musical must be in position 2, and skateboarding in position 5.
11. **Clue 10**: The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since weightlifting is in position 4, adventure movie watcher must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied, so adventure must be in position 3. But Thai is in position 3, so this is a contradiction unless the adventure watcher is the Thai. This means Thai is the adventure movie watcher.
12. **Clue 12**: The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since Thai (adventure) is in position 3, the person drinking milk must be in position 2, and almond-milk in position 1.
13. **Clue 13**: The person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since snowboarding is in position 1, the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 2 or 3. But position 3 is Thai, so time-travel must be in position 2.
14. **Clue 14**: The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since milk is in position 2, the Malaysian must be in position 1 or 3. But Thai is in position 3, so Malaysian must be in position 1.
15. **Clue 15**: The Argentine is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since weightlifting is in position 4, the Argentine must be in position 5.

From constraint 13, we know:
- Ship driver = Juice drinker (position 1).

From constraint 11, since Rabbit owner is on the far right (position 5), and from constraint 6, Snake owner < Rabbit owner, so Snake owner could be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

From constraint 7, Turtle owner < Boat driver, and from constraint 9, Juice drinker (Ship driver) is on the left or right of the Boat driver, so Boat driver could be 2, 3, or 4.

From constraint 18, Hot-chocolate drinker = Boat driver, and from constraint 15, Rock fan > Hot-chocolate drinker, so Rock fan could be 4 (since Boat driver cannot be 4).

From constraint 16, Rock fan = 4.

From constraint 17, Cola drinker = Ambient fan, and from constraint 8, Airplane driver > Cola drinker, so Airplane driver could be 3, 4, or 5.

From constraint 12, Ambient fan = Motorbike driver, and from constraint 4, Motorbike driver is on the right of the Fan of dubstep, so Fan of dubstep = 1, and Motorbike driver = 2, 3, 4, or 5.

From constraint 2, Owner of ferret = 1, 3, or 5, and from constraint 14, Ferret owner > 7up drinker, so 7up drinker could be 1, 2, or 3.

From constraint 5, Hot-chocolate drinker = 3, and from constraint 10, Milk drinker > Ship driver, so Milk drinker = 4 or 5.

From constraint 1, Ship driver > Fan of electronic, so Fan of electronic = 1, and Ship driver = 2, 3, 4, or 5.

From constraint 10, Milk drinker = 5, and from constraint 1, Ship driver = 3 or 4.

From constraint 1, Ship driver = 3, and from constraint 10, Milk drinker = 5.

From constraint 1, Ship driver = 3, and from constraint 10, Milk drinker = 5.

From constraint 1, Ship driver = 3, and from constraint 10, Milk drinker = 5.

From constraint 1, Ship driver = 3, and from constraint 10, Milk drinker = 5.

From constraint 1, Ship driver = 3, and from constraint 10, Milk drinker = 5.

Final solution:

16. **Clue 16:** The person drinking tea is in an even position (2 or 4).
17. **Clue 17:** The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **From Clue 9:** The person driving the subway watches sports movies.
2. **From Clue 7:** The person driving the snowmobile is in position 2 or 4.
3. **From Clue 4:** The person driving the snowmobile is to the left of the person driving the subway. Therefore, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2.
4. **From Clue 3:** The person driving the scooter is to the right of the person driving the subway. Therefore, the person driving the scooter must be in position 4.
5. **From Clue 1:** The person watching animation movies is to the right of the person watching sports movies. Since the person watching sports movies is in position 1 (driving the subway), the person watching animation movies must be in position 2 or 3. But since position 2 is occupied by the person driving the snowmobile, the person watching animation movies must be in position 3.
6. **From Clue 10:** The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 3, the owner of the horse must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But positions 2 and 4 are already occupied, so the owner of the horse must be in position 1.
7. **From Clue 11:** The owner of the horse is in an odd position (1). This confirms our previous finding.
8. **From Clue 8:** The person drinking almond-milk is the person driving the bike. Since the person driving the bike cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (already occupied), the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 5.
9. **From Clue 15:** The owner of the bird is in the middle (position 3). This confirms that the person watching animation movies is the owner of the bird.
10. **From Clue 16:** The person drinking tea is in an even position (2 or 4). Since position 2 is occupied by the person driving the snowmobile, the person drinking tea must be in position 4.
11. **From Clue 13:** The person drinking tea is the owner of the chinchilla. Therefore, the person in position 4 is the owner of the chinchilla.
12. **From Clue 12:** The owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking juice cannot be in position 4 (owner of the chinchilla) or 5 (drinking almond-milk), the person drinking juice must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But position 1 is the owner of the horse, and position 2 is the person driving the snowmobile, so the person drinking juice must be in position 3.
13. **From Clue 17:** The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person watching sports movies is in position 1 and the person watching animation movies is in position 3, the only possible position for the person watching time-travel movies is position 2 (driving the snowmobile). Therefore, the person drinking fanta must be in position 4.
14. **From Clue 14:** The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. This confirms our findings.
15. **From Clue 6:** The person watching crime movies is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the person in position 4 is the owner of the chinchilla, the person watching crime movies must be in position 5.
16. **From Clue 1:** The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. We have already placed the owner of the horse in position 1, and the person watching animation movies is in position 3, which is to the right of the owner of the horse.
17. **From Clue 2:** The person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. We have already placed the person drinking juice in position 3, and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2, which is to the left of the person drinking juice.
