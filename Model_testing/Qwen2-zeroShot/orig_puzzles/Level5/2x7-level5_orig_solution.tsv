Lv5-2x7-2	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and the constraints provided.

### Clues Summary:
1. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person eating cabbage.
2. The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage.
3. The person eating cabbage is in an odd position.
4. The person drinking water is on the right of the person eating broccoli.
5. The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
6. The person eating carrot is in an odd position.
7. The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
8. The person eating zucchini is on the far left or far right.
9. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
10. The person eating radish is on the left of the person drinking tea.
11. The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person eating radish.
12. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.
13. The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
14. The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage.
15. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the person eating broccoli.
16. The person eating broccoli is the person drinking hot-chocolate.
17. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3 & 6:
- The person eating cabbage is in an odd position (Clue 3).
- The person eating carrot is in an odd position (Clue 6).

Thus, possible positions for cabbage and carrot are 1, 3, 5, 7.

#### Clue 15 & 16:
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is both the person eating broccoli and the person drinking hot-chocolate (Clue 15 & 16).

So, the person eating broccoli is in the same position as the person drinking hot-chocolate.

#### Clue 4 & 10:
- The person drinking water is on the right of the person eating broccoli (Clue 4).
- The person eating radish is on the left of the person drinking tea (Clue 10).

#### Clue 7 & 11:
- The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk (Clue 7).
- The person eating zucchini is on the far left or far right (Clue 8).

Since zucchini is on the far left or far right, it must be in position 1 or 7. Given that it is also to the left of almond-milk, it must be in position 1.

#### Clue 1 & 9:
- The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person eating cabbage (Clue 1).
- The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate (Clue 9).
- The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate (Clue 12).

Given that hot-chocolate is in an odd position (from Clue 3) and mirinda is to the left of hot-chocolate, mirinda cannot be in position 7 (since it would contradict the position of hot-chocolate). Thus, mirinda could be in positions 1, 3, 5. But since zucchini is in position 1, mirinda must be in position 3 or 5.

#### Clue 5 & 14:
- The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk (Clue 5).
- The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage (Clue 14).

Given that cabbage is in an odd position (Clue 3), and mirinda is to the left or right of cabbage, mirinda must be in position 3 or 5.

#### Clue 2 & 13:
- The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage (Clue 2).
- The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person drinking tea (Clue 13).

Given the positions so far, let's place the remaining items:

- If mirinda is in position 3, then cabbage must be in position 5 (since it is an odd position and mirinda is to its left).
- This leaves positions 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 for the remaining items.

Now we can place the remaining items:

1. Zucchini (position 1)
2. Asparagus (must be to the right of almond-milk, so position 2)
3. Mirinda (position 3)
4. Almond-milk (position 4)
5. Hot-chocolate (position 5, since it is the person eating broccoli)
6. Iced-tea (position 6, to the right of cabbage)
7. Water (position 7, to the right of hot-chocolate)

#### Final Table:

Lv5-2x7-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will go through each clue step-by-step and place the hobbies and transport methods accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the bike is the person who's hobby is camping.
   - Bike → Camping

2. **Clue 2**: The person who's hobby is skydiving is in an even position (4).
   - Position 4 → Skydiving

3. **Clue 3**: The person driving the scooter is between the person driving the motorbike and the person who's hobby is writing.
   - Let's denote:
     - Motorbike → ?
     - Writing → ?
     - Scooter is between Motorbike and Writing

4. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person driving the bike.
   - Board-games → ?
   - Board-games < Bike

5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
   - Trike → ?
   - Rock-climbing > Trike

6. **Clue 6**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - Card-games < Rock-climbing

7. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
   - Rock-climbing is next to Skydiving

8. **Clue 8**: The person driving the bike is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).
   - Bike → 1, 3, 5, 7

9. **Clue 9**: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
   - Rock-climbing is next to Skydiving

10. **Clue 10**: The person driving the motorbike is the person driving the motorbike.
    - This is redundant but confirms the motorbike is assigned to someone.

11. **Clue 11**: The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter.
    - Trike and Scooter are adjacent.

12. **Clue 12**: The person driving the tram is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
    - Tram < Magic-tricks

13. **Clue 13**: The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
    - Card-games < Tram

14. **Clue 14**: The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
    - Tram and Rock-climbing are adjacent.

15. **Clue 15**: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the person driving the airplane.
    - Magic-tricks → Airplane

### Final Placement:

Let's start placing the clues into the positions:

1. **Bike → Camping** (from Clue 1)
2. **Position 4 → Skydiving** (from Clue 2)
3. **Bike is in an odd position** (from Clue 8), so Bike must be at position 1 or 3 or 5 or 7.
4. **Board-games is on the left of Bike** (from Clue 4), so if Bike is at 1, Board-games must be at 2; if Bike is at 3, Board-games must be at 2; if Bike is at 5, Board-games must be at 4; if Bike is at 7, Board-games must be at 6.
5. **Scooter is between Motorbike and Writing** (from Clue 3). Let's assume Bike is at 1 for now.
6. **Skydiving is in an even position** (from Clue 2), so Skydiving must be at 4.
7. **Rock-climbing is on the left or right of Skydiving** (from Clue 9) and on the left or right of Trike (from Clue 11) and on the left or right of Tram (from Clue 14).

Let's try to fit all these together:

- If Bike is at 1, then Board-games is at 2.
- If Scooter is between Motorbike and Writing, and Scooter cannot be at 4 (as Skydiving is there), it can be at 3 or 5.
- If Scooter is at 3, Motorbike must be at 2 (which conflicts with Board-games at 2).
- If Scooter is at 5, Motorbike must be at 4 (conflicts with Skydiving at 4).
- So, Scooter must be at 3, Motorbike at 2, and Writing at 4 (conflicts again).

Let's try Bike at 3:

- Board-games at 2.
- Scooter at 4 (between Motorbike and Writing), so Motorbike at 2 and Writing at 5.
- Skydiving at 4.
- Rock-climbing must be at 5 or 6, and since Writing is at 5, Rock-climbing must be at 6.
- Card-games must be at 1 (left of Rock-climbing).
- Tram must be at 2 (left of Magic-tricks), so Magic-tricks must be at 7.

So, the final arrangement is:

|             |    1    |     2      |       3       |     4     |      5       |      6      |    7    |
| Hobby       | Card-games | board-games | motor         | skydiving | writing     | rock-climbing | magic-tricks |
| Transport   | tram      | bike        | motorbike     | quad-bike | scooter     | trike        | airplane   |

Lv5-2x7-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The Japanese is on the right of the fan of gospel.**
   - This means the Japanese cannot be in position 1 or 2.

2. **The Brazilian is on the far left.**
   - The Brazilian must be in position 1.

3. **The Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the Dutch.**
   - Since the Brazilian is in position 1, the Dutch must be in positions 2 through 7.

4. **The Chinese is on the left of the Mexican.**
   - The Chinese and Mexican must be adjacent, with the Chinese to the left.

5. **The French is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7).**
   - The French can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.

6. **The fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the Chinese.**
   - If the Chinese is in position \(x\), then the fan of soul must be in position \(x+1\) or greater.

7. **The fan of classical is on the far left.**
   - The fan of classical must be in position 1, which is already taken by the Brazilian.

8. **The fan of country is the French.**
   - The French is the fan of country, so the French must be in a position where the fan of country can be placed.

9. **The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the Japanese.**
   - The Japanese cannot be in position 1 or 2, so the fan of salsa could be in positions 3 through 7, and it must be next to the Japanese.

10. **The fan of indie is on the right of the Dutch.**
    - If the Dutch is in position \(y\), then the fan of indie must be in position \(y+1\).

11. **The fan of gospel is on the left or right of the Brazilian.**
    - Since the Brazilian is in position 1, the fan of gospel can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, but not in position 1 (since the Brazilian is there).

12. **The fan of soul is on the far right.**
    - The fan of soul must be in position 7.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Place the Brazilian in position 1:

   - | B | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | So |

3. The French is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7) and is the fan of country, so place the French in position 3:
   - | B | ? | F | ? | ? | ? | So |

4. The fan of classical is on the far left, but it's already taken by the Brazilian, so we need to find another position for it. Given that the Brazilian is in position 1, the fan of classical must be in a different position. We'll determine its position later.

5. The Dutch must be to the right of the Brazilian and the fan of indie must be to the right of the Dutch. Let's place the Dutch in position 5:
   - | B | ? | F | ? | D | ? | So |

6. The fan of indie must be in position 6:
   - | B | ? | F | ? | D | I | So |

7. The Japanese is on the right of the fan of gospel. The fan of gospel can't be in position 1 or 2, so let's place the Japanese in position 6:

8. The fan of gospel must be in position 5:
   - | B | ? | F | G | D | J | So |

1. Since D and RC are adjacent and D is before 7U, let's assume D is 1 and RC is 2 or 3.
2. Since AM is in an odd position and BG is before AM, let's assume AM is 1, 3, or 5.
3. Since C is in an even position, let's assume C is 2, 4, or 6.
4. Since Co is between L and S, and S is adjacent to IT, let's assume S is 3 or 4, and IT is 2 or 5.
5. Since D is before 7U, and D is 1, 3, or 5, 7U must be 2, 4, or 6.
6. Since W is before RC, and RC is 2 or 3, W must be 1 or 2.
7. Since Co is adjacent to G, and G is after C, let's assume Co is 3 and G is 4.
8. Since D is after G, and D is 1 or 3, G must be 2 or 4, but since Co is 3, G must be 4.
9. Since C is 2 or 4, and Co is 3, C must be 2.
10. Since S is 3 or 4, and IT is 2 or 5, S must be 3, and IT must be 5.
11. Since W is before RC, and W must be 1 or 2, and RC is 2 or 3, W must be 1, and RC must be 2.
12. Since D is before 7U, and D is 1 or 3, 7U must be 2, 4, or 6, but since RC is 2, 7U must be 4.
13. Since D is 1 and G is 4, and D is before 7U, 7U must be 4, which is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

### Final Solution:
After re-evaluating, the correct positions can be:
1. Drawing (D)
2. Rock-Climbing (RC)
3. Singing (S)
4. Iced-Tea (IT)
5. Board-Games (BG)
6. Almond-Milk (AM)
7. 7up (7U)

Thus, the correct beverage and hobby arrangement is:

Lv5-2x7-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the appropriate movie genre and means of transport in their respective positions. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4:** The person driving the trike is in the middle.
   - Trike is in position 4.

2. **Clue 7:** The person watching horror movies is the person driving the bike.
   - Bike is in position 2 (since the person watching horror movies must be in an odd position).

3. **Clue 6:** The person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the scooter.
   - Since the person watching horror movies is in position 2, the scooter must be in position 4 (but we already know that position 4 is for the trike, so this needs re-evaluation).

4. **Clue 2:** The person driving the scooter is in an even position.
   - Scooter can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. But since position 2 is for the bike, and position 4 is for the trike, the only possible position for the scooter is 6.

5. **Clue 10:** The person watching spy movies is in an even position.
   - Spy can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. But since position 2 is for horror and position 6 is for the scooter, the only possible position for spy is 4.

6. **Clue 3:** The person driving the helicopter is in an odd position.
   - Helicopter can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. But since position 1, 3, and 7 need to be filled with other genres, and position 5 is for spy, the only possible position for the helicopter is 3.

7. **Clue 1:** The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person watching spy movies.
   - This confirms that the helicopter is in position 3 and spy is in position 4.

8. **Clue 13:** The person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching spy movies.
   - Western cannot be in position 4 (spy), so it must be in position 1 or 3. Since position 3 is for the helicopter, Western must be in position 1.

9. **Clue 5:** The person watching western movies is in an odd position.
   - This confirms Western is in position 1.

10. **Clue 8:** The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person watching disaster movies.
    - Tram can be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since position 4 is for the trike and position 6 is for the scooter, the tram can be in positions 5 or 7. Disaster cannot be in position 5 (helicopter) or 7 (trike), so it must be in position 3 (helicopter).

11. **Clue 9:** The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike.
    - Bus can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since position 1 is for Western, position 2 is for Horror, and position 4 is for Spy, the bus must be in position 1 or 3. But position 3 is for the helicopter, so the bus must be in position 1.

12. **Clue 11:** The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the roller.
    - Roller can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since position 2 is for Horror, position 3 is for the helicopter, position 4 is for Spy, and position 6 is for the scooter, the roller can be in positions 5 or 7. But since the bus is in position 1, the roller must be in position 5.

13. **Clue 12:** The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike.
    - Tram must be in position 7.

14. **Clue 14:** The person watching family movies is between the person driving the bus and the person watching superhero movies.
    - Since the bus is in position 1, the person watching family movies must be in position 3 (helicopter). Superhero must be in position 5 (roller).

15. **Clue 15:** The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike.
    - Tram is in position 7, confirming the previous steps.

16. **Clue 16:** The person watching western movies is the person driving the roller.
    - This confirms that the person watching western movies is in position 1, and the person driving the roller is in position 5.

   - Since the bartender is already in cell 1, the fan of techno must be in cell 2 or 3.
   - Clue 14: The fan of trance is somewhere to the left of the fan of techno.
   - Therefore, the fan of techno cannot be in cell 3 (as there would be no room for the fan of trance).

   - So, the engineer must be in cell 3, 6, or 7.
   - Clue 4: The fan of hip-hop is between the bartender and the videographer.
   - Since the bartender is in cell 1 and the fan of hip-hop is in cell 1 (trance), the videographer must be in cell 3.
   - Place ""videographer"" in cell 3.

9. **Clue 4**: The fan of hip-hop is between the bartender and the videographer.
   - Since the bartender is in cell 1 and the videographer is in cell 3, the fan of hip-hop must be in cell 2.
   - This is consistent with our previous placement.

10. **Clue 6**: The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of trance.
    - This is consistent with our previous placements.

11. **Clue 10**: The fan of folk is on the left or right of the librarian.

    - Place ""librarian"" in cell 7.

12. **Clue 12**: The social-worker is the fan of blues.
    - Place ""social-worker"" in cell 6.

13. **Clue 13**: The librarian is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues.
    - This is consistent with our previous placements.

14. **Clue 15**: The fan of punk is on the right of the electrician.
