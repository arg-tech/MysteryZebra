Lv5-5x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each attribute (beverage, hobby, job, pet, sport) into the correct column based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the positions step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The software-developer is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.
2. **Clue 2:** The software-developer is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
3. **Clue 3:** The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 1:
- This means that if the software-developer is in column 1, the person drinking lemonade must be in column 2.
- If the software-developer is in column 2, the person drinking lemonade must be in column 1.

#### Clue 2:
- The software-developer is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
- This means the person with the hobby skydiving cannot be in column 2 because the software-developer would then be in column 1, which violates the rule that the software-developer is on the right of the skydiving person.

#### Clue 3:
- The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
- This means the skateboarding person cannot be in column 2 because the dog owner would then be in column 1, which violates the rule.

### Putting it Together:

From Clue 2, we know the person with the hobby skydiving cannot be in column 2. So, the person with the hobby skydiving must be in column 1, and the software-developer must be in column 2. 

From Clue 1, if the software-developer is in column 2, the person drinking lemonade must be in column 1. 

Now, from Clue 3, since the person with the sport skateboarding cannot be in column 2, they must be in column 1, and the dog owner must be in column 2.

Let's fill in the table:

```
|            |       1       |         2          |
| Beverage   | Lemonade     | Water              |
| Hobby      | Skydiving    | Hiking             |
| Job        | Software-developer | Analyst           |
| Pet        | Dog          | Hedgehog           |
| Sport      | Skateboarding | Rugby              |
```

### Final Solution Table:

```
|            |       1       |         2          |
| Beverage   | Lemonade     | Water              |
| Hobby      | Skydiving    | Hiking             |
| Job        | Software-developer | Analyst           |
| Pet        | Dog          | Hedgehog           |
| Sport      | Skateboarding | Rugby              |
```"
Lv5-5x2-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step-by-step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Cycling is in an odd position (1 or 3).**
   - This means the person who prefers cycling can only be in position 1 or 3.

2. **Lemonade is to the right of the hedgehog owner.**
   - If the hedgehog owner is in position 1, lemonade must be in position 2.
   - If the hedgehog owner is in position 2, lemonade must be in position 3 or 4.
   - If the hedgehog owner is in position 3, lemonade must be in position 4 or 5.
   - If the hedgehog owner is in position 4, lemonade must be in position 5.
   - If the hedgehog owner is in position 5, there is no room for lemonade.

3. **Fisherman is to the right of the scientist.**
   - This means the scientist cannot be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 if the fisherman is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 respectively.

4. **Potato is to the left of the lemonade drinker.**
   - If the lemonade drinker is in position 2, potato must be in position 1.
   - If the lemonade drinker is in position 3, potato must be in position 1 or 2.
   - If the lemonade drinker is in position 4, potato must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - If the lemonade drinker is in position 5, potato must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

### Let's assign positions:

- Since cycling is in an odd position, let's assume it is in position 1. This gives us:
  - Position 1: Cycling

- The scientist cannot be in position 1, so they must be in one of the other positions. The fisherman must be to the right of the scientist. Let's place the scientist in position 2 and the fisherman in position 3:
  - Position 2: Scientist
  - Position 3: Fisherman

- Now, the hedgehog owner cannot be in position 1 or 2 because the fisherman is in position 3 and the scientist is in position 2. So, the hedgehog owner must be in position 4 or 5. Since lemonade is to the right of the hedgehog owner, the hedgehog owner cannot be in position 5 (because then there would be no room for lemonade). Therefore, the hedgehog owner must be in position 4:
  - Position 4: Hedgehog

- This means lemonade must be in position 5:
  - Position 5: Lemonade

- Now we need to determine the sports for the remaining positions (2 and 3):
  - Position 2 (Scientist): We need to decide between skateboarding and cycling. Since cycling is already assigned to position 1, the scientist must prefer skateboarding.
  - Position 3 (Fisherman): The fisherman must prefer cycling since that is the only sport left.

- Now, we need to assign the food:
  - Position 1 (Cycling): We need to decide between apricot and potato. Since potato is to the left of the lemonade drinker (position 5), the cyclist must eat apricot.
  - Position 4 (Hedgehog): The hedgehog owner must eat potato.

- Finally, we need to assign the jobs:
  - Position 2 (Scientist): The scientist must be a scientist.
  - Position 3 (Fisherman): The fisherman must be a fisherman.

### Final Table:

```
|            |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage   | Cycling   | Skateboarding |
| Food       | Apricot   | Potato        |
| Job        | Fisherman | Scientist     |
| Pet        |           | Hedgehog      |
| Sport      |           |               |
```

This configuration satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv5-5x2-3	"Sure, let's solve this step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the pairs:**
   - Beverage: Sprite and 7up
   - Movie-Genre: Mystery and Scientific
   - Nationality: Chinese and Russian
   - Sport: Rugby and Skiing
   - Transport: Quad-bike and Train

2. **Analyze the clues:**

   - **Clue 1:** The person drinking Sprite is on the left of the Chinese.
     - This means if we have the order: Sprite, ..., Chinese, then the person on the left (Sprite) is not necessarily the first but must be to the left of the Chinese.

   - **Clue 2:** The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is Skiing.
     - This means the person who does Skiing cannot be the last one, and the person who drives the quad-bike must be after them.

   - **Clue 3:** The person driving the quad-bike is the person watching Mystery movies.
     - This directly links the person driving the quad-bike to watching Mystery movies.

3. **Construct the table based on the clues:**

Let's denote:
- \( P_1 \): Person 1
- \( P_2 \): Person 2

We need to fill the table with the given constraints.

### Initial Setup:

|               |     1      |     2     |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Beverage      |            |           |

| Nationality   |            |           |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |

### Applying Clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person drinking Sprite is on the left of the Chinese.
   - Possible pairs: (Sprite, Chinese) or (Sprite, Other), (Other, Chinese).

2. **Clue 3:** The person driving the quad-bike is the person watching Mystery movies.
   - So, Mystery and Quad-bike must be together.

3. **Clue 2:** The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is Skiing.
   - This means Skiing cannot be the last, and Quad-bike must be after Skiing.

### Combining Clues:

- If we assume:
  - \( P_1 \) is the person who drinks Sprite and \( P_2 \) is the person who drinks 7up.
  - \( P_1 \) is also the person who watches Mystery movies and drives the quad-bike.
  - \( P_2 \) must be the person who watches Scientific movies and uses the train.

- Since \( P_1 \) is on the left of the Chinese, \( P_2 \) must be the Chinese.

- Since Skiing must be before Quad-bike, \( P_1 \) (who does Skiing) must be before \( P_2 \) (who does Rugby and uses the train).

Lv5-5x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and place the information into the table step-by-step.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **Clue 1:** The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person whose hobby is reading.
2. **Clue 2:** The Thai person is somewhere to the right of the fan of house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the subway is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Place Hobbies
- Clue 1 tells us that the person with the hobby of filmmaking must be to the left of the person with the hobby of reading.
- Let's denote the person with the hobby of filmmaking as F and the person with the hobby of reading as R.
- Therefore, we can place them in the first two columns:
  - Filmmaking (F) | Reading (R)

#### Step 2: Place Nationalities
- Clue 2 states that the Thai person is to the right of the fan of house.
- Let's denote the Thai person as T and the fan of house as H.
- Since the Thai person must be to the right of the fan of house, we can place them in the second column:
  - Filmmaking (F) | Reading (R)
  - House (H) | Thai (T)

#### Step 3: Place Beverages
- Clue 3 states that the person driving the subway is to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
- Let's denote the person driving the subway as S and the person drinking lemonade as L.
- Since the person driving the subway must be to the left of the person drinking lemonade, we can place them in the first column:
  - Submarine (S) | Lemonade (L)
  - House (H) | Thai (T)

#### Step 4: Fill in the Remaining Columns
- We now have the following table structure:
  - Beverage: Submarine (S) | Lemonade (L)
  - Hobby: Filmmaking (F) | Reading (R)
  - Music-Genre: Folk (F) | House (R)
  - Nationality: American (F) | Thai (R)
  - Transport: Submarine (S) | Bus (R)

Since we only have two choices for each category and all conditions are met, we can finalize the table:

Lv5-5x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the given table. Let's break down the clues step by step:

### Clues Analysis:
1. **The librarian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the skateboard.**
2. **The Spanish is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.**
3. **The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking fanta.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the positions of the librarian and the person driving the skateboard.
- Since the librarian is to the left of the person driving the skateboard, we can denote them as follows:
  - Librarian (L) < Person Driving Skateboard (S)
  
  This means L must be in position 1, and S must be in position 2.

  |               |     1     |     2      |
  |---------------|-----------|-----------|

  | Sport         |           |           |
  | Transport     |           | Skateboard|

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of the Spanish and the person who prefers ice-hockey.
- The Spanish is to the left of the person who prefers ice-hockey.
- From the previous step, we know that the librarian (Spanish) is already in position 1, so the person who prefers ice-hockey must be in position 2.

  |               |     1     |     2      |

  | Transport     |           | Skateboard|

#### Step 3: Determine the positions of the people drinking cola and fanta.
- The person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking fanta.
- We need to fit these into the remaining positions.

  Since the librarian and the Spanish are already placed, the only remaining positions are for the job (freelancer) and the nationality (Japanese).

Lv5-5x2-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step based on the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
2. The mechanic is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
3. The police-officer is on the left or right of the owner of the pony.
4. The person drinking fanta is the person watching time-travel movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- Board-games (B) > Reading (R)
  - Possible order: B _ R _ _ or _ B _ R _ or _ _ B R _
  
#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- Mechanic (M) < Iced-tea (I)
  - M must be in the first position and I must be in the second, third, or fourth position.
  
#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Police-officer (P) is next to the owner of the pony (Pony (Pony))
  - Possible pairs: MPony, PonyM
  
#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- Fanta (F) = Time-travel movies (TT)
  - The person drinking fanta watches time-travel movies.

### Combining Clues:

#### Possible Orders Based on Clue 2 (Mechanic < Iced-tea):
- M _ _ _ I
- M _ _ I _
- M _ I _ _

#### Considering Clue 3 (Police-officer next to pony):
- If M _ _ _ I, then P must be in the second or third position.
- If M _ _ I _, then P must be in the second or third position.
- If M _ I _ _, then P must be in the second or third position.

#### Considering Clue 1 (Board-games > Reading):
- If M _ _ _ I, possible orders: M B _ I R or M B I _ R
- If M _ _ I _, possible orders: M B _ I R or M B I _ R
- If M _ I _ _, possible orders: M B I _ R

#### Considering Clue 4 (Fanta = Time-travel movies):
- F must be in a position where the person watches time-travel movies.

### Final Solution:

Let's try the order M B I R P:
- M is the mechanic.
- B is board-games.
- I is iced-tea.
- R is reading.
- P is the pony.

Now we need to fit in the other details:
- Fanta = Time-travel movies, so the person drinking fanta must be in a position that matches this clue.

Given the constraints:
- The person drinking iced-tea (I) is to the right of the mechanic (M).
- The police-officer (P) is next to the pony (P).

This gives us:
- M (mechanic) is in the first position.
- B (board-games) must be to the right of R (reading), so B could be in the second or third position.
- I (iced-tea) is in the fourth position.
- P (police-officer) and Pony (Pony) are next to each other, so they can be in the second and third positions, or third and fourth positions.

Since B must be to the right of R and I is in the fourth position, the only feasible order is:
- M (mechanic) in the first position.
- B (board-games) in the second position.
- R (reading) in the third position.
- I (iced-tea) in the fourth position.
- P (police-officer) and Pony (Pony) in the fifth position.

Thus, the final solution is:
```
|               |      1      |       2        |
| Beverage      |  iced-tea   |                |
| Hobby         |  reading    | board-games    |

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the person eating cherry.
2. **Clue 2:** The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the left of the security-guard.
3. **Clue 3:** The person whose hobby is cooking is on the right of the person whose sport is biathlon.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the order based on Clue 1:
- Carrot (C) must be to the right of Cherry (Ch).
- Possible arrangements: C Ch, Ch C.

#### Step 2: Determine the order based on Clue 2:
- Skateboard (S) must be to the left of Security-guard (SG).
- Possible arrangements: S SG, SG S.

#### Step 3: Determine the order based on Clue 3:
- Cooking (Co) must be to the right of Biathlon (Bi).
- Possible arrangements: Co Bi, Bi Co.

### Combining the Clues:

Let's start with the most restrictive clues first:

- From Clue 2, we know that Skateboard (S) must be to the left of Security-guard (SG). So, the possible pairs are: S SG or SG S.
- From Clue 3, we know that Cooking (Co) must be to the right of Biathlon (Bi). So, the possible pairs are: Co Bi or Bi Co.

Since we have two columns, let's try to fit these clues into both columns while ensuring all conditions are met.

### Arrangement:

Let's start with the first column (Column 1):

1. **Column 1:**
   - We can place ""Cherry"" in Column 1 since it must be to the left of ""Carrot"".
   - We can place ""Skateboard"" in Column 1 since it must be to the left of ""Security-guard"".

So, Column 1 could look like:
- Food: Cherry
- Hobby: Cooking
- Job: Firefighter
- Sport: Biathlon
- Transport: Skateboard

Now, let's fill in Column 2:

2. **Column 2:**
   - Since ""Carrot"" is to the right of ""Cherry"", ""Carrot"" goes in Column 2.
   - Since ""Security-guard"" is to the right of ""Skateboard"", ""Security-guard"" goes in Column 2.
   - Since ""Cooking"" is to the left of ""Biathlon"", ""Biathlon"" goes in Column 2.
   - The remaining options for Food, Hobby, Job, and Sport will be filled accordingly.

So, Column 2 could look like:
- Food: Carrot
- Hobby: Drawing
- Job: Security-guard
- Sport: Golf
- Transport: Quad-bike

### Final Table:

```
|             |      1      |       2        |
| Food        | Cherry      | Carrot         |
| Hobby       | Cooking     | Drawing        |
| Job         | Firefighter | Security-guard |
| Sport       | Biathlon    | Golf           |
| Transport   | Skateboard  | Quad-bike      |

Lv5-5x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the items accordingly. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Clues Recap:
1. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike.
2. The person eating peas is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
3. The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating potato.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: Tea & Motorbike
- If the person drinking tea is to the left of the person driving the motorbike, then we can deduce that if the person drinking tea is in position 1, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2. This implies a relationship between positions 1 and 2 for tea and motorbike.

#### Clue 2: Peas & Hamster
- The person eating peas is either directly to the left or right of the owner of the hamster. This means that if someone owns the hamster, they are immediately adjacent (either to the left or right) to the person eating peas.

#### Clue 3: Zombie Movies & Potato
- The person watching zombie movies is to the left of the person eating potato. This indicates a relationship where the person watching zombie movies must be in a position to the left of the person eating potato.

### Possible Arrangements:
Let's start with the first clue and see how it fits with the other clues.

1. **Tea & Motorbike**: 
   - If the person drinking tea is in position 1, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2.
   - If the person drinking tea is in position 2, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1.

2. **Peas & Hamster**:
   - The person eating peas is next to the owner of the hamster. This could mean the hamster owner is in position 1 and the person eating peas is in position 2, or vice versa.

3. **Zombie Movies & Potato**:
   - The person watching zombie movies is to the left of the person eating potato. This could mean the person watching zombie movies is in position 1 and the person eating potato is in position 2, or vice versa.

### Combining Clues:
Let's assume the person drinking tea is in position 1 and the person driving the motorbike is in position 2. This satisfies Clue 1.

Now, let's consider Clue 2 and Clue 3:
- For Clue 2, the person eating peas must be next to the owner of the hamster.
- For Clue 3, the person watching zombie movies must be to the left of the person eating potato.

Given these constraints, let's try the following arrangement:

|               |     1      |     2     |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Beverage      | Tea        | Motorbike |
| Food          | Peas       | Potato    |
| Movie-Genre   | Family     | Zombie    |
| Pet           | Guinea-Pig | Hamster   |
| Transport     | Trike      |           |

### Verification:
1. **Tea & Motorbike**: Tea is in position 1, and Motorbike is in position 2. This satisfies Clue 1.
2. **Peas & Hamster**: Peas is in position 1, and Hamster is in position 2. This satisfies Clue 2.
3. **Zombie Movies & Potato**: Zombie is in position 2, and Potato is in position 1. This satisfies Clue 3.

### Final Solution Table:
```
|               |     1      |     2     |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Beverage      | Tea        | Motorbike |
