Lv5-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person watching spy movies is in an odd position.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating lettuce is between the person eating carrot and the Egyptian.
3. **Clue 3:** The French is on the far left or far right.
4. **Clue 4:** The person watching fantasy movies is in an even position.
5. **Clue 5:** The French is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
6. **Clue 6:** The person driving the subway is in an odd position.
7. **Clue 7:** The Malaysian is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
8. **Clue 8:** The Egyptian is the person driving the car.
9. **Clue 9:** The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left or far right.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine positions for Spy Movies and Subway Driver
- From Clue 1: The person watching spy movies is in an odd position (1 or 3).
- From Clue 6: The person driving the subway is in an odd position (1 or 3).

Since the person watching spy movies must be to the right of the person driving the subway (Clue 9), and both are in odd positions, the only possible arrangement is:
- Spy movies: Position 3
- Subway driver: Position 1

#### Step 2: Determine the French and Chess Hobbies
- From Clue 3: The French is on the far left or far right.
- From Clue 5: The French is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
- From Clue 10: The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left or far right.

Given that the French cannot be in position 3 (as it would violate Clue 5 with the woodworking person), the French must be in position 1:
- French: Position 1

Since the French is in position 1, the woodworking person must be in position 3 (far right):
- Woodworking: Position 3

This leaves the chess person in position 2:
- Chess: Position 2

#### Step 3: Determine the Egyptian and Car Driver
- From Clue 8: The Egyptian is the person driving the car.
- Since the Egyptian is not the French or the woodworking person, they must be in position 2 (chess):
- Car driver: Position 2
- Egyptian: Position 2

This leaves the remaining position (position 3) for the spy movie watcher:
- Spy movies: Position 3

#### Step 4: Determine the Remaining Positions
- From Clue 2: The person eating lettuce is between the person eating carrot and the Egyptian.
- The Egyptian is in position 2, so the person eating lettuce must be in position 1 (French) or position 3 (spy movie watcher).

Since the French is in position 1, the person eating lettuce must be in position 3 (spy movie watcher), and the person eating carrot must be in position 2 (chess):

- Carrot: Position 2
- Lettuce: Position 3
- Tomato: Position 1

#### Step 5: Determine the Movie Genres and Nationalities
- From Clue 4: The person watching fantasy movies is in an even position (2).
- From Clue 9: The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway (position 3).

Given the spy movie watcher is in position 3, the fantasy movie watcher must be in position 2:
- Fantasy movies: Position 2
- Spy movies: Position 3

This leaves the zombie movie watcher in position 1:
- Zombie movies: Position 1

Lv5-5x3-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the fan of r&b.**
   - This implies that the fan of r&b cannot be in position 3.

2. **The person drinking water is between the person drinking almond-milk and the fan of r&b.**
   - This means that the fan of r&b must be in position 2, and water is either in position 1 or 3, with almond-milk in the adjacent position.

3. **The owner of the horse is somewhere to the left of the librarian.**
   - This means the librarian cannot be in position 1 if the horse is in position 1.

4. **The person driving the jet-ski is on the far right.**
   - This means the jet-ski is in position 3 for transport.

5. **The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the train.**
   - Since the jet-ski is in position 3, the train can be in position 1 or 2.

6. **The person driving the train is on the left of the entrepreneur.**
   - If the train is in position 1, the entrepreneur is in position 2 or 3 (but not 3 because jet-ski is there).

7. **The entrepreneur is on the right of the librarian.**
   - If the librarian is in position 1, the entrepreneur must be in position 2 or 3.

8. **The fan of pop is on the right of the fan of blues.**
   - This means pop cannot be in position 1, and blues cannot be in position 3.

### Solving Step-by-Step:

#### Step 1: Positioning the jet-ski
- Jet-ski is in position 3.

#### Step 2: Positioning the fan of r&b
- From clue 1, the fan of r&b cannot be in position 3.
- From clue 2, the fan of r&b must be in position 2, and water is in position 1 or 3.
- Since jet-ski is in position 3, water must be in position 1 (since it's between almond-milk and r&b).

#### Step 3: Positioning the fan of r&b and almond-milk
- Water is in position 1, so almond-milk must be in position 3 (since it's next to r&b).
- Therefore, r&b is in position 2.

#### Step 4: Positioning the horse and librarian
- From clue 3, the owner of the horse is to the left of the librarian.
- From clue 6, the train is to the left of the entrepreneur.
- From clue 7, the entrepreneur is to the right of the librarian.

#### Step 5: Positioning the train and entrepreneur
- The train can only be in position 1 or 2.
- If the train is in position 1, the entrepreneur must be in position 2 or 3 (but 3 is occupied by jet-ski).
- Therefore, the train is in position 1, and the entrepreneur is in position 2.
- The librarian must be in position 3.

#### Step 6: Positioning the blues and pop
- From clue 8, pop is to the right of blues.
- Blues cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 1 or 2.
- Since the train is in position 1, blues must be in position 1.
- Pop must be in position 2.

#### Final Table:

7. The person eating papaya is somewhere to the right of the colombian.
8. The fan of folk is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit.
9. The person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the dutch.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 1 & 7**: The owner of the hamster is the person eating papaya, and the person eating papaya is to the right of the colombian.
   - Let's place the colombian first, then the person eating papaya (hamster owner) to the right of the colombian.
   
2. **Clue 3**: The colombian is the fan of d&b.
   - Colombian -> d&b.

3. **Clue 5**: The fan of indie is on the right of the colombian.
   - Colombian -> d&b, Indie fan -> to the right of d&b.

4. **Clue 2 & 6**: The owner of the horse is between the malaysian and the owner of the hamster, and also between the owner of the hamster and the videographer.
   - Let's denote the positions as follows: [_, _, _]
   - Since the owner of the hamster (papaya eater) is to the right of the colombian, and the owner of the horse is between them and the videographer, we can place the owner of the horse in the middle.
   - Colombian -> d&b, Owner of the horse -> middle, Videographer -> to the right of the horse.

5. **Clue 8**: The fan of folk is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit.
   - Since the fan of folk cannot be the colombian (d&b), and the person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the dutch, let's consider the possible placements for folk and grapefruit.
   - If the folk fan is not the colombian, it could be the freelancer or the videographer. However, since the freelance is on the left or right of folk, and the person eating grapefruit is next to the dutch, the folk fan must be the freelancer.

6. **Clue 4**: The freelancer is on the left or right of the fan of folk.
   - Freelancer -> folk fan.

7. **Clue 9**: The person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the dutch.
   - Since the freelance is the folk fan, the person eating grapefruit must be the dutch.
   - Dutch -> grapefruit.

8. **Clue 1**: The owner of the hamster is the person eating papaya.
   - Hamster owner -> papaya eater.

### Final Table:
```

Lv5-5x3-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's break down the clues step by step.

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the Canadian.
   - This implies that the Canadian cannot be in position 1 if the person driving the airplane is in position 1.

2. **Clue 2**: The person whose sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is camping.
   - This means the positions of the person with the hobby of camping and the person with the sport of water-polo must be adjacent.

3. **Clue 3**: The analyst is between the Turkish and the doctor.
   - This means the analyst must be in the middle of the Turkish and the doctor.

4. **Clue 4**: The analyst is between the person whose sport is soccer and the person whose hobby is camping.
   - This also means the analyst is in the middle of these two individuals.

5. **Clue 5**: The person driving the car is in an even position.
   - This means the person driving the car can only be in position 2 or 4.

6. **Clue 6**: The person whose hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is soccer.
   - This means the person with the hobby of baking cannot be in position 3 if the person with the sport of soccer is in position 3.

7. **Clue 7**: The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is water-polo.
   - This means the person with the sport of water-polo cannot be in position 3 if the Turkish is in position 3.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Positioning Analyst**:
   - From Clues 3 and 4, the analyst must be in position 2 because it is the only position that can satisfy both conditions (between the Turkish and the doctor, and between the person whose sport is soccer and the person whose hobby is camping).

2. **Positioning Sport and Hobby**:
   - Since the analyst is in position 2, the person with the sport of soccer and the person with the hobby of camping must be in positions 1 and 3 respectively (to satisfy Clue 4).

3. **Positioning Nationality**:
   - From Clue 3, the Turkish and the doctor must be on either side of the analyst in positions 1 and 3. Since the analyst is in position 2, the Turkish cannot be in position 3 (Clue 7). Therefore, the Turkish must be in position 1, and the doctor in position 3.

4. **Positioning Car and Airplane**:
   - From Clue 5, the person driving the car must be in position 2 or 4. But since position 2 is already taken by the analyst, the car driver must be in position 4.
   - From Clue 1, the person driving the airplane must be to the left of the Canadian. Since the Canadian cannot be in position 1 (as per Clue 1), the Canadian must be in position 3 (since the analyst is in position 2 and the doctor is in position 3, leaving position 3 for the Canadian).

5. **Positioning Baking and Soccer**:
   - From Clue 6, the person with the hobby of baking must be to the left of the person with the sport of soccer. Since the person with the sport of soccer is in position 3, the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 1.

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1     |     2      |      3       |

Lv5-5x3-7	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The person driving the train is on the left of the American.
2. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the Dutch.
3. The fan of D&B is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is camping.
4. The American is in an even position.
5. The person drinking Mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.
6. The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person driving the boat.
7. The person whose hobby is chess is on the far right.
8. The person driving the car is the fan of classical.
9. The American is the person driving the boat.
10. The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4 & 9:
- The American is in an even position (Clue 4).
- The American is the person driving the boat (Clue 9).

So, the American must be in position 2 (since it's the only even position available).

#### Clue 7:
- The person whose hobby is chess is on the far right.
- Therefore, the person with the hobby ""chess"" must be in position 3.

#### Clue 8:
- The person driving the car is the fan of classical.
- Since the American is already in position 2 and drives the boat, the person driving the car cannot be in position 2.
- The person driving the car must be in position 1 (since positions 2 and 3 are taken by the American and chess, respectively).

#### Clue 10:
- The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.
- Since the person driving the car is in position 1, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2 or 3.
- But since position 2 is the American, the person drinking sprite must be in position 3.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Driver of car (fan of classical)
- Position 2: American (drives the boat)
- Position 3: Chess (drinks sprite)

#### Clue 1:
- The person driving the train is on the left of the American.
- So, the person driving the train must be in position 1, but that's already taken by the person driving the car.
- This confirms our earlier assignment for the positions.

#### Clue 2 & 5:
- The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the Dutch.
- The person drinking sprite is in position 3.
- The person drinking Mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.
- The person driving the boat is in position 2 (American).
- So, the person drinking Mirinda must be in position 3, which contradicts the sprite drinker being in position 3. Therefore, the person drinking Mirinda must be in position 3, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 2 (Dutch).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Driver of car (fan of classical)
- Position 2: American (drives the boat, drinks sprite)
- Position 3: Dutch (drinks Mirinda, chess)

#### Clue 3:
- The fan of D&B is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is camping.
- The person whose hobby is camping must be in position 1 (since the fan of D&B is to the right and the only remaining position is 1).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Camping (fan of D&B)
- Position 2: American (drives the boat, drinks sprite)
- Position 3: Dutch (drinks Mirinda, chess)

#### Clue 6:
- The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person driving the boat.
- The person driving the boat is in position 2 (American).
- So, the fan of hip-hop can be in position 1 or 3.
- Since position 1 is camping (fan of D&B), the fan of hip-hop must be in position 3 (Dutch).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Camping (fan of D&B)
- Position 2: American (drives the boat, drinks sprite)
- Position 3: Dutch (drinks Mirinda, chess, fan of hip-hop)

Now, let's assign the beverages and music genres based on the positions:

- Position 1: Camping (fan of D&B) - Must be driving the train (Clue 1).
- Position 2: American (drives the boat, drinks sprite) - Must be drinking sprite (Clue 2).
- Position 3: Dutch (drinks Mirinda, chess, fan of hip-hop) - Must be drinking Mirinda (Clue 5).

Since the American is in position 2 and drinks sprite, the remaining beverages are:
- Position 1: Drinking coffee (since sprite and Mirinda are taken).
- Position 3: Drinking sprite (already assigned).

Finally, the music genres:
- Position 1: D&B (fan of D&B).
- Position 2: Classical (fan of classical).
- Position 3: Hip-hop (fan of hip-hop).

8. **Clue 8:** The person whose hobby is Singing is on the right of the person drinking Tea.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4:
- The person drinking Coffee watches Zombie movies.

#### Clue 8:
- The person drinking Tea has the hobby of Singing.
- The person with the hobby of Singing is on the right of the person drinking Tea.

#### Clue 6:
- The person eating Lemon has the hobby of Singing (from Clue 8).
- The person eating Lemon is on the right of the person drinking Tea.

Thus, we can place:
- **Person 1:** Drinking Tea, Hobby: Singing
- **Person 2:** Eating Lemon, Hobby: Singing
- **Person 3:** Watching Zombie movies, Drinking Coffee

#### Clue 7:
- The owner of the Chinchilla is on the right of the person whose hobby is Traveling.
- Since Person 3 has the hobby of Singing (and thus cannot be the owner of the Chinchilla), the person with the hobby of Traveling must be either Person 1 or Person 2.
- Given that Person 2 already has the hobby of Singing, the person with the hobby of Traveling must be Person 1.
- Therefore, the owner of the Chinchilla is Person 3.

Thus, we can place:
- **Person 1:** Drinking Tea, Hobby: Traveling, Pet: Chinchilla
- **Person 2:** Eating Lemon, Hobby: Singing
- **Person 3:** Watching Zombie movies, Drinking Coffee, Pet: Chinchilla

#### Clue 1:
- The person drinking Fanta is between the person watching Spy movies and the owner of the Rat.
- Since Person 3 is watching Zombie movies and drinking Coffee, the person watching Spy movies must be Person 2 (since Person 1 is traveling and Person 3 is zombie).
- Thus, Person 2 is watching Spy movies.
- Therefore, the person drinking Fanta is between Person 2 (Spy) and Person 3 (Zombie).

Thus, we can place:
- **Person 2:** Watching Spy movies, Drinking Fanta
- **Person 3:** Watching Zombie movies, Drinking Coffee, Pet: Chinchilla

#### Clue 2:
- The person eating Orange is somewhere to the left of the owner of the Chinchilla (Person 3).
- Since Person 3 is the owner of the Chinchilla, the person eating Orange must be Person 1.

Thus, we can place:
- **Person 1:** Drinking Tea, Hobby: Traveling, Pet: Chinchilla, Eating Orange

#### Clue 3:
- The person watching Spy movies (Person 2) is on the left of the owner of the Chinchilla (Person 3).

This confirms our previous placement.

#### Clue 5:
- The person eating Carrot is on the left or right of the person eating Lemon.
- Since Person 2 is eating Lemon, the person eating Carrot must be Person 1 or Person 3.
- Since Person 1 is eating Orange, the person eating Carrot must be Person 3.

Thus, we can place:
- **Person 3:** Watching Zombie movies, Drinking Coffee, Pet: Chinchilla, Eating Carrot

#### Clue 6:
- The person eating Lemon (Person 2) is on the right of the person whose hobby is Singing.
- This is already confirmed as Person 2 has the hobby of Singing and is on the right of Person 1 (who has the hobby of Traveling).

#### Clue 7:
- The owner of the Chinchilla (Person 3) is on the right of the person whose hobby is Traveling.
- This is already confirmed as Person 3 is the owner of the Chinchilla and has the hobby of Traveling.

Lv5-5x3-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

1. **Identify the positions:**
   - The videographer is on the far left (position 1).
   - The person eating potato is on the far left (position 1).

Since both the videographer and the person eating potato are in position 1, we need to ensure no overlap. Therefore, the videographer must be the one eating potato. So, we have:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      | potato       | soy-     |         |
| Food          | potato       |          |         |
| Job           | videographer |          |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |         |
| Pet           |              |          |         |
```

2. **Positioning based on beverage:**
   - The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk.
   - The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the designer.

From this, we can infer that the person drinking milk cannot be in position 1 because it is already occupied by the videographer. Thus, the person drinking milk must be in position 2 or 3, and the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is occupied by the videographer, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2, and the person drinking milk must be in position 3.

So, we update the table as follows:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      | potato       | iced-tea | milk    |
| Food          | potato       |          |         |
| Job           | videographer |          |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |         |
| Pet           |              |          |         |
```

3. **Positioning based on music genre:**
   - The fan of blues is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - The fan of blues is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
   - The fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.

From these clues, we know the fan of blues cannot be in position 3 because the person drinking soy-milk is to their right. Therefore, the fan of blues must be in position 1 or 2. Given that the person drinking soy-milk is in position 3, the fan of blues must be in position 2. This means the owner of the horse is also in position 2, but since position 2 is now taken by the fan of blues, the owner of the horse must be in position 3. The fan of funk must be in position 3 because the owner of the chinchilla is to their left.

So, we update the table as follows:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      | potato       | iced-tea | milk    |
| Food          | potato       |          |         |
| Job           | videographer |          |         |
| Music-Genre   | blues        | funk     | horse   |
| Pet           |              |          |         |
```

4. **Positioning based on food and pet:**
   - The person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk.
   - The person eating potato is on the far left (already known).

From this, the person eating kale must be in position 3. Therefore, the person eating potato must be in position 1. The pet for the person eating kale must be the chinchilla, and the pet for the person eating potato must be the cat.

So, we update the table as follows:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      | potato       | iced-tea | milk    |
| Food          | potato       |          | kale    |
| Job           | videographer |          |         |
| Music-Genre   | blues        | funk     | horse   |
| Pet           | cat          |          | chinchilla|
```

5. **Positioning based on job:**
   - The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the designer.

From this, the designer must be in position 3 because the person drinking milk is in position 3.

So, we update the table as follows:
```
|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      | potato       | iced-tea | milk    |
| Food          | potato       |          | kale    |
| Job           | videographer |          | designer|
| Music-Genre   | blues        | funk     | horse   |
| Pet           | cat          |          | chinchilla|
```

6. **Final positioning of food and job:**
   - The person eating mango must be in position 2.

So, we update the table as follows:
```
