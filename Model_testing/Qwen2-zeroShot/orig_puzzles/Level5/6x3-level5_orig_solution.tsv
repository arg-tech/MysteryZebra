Lv5-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who's sport is rowing is between the person who's sport is sailing and the fan of salsa.**
   - This means the order for these three is: sailing -> rowing -> salsa.

2. **The project-manager is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot.**
   - Project-manager > Apricot.

3. **The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is writing.**
   - Documentaries < Writing.

4. **The person eating garlic is on the far left or far right.**
   - Garlic = 1st or 3rd position.

5. **The social-worker is on the left of the person eating blueberry.**
   - Social-worker < Blueberry.

6. **The social-worker is somewhere to the right of the fan of rock.**
   - Rock < Social-worker.

7. **The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.**
   - Hiking < Thriller.

8. **The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating garlic.**
   - Garlic < Sports.

9. **The person who's hobby is video-games is on the far left.**
   - Video-games = 1st position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Positioning Video-Games:
- From clue 9, the person with the hobby of video-games is on the far left.
- So, Video-games = 1.

#### Positioning Garlic:
- From clue 4, the person eating garlic is on the far left or far right.
- Since Video-games is already on the far left, Garlic must be on the far right (position 3).

#### Positioning Sailing, Rowing, and Salsa:
- From clue 1, the order is: Sailing -> Rowing -> Salsa.
- The person who eats garlic (position 3) cannot be the one doing rowing because it would violate clue 8 (Garlic < Sports). Therefore, Garlic can only be eating apricot or blueberry.
- Let’s assume Garlic is eating blueberry (we will check if this assumption works later).
- So, the person eating apricot must be on the far left (position 1) because Garlic is on the far right.
- Now, the person eating apricot is the one who’s job is a project-manager (clue 2).
- Therefore, Project-manager = 1, Apricot = 1.

#### Positioning Sailing, Rowing, and Salsa:
- Since Apricot = 1, and Garlic = 3, we need to place Sailing, Rowing, and Salsa.
- From clue 1, the order is: Sailing -> Rowing -> Salsa.
- Sailing must be in position 2 because Rowing cannot be in position 1 (Project-manager) and Rowing cannot be in position 3 (Salsa).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Project-manager, Apricot
- Position 2: Sailing
- Position 3: Garlic, Blueberry

#### Positioning Social-Worker and Rock:
- From clue 6, the social-worker is to the right of the fan of rock.
- From clue 5, the social-worker is on the left of the person eating blueberry.
- From clue 6, the social-worker is to the right of the fan of rock.
- From clue 3, the person watching documentaries is to the left of the person who’s hobby is writing.
- The person watching documentaries must be in position 1 (Project-manager), so the person who’s hobby is writing must be in position 3 (Garlic, Blueberry).

So, let’s place Social-worker and Rock:
- Social-worker = 2 (since it’s to the right of Rock and to the left of Blueberry).
- Rock = 1 (since Social-worker is to the right of Rock).

#### Final Positions:
- Position 1: Project-manager, Apricot
- Position 2: Social-worker, Rock
- Position 3: Garlic, Blueberry

#### Remaining Clues:
- From clue 7, the person who’s hobby is hiking is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
- From clue 8, the person watching sports movies is to the right of the person eating garlic.
- From clue 3, the person watching documentaries is to the left of the person who’s hobby is writing.

Given the remaining positions and clues, we can fill in the rest:

- The person watching documentaries (Project-manager) is to the left of the person who’s hobby is writing (Blueberry).
- The person who’s hobby is hiking (Video-games) is to the left of the person watching thriller movies (Documentaries).

So, we have:
- Position 1: Project-manager, Apricot
- Position 2: Social-worker, Rock
- Position 3: Garlic, Blueberry

#### Final Table:
```

8. **Clue 8:** The person eating mango is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.
9. **Clue 9:** The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze Clue 7
- The owner of the rat is on the right of the British.
- Possible positions for the British and the rat:
  - British (1), Rat (2) or British (2), Rat (3)

#### Step 2: Analyze Clue 6
- The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
- If British (1), Rat (2), then Guinea-pig can be at position 1 or 2.
- If British (2), Rat (3), then Guinea-pig can be at position 2 or 3.

#### Step 3: Analyze Clue 9
- The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.
- This means water cannot be in position 3, and cola cannot be in position 1.

#### Step 4: Analyze Clue 8
- The person eating mango is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.
- This means they cannot be in separate positions 1 and 3.

#### Step 5: Analyze Clue 1
- The person watching family movies is on the left of the person eating pumpkin.
- This means family movies and pumpkin cannot be in positions 3 and 1 respectively.

#### Step 6: Analyze Clue 2
- The person watching spy movies is between the Mexican and the person eating pepper.
- This means the Mexican cannot be in position 1 or 3.

#### Step 7: Analyze Clue 3 & 4
- The person whose hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the owner of the frog.
- And also to the left of the person watching spy movies.
- This implies the person with the hobby of board-games must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Step 8: Analyze Clue 5
- The person whose hobby is chess is on the left or right of the Turkish.
- This means the Turkish cannot be in position 1 if the chess person is in position 2, and vice versa.

### Putting it all together:

Given the constraints, let's place the items:

1. **British (1)**: Rat (2) is on the right.
2. **Turkish (2)**: Chess (1 or 2).
3. **Mexican (3)**: Spy movies (2).

From Clue 9, water and cola cannot be in positions 1 and 3. Let's assume:
- Water (1)
- Cola (3)

From Clue 8, mango and sprite cannot be in separate positions 1 and 3. Let's assume:
- Mango (1)
- Sprite (2)

From Clue 1, family movies (1) and pumpkin (2).

From Clue 3 & 4, board-games (1) and frog (2).

From Clue 5, chess (2).

From Clue 6, guinea-pig (1) and rat (2).

From Clue 2, spy movies (2) and pepper (3).

### Final Table:

```
|               |      1      |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      |     Water   |    Sprite |   Cola   |

#### 7. From clue 3: The person eating broccoli is somewhere to the left of the fan of hip-hop.
Since the person eating lime is in position 2, the person eating broccoli must be in position 1 (Rock-Climbing) or position 3 (Van). But since Rock-Climbing is Turkish and Van is Singing, the only possible position for the person eating broccoli is position 3.

#### 8. From clue 6: The person whose hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the fan of hip-hop.
Since the person eating broccoli is in position 3, the person whose hobby is gardening must be in position 1 or 2.
- Position 1 is occupied by Turkish (Rock-Climbing).
- Position 2 is unoccupied and could be gardening.
- Position 3 is occupied by the person who likes Broccoli.

So, the person whose hobby is gardening is in position 2.

#### 10. From clue 11: The architect is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
Since the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 2 (as the architect cannot be in position 2), the architect must be in position 3.

- The person drinking tea is between the person eating cucumber and the person watching zombie movies.
- Since the person who's sport is rowing is drinking tea, the person who's sport is rowing must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: Rowing -> Tea
```

#### Step 3: Use clue 1 to place the librarian
- The librarian is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is rowing.
- Since the person whose sport is rowing is in position 3, the librarian must be in position 1 or 2.

So, we have two possibilities for the librarian:
```
Position 1: Librarian
Position 2: ?
Position 3: Rowing -> Tea
```

or
```
Position 1: ?
Position 2: Librarian
Position 3: Rowing -> Tea
```

#### Step 4: Use clue 2 to place the person eating nectarine
- The person eating nectarine is somewhere to the right of the person watching zombie movies.
- Since the person drinking tea is between the person eating cucumber and the person watching zombie movies, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 1 or 2.

If the person watching zombie movies is in position 1:
```
Position 1: Watching zombie movies
Position 2: Eating cucumber
Position 3: Rowing -> Tea
```

Then the person eating nectarine must be in position 3, but that conflicts with the person drinking tea being in position 3. So, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2:
```
Position 1: Eating cucumber
Position 2: Watching zombie movies
Position 3: Rowing -> Tea
```

Thus, the person eating nectarine must be in position 3:
```
Position 1: Eating cucumber
Position 2: Watching zombie movies
Position 3: Rowing -> Tea
```

#### Step 5: Use clue 5 to place the person watching family movies
- The person watching family movies is on the left of the fan of ambient.
- Since the person watching zombie movies is in position 2, the person watching family movies must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
Position 1: Watching family movies
Position 2: Watching zombie movies
Position 3: Rowing -> Tea
```

#### Step 6: Use clue 5 again to place the fan of ambient
- The person watching family movies is on the left of the fan of ambient.
- Therefore, the fan of ambient must be in position 3.

This conflicts with the person drinking tea already being in position 3. Therefore, the person watching family movies must be in position 1, and the fan of ambient must be in position 2.

So, we have:
```
Position 1: Watching family movies
Position 2: Fan of ambient
Position 3: Rowing -> Tea
```

#### Step 7: Use clue 6 to place the architect
- The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the architect.
- Since the person eating cucumber is in position 1, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 2 or 3.

Since the person eating cucumber is in position 1, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the person in position 2 is the fan of ambient, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
Position 1: Watching family movies
Position 2: Fan of ambient
Position 3: Eating pomegranate -> Rowing -> Tea
```

#### Step 8: Use clue 4 to place the person drinking mirinda
- The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
- Since the person who's sport is rowing is drinking tea, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 1 or 2.

Since the person in position 1 is watching family movies, the person in position 2 is the fan of ambient, and the person in position 3 is eating pomegranate, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
Position 1: Biathlon
Position 2: Fan of ambient
Position 3: Eating pomegranate -> Rowing -> Tea
```

Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2:
```
Position 1: Biathlon
Position 2: Drinking mirinda
Position 3: Eating pomegranate -> Rowing -> Tea
```

#### Step 9: Place the remaining people
- The person eating cucumber is in position 1.
- The person watching zombie movies is in position 2.
- The person drinking tea is in position 3.
- The person eating pomegranate is in position 3.
- The person drinking mirinda is in position 2.
- The person watching family movies is in position 1.
- The person who's sport is rowing is in position 3.

Finally, we have:
```
Position 1: Eating cucumber
Position 2: Drinking mirinda
Position 3: Eating pomegranate -> Rowing -> Tea
```

#### 1. Clue 4: The person watching western movies is the American.
This means:
- **American** -> **Western**

#### 2. Clue 7: The person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the American.
Since the American has the hobby ""traveling,"" and it must be in position 3 (since there are only three positions):

Lv5-6x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each element based on the given clues. Let's break down the information step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Sport Clues**:
   - Water-polo (3) is on the right of ice-hockey.
   - Ice-hockey is on the left of water-polo.

2. **Transport Clues**:
   - Car (1) is on the right of skateboard (3).
   - The person driving the car is on the left of the social worker.

3. **Beverage and Food Clues**:
   - The journalist is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
   - The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the journalist.
   - The person eating apple is on the left of the person eating zucchini.
   - The person who owns the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
   - The person eating mango is on the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.

4. **Putting it Together**:
   - We know that the sport sequence must be: Ice-hockey (2), Water-polo (3).
   - The transport sequence must be: Skateboard (3), Car (1), Social-worker (2).

Now let's fill in the table step-by-step:

|             |      1      |     2      |       3       |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Beverage    |             |            |               |
| Food        |             |            |               |
| Job         |             |            |               |
| Pet         |             |            | Turtle (3)    |
| Sport       | Ice-hockey  | Water-polo | -             |
| Transport   | Skateboard  | Car        | Social-worker |

Next, let's consider the beverage and food clues:

- The journalist is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
- The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the journalist.
- The person eating apple is on the left of the person eating zucchini.
- The person who owns the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
- The person eating mango is on the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.

Given the transport and sport sequences, we can deduce the following:

1. The journalist cannot be in position 3 because the person drinking water is to their right.
2. The person drinking water cannot be in position 3 either since the journalist is to their left.
3. The person drinking cola must be in position 2 because the journalist is to their right, and the person drinking water is to the right of the journalist.

So, we have:

|             |      1      |     2      |       3       |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Beverage    | Cola        | Water      |               |
| Food        |             |            |               |

| Pet         |             |            | Turtle (3)    |
| Sport       | Ice-hockey  | Water-polo | -             |
| Transport   | Skateboard  | Car        | Social-worker |

Now, let's place the food and job:

- The person eating apple is on the left of the person eating zucchini.
- The person who owns the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
- The person eating mango is on the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.

Since the person whose sport is ice-hockey is in position 2, the person eating mango must be in position 3. This leaves positions 1 and 2 for apple and zucchini, with apple on the left of zucchini.

Thus, we have:

|             |      1      |     2      |       3       |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Beverage    | Cola        | Water      |               |
| Food        | Apple       | Zucchini   |               |
| Job         | Firefighter | Journalist | Social-worker |
| Pet         |             |            | Turtle (3)    |
| Sport       | Ice-hockey  | Water-polo | -             |
| Transport   | Skateboard  | Car        | Social-worker |

Finally, we need to place the pets and jobs:

- The person who owns the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
- The person drinking 7up must be in position 1, and the person owning the rabbit must be in position 2.

Thus, the final solution is:

|             |      1      |     2      |       3       |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Beverage    | 7up         | Water      |               |

Lv5-6x3-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will systematically analyze each clue and place the information into the given table.

Let's start with the clues:

1. The owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
2. The security-guard is between the person driving the roller and the person driving the tram.
3. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
4. The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike.
5. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta.
6. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person eating garlic.
7. The journalist is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram.
8. The owner of the mouse is in an odd position.
9. The person eating carrot is on the far left.
10. The owner of the rat is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
11. The person eating carrot is on the far left or far right.
12. The person eating carrot is on the far left.

From clues 9 and 10, we can determine that the person eating carrot is in position 1 (the far left).

From clue 6, the owner of the mouse must be in position 1 because it's in an odd position and the person eating carrot is already there. Therefore, the person eating garlic must be in position 3.

From clue 7, the owner of the mouse (position 1) is on the left of the person eating garlic (position 3). This is consistent.

From clue 11, since the person eating carrot is on the far left, they are not on the far right. Therefore, the person eating carrot is in position 1, and the person drinking fanta must be in position 3.

From clue 3, the security-guard is between the person driving the roller and the person driving the tram. Given the positions, the security-guard must be in position 2.

From clue 2, the owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the security-guard is in position 2, the person whose sport is volleyball must be in position 3, and the owner of the rat must be in position 1. This is consistent with the previous placement.

From clue 4, the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 3, the person drinking cola must be in position 3 and the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1. However, position 1 is already occupied by the person eating carrot, so the person drinking cola must be in position 3 and the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2.

From clue 12, the person eating carrot is on the far left, and the person whose sport is badminton must be on the right of the owner of the rat. Therefore, the person whose sport is badminton must be in position 3, which is consistent with the previous placements.

Now, let's place all the information into the table:

```
|             |       1       |       2        |     3      |
