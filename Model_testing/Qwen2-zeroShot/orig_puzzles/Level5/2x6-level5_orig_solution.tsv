10. The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
11. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.

#### Initial Setup:
Let's start by placing some definite information from the clues.

**Clue 7**: The person watching disaster movies is the person drinking fanta.
- This means fanta is the beverage for the disaster movie genre.

**Clue 4**: The person watching crime movies is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person watching disaster movies.
- Since fanta is for disaster movies, the person drinking soy-milk must be to the left of the person watching crime movies, and the person watching crime movies must be to the left of the person drinking fanta.

**Clue 10**: The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
- This means the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in position 6 (the last position).

**Clue 9**: The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching crime movies.
- This confirms that the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person watching crime movies, which is to the left of the person drinking fanta.

**Clue 11**: The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.
- This means the person watching superhero movies cannot be in position 6, and the person watching zombie movies cannot be in position 1.

**Clue 5**: The person watching western movies is the person drinking iced-tea.
- This means iced-tea is for the western movie genre.

**Clue 6**: The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
- This means iced-tea is not in position 6.

**Clue 3**: The person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta.
- This means tea cannot be in position 1 or 2.

**Clue 2**: The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta.
- This means coffee cannot be in position 6.

**Clue 1**: The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
- This means soy-milk is to the left of coffee.

**Clue 8**: The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
- This means iced-tea is not in position 6.

#### Placement:
From the above analysis, we can start placing the beverages and movie genres:

1. **Soy-milk** must be in position 1 because it needs to be to the left of both coffee and the person watching crime movies.
2. **Coffee** must be in position 3 because it needs to be to the right of soy-milk and to the left of fanta.
3. **Fanta** must be in position 4 because it is the drink for disaster movies and is to the right of coffee.
4. **Tea** must be in position 5 because it needs to be to the right of fanta.
5. **Mirinda** must be in position 2 because it is to the right of iced-tea and to the left of coffee.
6. **Iced-tea** must be in position 6 because it is the drink for western movies and is to the left of mirinda.

Now, let's assign the movie genres based on the positions:

1. **Soy-milk** -> Crime
2. **Mirinda** -> Superhero
3. **Coffee** -> Zombie
4. **Fanta** -> Disaster
5. **Tea** -> Epic
6. **Iced-tea** -> Western

### Final Solution Table:

16. The woodworking player is to the left of the lacrosse player.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 13**: The biathlon player is the video-games player.
   - Video-games player = Biathlon.

2. **Clue 15**: The biathlon player is to the left of the lacrosse player.
   - Biathlon (video-games) is to the left of Lacrosse.

3. **Clue 11**: The biathlon player is next to the skiing player.
   - Biathlon (video-games) is next to Skiing.

4. **Clue 12**: The rugby player is to the right of the skiing player.
   - Skiing is to the left of Rugby.

5. **Clue 5**: The rugby player is to the right of the woodworking player.
   - Woodworking is to the left of Rugby.

6. **Clue 16**: The woodworking player is to the left of the lacrosse player.
   - Woodworking is to the left of Lacrosse.

7. **Clue 10**: The hiking player is next to the lacrosse player.
   - Hiking is either to the left or right of Lacrosse.

8. **Clue 6**: The hiking player is to the right of the lacrosse player.
   - Hiking is to the right of Lacrosse.

9. **Clue 4**: The filmmaking player is to the left of the tennis player.
   - Filmmaking is to the left of Tennis.

10. **Clue 7**: The filmmaking player and the rugby player are the same.
    - Filmmaking = Rugby.

    - Filmmaking is next to Skateboarding.

12. **Clue 2**: The chess player is to the left of the collecting player.
    - Chess is to the left of Collecting.

13. **Clue 8**: The collecting player is in an odd position.
    - Collecting is in positions 1, 3, or 5.

14. **Clue 14**: The chess player is next to the collecting player.
    - Chess is next to Collecting.

Now let's place the players based on these constraints:

- Since Collecting is in an odd position and Chess is next to it, we can place:
  - Collecting in position 1, then Chess in position 2.
  - Collecting in position 3, then Chess in position 4.
  - Collecting in position 5, then Chess in position 6.

- Since Filmmaking = Rugby and Filmmaking is to the left of Tennis, we need to place:
  - Filmmaking in position 2, then Rugby in position 3.
  - Filmmaking in position 4, then Rugby in position 5.
  - Filmmaking in position 6, which contradicts Tennis being to the right.

- Since Woodworking is to the left of Lacrosse, and Hiking is to the right of Lacrosse, we need to place:
  - Woodworking in position 1, then Lacrosse in position 2, and Hiking in position 3.
  - Woodworking in position 3, then Lacrosse in position 4, and Hiking in position 5.
  - Woodworking in position 5, then Lacrosse in position 6, and Hiking in position 7 (not possible as there are only 6 positions).

Thus, the only feasible arrangement is:
- Position 1: Woodworking
- Position 2: Lacrosse
- Position 3: Hiking
- Position 4: Filmmaking (Rugby)
- Position 5: Tennis
- Position 6: Chess (Collecting)

Lv5-2x6-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given constraints:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Constraint 3:** The person drinking soy-milk is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
2. **Constraint 5:** The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
3. **Constraint 6:** The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep.
4. **Constraint 7:** The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the fan of metal.
5. **Constraint 9:** The fan of r&b is between the person drinking soy-milk and the fan of trance.

### Analyzing Constraints:

- From Constraint 3, the possible positions for soy-milk are 1, 3, or 5.
- From Constraint 5, if soy-milk is at 1, then iced-tea must be at 2, 4, or 6.
- From Constraint 6, the fan of dubstep must be to the left of iced-tea.
- From Constraint 7, the fan of metal must be at 1 or 6.
- From Constraint 9, r&b must be between soy-milk and trance.

### Possible Positions:

- Let's assume soy-milk is at position 1:
  - Iced-tea can be at 2, 4, or 6.
  - Dubstep must be to the left of iced-tea.
  - Metal must be at 6.
  - R&b must be between soy-milk and trance.

If soy-milk is at 1:
- Iced-tea can be at 2, 4, or 6.
- If iced-tea is at 2, dubstep can be at 1 (already taken) or 3, but that would place trance at 4, which doesn't fit r&b being between soy-milk and trance.
- If iced-tea is at 4, dubstep can be at 3, and trance can be at 5, with r&b at 2.
- If iced-tea is at 6, dubstep can be at 3 or 4, but that doesn't fit r&b being between soy-milk and trance.

So, let's try soy-milk at 1, iced-tea at 4, dubstep at 3, trance at 5, and r&b at 2.

- This fits all constraints so far.

### Final Table:

|               |    1     |      2      |   3    |    4     |    5    |    6     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | lemonade    | dubstep| fanta    | r&b     | trance   |
| Music-Genre   |          |             |        |          |         |          |

Now we need to fill in the beverages:

- From Constraint 4, the fan of soul is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
- From Constraint 10, the fan of soul is on the right of the person drinking milk.
- From Constraint 8, the fan of trance is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.
- From Constraint 1, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.

Since we have r&b at 2, the only beverage left for 2 is almond-milk.

- Fan of soul must be at 5 (since it's to the right of milk and left of fanta).

### Final Table:

|               |    1     |      2      |   3    |    4     |    5    |    6     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | almond-milk | dubstep| fanta    | lemonade| trance   |
| Music-Genre   |          |             |        |          |         |          |

- Fan of soul at 5, fan of metal at 6.

### Final Solution:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |   3    |    4     |    5    |    6     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | almond-milk | dubstep| fanta    | lemonade| trance   |
| Music-Genre   |          |             |        |          |         |          |

### Placing Items Based on Clues:

1. **Clue 4**: The person eating avocado is the person drinking 7up.
   - \( \text{Avocado} = 7up \)

2. **Clue 5**: The person eating radish is on the far left or far right.
   - \( \text{Radish} = 1 \) or \( \text{Radish} = 6 \)

3. **Clue 8 & 6**: The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea.
   - \( \text{Cola} < \text{Tea} \)

4. **Clue 11**: The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position.

    - \( \text{Zucchini} < \text{Garlic} \)

12. **Clue 12**: The person eating apricot is on the right of the person eating garlic.
    - \( \text{Apricot} > \text{Garlic} \)

### Final Placement:

Let's start with the positions:

- **Radish** must be at either position 1 or 6.
- **Hot-Chocolate** must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

Since **Radish** cannot be at position 3 (as it would conflict with other placements), let's try **Radish = 1**.

- **Hot-Chocolate = 3** (since it’s an odd position and not 1 or 5).

Now, let's place the rest:

- **7up (Avocado)**: Since **Avocado** is the person drinking 7up, and it needs to be to the left of **Fanta**, and considering the other constraints, let's place it at position 2.

- **Cola**: It needs to be to the left of **Tea** and to the left of **Fanta**. Let's place it at position 4.

- **Pear**: It needs to be to the right of **Cola** and to the left of **Iced-Tea**. Let's place it at position 5.

- **Fanta**: It needs to be to the right of **Cola** and **Avocado**. Let's place it at position 6.

- **Tea**: It needs to be to the right of **Pear** and **Fanta**. Since **Hot-Chocolate** is at 3, and it needs to be to the right of **Tea**, let's place it at position 2.

- **Zucchini** and **Garlic**: They need to be adjacent and **Zucchini** needs to be to the left of **Garlic**. Since **Apricot** needs to be to the right of **Garlic**, let's place them at positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Lv5-2x6-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step and place the information into the table.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Person Watching Mystery Movies (6) is the Person Whose Sport is Soccer**:
   - Mystery -> Soccer (6)

2. **Person Watching Musical Movies is on the Far Left or Far Right**:
   - Musical -> 1 or 6

3. **Person Watching Time-Travel Movies is Somewhere to the Left of the Person Whose Sport is Skiing**:
   - Time-Travel -> Skiing (5)

4. **Person Whose Sport is Badminton is on the Left of the Person Watching Time-Travel Movies**:
   - Badminton -> Time-Travel (not 5, but somewhere to the left of 5)

5. **Person Whose Sport is Skiing is in an Odd Position**:
   - Skiing -> 1, 3, or 5

6. **Person Watching Zombie Movies is on the Right of the Person Watching Action Movies**:
   - Zombie -> Action + 1

7. **Person Watching Zombie Movies is Somewhere to the Left of the Person Watching Time-Travel Movies**:
   - Zombie -> < Time-Travel

8. **Person Watching Time-Travel Movies is on the Left or Right of the Person Watching Zombie Movies**:
   - Time-Travel -> < Zombie or > Zombie

9. **Person Who's Sport is Ice-Hockey is the Person Watching Musical Movies**:
   - Ice-Hockey -> Musical (1 or 6)

10. **Person Watching Action Movies is in an Even Position**:
    - Action -> 2, 4, or 6

11. **Person Whose Sport is Badminton is Somewhere to the Left of the Person Watching Musical Movies**:
    - Badminton -> < Musical (1 or 6)

### Analyzing Positions and Sports:

- From points 1, 2, and 6, we know:
  - Mystery -> Soccer (6)
  - Musical -> 1 or 6
  - Zombie -> Action + 1

- From point 5:
  - Skiing -> 1, 3, or 5

- From point 3 and 4:
  - Time-Travel -> Skiing (5), so Time-Travel must be in 5.
  - Badminton -> < Time-Travel (so Badminton must be in 1, 2, or 3).

- From point 10:
  - Ice-Hockey -> Musical (1 or 6)

- From point 11:
  - Action -> 2, 4, or 6 (but 6 is already occupied by Soccer, so Action must be 2 or 4).

- From point 7 and 8:
  - Zombie -> < Time-Travel (so Zombie must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4).
  - Time-Travel -> > Zombie (so Zombie cannot be 5 or 6).

- From point 9:
  - Time-Travel -> < Zombie or > Zombie (conflict resolved with previous constraints).

### Placing the Values:

1. **Skiing is in an odd position**:
   - Let's assume Skiing = 3 for now (other options 1 and 5 would conflict).

2. **Time-Travel = 5**:
   - This fits with Skiing = 3.

3. **Badminton -> < Time-Travel**:
   - So Badminton can be 1 or 2.

4. **Musical -> 1 or 6**:
   - If Musical = 1, then Action = 2 (even position).
   - If Musical = 6, then Action = 4 (even position).

5. **Zombie -> Action + 1**:
   - If Action = 2, then Zombie = 3 (conflicts with Skiing = 3).
   - If Action = 4, then Zombie = 5 (conflicts with Time-Travel = 5).

6. **Ice-Hockey -> Musical**:
   - If Musical = 1, then Ice-Hockey = 1 (conflict).
   - If Musical = 6, then Ice-Hockey = 6 (conflict).

So, let's try another arrangement:

- **Skiing = 1**
- **Time-Travel = 3**
- **Badminton = 2**
- **Musical = 6**
- **Action = 4**
- **Zombie = 5**

This fits all the constraints:

- Mystery -> Soccer (6)
- Musical -> 6
- Time-Travel -> 3
- Badminton -> 2
- Skiing -> 1
- Action -> 4
- Zombie -> 5

Lv5-2x6-6	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the Colombian.
2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the far right (Position 6).
3. The Chinese is on the left or right of the Colombian.
4. The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
5. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket.
6. The person who's sport is rowing is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
7. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the Mexican.
8. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby.
9. The Chinese is somewhere to the left of the Polish.
10. The Colombian is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rowing.
11. The person who's sport is rugby is the American.
12. The person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Skateboarding and Colombian**: 
   - Position 1 or 2 for the Colombian with skateboarding.

2. **Weightlifting**:
   - Position 6 for weightlifting.

3. **Chinese and Colombian**:
   - Chinese must be next to the Colombian because they can only be on the left or right.

4. **Cricket and Swimming**:
   - Cricket must be to the left of swimming, and both must be next to each other.

5. **Rowing**:
   - Rowing is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

6. **Swimming and Mexican**:
   - Swimming is on the right of the Mexican.

7. **Rugby and American**:
   - Rugby is the American and is to the right of swimming.

8. **Skateboarding and Rugby**:
   - Skateboarding is next to rugby.

Given these constraints, let's place the elements step-by-step:

- Since the Colombian has skateboarding and is at Position 1 or 2, and the American has rugby, we need to place them accordingly.
- Since the American (rugby) is to the right of swimming, and the Colombian (skateboarding) is next to the person with rugby, the Colombian cannot be at Position 2 (because then the American would have to be at Position 3, but that would not fit with the odd position for rowing).

So, the Colombian must be at Position 1:
- Position 1: Colombian (skateboarding)
- Position 6: Weightlifting (given)

Now, the American must be at Position 5 (since it’s the only odd position left):
- Position 5: American (rugby)

Since the American is at Position 5, the Colombian must be at Position 1, and the person with rugby is to the right of swimming, the person with swimming must be at Position 4:
- Position 4: Swimming

Since the person with swimming is on the right of the Mexican, the Mexican must be at Position 3:
- Position 3: Mexican

Now, the person with cricket must be to the left of the person with swimming, so the person with cricket must be at Position 2:
- Position 2: Cricket

Finally, the person with rowing must be at Position 3 (since it’s the only odd position left):
- Position 3: Rowing

And the Chinese must be to the left of the Polish, so the Chinese must be at Position 2 and the Polish at Position 4:
- Position 2: Chinese
- Position 4: Polish

Lv5-2x6-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

### Clue Analysis:

1. **Clue 9:** The person watching martial-arts movies is the Indonesian.
   - This means the Indonesian watches martial-arts.

2. **Clue 10:** The Turkish is on the right of the Indonesian.
   - This means the Indonesian is in position 1 and the Turkish is in position 2.

3. **Clue 6:** The person watching martial-arts movies (Indonesian) is on the right of the Canadian.
   - Since the Indonesian is in position 1, the Canadian must be in position 3.

4. **Clue 1:** The German is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.
   - Let's denote the person watching action movies as \(A\). The German cannot be in positions 1 or 2 because the Indonesian and the Canadian are there. So, \(A\) can only be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6. The German will be to the right of \(A\).

5. **Clue 3:** The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the Indonesian.
   - Since the Indonesian is in position 1, the person watching action movies (\(A\)) can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the Indonesian is already in position 1, \(A\) can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Also, the German will be to the right of \(A\).

6. **Clue 2:** The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies.

   - Let’s denote the person watching scientific movies as \(S\) and the person watching epic movies as \(E\). \(S\) is to the left of \(E\).

10. **Clue 8:** The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the Indonesian.
    - Since the Indonesian is in position 1, \(S\) can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the Indonesian is in position 1, \(S\) can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

11. **Clue 11:** The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the right of the Nigerian.
    - Since the Nigerian can be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6, \(S\) must be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

12. **Clue 12:** The person watching horror movies is on the left of the Nigerian.
    - Since the Nigerian can be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6, \(H\) must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

13. **Clue 13:** The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.
    - Since the Indonesian is in position 1 and the person watching martial-arts movies is the Indonesian, \(S\) can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. And the person watching martial-arts movies can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Lv5-2x6-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the sports and beverages accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is cricket is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The person drinking tea is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's sport is climbing is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is golf is between the person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's sport is sailing.
8. **Clue 8:** The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
9. **Clue 9:** The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cricket.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who's sport is cricket is between the person who's sport is climbing and the person who's sport is sailing.
11. **Clue 11:** The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
12. **Clue 13:** The person who's sport is climbing is somewhere to the right of the person drinking tea.
14. **Clue 14:** The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket.
15. **Clue 15:** The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.

### Initial Placement Based on Clues:

1. **Clue 2:** Tea is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Let's start with position 3 for now.
2. **Clue 13:** Climbing is somewhere to the right of tea. So, if tea is in position 3, climbing can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.
3. **Clue 12:** Climbing is also somewhere to the right of tea. So, if tea is in position 3, climbing can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.
4. **Clue 10:** Cricket is between climbing and sailing. So, if climbing is in position 4, cricket must be in position 5 and sailing in position 6. If climbing is in position 5, cricket must be in position 4 and sailing in position 6. If climbing is in position 6, cricket must be in position 4 or 5, but then there would be no room for sailing.

Let's assume:
- Tea in position 3
- Climbing in position 4
- Cricket in position 5
- Sailing in position 6

### Filling in the Beverages:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's sport is cricket (position 5) is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Soy-milk must be in position 4 or 6. Since climbing is in position 4, soy-milk must be in position 6.
2. **Clue 11:** The person drinking soy-milk (position 6) is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Volleyball must be in position 4 or 5. Since climbing is in position 4, volleyball must be in position 5.
3. **Clue 6:** The person who's sport is volleyball (position 5) is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Mirinda must be in position 4 or 6. Since climbing is in position 4, mirinda must be in position 6, but soy-milk is already in position 6. Therefore, mirinda must be in position 4.
4. **Clue 8:** The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Lemonade and juice must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since tea is in position 3, lemonade and juice must be in positions 1 and 2.
5. **Clue 9:** The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Cricket is in position 5, so lemonade must be in position 1 and juice in position 2.
6. **Clue 14:** The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. Cricket is in position 5, so almond-milk must be in position 4 or 6. But soy-milk is in position 6, so almond-milk must be in position 4.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's sport is golf is between the person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's sport is sailing. Golf must be in position 3, which is already occupied by tea.

|            |    1     |     2      |    3    |    4     |    5    |      6      |
| Beverage   | lemonade | juice      | tea     | almond-milk | cricket | soy-milk   |
| Sport      | golf     | swimming  | volleyball | climbing | sailing | mirinda   |

Lv5-2x6-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each nationality with their corresponding beverage based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The German is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda**.
2. **The person drinking coffee is on the right of the Brazilian**.
3. **The person drinking water is on the left of the Egyptian**.
4. **The Brazilian is on the left of the Argentine**.
5. **The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water**.
6. **The Argentine is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian**.
7. **The person drinking Mirinda is somewhere to the left of the Argentine**.
8. **The Colombian is in an even position**.
9. **The person drinking Mirinda is somewhere to the left of the Argentine** (redundant with clue 7).
10. **The person drinking Mirinda is somewhere to the right of the Colombian**.
11. **The Canadian is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Iced Tea**.
12. **The German is somewhere to the left of the Colombian**.
13. **The person drinking juice is the Colombian**.

Let's summarize and place the clues:

- **Clue 8**: The Colombian is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).
- **Clue 13**: The person drinking juice is the Colombian.
- **Clue 10**: The person drinking Mirinda is somewhere to the right of the Colombian.
- **Clue 7**: The person drinking Mirinda is somewhere to the left of the Argentine.
- **Clue 4**: The Brazilian is on the left of the Argentine.
- **Clue 6**: The Argentine is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian.
- **Clue 2**: The person drinking coffee is on the right of the Brazilian.
- **Clue 5**: The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
- **Clue 3**: The person drinking water is on the left of the Egyptian.
- **Clue 1**: The German is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda.
- **Clue 12**: The German is somewhere to the left of the Colombian.
- **Clue 11**: The Canadian is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Iced Tea.

Given these clues, let's place the Colombian first:
- Since the Colombian drinks juice and is in an even position, possible positions are 2, 4, or 6.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **Colombian (Juice)**: Place in position 2 (since placing in 4 or 6 would make it difficult to satisfy all other conditions).
2. **Mirinda**: Must be to the right of the Colombian (position 3 or 4 or 5). Since the Argentine must be to the right of the Mirinda, the only valid placement for Mirinda is in position 3.
3. **Argentine**: To the right of the Mirinda (position 4 or 5).
4. **Brazilian**: To the left of the Argentine (position 1 or 2). Since the Colombian is already in position 2, the Brazilian must be in position 1.
5. **German**: To the left of the Mirinda (position 1 or 2). Since the Brazilian is in position 1, the German must be in position 1 (but this conflicts with the Brazilian, so we need to adjust).
6. **Canadian**: To the left of the person drinking Iced Tea (position 1 or 2). Since the Brazilian is in position 1, the Canadian must be in position 1 (conflict again, so we need to re-evaluate).
7. **Re-evaluating positions**:
   - If Colombian is in position 4 (even), then Mirinda can be in position 5.
   - Argentine must be in position 6.
   - Brazilian must be in position 3.
   - German must be in position 2.
   - Canadian must be in position 1.
   - Iced Tea must be in position 5 (right of Canadian).

Thus, the final arrangement is:

|               |    1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |    5     |    6     |
