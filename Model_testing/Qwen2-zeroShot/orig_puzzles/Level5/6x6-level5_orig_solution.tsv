#### 2. Placing Items Based on Clues:
Let's start with the known positions and work through the constraints.

- **Person who's sport is rugby (peach) is in position 3** (Clue 33).
- **Person who's hobby is board-games (peach) is in position 4** (Clue 35).

Since both peach and board-games are in position 3 and 4 respectively, we can fill those positions:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |      4       |      5       |      6       |
| Food          |            |            |    peach   |    nectarine |              |              |
| Hobby         |            |            |    board-games |            |              |              |
| Job           |            |            |            |              |              |              |
| Music-Genre   |            |            |            |              |              |              |
| Sport         |            |            |    rugby   |              |              |              |
| Transport     |            |            |            |              |              |              |

- **Person driving the ship is the person who's sport is ice-hockey (position 6)** (Clue 3).
- **Person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person eating nectarine (Clue 11)**, so nectarine must be in position 2.
- **Person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the person driving the airplane (Clue 1)**, and also somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (Clue 27), and somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship (Clue 3). This means the person driving the boat is in position 1.
- **Person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the accountant (Clue 28)**, and also somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat (Clue 1). This means the person driving the airplane is in position 5.

Now, we can update the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |      4       |      5       |      6       |
| Food          |    cabbage  |    nectarine |    peach   |    nectarine |              |              |
| Hobby         |            |            |    board-games |            |              |              |

| Music-Genre   |            |            |            |              |              |              |
| Sport         |    badminton  |            |    rugby   |              |              |    ice-hockey  |

- **Person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person eating papaya (Clue 6)**, and the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the journalist (Clue 14). Since the journalist is to the right of the scientist (Clue 13), the scientist must be in position 1 or 2, and the journalist in position 3 or 4. Given that the person eating papaya is in position 2, the journalist must be in position 4, and the skydiver in position 3.

Now, we can update the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |      4       |      5       |      6       |

| Job           |            |            |            |              |              |              |
| Music-Genre   |            |            |            |              |              |              |
| Sport         |    badminton  |            |    rugby   |              |              |    ice-hockey  |
| Transport     |    boat     |            |            |              |    airplane  |              |

- **Person who's hobby is board-games is the person eating peach (Clue 35)**, which we already know, and the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 3, so the board-games person is in position 4.

Now, we can update the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |      4       |      5       |      6       |

| Hobby         |    board-games |            |    skydiving |              |              |              |
| Job           |            |            |            |              |              |              |
| Music-Genre   |            |            |            |              |              |              |

- **Person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the videographer (Clue 19)**, and the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 2 or 5.

Given that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 6, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 5, and the videographer in position 2.

Now, we can update the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |      4       |      5       |      6       |
