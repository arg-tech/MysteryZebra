Lv5-3x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Clues Breakdown:

1. **The fan of r&b is between the person watching action movies and the person who's hobby is hiking.**
2. **The fan of r&b is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).**
3. **The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.**
4. **The fan of blues is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies.**
5. **The person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk.**
6. **The fan of pop is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.**
7. **The person watching documentary movies is the fan of r&b.**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Positioning the Fan of R&B:
From clue 2, the fan of r&b must be in position 1 or 3.
From clue 7, the person watching documentary movies is the fan of r&b. Therefore, the fan of r&b must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
| Hobby         |      1       |    2     |      3      |    4    |
| Movie-Genre   |              |          |             |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |             |         |
```

#### Positioning the Person Watching Documentary Movies:
Since the fan of r&b (documentary) is in position 1, the person watching documentary movies is in position 1.

So, we update the table:
```
| Hobby         |  Drawing    |    2     |      3      |    4    |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary |          |             |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |             |         |
```

#### Positioning the Person Watching Action Movies:
From clue 1, the fan of r&b (documentary) is between the person watching action movies and the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the fan of r&b is in position 1, the person watching action movies must be in position 3 and the person with the hobby of hiking must be in position 2.

So, we update the table:
```
| Hobby         |  Drawing    |  Hiking   |      3      |    4    |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary |          |  Action    |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |             |         |
```

#### Positioning the Person Watching Disaster Movies:
From clue 3, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the person watching disaster movies must be to the left of the person with the hobby of drawing, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 2.

So, we update the table:
```
| Hobby         |  Drawing    |  Hiking   |      3      |    4    |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Disaster  |  Action    |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |             |         |
```

#### Positioning the Fan of Blues:
From clue 4, the fan of blues is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 2, the fan of blues can be in position 1 or 3. However, position 1 is already taken by the fan of r&b, so the fan of blues must be in position 3.

So, we update the table:
```
| Hobby         |  Drawing    |  Hiking   |  Blues     |    4    |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Disaster  |  Action    |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |             |         |
```

#### Positioning the Person with the Hobby of Singing:
From clue 5, the person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk. The only remaining positions for the fan of funk are position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is already taken by the fan of r&b and position 2 is taken by the person with the hobby of hiking, the fan of funk must be in position 4 and the person with the hobby of singing must be in position 3.

However, position 3 is already taken by the fan of blues. This means we need to re-evaluate the positions. Given that the person with the hobby of singing must be to the right of the fan of funk, and the fan of funk cannot be in position 3 (since it would conflict with the fan of blues), the fan of funk must be in position 2, and the person with the hobby of singing must be in position 3.

So, we update the table:
```
| Hobby         |  Drawing    |  Funk     |  Blues     |  Singing |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Disaster  |  Action    |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |             |         |
```

#### Positioning the Fan of Pop:
From clue 6, the fan of pop is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 2, the fan of pop must be in position 3 or 4. Since position 3 is already taken by the fan of blues, the fan of pop must be in position 4.

So, we update the table:
```
| Hobby         |  Drawing    |  Funk     |  Blues     |  Singing |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Disaster  |  Action    |  Pop     |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |             |         |
```

#### Positioning the Music Genres:
We need to assign the music genres such that all conditions are satisfied. From the given clues, we can infer the following:
- The person with the hobby of drawing (position 1) could be associated with any genre.
- The person with the hobby of hiking (position 2) could be associated with any genre.
- The person with the hobby of singing (position 4) could be associated with any genre.
- The person with the hobby of blues (position 3) could be associated with any genre.

Given that there are no further constraints, we can assign the remaining genres as follows:
- Blues: Funk (since it fits the pattern)
- Pop: R&B (since it fits the pattern)

So, the final table is:
```
| Hobby         |  Drawing    |  Funk     |  Blues     |  Singing |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Disaster  |  Action    |  Pop     |
| Music-Genre   | Blues       | Funk      | R&B        | Pop      |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
| Hobby         |  Drawing    |  Funk     |  Blues     |  Singing |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Disaster  |  Action    |  Pop     |
| Music-Genre   | Blues       | Funk      | R&B        | Pop      |

7. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the Fisherman.
8. The Designer is the person drinking 7up.
9. The Canadian is on the left of the Nigerian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Nigerian and the Teacher
From Clue 1 and Clue 9:
- The Nigerian is the teacher.
- The Canadian is on the left of the Nigerian.

So, we can place:
- **Canadian** in position 1.
- **Nigerian (Teacher)** in position 2.

|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      |  Canadian|             |           |           |
| Job           |         | Nigerian    |           |           |
| Nationality   |         |             |           |           |

#### Step 2: Positioning the Designer
From Clue 8:
- The Designer drinks 7up.

So, we can place:
- **Designer (drinks 7up)** in position 1.

|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      | Designer |             |           |           |
| Job           |         | Nigerian    |           |           |
| Nationality   |         |             |           |           |

#### Step 3: Positioning the Lemonade Drinker
From Clue 2:
- The person drinking lemonade is between the Malaysian and the Nigerian.

Since the Nigerian is in position 2, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3, and the Malaysian must be in position 4.

So, we can place:
- **Malaysian** in position 4.
- **Lemonade** in position 3.

|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      | Designer |             | Lemonade  | Malaysian |
| Job           |         | Nigerian    |           |           |
| Nationality   |         |             |           |           |

#### Step 4: Positioning the Engineer
From Clue 6:
- The Engineer is on the right of the Pakistani.

And from Clue 3:
- The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the engineer.

Since the person drinking lemonade is in position 3, the engineer must be in position 4.

So, we can place:
- **Engineer** in position 4.

|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      | Designer |             | Lemonade  | Engineer  |
| Job           |         | Nigerian    |           |           |
| Nationality   |         |             |           |           |

#### Step 5: Positioning the Fisherman
From Clue 4:
- The Nigerian is on the left of the Fisherman.

So, the Fisherman must be in position 3.

From Clue 5:
- The Fisherman is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

Since the Fisherman is in position 3, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1.

So, we can place:
- **Almond-milk** in position 1.

|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk|             | Lemonade  | Engineer  |
| Job           |         | Nigerian    | Fisherman |           |
| Nationality   |         |             |           |           |

#### Step 6: Positioning the Remaining Nationality and Job
From Clue 7:
- The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the Fisherman.

This is already satisfied as the Almond-milk is in position 1 and the Fisherman is in position 3.

From Clue 6:
- The Engineer is on the right of the Pakistani.

So, the Pakistani must be in position 2.

|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk|             | Lemonade  | Engineer  |
| Job           |         | Pakistani   | Fisherman |           |
| Nationality   |         |             |           |           |

Finally, the remaining nationality, Malaysian, must be in position 4.

|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk|             | Lemonade  | Malaysian |
| Job           |         | Pakistani   | Fisherman |           |
| Nationality   |         |             |           |           |

Thus, the final solution table is:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk|             | Lemonade  | Malaysian |
| Job           |         | Pakistani   | Fisherman |           |
| Nationality   |         |             |           |           |

Lv5-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.
2. **Clue 2**: The dancer is between the pilot and the photographer.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the left of the fan of reggae.
4. **Clue 4**: The fan of blues is on the left of the fan of country.
5. **Clue 5**: The fan of indie is somewhere to the left of the fisherman.
6. **Clue 6**: The fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
7. **Clue 7**: The fan of reggae is on the left of the pilot.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the photographer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Positioning the Hobbies
- From Clue 1, we know that ""filmmaking"" must be to the left of ""drawing"".
- From Clue 6, ""reggae"" must be to the left of ""filmmaking"".
- From Clue 7, ""reggae"" must also be to the left of ""pilot"".

Given these constraints, let's place ""reggae"" in position 1 or 2 (since it needs to be to the left of ""pilot"" and ""filmmaking"").

- If ""reggae"" is in position 1, then ""pilot"" can only be in position 3 or 4, and ""filmmaking"" must be in position 2 or 3.
- If ""reggae"" is in position 2, then ""pilot"" can only be in position 4, and ""filmmaking"" must be in position 3.

Let's try ""reggae"" in position 1:
- Reggae (1), Pilot (3 or 4), Filmmaking (2 or 3)

Since ""filmmaking"" must be to the right of ""photographer"" (Clue 8), and ""drawing"" must be to the right of ""filmmaking"" (Clue 1), we can place:
- Reggae (1), Pilot (3), Filmmaking (2), Drawing (4)

This fits all the clues so far.

#### Step 2: Positioning the Jobs
- From Clue 2, the dancer is between the pilot and the photographer.
- Given our current positions:
  - Pilot (3), Dancer (2), Photographer (4)
  
This fits Clue 2 perfectly.

#### Step 3: Positioning the Music Genres
- From Clue 4, the fan of blues is on the left of the fan of country.
- From Clue 5, the fan of indie is to the left of the fisherman.
- From Clue 3, the person with the hobby ""collecting"" is to the left of the fan of reggae (which is already in position 1).

So, we need to assign the music genres such that:
- Blues (leftmost)
- Indie (to the left of the fisherman)
- Reggae (already placed in 1)
- Country (rightmost)

Thus, the order for music genres would be:
- Blues (1)
- Indie (2)
- Reggae (1) [repeated, but since it's a hobby, it doesn't conflict]
- Country (4)

### Final Table:

| Hobby         | Collecting   | Filmmaking | Dancer     | Writing   |

Lv5-3x4-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into the table step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 7**: The French person is in an even position.
   - Possible positions: 2 or 4.

2. **Clue 2**: The Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the French.
   - If French is in position 2, then Brazilian must be in position 1.
   - If French is in position 4, then Brazilian must be in position 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 3**: The Paramedic is on the left or right of the German.
   - This means they can be adjacent or not adjacent but one of them must be next to the other.

4. **Clue 5**: The fan of Punk is somewhere to the left of the Electrician.
   - This means the Electrician cannot be in the first position if the fan of Punk is there.

5. **Clue 4**: The fan of Classical is on the right of the German.
   - This means the German cannot be in the last position (4).

6. **Clue 6**: The French is somewhere to the left of the fan of Rock.
   - This means the fan of Rock cannot be in position 1 or 2 if French is in position 2 or 4 respectively.

7. **Clue 8**: The fan of Punk is on the left or right of the fan of Disco.
   - This means the fans of Punk and Disco are either adjacent or not adjacent but one of them must be next to the other.

8. **Clue 9**: The Writer is on the right of the fan of Disco.
   - This means the fan of Disco cannot be in the last position (4) if the Writer is there.

Let's start placing the information:

- From Clue 7, French is in position 2 or 4.
- From Clue 2, if French is in position 2, Brazilian is in position 1.
- If French is in position 4, Brazilian can be in position 1 or 2.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: French in Position 2, Brazilian in Position 1
- Position 1: Brazilian
- Position 2: French
- German must be in position 3 or 4 because he is to the right of the Paramedic and Classical fan is to his right.
- If German is in position 3, Paramedic can be in position 1 or 2 (but Brazilian is already in 1).
- If German is in position 4, Paramedic can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let's try with German in position 4:
- Position 4: German
- Paramedic must be in position 3 (because Paramedic is to the left of German).
- Classical fan must be in position 5 (but only positions 1-4 exist).

This doesn't work, so let's try another configuration.

#### Scenario 2: French in Position 4, Brazilian in Position 1 or 2
- Position 1: Brazilian
- Position 4: French
- German must be in position 3 or 1 (because he is to the right of the Paramedic and Classical fan is to his right).

Let's try with German in position 3:
- Position 3: German
- Paramedic must be in position 2 (because Paramedic is to the left of German).
- Classical fan must be in position 4 (French is in 4, so it must be German).

This works so far. Now let's place the rest:

- Position 1: Brazilian
- Position 2: Paramedic
- Position 3: German
- Position 4: French

Now, let's place the jobs and music genres:

- Clue 5: Fan of Punk is to the left of the Electrician.
- Clue 4: Fan of Classical is to the right of the German (German has Classical).
- Clue 6: French is to the left of the fan of Rock (French in 4, so Rock must be in 5, but only 1-4 exist, so it must be in 3).
- Clue 8: Fan of Punk is to the left or right of the fan of Disco.
- Clue 9: Writer is to the right of the fan of Disco.

From these clues, we can deduce:

- Position 1: Brazilian (Electrician)
- Position 2: Paramedic (Punk)
- Position 3: German (Classical)
- Position 4: French (Rock)

Finally, placing the jobs and music genres:

|               |     1     |     2     |   3    |      4      |
| Job           | Electrician | Paramedic | Pilot  | Writer     |
| Music-Genre   | Punk        | Disco     | Classical | Rock      |
| Nationality   | Brazilian  | British   | German | French     |

Lv5-3x4-5	"Let's break down and solve the puzzle step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The fan of dubstep is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies.**
   - This means if someone prefers dubstep, they must be to the left of someone who prefers fantasy movies.

2. **The coach is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.**
   - The coach cannot be in position 4 (rightmost), as there must be someone to their right.

3. **The person watching epic movies is on the far right.**
   - Position 4 is occupied by the person who watches epic movies.
   
4. **The musician is the person watching epic movies.**
   - Therefore, the musician is in position 4.

5. **The photographer is on the right of the fan of dubstep.**
   - Since the fan of dubstep is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies, and the photographer is to the right of the fan of dubstep, the photographer cannot be in position 4 (since that would make the fan of dubstep in position 3, leaving no room for the photographer).

6. **The fan of d&b is the person watching crime movies.**
   - This means the person in position 1 or 2 is the fan of d&b and watches crime movies.

7. **The photographer is somewhere to the right of the fan of d&b.**
   - Given the above points, the fan of d&b must be in position 1 or 2, and the photographer must be in position 2 or 3.

8. **The fan of gospel is on the right of the coach.**
   - This means the coach is to the left of the fan of gospel.

### Combining all the clues:

- Position 4 is the musician watching epic movies.
- The fan of d&b is in position 1 or 2, and the photographer is in position 2 or 3.
- The fan of dubstep is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
- The coach is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
- The fan of gospel is to the right of the coach.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the elements:

- Position 4: Musician (watching epic movies)
- Position 3: Fan of dubstep (left of the person watching fantasy movies)
- Position 2: Fan of d&b (watching crime movies) and photographer (to the right of the fan of d&b)
- Position 1: Coach (to the left of the fan of gospel)

So, the arrangement could be:
- Position 1: Coach
- Position 2: Fan of d&b (watching crime movies)
- Position 3: Fan of dubstep (left of the person watching fantasy movies)
- Position 4: Musician (watching epic movies)

The fan of gospel must be in position 2 or 3, but since the photographer is to the right of the fan of d&b and the fan of dubstep is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies, the fan of gospel must be in position 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- Position 1: Coach
- Position 2: Fan of d&b (watching crime movies)
- Position 3: Fan of gospel (to the right of the coach)
- Position 4: Musician (watching epic movies)

### Final Solution Table:

```
|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |    4     |
| Job           |  Coach   |  Fan of d&b |  Fan of gospel | Musician |

- **Position 2 (Chinchilla):** Sport must not be volleyball or climbing.
- **Position 3 (Turtle):** Sport must be volleyball.
- **Position 4 (Volleyball):** Sport must be volleyball.

From clue 3, the owner of the fish is to the right of volleyball, so they must be in position 4 (but volleyball is already there), so the fish owner must be in position 4.

From clue 6, the Indonesian cannot be in position 1 or 4, so they must be in position 2 or 3.

From clue 7, the Indonesian cannot be in position 1 or 2, so they must be in position 3.

From clue 8, the Italian cannot be in position 3 or 4, so they must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 9, the owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the Italian, so the Italian must be in position 1.

From clue 10, the Indonesian is to the right of the owner of the chinchilla, so the Indonesian must be in position 3.

Now we have:

8. **Clue 8:** The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies.
9. **Clue 9:** The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the fan of funk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Apply Clue 7
- **Soy-milk** is associated with **Folk** music.
  - |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
  - | Music-Genre | Folk | | | |
  - | Beverage | | | Soy-milk | |

#### Step 2: Apply Clue 4
- The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
  - Possible arrangements for 3 and 4 could be (hot-chocolate, fanta) or (fanta, hot-chocolate).

#### Step 3: Apply Clue 9
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the fan of funk.
  - If hot-chocolate is in position 3, then funk can be in 2 or 4.
  - If hot-chocolate is in position 4, then funk can be in 2 or 3.

#### Step 4: Apply Clue 1
- The fan of funk is on the left or right of the fan of ambient.
  - If funk is in 2, ambient must be in 1 or 3.
  - If funk is in 3, ambient must be in 1 or 2.
  - If funk is in 4, ambient must be in 1, 2, or 3.

#### Step 5: Apply Clue 2
- The person watching musical movies is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking fanta.
  - Since soy-milk is in 4, and fanta is on the right of hot-chocolate, the only possible arrangement for 2 and 3 is (hot-chocolate, musical).
  - Thus, fanta must be in 4, and hot-chocolate must be in 3.

#### Step 6: Apply Clue 5
- The person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of funk.
  - Since musical is in 3, funk must be in 4.

#### Step 7: Apply Clue 3
- The person watching romance movies is on the left of the fan of pop.
  - Since funk is in 4, and the fan of funk is on the right of the fan of ambient, ambient must be in 1 or 2.
  - Romance must be in 1 or 2, and pop must be in 3 or 4. Since 3 is taken by musical and 4 by funk, pop must be in 2 and romance in 1.

#### Step 8: Apply Clue 6
- The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies.
  - Since 1 and 2 are already taken by romance and ambient, comedy must be in 1 and animation in 2.

#### Step 9: Apply Clue 8
- The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies.
  - Since romance is in 1, 7up must be in 2.

Lv5-3x4-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Dancer is on the left of the pilot**:
   - This means Dancer and Pilot must be in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (since there are only 4 positions).

2. **Person driving the skateboard is the dancer**:
   - This means the Dancer is in position 1 and the Skateboard is in position 1.

3. **Person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person driving the motorbike**:
   - This means Helicopter must be in position 1 or 2, and Motorbike must be in position 2 or 3.

4. **Pilot is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola**:
   - This means the Pilot cannot be in position 1 or 2 if the cola drinker is in position 1 or 2.

5. **Pilot is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade**:
   - This means the Pilot can be next to the Lemonade drinker or not directly adjacent.

6. **Person drinking coffee is between the designer and the person driving the skateboard**:
   - Since the skateboard is driven by the Dancer (position 1), the Coffee drinker must be in position 2 or 3, and the Designer must be in position 3 or 4.

7. **Person driving the van is in an even position**:
   - This means the Van can only be in position 2 or 4.

8. **Person driving the helicopter is the designer**:
   - This means the Designer is in position 2 and the Helicopter is in position 1.

9. **Social-worker is on the far right**:
   - This means the Social-worker is in position 4.

### Putting it all together:

From the above points, we can deduce the following:

- **Position 1**: Dancer (driving skateboard)
- **Position 2**: Designer (driving helicopter)
- **Position 3**: Coffee drinker
- **Position 4**: Social-worker

Now let's place the remaining details:

- From point 4, the Pilot must be in position 3 or 4, but since the Social-worker is in position 4, the Pilot must be in position 3.
- From point 5, the person drinking cola must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Dancer is in position 1, the Cola drinker must be in position 2.
- From point 6, the Coffee drinker must be in position 3 (between the Designer and the Dancer).

So, the final arrangement is:

- **Position 1**: Dancer (driving skateboard, drinking cola)
- **Position 2**: Designer (driving helicopter, drinking coffee)
- **Position 3**: Pilot (drinking lemonade)
- **Position 4**: Social-worker (drinking juice)

### Final Table:

Lv5-3x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze and arrange the information step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Position Constraints:**
   - From clue 8: The person driving the helicopter is on the far left or far right.
   - From clue 9: The writer is in an even position (2 or 4).
   - From clue 10: The person eating artichoke is on the far left or far right.

2. **Job and Transport Assignments:**
   - From clue 2: The entrepreneur is the person driving the snowmobile.
   - From clue 7: The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the security-guard. Therefore, the security-guard cannot be in position 4.
   - From clue 1: The person driving the ship is somewhere to the left of the security-guard. Therefore, the security-guard cannot be in position 1.
   - From clue 3: The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship.
   - From clue 4: The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes.
   - From clue 5: The person eating grapefruit is in an odd position (1 or 3).
   - From clue 6: The person eating grapes is on the left of the writer.

### Arranging the Positions:

Let's start by placing the known elements:

- **Position 1:** The person driving the helicopter (clue 8). This can either be the writer or the person eating artichoke.
- **Position 2:** The writer (clue 9) must be here because it's an even position.
- **Position 4:** The security-guard (clue 1 and 7).

Given these constraints, we can deduce:
- Position 1: The person driving the helicopter (must be the writer or the person eating artichoke).
- Position 2: The writer.
- Position 4: The security-guard.

Since the person driving the helicopter is on the far left or far right (clue 8), and the writer is in position 2 (clue 9), the person driving the helicopter must be in position 1 (far left).

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

- **Position 3:** The person driving the ship (clue 1 and 3). Since the person driving the ship is somewhere to the left of the security-guard (clue 1), and the security-guard is in position 4, the ship must be driven by someone in position 3.
- **Position 1:** The writer (since the person driving the helicopter must be in position 1 and the writer is in position 2).
- **Position 4:** The security-guard.

We now have:
- Position 1: Writer (driving the helicopter)
- Position 2: Security-guard (not driving any vehicle, but eating something)
- Position 3: Person driving the ship (not the writer or security-guard)
- Position 4: Security-guard (driving the ship)

Next, let's assign the remaining jobs and foods:

- **Job Assignments:**
  - The entrepreneur is driving the snowmobile (clue 2), so they are not in positions 1, 2, or 4. They must be in position 3.
  - The security-guard is not driving any vehicle, so they are not the entrepreneur, fisherman, or writer. They must be the fisherman.
  - The writer is in position 1 and driving the helicopter, so they are the writer.
  - The person in position 3 (entrepreneur) is driving the snowmobile, so they are the entrepreneur.
  - The person in position 4 (security-guard) is the fisherman.

- **Food Assignments:**
  - Clue 6: The person eating grapes is on the left of the writer. The writer is in position 1, so the person eating grapes must be in position 2.
  - Clue 5: The person eating grapefruit is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since position 1 is taken by the writer, the person eating grapefruit must be in position 3.
  - Clue 4: The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes. The person eating grapes is in position 2, so the person eating artichoke must be in position 4.
  - Clue 3: The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship. The person driving the ship is in position 3, so the person eating grapefruit must be in position 1.

Thus, the final arrangement is:

```
|             |     1      |   2    |       3        |      4       |
| Food        | Grapefruit | Grapes | Artichoke      | Radish       |
| Job         | Writer     | Fisherman | Entrepreneur  | Security-guard |
| Transport   | Helicopter |          | Ship          | Snowmobile   |
```

### Final Solution Table:
```
|             |     1      |   2    |       3        |      4       |
| Food        | Grapefruit | Grapes | Artichoke      | Radish       |
| Job         | Writer     | Fisherman | Entrepreneur  | Security-guard |

Lv5-3x4-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The Pakistani is the person watching comedy movies.
   - This means the Pakistani is in row ""Movie-Genre"" and column ""Comedy"".

2. **Clue 2**: The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of soul.
   - This means the fans of ambient and soul must be in adjacent columns.

3. **Clue 3**: The Pakistani is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian.
   - This means the Pakistani cannot be in the last (rightmost) column, and the Egyptian must be to the right of the Pakistani.

4. **Clue 4**: The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the Argentine.
   - This means the person watching adventure movies cannot be in the last (rightmost) column, and the Argentine must be to the right of the person watching adventure movies.

5. **Clue 5**: The Pakistani is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
   - This means the person watching disaster movies cannot be in the first (leftmost) column, and the Pakistani must be to the left of the person watching disaster movies.

6. **Clue 6**: The Indonesian is on the left or right of the fan of soul.
   - This means the Indonesian and the fan of soul must be in adjacent columns.

7. **Clue 7**: The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the fan of R&B.
   - This means the fan of R&B cannot be in the last (rightmost) column, and the person watching disaster movies must be to the right of the fan of R&B.

8. **Clue 8**: The Pakistani is on the right of the person watching drama movies.
   - This means the person watching drama movies cannot be in the last (rightmost) column, and the Pakistani must be to the right of the person watching drama movies.

Let's summarize what we know:
- Pakistani (P) is in column 1 (Comedy).
- P is on the left of the person watching disaster movies (D).
- P is on the right of the person watching drama movies (Da).
- P is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian (E).
- The person watching adventure movies (Ad) is on the left of the Argentine (A).

From Clue 3, P cannot be in column 4 (rightmost), so it can only be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Since P is in column 1, E must be in column 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 5, the person watching disaster movies must be in column 2, 3, or 4 (since P is in column 1). Let's consider the possibilities:

### Step-by-Step Deduction:
1. **P (Pakistan) in column 1 (Comedy)**.
2. **E in column 2, 3, or 4**.
3. **Disaster movies in column 2, 3, or 4**.
4. **Drama movies in column 1 or 2 (since P is in column 1 and must be on the right of Da)**.
5. **Adventure movies in column 1 or 2 (since Ad is on the left of A and P is in column 1)**.
6. **R&B in column 1 or 2 (since the fan of R&B is on the left or right of the fan of soul, and D is on the right of the fan of R&B)**.
7. **Ambient and Soul must be adjacent and not in columns 1 or 4**.

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining elements:

- Since P is in column 1 (Comedy), E must be in column 2 or 3.
- If E is in column 2, then the person watching disaster movies must be in column 3.
- If E is in column 3, then the person watching disaster movies must be in column 4.
- Since the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the Argentine, and P is in column 1, the person watching adventure movies must be in column 2, and the Argentine in column 3 or 4.
- Since the fan of R&B is on the left or right of the fan of soul, and the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the fan of R&B, the fan of R&B must be in column 2, and the fan of soul in column 3.
- The Indonesian must be in column 2 or 3 with the fan of R&B and soul.

Final placement:

|               |     1      |     2     |     3     |    4     |
