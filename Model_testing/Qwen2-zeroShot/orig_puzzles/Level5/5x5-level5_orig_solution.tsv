### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 3:
- The person whose hobby is puzzles is the person drinking 7up.

- The person drinking Fanta is on the far left or far right.
- Since clue 3 states that the person drinking 7up has the hobby of puzzles, and the person eating broccoli is on the left of the person with the hobby of puzzles (clue 9), the person drinking Fanta must be at position 1 (since it can't be 3 or 5).

- Therefore, the person drinking 7up (puzzles) must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

#### Clue 1:
- The person eating zucchini is on the left of the Malaysian.
- Since the person drinking Fanta is at position 1, the Malaysian cannot be in position 1 or 2. The zucchini eater must be in position 1 or 2, and the Malaysian must be in position 2 or 3.

#### Clue 2:
- The person whose hobby is gardening is on the left of the Chinese.
- This implies the Chinese cannot be in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 9:
- The person eating broccoli is on the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles (7up).
- Since the person drinking 7up is in position 2, 3, or 4, the person eating broccoli must be in positions 1 or 2.

#### Clue 5:
- The person eating carrot is between the person eating radish and the British.
- This means the British cannot be in position 1, and the person eating radish must be to the left of the person eating carrot.

- The Colombian must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 20:
- The person whose hobby is camping is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up.
- Since the person drinking 7up is in position 2, 3, or 4, the person whose hobby is camping must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

#### Clue 21:
- The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
- The person drinking 7up is in position 2, 3, or 4, so the owner of the turtle must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

1. **Clue 14**: The person whose hobby is board-games is in the middle (position 3).
2. **Clue 10**: The person whose hobby is singing is the fan of hip-hop.
3. **Clue 2**: The fan of indie is in the middle (position 3).
4. **Clue 13**: The fan of blues is on the far left or far right (positions 1 or 5).

Since the fan of indie is in position 3, the fan of blues must be in either position 1 or 5.

5. **Clue 10**: The person whose hobby is singing is the fan of hip-hop.
6. **Clue 1**: The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is board-games.
   - Since the person whose hobby is board-games is in position 3, the fan of hip-hop can only be in positions 4 or 5.

7. **Clue 24**: The person whose hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is singing.
   - This confirms that the fan of hip-hop must be in position 4 or 5.

8. **Clue 10**: The person whose hobby is singing is the fan of hip-hop.
   - Therefore, the fan of hip-hop is in position 4 (since it cannot be in position 5 as it would violate clue 24).

9. **Clue 1**: The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is board-games.
   - This is satisfied since the fan of hip-hop is in position 4 and the person whose hobby is board-games is in position 3.

10. **Clue 2**: The fan of indie is in the middle (position 3).
11. **Clue 13**: The fan of blues is on the far left or far right (positions 1 or 5).

Since the fan of indie is in position 3 and the fan of hip-hop is in position 4, the fan of blues must be in position 1.

12. **Clue 5**: The person whose hobby is fishing is the person whose sport is lacrosse.
   - Let's assume the person whose hobby is fishing is in position 1 (blues fan), so the person whose sport is lacrosse is also in position 1.

13. **Clue 20**: The fan of indie is the person driving the trike.
   - The fan of indie is in position 3, so the person driving the trike is in position 3.

14. **Clue 8**: The person whose sport is skateboarding is the person driving the ship.
   - Let's assume the person whose sport is skateboarding is in position 5, so the person driving the ship is in position 5.

15. **Clue 18**: The person driving the tram is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is skateboarding.
   - Since the person whose sport is skateboarding is in position 5, the person driving the tram is in position 4.

16. **Clue 19**: The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the van.
   - The person driving the tram is in position 4, so the person driving the quad-bike is in position 5 (which conflicts with the person driving the ship being in position 5). Therefore, the person driving the van must be in position 4, and the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 5.

17. **Clue 6**: The person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person eating cucumber.
   - Let's assume the person eating pear is in position 1 and the person eating cucumber is in position 3.

18. **Clue 16**: The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues.
   - The fan of blues is in position 1, so the person eating cucumber is in position 3.

   - The fan of techno is in position 4, so the person eating pepper is in position 4.

20. **Clue 22**: The person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram.
   - The person eating pear is in position 1 and the person driving the tram is in position 4.

   - The person whose sport is skateboarding is in position 5, so the person whose sport is parkour is in position 4.

24. **Clue 7**: The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person eating pepper.
   - The fan of hip-hop is in position 4, so the person eating pepper is in position 4.

25. **Clue 9**: The person whose sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is parkour.
   - The person whose sport is skateboarding is in position 5, so the person whose sport is parkour is in position 4.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Positioning Based on Clues 6 and 12
- From Clue 6: The person eating lime is on the far left or far right.
- From Clue 12: The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the right of the person eating lime.
- Therefore, the person eating lime must be in position 1 or 5 (since the person with magic-tricks must be to the right).

#### Step 2: Positioning Based on Clue 7
- From Clue 7: The person driving the motorbike is the person watching fantasy movies.
- This places ""fantasy"" in the same row as ""motorbike"".

#### Step 3: Positioning Based on Clue 13
- From Clue 13: The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.
- Since ""motorbike"" is already in the ""fantasy"" row, the person with the hobby ""dancing"" must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

#### Step 4: Positioning Based on Clue 14
- From Clue 14: The person who's hobby is card-games is on the far left or far right.
- Given that the person eating lime is on the far left or far right, the person with the hobby ""card-games"" must be in position 5 if the person eating lime is in position 1, and vice versa.

#### Step 5: Positioning Based on Clue 18
- From Clue 18: The person whose hobby is singing is in the middle.
- This places ""singing"" in position 3.

#### Step 6: Positioning Based on Clue 17
- From Clue 17: The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the person eating cranberry.
- This means the person eating cranberry cannot be in position 5, and the owner of the hedgehog must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

#### Step 7: Positioning Based on Clue 19
- From Clue 19: The person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane.
- This means the person driving the airplane cannot be in position 1, and the person eating cucumber must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

#### Step 8: Positioning Based on Clue 15
- From Clue 15: The person driving the tram is on the left of the person driving the train.
- This places the tram in position 1 and the train in position 2 or 3.

#### Step 9: Finalizing Positions
- We now need to fit all remaining information into the table while ensuring all clues are satisfied.

16. **Fish is in the middle**:
    - Fish is in position 3

Given all these constraints, let's fill in the positions step-by-step:

1. **Fish is in the middle (position 3)**:
   - Fish = 3

2. **Sprite and Iced-tea**:
   - Since Sprite < Iced-tea and Fish is in position 3, and considering other constraints, we can place Sprite and Iced-tea as follows:
   - Sprite = 1, Iced-tea = 4

3. **Hot-chocolate**:
   - Hot-chocolate must be before Iced-tea, so it could be 2 or 3 (but 3 is occupied by Fish):
   - Hot-chocolate = 2

4. **Bike and Snowmobile**:
   - Bike < Snowmobile, and considering other constraints:
   - Bike = 1, Snowmobile = 5 (since 1 is occupied by Sprite, 2 by Hot-chocolate, and 4 by Iced-tea, only 3 and 5 are left for Bike and Snowmobile)
   - But since Bike < Designer and Designer is on the right of Van, and Van is on the left of German, we need to adjust:
   - Bike = 2, Snowmobile = 5

5. **Bike and Designer**:
   - Bike = 2, Designer = 5

6. **Van and German**:
   - Van = 3 (since Fish is in 3), German = 4 (since Iced-tea is in 4)

7. **Car and Police-officer**:
   - Car = 4 (since Iced-tea is in 4), Police-officer = 5 (since German is in 4 and Van is in 3)

8. **Pilot and French**:
   - Pilot = 1, French = 2 (since Hot-chocolate is in 2 and Bike is in 1)

9. **Mirinda**:
   - Mirinda = 3 (since Fish is in 3, and Teacher is on the left or right of Mirinda, and Teacher is on the left of German)

10. **Lizard**:
    - Designer = Lizard (given in clue 14)

11. **Frog and Sprite**:
    - Frog = 1 (since Sprite is in 1 and Frog is on the left of Sprite)

12. **Canadian and Sprite**:
    - Canadian = 1 (since Sprite is in 1 and Canadian is on the left of Sprite)

Lv5-5x5-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 2**: The chef drinks hot-chocolate.
2. **Clue 6**: The chef is in an odd position (1 or 3).
3. **Clue 16**: The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies.
4. **Clue 14**: The person who's sport is tennis is in an even position (2, 4, or 5).

Since the chef is in an odd position and the chef drinks hot-chocolate, the chef cannot be in position 2, 4, or 5 because those positions would place the person watching thrillers next to someone who is in an odd position. Therefore, the chef must be in position 1.

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |   2    |     3     |     4      |      5      |

```

5. **Clue 1**: The person eating lime is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.
   - Since the chef is in position 1, the person eating lime cannot be in position 1.
   - Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1 (which is the chef), but that's not possible since the chef drinks hot-chocolate.
   - The person drinking mirinda must be in position 2, and the person eating lime must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |   2    |     3     |     4      |      5      |

```

6. **Clue 13**: The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person eating cherry.
   - The person eating cherry cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because the chef and the person drinking mirinda are there).
   - Therefore, the person eating cherry must be in position 3, and the person drinking soy-milk can be in position 2 or 4.

Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 4.

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |   2    |     3     |     4      |      5      |

```

7. **Clue 17**: The freelancer is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
   - The freelancer cannot be in position 5 (since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 4).
   - Therefore, the freelancer must be in position 3.

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |   2    |     3     |     4      |      5      |

```

8. **Clue 18**: The person eating peach is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea.
   - The person drinking tea cannot be in position 1 (chef) or 2 (mirinda) or 3 (cherry).
   - Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 5, and the person eating peach must be in position 4.

So, we have:
```
|               |       1       |   2    |     3     |     4      |      5      |

```

9. **Clue 5**: The mechanic is on the right of the person drinking tea.
   - The mechanic cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Therefore, the mechanic must be in position 5.

So, we have:

2. **Clue 2 and 17:** The person eating blueberry is on the left of the person eating watermelon. Since clue 16 states that the person eating watermelon watches comedy movies, and clue 17 indicates that the person whose hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon, the person eating watermelon must be in position 5, and the person eating blueberry must be in position 4.
   
3. **Clue 3 and 13:** The Brazilian is in an odd position and the British is in an odd position. Given that the Brazilian is in an odd position, and the British is also in an odd position, the only possible positions for both are 1 and 3 (since 5 is already taken by the person eating watermelon).

4. **Clue 4 and 5:** The person whose sport is handball is the person whose hobby is filmmaking, and the person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the Thai. Therefore, the Thai must be in position 5 (watermelon eater), and the person whose hobby is filmmaking must be in position 4 (blueberry eater).

7. **Clue 9 and 10:** The person whose sport is handball is on the left or right of the person eating peach, and the person whose sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person eating artichoke. Therefore, the person whose sport is handball must be in position 2, and the person whose sport is tennis must be in position 4 (already determined as filmmaking).

8. **Clue 11 and 12:** The person whose sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is badminton, and the British is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is skydiving. Therefore, the British must be in position 3 (skydiving).

9. **Clue 14 and 21:** The person whose hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is rugby, and the person whose hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is singing.

This solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv5-5x5-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will systematically analyze each clue and place the information into the table accordingly. Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

### Clues Analysis

22. **Clue 23:** The person driving the scooter is the teacher.
23. **Clue 24:** The person driving the scooter is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **From Clue 8:** The person watching drama movies is the person eating peach. Peach must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (Clue 10). Since the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person watching sports movies (Clue 1), and the person watching sports movies is to the right of the person watching drama movies, Peach cannot be in position 5. Therefore, Peach must be in position 1 or 3.

2. **From Clue 11:** The electrician is the Chinese.
3. **From Clue 12:** The electrician (Chinese) is on the right of the person watching spy movies. This means the person watching spy movies is in position 1, 2, or 3.
4. **From Clue 14:** The Indian is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and is to the left of the teacher. The teacher cannot be in position 1 since the Indian would not be to the left of the teacher. So, the Indian can only be in position 3 or 5.
5. **From Clue 13:** The teacher is somewhere to the left of the Mexican. If the teacher is in position 3, the Mexican can be in positions 4 or 5. If the teacher is in position 5, the Mexican must be in position 4.
6. **From Clue 16:** The person driving the van is on the left of the entrepreneur. This means the entrepreneur is in a position to the right of the van.
7. **From Clue 22:** The person eating orange is somewhere to the right of the person eating mango. This means mango cannot be in position 5, so mango must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
8. **From Clue 23:** The person driving the scooter is the teacher. The teacher must be in position 3 (since the scooter driver is in an odd position, and the Indian is in an odd position, the teacher cannot be in position 1 or 5).

Now let's place the known values:
- Position 3: Teacher (driving scooter)
- Position 1: Peach (drama movies)
- Position 5: Thai (left of the person watching sports movies)

Since the person watching sports movies is to the right of the person watching drama movies, and the Thai is to the left of the person watching sports movies, the person watching sports movies must be in position 4.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Peach (drama movies)
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: Teacher (driving scooter)
- Position 4: Sports movies
- Position 5: Thai (left of the person watching sports movies)

Next, let's determine the remaining positions:
- The person driving the airplane (security-guard) must be in position 2.
- The person driving the roller is to the right of the person eating corn.
- The person eating corn is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
- The person eating corn is also to the right of the Indian.
- The person eating pineapple is to the right of the person watching sports movies.
- The person eating orange is to the right of the person eating mango.
- The manager is to the left of the Chinese (electrician).
- The manager cannot be in position 1 or 5 (since the Chinese is in position 3 and the manager is to the left of the Chinese).
- The manager must be in position 2 or 4.
- Since the person driving the airplane (security-guard) is in position 2, the manager must be in position 4.
- The person eating orange must be in position 2 or 4, but position 2 is already taken by the security-guard, so the person eating orange must be in position 4.
- The person eating mango must be in position 1 or 3, but position 1 is taken by peach, so the person eating mango must be in position 3.
- The person eating pineapple must be in position 5 (right of the person watching sports movies).
- The person eating corn must be in position 1 (left of the person watching disaster movies).

Finally, we have:
- Position 1: Peach (drama movies)
- Position 2: Security-guard (driving airplane)
- Position 3: Mango (eating, to the left of the teacher)
- Position 4: Orange (eating, to the right of the manager)
- Position 5: Pineapple (eating, right of the person watching sports movies)

The person watching disaster movies must be in position 4 (right of the person driving the scooter).
