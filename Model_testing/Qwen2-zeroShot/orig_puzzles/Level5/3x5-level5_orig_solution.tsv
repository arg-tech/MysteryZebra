13. **The owner of the ferret is the person drinking coffee**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 13**: The owner of the ferret is the person drinking coffee. So, Coffee -> Ferret.
2. **Clue 11**: The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person drinking coffee. Since Coffee is in column 1, Video-games must be in column 1 or 2. However, since Video-games cannot be in column 1 (as it would violate the order), Video-games must be in column 2.
3. **Clue 1**: The person drinking coffee (column 1) is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Therefore, Almond-milk must be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5.
4. **Clue 9**: The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since Video-games is in column 2, the bird owner must be in column 1 or 2. But since column 1 is occupied by coffee, the bird owner must be in column 2.
5. **Clue 4**: The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the bird owner is in column 2, Traveling must be in column 1, 2, or 3. But since Video-games is in column 2 and the bird owner is in column 2, Traveling must be in column 3.
6. **Clue 8**: The person drinking almond-milk is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person who's hobby is traveling. Since Traveling is in column 3, Almond-milk must be in column 2 or 4. But since the bird owner is in column 2, Almond-milk must be in column 4.
7. **Clue 12**: The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since Traveling is in column 3, Iced-tea must be in column 1, 2, or 3. But since Coffee is in column 1 and Traveling is in column 3, Iced-tea must be in column 2.
8. **Clue 2**: The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since Iced-tea is in column 2, the person with the hobby of dancing must be in column 1 or 2. But since Video-games is in column 2, Dancing must be in column 1. Therefore, Juice must be in column 3, 4, or 5. But since Traveling is in column 3 and Almond-milk is in column 4, Juice must be in column 5.
9. **Clue 6**: The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since Juice is in column 5, Filmmaking must be in column 3 or 4. But since Traveling is in column 3, Filmmaking must be in column 4.
10. **Clue 7**: The person who's hobby is gardening is the owner of the frog. Since Filmmaking is in column 4, Gardening must be in column 5, and the frog owner must be in column 5.
11. **Clue 3**: The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since Filmmaking is in column 4, the turtle owner must be in column 3 or 5. But since the frog owner is in column 5, the turtle owner must be in column 3.
12. **Clue 5**: The owner of the turtle is on the far left or far right. Since the turtle owner is in column 3, it must be in column 1 or 5. But since the bird owner is in column 2 and the frog owner is in column 5, the turtle owner must be in column 1.

11. **The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up**.
12. **The person drinking cola is the person watching martial-arts movies**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 9**: The person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right. Let's assume it is on the far left for now:
   - Beverage: 7up | ? | ? | ? | ?
   - Movie-Genre: ? | ? | ? | ? | ?
   - Music-Genre: ? | ? | ? | ? | ?

2. **Clue 5**: The person drinking sprite is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
   - Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5

3. **Clue 6**: The fan of funk is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
   - Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5

4. **Clue 11**: The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up.
   - Since 7up is on the far left, the person watching family movies must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

5. **Clue 4**: The person watching family movies is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
   - Therefore, the person watching family movies must be in position 3.

6. **Clue 12**: The person drinking cola is the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - So, position 4 must have cola and martial-arts.

7. **Clue 10**: The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
   - Since the person watching family movies is in position 3, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 1 or 2.

8. **Clue 1**: The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the person watching comedy movies.
   - Since the person watching documentary movies is on the left of the fan of dubstep, the fan of dubstep cannot be in position 1. Thus, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

9. **Clue 2**: The fan of salsa is between the fan of metal and the person drinking cola.
   - Since cola is in position 4, the fan of salsa must be in position 3, and the fan of metal must be in position 2.

10. **Clue 8**: The fan of salsa is between the fan of dubstep and the person drinking sprite.
    - Since the fan of salsa is in position 3, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 4.

11. **Clue 3**: The fan of metal is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
    - Since the fan of metal is in position 2, the person watching martial-arts movies (cola) is in position 4, which is consistent.

12. **Clue 7**: The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
    - Since the person drinking 7up is in position 1, and the person drinking sprite is in position 4, the only remaining positions for coffee and mirinda are 2 and 5. Given that coffee is to the left of mirinda, coffee must be in position 2, and mirinda must be in position 5.

13. **Clue 10**: The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
    - Since the fan of dubstep is in position 2, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person watching martial-arts movies is the person driving the helicopter.
3. **Clue 3:** The person driving the car is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person driving the helicopter.
5. **Clue 5:** The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. (This is redundant with Clue 6)
8. **Clue 8:** The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car.
9. **Clue 9:** The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
10. **Clue 10:** The person driving the helicopter is on the far left or far right.
11. **Clue 11:** The person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the car.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 10:** The person driving the helicopter is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the car must be on the right of the person driving the helicopter (Clue 8), the person driving the helicopter must be on the far left (position 1).

2. **Clue 2:** The person watching martial-arts movies is the person driving the helicopter. Therefore, the person in position 1 is also watching martial-arts movies.

3. **Clue 9:** The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Since the person driving the helicopter is on the far left, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2.

4. **Clue 3:** The person driving the car is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 1, the person driving the car must be in position 5.

5. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. Therefore, the person in position 4 has chess as their hobby.

6. **Clue 1:** The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the person watching mystery movies is in position 2, the person watching romance movies must be in position 3 or 4. But since the person in position 4 has chess as their hobby, the person watching romance movies must be in position 3.

7. **Clue 5:** The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies. Since the person driving the car is in position 5, the person watching musical movies must be in position 4 or 3. But since position 4 has chess and position 3 has romance, the person watching musical movies must be in position 4, which contradicts the previous conclusion. Rechecking, we find that the person watching musical movies must be in position 4, and the person in position 3 has dancing as their hobby.

8. **Clue 6 & 7:** The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person in position 3 has dancing as their hobby, the person in position 4 or 5 must have skydiving as their hobby. Since position 4 has chess, the person in position 5 must have skydiving as their hobby.

9. **Clue 11:** The person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the car. Since the person driving the car is in position 5, the person driving the train must be in position 3.

10. **Clue 8:** The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car. This is already satisfied.

Lv5-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Analysis:

1. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
2. The person who's hobby is hiking is between the person who's hobby is board-games and the person who's hobby is photography.
3. The person who's hobby is board-games is between the person who's hobby is video-games and the person watching spy movies.
4. The person who's sport is rugby is in an even position.
5. The person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is photography.
6. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
7. The person who's sport is volleyball is in an even position.
8. The person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person watching spy movies.
9. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
10. The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies.
11. The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.
12. The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify positions for sports**:
   - Rugby (even position) can be in 2 or 4.
   - Volleyball (even position) can be in 2 or 4.
   - Swimming must be to the right of volleyball, so it can only be in 4 if volleyball is in 2.
   - Thus, Rugby and Volleyball can't both be in 2 or 4. Let's assume Rugby is in 2 and Volleyball is in 4.
   
2. **Determine the order of sports**:
   - Rugby (2)
   - Volleyball (4)
   - Swimming (4+1=5, but 5 is not possible since volleyball is in 4, so it must be 3).
   - Water Polo (odd position, remaining odd positions are 1 and 5, but we need to fit other constraints).

3. **Determine the order of hobbies**:
   - Board-games (B), Photography (P), Hiking (H), Video-games (V), Cooking (C).
   - B is between V and Spy movies (S).
   - P is to the left of C.
   - B is to the right of P.
   - H is between B and P.
   - B is to the right of P.
   - So, the sequence for hobbies must be: P, B, H, V, C.

4. **Movie genres**:
   - Fantasy (F) is on the left or right of Video-games (V).
   - Disaster (D) is on the left or right of Fantasy (F).
   - Spy (S) is to the right of Rugby (2), so it can be in 3, 4, or 5.
   - Superhero (SH) is to the right of Zombie (Z).
   - From clue 10, D is on the left or right of F, and from clue 3, B is between V and S, and from clue 1, F is on the left or right of V.
   - From clue 11, S is to the right of Climbing (Climb), so S can be in 3, 4, or 5.
   - Since S is to the right of Rugby (2), it can only be in 3 or 4 or 5, but B is between V and S, and V can only be in 1, so S must be in 3, 4, or 5.
   - If S is in 3, then B is in 2 and V is in 1, and F must be in 2 or 4, but F is on the left or right of V, so F must be in 4.
   - So, the sequence for movie genres could be: F, SH, Z, D, S.

### Verification:
1. The person watching fantasy movies (F) is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games (V).
2. The person who's hobby is hiking (H) is between the person who's hobby is board-games (B) and the person who's hobby is photography (P).

- So, in position 1, we have:
  - Beverage: Soy-milk
  - Music-Genre: Gospel
  - Transport: Subway

#### From Clue 11:
- The person driving the boat is the fan of techno.
- So, in position 1, we also have:
  - Transport: Boat
  - Music-Genre: Techno

#### From Clue 12:
- The fan of techno (position 1) is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
- Therefore, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2 or 3.

#### From Clue 7:
- The person driving the train is in an even position and on the right of the person driving the boat.
- Possible even positions for the train driver are 2 or 4.
- Since the boat is driven by position 1, the train must be driven by position 4.
- So, in position 4, we have:
  - Transport: Train

#### From Clue 6:
- The person driving the train is in an even position (already determined as position 4).
- So, in position 4, we have:
  - Transport: Train

#### From Clue 4:
- The person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person driving the tram.
- Since the train is in position 4, the tram must be in position 3.
- The person drinking juice can be in position 2 or 3.

#### From Clue 8:
- The fan of techno is on the right of the fan of d&b.
- We already placed techno in position 1.
- The fan of d&b must be in position 2 or 3.

#### From Clue 2:
- The fan of gospel (position 1) is on the left or right of the fan of d&b.
- The fan of d&b cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.

#### From Clue 1:
- The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train.
- The train is in position 4, so the fan of hip-hop must be in position 5 (already occupied by lemonade).

#### From Clue 12:
- The fan of techno (position 1) is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
- Therefore, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2.

Lv5-3x5-7	"Let's break down the clues step-by-step to determine the final arrangement:

### Clues Analysis:
1. The French is between the German and the person drinking juice.
2. The Canadian is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.
3. The person drinking 7up is the person whose sport is golf.
4. The person whose sport is basketball is on the left of the person whose sport is golf.
5. The American is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is cricket.
6. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the Turkish.
7. The French is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.
8. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the Turkish.
9. The person whose sport is golf is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is cricket.
10. The person whose sport is tennis is on the left of the Canadian.
11. The French is somewhere to the left of the American.
12. The person whose sport is golf is in the middle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 12:
- The person whose sport is golf is in the middle (position 3).

#### Clue 3 & Clue 12:
- The person drinking 7up is the person whose sport is golf, so position 3 is 7up.

#### Clue 4:
- The person whose sport is basketball is on the left of the person whose sport is golf (position 3).
- Therefore, the person whose sport is basketball must be in position 2.

#### Clue 9:
- The person whose sport is golf (position 3) is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is cricket.
- Since the person whose sport is golf is already in position 3, the person whose sport is cricket must be in position 4.

#### Clue 5:
- The American is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is cricket.
- The person whose sport is cricket is in position 4, so the American must be in position 5.

#### Clue 11:
- The French is somewhere to the left of the American.
- Given that the American is in position 5, the French must be in position 1 or 2.

#### Clue 6:
- The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the Turkish.
- Since the French cannot be in position 5 (American), let's consider the possible positions for the French:
  - If French is in position 1, then the person drinking juice must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  - If French is in position 2, then the person drinking juice must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - If French is in position 3, then the person drinking juice must be in position 4 or 5.
  - If French is in position 4, then the person drinking juice must be in position 5.
  - If French is in position 5, it violates the clue.

#### Clue 7:
- The French is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.
- Given the previous constraints, if French is in position 2, the person drinking water could be in position 1, and the person drinking juice would have to be in position 3 or 4.
- If French is in position 3, the person drinking water could be in position 1 or 2, and the person drinking juice would have to be in position 4 or 5.
- If French is in position 4, the person drinking water could be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the person drinking juice would have to be in position 5.
- If French is in position 5, it violates the clue.

Given these constraints, let's try:

- **Position 1: French**
- **Position 2: Turkish** (since the French is to the left of the American)
- **Position 3: 7up**
- **Position 4: Cricket**
- **Position 5: American**

Now we need to place the remaining beverages and sports:
- **Position 1: French**
- **Position 2: Turkish**
- **Position 3: 7up**
- **Position 4: Cricket**
- **Position 5: American**

We know:
- The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the Turkish (so not in position 1 or 2).
- The person drinking water is to the left of the French (so not in position 3 or 4).

Thus:
- **Position 2: Turkish**
- **Position 3: 7up**
- **Position 4: Cricket**
- **Position 5: American**
- **Position 1: French**

Remaining beverages: almond-milk, juice, sprite
- The person drinking juice is to the right of the Turkish (so not in position 1 or 2).
- The person drinking sprite is to the right of the Turkish (so not in position 1 or 2).

Thus:
- **Position 1: French**
- **Position 2: Turkish**
- **Position 3: 7up**
- **Position 4: Cricket**
- **Position 5: American**

Final Beverage Arrangement:
- **Position 1: French**
- **Position 2: Turkish**
- **Position 3: 7up**
- **Position 4: Cricket**
- **Position 5: American**

Final Beverage Arrangement:
- **Beverage**: Juice, Sprite, Water, 7up, Sprite
- **Nationality**: French, Turkish, American, Cricket, German
- **Sport**: Basketball, Cricket, Golf, Tennis, Tennis

### Final Table:
