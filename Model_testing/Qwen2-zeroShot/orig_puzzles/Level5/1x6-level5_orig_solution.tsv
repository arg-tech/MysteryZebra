Lv5-1x6-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct order of the means of transport. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

1. **The person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile**.
2. **The person driving the boat is in an even position**.
3. **The person driving the airplane is on the far right**.
4. **The person driving the subway is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus**.
5. **The person driving the snowmobile is in an even position**.
6. **The person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike**.
7. **The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile**.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The boat must be in an even position (2 or 4).
- The snowmobile must also be in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
- Since the boat is to the left of the snowmobile, the only possible positions for the boat and snowmobile are:
  - Boat in position 2, Snowmobile in position 4.
  - Boat in position 2, Snowmobile in position 6.
  - Boat in position 4, Snowmobile in position 6.

However, since the snowmobile is also in an even position and must be to the right of the boat, the only valid combination is:
- Boat in position 2, Snowmobile in position 4.

Now, we know:
- Position 2: Boat
- Position 4: Snowmobile
- Position 6: Snowmobile (invalid as it's already in position 4)

Since the boat is in position 2 and the snowmobile is in position 4, let's place the other vehicles:

- The airplane is on the far right (position 6).
- The bus must be to the left of the snowmobile, so it can be in position 3.
- The subway must be to the left of the bus, so it can be in position 1.
- The motorbike must be to the right of the boat but not in position 4 or 6, so it can be in position 3 (already taken by the bus) or 5. Since the bus is in position 3, the motorbike must be in position 5.

Thus, the final arrangement is:

- Position 1: Subway
- Position 2: Boat
- Position 3: Bus
- Position 4: Snowmobile
- Position 5: Motorbike
- Position 6: Airplane

Here is the final solution table:

```
|             |   1    |  2   |  3  |     4      |     5     |    6     |

Lv5-1x6-2	"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who's hobby is puzzles is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
4. **Clue 4:** The person who's hobby is video-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3 & Clue 2 & Clue 7:** Puzzles must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6). Since puzzles are to the right of gardening and gardening is also to the left of puzzles, puzzles cannot be in position 2 (because there would be no space for gardening to the left). Therefore, puzzles must be in position 4 or 6.

2. **Clue 5 & Clue 7:** Gardening is on the right of drawing and also to the left of puzzles. This means drawing must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and puzzles must be in an even position (4 or 6).

3. **Clue 4 & Clue 1:** Video-games is to the left of hiking, and hiking is either to the left or right of drawing. If drawing is in position 1, then hiking could be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since video-games is to the left of hiking, and we need to fit all conditions, let's consider the possible positions for drawing and hiking.

4. **Combining Clues:** 
   - Drawing can only be in position 1 or 3 (since it has to be to the left of gardening and puzzles are in an even position).
   - If drawing is in position 1, then gardening must be in position 2 (since it is to the right of drawing), and puzzles must be in position 4 or 6 (since puzzles are in an even position and to the right of gardening).

Let's test these possibilities:

- **If drawing is in position 1:**
  - Gardening must be in position 2.
  - Puzzles must be in position 4 or 6.
  - Hiking must be to the right of drawing and to the left or right of puzzles.
  - Video-games must be to the left of hiking.

Considering the above, if puzzles are in position 4:
  - Hiking must be in position 5 (to the right of drawing and to the left of puzzles).
  - Video-games must be in position 3 (to the left of hiking).

This fits all the clues:
- Position 1: Drawing
- Position 2: Gardening
- Position 3: Video-games
- Position 4: Puzzles
- Position 5: Hiking
- Position 6: Writing

### Final Solution Table:

```
|         |    1    |      2      |   3    |    4    |     5     |    6    |
| Hobby   | Drawing | Gardening   | Video-games | Puzzles | Hiking   | Writing |
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
Lv5-1x6-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the means of transport accordingly. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person driving the subway**.
2. **The person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the train**.
3. **The person driving the helicopter is on the far left or far right**.
4. **The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right**.
5. **The person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat**.
6. **The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know that either the helicopter or the subway must be in position 1 (far left) or 6 (far right). Since Clue 5 states that the person driving the subway is to the right of the person driving the boat, the subway cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the helicopter must be in position 1 or 6.

2. If the helicopter is in position 1, then the subway must be in position 6 (since it can only be in positions 1 or 6 and it has to be to the right of the boat).

3. Now, if the helicopter is in position 1 and the subway in position 6, we need to place the remaining vehicles (boat, trike, train, snowmobile) in positions 2 through 5.

4. From Clue 2, the trike must be to the left of the train. This means the trike cannot be in position 5, as there would be no room for the train.

5. From Clue 1, the boat must be either to the left or right of the subway. Since the subway is in position 6, the boat must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

6. From Clue 5, the boat must be to the left of the subway. So, the boat cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the boat must be in position 2 or 3.

7. From Clue 6, the snowmobile must be to the left of the trike. So, the trike cannot be in position 2, as there would be no room for the snowmobile.

8. Combining all these constraints, let's try placing the boat in position 2:
   - Boat in position 2, then the trike must be in position 3 or 4 (since it must be to the left of the train).
   - If the trike is in position 3, the train must be in position 4 or 5.
   - The snowmobile must be to the left of the trike, so it can be in position 1 or 2, but position 2 is taken by the boat, so it must be in position 1.

Given all these constraints, let's finalize the positions:

- Helicopter in position 1
- Boat in position 2
- Snowmobile in position 3
- Trike in position 4
- Train in position 5
- Subway in position 6

So, the final solution is:

```
|             |     1      |     2      |   3   |   4   |  5   |   6    |
| Transport   | Helicopter | Boat       | Snowmobile | Trike | Train | Subway |

Lv5-1x6-4	"Let's analyze and solve the puzzle step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. **The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.**
2. **The owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rat.**
3. **The owner of the lizard is on the left of the owner of the snake.**
4. **The owner of the fish is on the far left.**
5. **This is a repetition of clue 2.**
6. **The owner of the frog is in an odd position.**
7. **The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.**

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- From Clue 4, we know that the owner of the fish must be in position 1.
- From Clue 2 and Clue 5 (which are essentially the same), the owner of the frog must be in an odd position and to the right of the owner of the rat. The only odd positions available are 1, 3, and 5. Since the fish is in position 1, the frog can only be in positions 3 or 5.
- From Clue 6, if the frog is in position 3 or 5, then the owner of the rat must be in one of the positions to the left of the frog.
- From Clue 3, the owner of the lizard is to the left of the owner of the snake.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the owner of the horse is either to the left or right of the owner of the frog, and the owner of the lizard must be to the right of the owner of the horse.

Let's test possible positions for the frog and see which fits all conditions:

- If the frog is in position 3:
  - Rat must be in position 1 (since it must be to the left of the frog).
  - Lizard must be to the left of the snake, so it could be in position 2 and snake in position 4.
  - Horse can be in position 5 (left or right of the frog).

  This gives us:
  - Position 1: Rat
  - Position 2: Lizard
  - Position 3: Frog
  - Position 4: Snake
  - Position 5: Horse
  - Position 6: Fish

- If the frog is in position 5:
  - Rat must be in position 3 or 1 (but since 1 is taken by fish, it must be 3).
  - Lizard must be to the left of the snake, so it could be in position 2 and snake in position 4.
  - Horse can be in position 1 (right of the frog).

  This gives us:
  - Position 1: Horse
  - Position 2: Lizard
  - Position 3: Rat
  - Position 4: Snake
  - Position 5: Frog
  - Position 6: Fish

However, this does not satisfy Clue 7 because the horse would be to the right of the frog, which contradicts the requirement that the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.

Therefore, the only valid solution is:

```

Lv5-1x6-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Clues Recap:
1. The American is on the right of the Canadian.
2. The French is somewhere to the right of the Canadian.
3. The Spanish is on the left of the Canadian.
4. The Australian is in an even position.
5. The Spanish is on the right of the Australian.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Clue 4:
The Australian must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

#### Clue 5:
The Spanish is on the right of the Australian. Therefore, if the Australian is in position 2, the Spanish must be in position 3, 4, or 5. If the Australian is in position 4, the Spanish must be in position 5 or 6. If the Australian is in position 6, there is no valid position for the Spanish.

#### Clue 3:
The Spanish is on the left of the Canadian. This means the Canadian cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 because the Spanish would not have enough space to the left.

#### Combining Clues 3 and 5:
- If the Australian is in position 2, the Spanish can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
  - If Spanish is in position 3, then Canadian must be in position 4 or 5.
  - If Spanish is in position 4, then Canadian must be in position 5.
  - If Spanish is in position 5, then Canadian must be in position 6.
- If the Australian is in position 4, the Spanish can only be in position 5.
  - Then Canadian must be in position 6.
- If the Australian is in position 6, there is no valid position for the Spanish.

#### Clue 1:
The American is on the right of the Canadian.

#### Clue 2:
The French is somewhere to the right of the Canadian.

#### Valid Positions Analysis:
- **If Australian is in position 2:**
  - Spanish can be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - Canadian must be in position 4, 5, or 6.
  - American must be in position 5 or 6.
  - French must be in position 6.
  
  Let's try:
  - If Spanish is in position 3, Canadian in position 4, American in position 5, and French in position 6:
    - This satisfies all conditions.
    
  - If Spanish is in position 4, Canadian in position 5, American in position 6, and French in position 6:
    - This does not satisfy as French cannot be in the same position.
    
  - If Spanish is in position 5, Canadian in position 6, American in position 7 (not possible):
    - This does not satisfy.

- **If Australian is in position 4:**
  - Spanish must be in position 5.
  - Canadian must be in position 6.
  - American must be in position 7 (not possible):
    - This does not satisfy.

Thus, the only valid configuration is:
- Australian in position 2
- Spanish in position 3
- Canadian in position 4
- American in position 5
- French in position 6

### Final Solution Table:

Lv5-1x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze and apply each clue step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person eating lettuce is on the left of the person eating peas.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating broccoli is on the right of the person eating peas.
3. **Clue 3**: The person eating pepper is in an even position (positions 2, 4, or 6).
4. **Clue 4**: The person eating spinach is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli.
5. **Clue 5**: The person eating lettuce is on the left or right of the person eating spinach.
6. **Clue 7**: The person eating peas is on the right of the person eating lettuce.
7. **Clue 8**: The person eating lettuce is on the left of the person eating cucumber.

From Clues 1, 2, and 7:
- Lettuce must be to the left of peas.
- Peas must be to the left of broccoli.
- Lettuce must be to the left of cucumber.

This means the order of lettuce, peas, and broccoli must be:
\[ \text{Lettuce} < \text{Peas} < \text{Broccoli} \]

From Clue 3:
- Pepper is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

From Clue 4 and Clue 5:
- Spinach can be either to the left or right of broccoli, but it cannot be in the same position as broccoli.
- Lettuce can be either to the left or right of spinach, but it cannot be in the same position as spinach.

Considering all these constraints, let's try to place the foods in positions while satisfying all conditions:

- Since lettuce, peas, and broccoli must be in that order, and lettuce must be somewhere to the left of cucumber, we need to place them first.
- Pepper must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6), and spinach must not be in the same position as broccoli.

Let's start with placing lettuce, peas, and broccoli:
- If lettuce is in position 1, then peas must be in position 2 and broccoli in position 3.
- If lettuce is in position 2, then peas must be in position 3 and broccoli in position 4.
- If lettuce is in position 3, then peas must be in position 4 and broccoli in position 5.
- If lettuce is in position 4, then peas must be in position 5 and broccoli in position 6.

Since lettuce must be to the left of cucumber and there are only six positions, let's test the possible placements:

1. If lettuce is in position 1, then:
   - Peas is in position 2, broccoli is in position 3.
   - Cucumber must be in position 4, 5, or 6.
   - Pepper can be in position 2, 4, or 6 (but 2 is taken by peas).
   - Spinach can be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6 (but 3 is taken by broccoli).

2. If lettuce is in position 2, then:
   - Peas is in position 3, broccoli is in position 4.
   - Cucumber must be in position 5 or 6.
   - Pepper can be in position 2, 4, or 6 (but 2 is taken by peas and 4 is taken by broccoli).
   - Spinach can be in position 3, 5, or 6 (but 3 is taken by broccoli).

3. If lettuce is in position 3, then:
   - Peas is in position 4, broccoli is in position 5.
   - Cucumber must be in position 6.
   - Pepper can be in position 2 or 4 (but 4 is taken by peas).
   - Spinach can be in position 3 or 5 (but 3 is taken by peas and 5 is taken by broccoli).

4. If lettuce is in position 4, then:
   - Peas is in position 5, broccoli is in position 6.
   - Cucumber must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - Pepper can be in position 2, 4, or 6 (but 4 and 6 are taken by peas and broccoli respectively).
   - Spinach can be in position 3 or 5 (but 5 is taken by broccoli).

The only consistent placement that satisfies all conditions is:
- Lettuce in position 1.
- Peas in position 2.
- Broccoli in position 3.
- Cucumber in position 6.
- Pepper in position 4.
- Spinach in position 5.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
```

Lv5-1x6-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze and arrange the given clues step-by-step:

1. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
2. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite.
3. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person drinking tea.
4. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water (repeated from clue 1).
5. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta.
6. The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.
7. The person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the person drinking tea.

Let's summarize these clues into a logical order:

- From Clue 3: Milk is to the left of Tea.
- From Clue 2: Tea is to the left of Sprite.
- From Clue 1 and 4: Sprite is to the left of Water.
- From Clue 6: Water is to the left of Cola.
- From Clue 5: Cola is to the left of Fanta.
- From Clue 7: Water is to the right of Tea, which means Tea is to the left of Water.

Combining all these, we can deduce the following order:
1. Milk
2. Tea
3. Sprite
4. Water
5. Cola
6. Fanta

Now, let's place the beverages in the table according to the order:

Lv5-1x6-8	"Let's analyze and solve the puzzle step by step.

Given:
1. The person eating potato (P) is the person eating potato.
2. The person eating peach (L) is somewhere to the right of the person eating lettuce (C).
3. The person eating broccoli (B) is on the right of the person eating peach (L).
4. The person eating cucumber (Cu) is on the left of the person eating onion (O).
5. The person eating potato (P) is somewhere to the left of the person eating peach (L).
6. The person eating potato (P) is on the left of the person eating lettuce (C).
7. The person eating cucumber (Cu) is on the right of the person eating broccoli (B).

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Clue 1 and 5 tell us that P must be somewhere to the left of L.
- Clue 2 and 6 tell us that C must be to the left of O, and P must be to the left of C.
- Clue 3 tells us that B must be to the right of L.
- Clue 4 tells us that Cu must be to the left of O.
- Clue 7 tells us that Cu must be to the right of B.

Now let's place the foods based on the above deductions:

1. Since P is to the left of C and L, and C is to the left of O, the order involving P, C, and O must be P, C, O or P, C, O with some other foods in between.
2. Since B is to the right of L and Cu is to the right of B and to the left of O, we can place B and L accordingly.

Given the constraints, the only logical order that fits all the clues is:

- P (potato) must be first.
- C (cucumber) must be second.
- B (broccoli) must be third.
- L (lettuce) must be fourth.
- O (onion) must be fifth.
- Therefore, the remaining position for the last food is sixth, which is the one not yet placed.

Thus, the final arrangement is:

|        |   1    |    2    |   3   |    4     |    5     |   6   |
| Food   | Potato | Cucumber | Broccoli | Lettuce | Onion | Remaining Food |

Since the remaining food is not specified in the clues but must be one of the given foods (peach, potato, cucumber, broccoli, lettuce, onion), and considering that potato, cucumber, and broccoli are already placed, the remaining food must be either peach or the one not yet mentioned.

However, since potato is already placed and it cannot repeat, the remaining food must be peach.

So the final arrangement is:

|        |   1    |    2    |   3   |    4     |    5     |   6   |

Lv5-1x6-9	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.
   - This means milk must be to the left of coffee.

2. **Clue 2**: The person drinking water is between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking almond-milk.
   - This means the order for these three is either: mirinda, water, almond-milk or almond-milk, water, mirinda.

3. **Clue 3**: The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk.
   - This means fanta must be to the left of milk.

4. **Clue 4**: The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking water.
   - This reinforces Clue 2 and confirms that the order must be mirinda, water, almond-milk.

5. **Clue 5**: The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta.
   - This means fanta must be to the right of mirinda.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the beverages:

- From Clue 3, fanta must be to the left of milk.
- From Clue 1, milk must be to the left of coffee.
- From Clue 4, almond-milk must be to the left of water.
- From Clue 2, the order mirinda, water, almond-milk fits perfectly with the other clues.

So, we can deduce the following:
- Fanta must be in position 1 (the leftmost position).
- Mirinda must be in position 2.
- Water must be in position 3.
- Almond-milk must be in position 4.
- Milk must be in position 5.
- Coffee must be in position 6 (the rightmost position).

Lv5-1x6-10	"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the order of the movie genres from left to right.

### Clues Breakdown:
1. **The person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies.**
   - This means Thriller (T) must be to the left of Horror (H).

2. **The person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching spy movies.**
   - This means Adventure (A) must be to the left of Spy (S).

3. **The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies.**
   - This means Documentary (D) can either be next to Thriller (T) or not next to it but still in the sequence.

4. **The person watching family movies is on the right of the person watching horror movies.**
   - This means Family (F) must be to the right of Horror (H).

5. **The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person watching family movies.**
   - This means Adventure (A) must be to the right of Family (F).

6. **The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies.**
   - This is redundant because it confirms the first clue (Thriller on the left of Horror).

### Combining the Clues:
From Clue 4 and Clue 6, we know:
- F (Family) must be to the right of H (Horror).
- T (Thriller) must be to the left of H (Horror).

From Clue 5:
- A (Adventure) must be to the right of F (Family).

From Clue 2:
- A (Adventure) must be to the left of S (Spy).

From Clue 3:
- D (Documentary) can be next to T (Thriller) or not next to it but still in the sequence.

### Possible Sequence:
Given the constraints, let's try to fit all the clues into a possible sequence:

1. Since T (Thriller) is to the left of H (Horror) and F (Family) is to the right of H (Horror), we need to place T and H in the sequence with F to the right of H.
2. Since A (Adventure) must be to the left of S (Spy) and to the right of F (Family), we need to place A and S accordingly.
3. D (Documentary) can be placed anywhere, but it should respect the other constraints.

A possible valid sequence that fits all these constraints is:
- Thriller (T)
- Adventure (A)
