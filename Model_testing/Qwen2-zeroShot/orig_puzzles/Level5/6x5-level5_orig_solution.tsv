23. The person driving the ship is the person eating orange.
24. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the owner of the mouse.

#### Placing Information:
1. **Clue 21**: The doctor is on the far left (Position 1).
2. **Clue 4**: The coach is the person driving the ship (Position 4).
3. **Clue 23**: The person driving the ship is the person eating orange (Position 4, Food: Orange).

Now let's place the remaining clues step-by-step:

- **Clue 10**: The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left or far right.
- **Clue 14**: The person who's sport is weightlifting is the fisherman.
- **Clue 20**: The owner of the hamster is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person who's sport is lacrosse.

Since the fisherman (weightlifting) must be in one of the extreme positions and the owner of the hamster is between weightlifting and lacrosse, we can place:

- **Weightlifting** (Fisherman) at Position 1 or 5.
- **Hamster owner** in the middle.

Let's assume **Weightlifting** (Fisherman) is at Position 1 for now.

- **Clue 20**: The owner of the hamster is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person who's sport is lacrosse.
- **Clue 20**: If Weightlifting (Fisherman) is at Position 1, Lacrosse must be at Position 5, and Hamster owner at Position 3.

- **Clue 10**: Ice-hockey is on the far left or far right.
- **Clue 10**: Since Weightlifting (Fisherman) is at Position 1, Ice-hockey must be at Position 5.
