Zebra_1domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to piece together the information step by step and place each variable into a grid that includes nationality, favorite color, cigar brand, sport, and pet.

Let's start with the given clues:

1. The English is the person who likes red.
2. The Spanish owns the dog.
3. The person who's sport is baseball likes green.
4. The Ukrainian is the person who's sport is biathlon.
5. The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
6. The old-gold smoker owns the snails.
7. The kools-smoker likes yellow.
8. The person who's sport is weightlifting is in the middle (3rd position).
9. The Norwegian is on the far left.
10. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
11. The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.
12. The lucky-strike smoker is the person who's sport is handball.
13. The Japanese is the parliaments-smoker.
14. The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.

Let's construct a 5x5 grid:

| Nationality | Color    | Cigars   | Sport      | Pets         |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Norwegian   |          |          |            |              |
| Spanish     |          |          |            | Dog          |
|            |          |          | Weightlifting |            |
| Ukrainian  |          |          | Biathlon   |             |
| English    | Red      |          |            |              |

From clue 3 and 5, since the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory:
- Green can't be in position 1 (Norwegian).
- Ivory could be in position 1 or 2.

Given that the Norwegian is on the far left (position 1), we place it there:

| Nationality | Color    | Cigars   | Sport      | Pets         |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Norwegian   |          |          |            |              |
| Spanish     |          |          |            | Dog          |
|            |          |          | Weightlifting |            |
| Ukrainian  |          |          | Biathlon   |             |
| English    | Red      |          |            |              |

From clue 7, the kools-smoker likes yellow:
- Kools can't be in position 5 (English).

From clue 2, the Spanish owns the dog. From clue 14, the Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
- The Norwegian (position 1) must like a color other than blue.

Let's place yellow in the kools-smoker:

| Nationality | Color    | Cigars   | Sport      | Pets         |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Norwegian   |          | Kools    |            |              |
| Spanish     | Yellow   |          |            | Dog          |
|            |          |          | Weightlifting |            |
| Ukrainian  |          |          | Biathlon   |             |
| English    | Red      |          |            |              |

From clue 12, the lucky-strike smoker is the person who's sport is handball:
- Handball can't be in position 4 (Ukrainian).

From clue 3 and 5, since the green person is to the right of ivory, we place them accordingly. Since green cannot be in position 1 or 2:

| Nationality | Color    | Cigars   | Sport      | Pets         |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Norwegian   | Ivory    | Kools    |            |              |
| Spanish     | Yellow   |          |            | Dog          |
| Green       |          |          | Handball   |              |
| Ukrainian  |          |          | Biathlon   |             |
| English    | Red      |          |            |              |

From clue 6, the old-gold smoker owns the snails:
- Old-gold can't be in position 1 (Norwegian).

From clue 8, the person who's sport is weightlifting is in the middle (3rd position):
- Weightlifting can't be in position 4 or 5.

We now have:

| Nationality | Color    | Cigars   | Sport      | Pets         |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Norwegian   | Ivory    | Kools    |            |              |
| Spanish     | Yellow   |          |            | Dog          |
| Green       |          | Old-gold | Weightlifting |            |
| Ukrainian  |          |          | Biathlon   |             |
| English    | Red      |          |            |              |

From clue 13, the Japanese is the parliaments-smoker:
- Parliaments can't be in position 2 (Spanish).

From clue 9, the Norwegian is on the far left. We place it there:

| Nationality | Color    | Cigars   | Sport      | Pets         |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Norwegian   | Ivory    | Kools    |            |              |
| Spanish     | Yellow   |          |            | Dog          |
| Green       |          | Old-gold | Weightlifting |            |
| Ukrainian  |          | Parliaments | Biathlon   |             |
| English    | Red      |          |            |              |

From clue 10, the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox:
- Chesterfields can't be in position 2 (Spanish) or 4 (Ukrainian).

From clue 11, the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse:
- Kools can't be in position 3.

From clue 14, the Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since Norwegian is already in position 1 and Ivory is there:

| Nationality | Color    | Cigars   | Sport      | Pets         |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Norwegian   | Ivory    | Kools    |            |              |
| Spanish     | Yellow   |          |            | Dog          |
| Green       |          | Old-gold | Weightlifting |            |
| Ukrainian  | Blue     | Parliaments | Biathlon   |             |
| English    | Red      | Chesterfields|           |              |

Now, we need to place the sports and cigars. We know that:

- The sport of handball is lucky-strike (position 3).
- Weightlifting is in position 3.

Thus:

| Nationality | Color    | Cigars   | Sport      | Pets         |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Norwegian   | Ivory    | Kools    | Parkour   |              |
| Spanish     | Yellow   |          | Handball  | Dog          |
| Green       |          | Old-gold | Weightlifting |            |
| Ukrainian  | Blue     | Parliaments | Biathlon   |             |
| English    | Red      | Chesterfields|           |              |

Since the sport of parkour is in position 1:

parkour:1"	parkour:1	parkour:1	True	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_0	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues.

First, let's summarize the information provided:

1. English = Red
2. Spanish = Dog
3. Green = Baseball
4. Ukrainian = Biathlon
5. Green (Baseball) is to the right of Ivory.
6. Old-Gold = Snails
7. Kools = Yellow
8. Weightlifting is in the middle.
9. Norwegian is on the far left.
10. Chesterfields are on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
11. Kools (Yellow) is to the left or right of the horse keeper.
12. Lucky-Strike = Handball
13. Japanese = Parliaments
14. Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes Blue.

Now, let's place the pieces we know:

1. The Norwegian is on the far left: 
   - Position 1 = Norwegian

Since the Norwegian is on the far left and the order can be flexible, we'll move forward with this setup for now.

2. Englishman likes Red:
   - Position 2-5 (one of these) = English, Red

3. Spanish owns Dog:
   - Position 2-5 (not 1) = Spanish, Dog

4. Green (Baseball) is to the right of Ivory:
   - Possible positions: (Ivory, Green) or (Ivory, ..., Green)

5. Old-Gold (Snails):
   - Position 2-5 (one of these) = Old-Gold, Snails

6. Kools (Yellow):
   - Position 2-5 (not 1) = Kools, Yellow

7. Weightlifting is in the middle:
   - Position 3 = Sport: Weightlifting

8. Lucky-Strike (Handball):
   - Position 2-5 (one of these) = Lucky-Strike, Handball

9. Japanese = Parliaments:
   - Position 2-5 (not 1) = Japanese, Parliaments

10. Norwegian is to the left or right of Blue:
    - Position 1, 2, or 3 (not 4-5) could be related to Blue.

Now let's fill in these constraints:

Since the Norwegian is on the far left and they can't like blue, we have:

1 = Norwegian

Let’s consider the other constraints with our current setup:

Given:
- The Englishman likes Red: Not 1 (since Norwegian), so positions 2-5.
- Spanish owns Dog: 3-5.
- Green is to the right of Ivory and can't be in position 1, nor could it be next to blue.
- Old-Gold has Snails: Positions 2-4.
- Kools have Yellow: 2-5 (not 1).
- Weightlifting is in the middle: Position 3.
- Lucky-Strike has Handball: Positions 2-5.
- Japanese Parliaments: Positions 2-5.

Now, placing these step-by-step:

1. Norwegian
2. English / Red
3. Sport = Weightlifting (middle)
4. Old-Gold (Snails) or Kools (Yellow)
5. Lucky-Strike (Handball)

Since the sport in position 3 is weightlifting and it’s middle, we place Spanish with Dog, but not next to the Norwegian.

2 = English, Red
3 = Weightlifting
4 = Old-Gold (Snails)
5 = Lucky-Strike (Handball)

Spanish has the dog: Position 4 or 5. Let's put Spanish as the owner of the dog in position 4:

1 = Norwegian
2 = English, Red
3 = Weightlifting
4 = Spanish, Dog
5 = Lucky-Strike, Handball

Ivory and Green must be placed such that Green is to the right of Ivory:
Ivory: Position 2 or 3 (since weightlifting is in position 3)
Green: Position 3 or 4.

So, placing Ivory in position 2 and Green in position 3:

1 = Norwegian
2 = English, Ivory
3 = Green (Baseball)
4 = Spanish, Dog
5 = Lucky-Strike, Handball

Now check the remaining constraints:
- Old-Gold (Snails): Position 4 or 5. Since Spanish is already there, it must be in position 2.
- Kools (Yellow) are to the left of horse: Position 1.

Thus, we have:

1 = Norwegian
2 = Kools, Yellow
3 = English, Ivory
4 = Spanish, Dog
5 = Old-Gold (Snails)

Now, placing blue and the remaining constraints:
- Japanese (Parliaments): Position 2 or 5. Since position 5 is Snails, Japanese must be in position 2.
- Norwegian can't like Blue, but it could be in positions 3-5.

Finally:

1 = Norwegian
2 = Japanese, Parliaments
3 = English, Ivory
4 = Spanish, Dog
5 = Old-Gold (Snails)

So the zebra is with the Ukrainian, and we need to check where the Ukrainian is:
- Ukrainian likes biathlon.
- Biathlon must be in position 8, but weightlifting is in position 3.

Thus:

1. Norwegian
2. Japanese, Parliaments
3. English, Ivory
4. Spanish, Dog
5. Old-Gold (Snails)

Since zebra can't fit into any of the current positions for the given constraints directly related to this problem setup and based on the clues provided, we need to re-check:

If the zebra is in position 2: 
1 = Norwegian
2 = Ukrainian, Zebra
3 = English, Ivory
4 = Spanish, Dog
5 = Old-Gold (Snails)

Thus:
**zebra:2**"	zebra:5	zebra:2	False	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information step-by-step. Let's break down the clues:

1. The October birthday person likes red.
2. The May birthday person owns the dog.
3. The green beverage drinker is also the red color lover (October).
4. The January birthday person drinks tea.
5. Green is to the right of ivory in terms of preference, but we need more information on their exact positions.
6. Old Gold smoker owns snails.
7. Kools smoker likes yellow and owns a pet.
8. Milk is in the middle.
9. April birthday is far left (1st position).
10. Chesterfields owner is to the left or right of the fox owner.
11. Kools owner is to the left or right of the horse owner.
12. Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
13. Parliaments smoker has a March birthday.
14. April birthday person likes blue, so it's in 5th position.

Now let’s map out the positions based on birthdays and preferences:

**Month Position:**
1 - April
2 - ?
3 - January
4 - May
5 - March

**Color Preference (from left to right):**
Red is in position 1 (October birthday).
Ivory must be somewhere between red and green.
Green (coffee drinker) cannot be in the middle, so it's either 2 or 4.

**Beverage:**
Tea is in January (3rd position), and milk is in the middle (position 3).

The positions for colors and beverages can now be set up:

1. April birthday - Blue
2. ?
3. January birthday - Tea, Green
4. May birthday - ?
5. March birthday - Parliaments

Now let's place pets:
- Dog owner is in position 2 (May).
- Zebra must be the remaining pet.

Placing cigars and other preferences:

6. Old Gold smoker owns snails.
7. Kools smoker likes yellow, so it cannot be orange juice or milk.
8. Milk is middle (position 3), not in January or April.
9. Lucky Strike - Orange Juice.
10. Chesterfields owner is to the left or right of fox.
11. Kools owner is to the left or right of horse.

Let's finalize based on all clues:

- Old Gold smoker owns snails, cannot be in position 3 (milk).
- Parliaments smoker in March.
- Kools smoker likes yellow and must own a pet different from dog, zebra, horse.
- Lucky Strike - Orange Juice.

By process of elimination:
1. April birthday - Blue
2. May birthday - Yellow Kools, Dog
3. January birthday - Green Coffee, Tea (middle)
4. March birthday - Parliaments smoker
5. October birthday - Red

Now placing beverages and pets correctly:

- January: Tea, Green
- May: Yellow Kools, Dog
- April: Blue
- March: Parliaments (can be any pet, not dog)
- October: Red (coffee)

**Final setup:**
1. April - Blue, Horse, Orange Juice
2. May - Yellow Kools, Dog, Tea
3. January - Green Coffee, Tea
4. March - Parliaments, Zebra, Milk
5. October - Red, Coffee

Therefore, the person who likes water is in position 3 (January).

**water:3**"	water:1	water:3	False	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding elements step by step. Let's start organizing the information:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Months and Colors**
   - October (Red)
   - May (Dog)
   - January (Tea)
   - April (Left or Right of Blue)

2. **Beverages**
   - Coffee (Green)
   - Milk (Middle)
   - Tea (January)
   - Orange Juice (Lucky Strike)

3. **Cigars and Pets**
   - Old Gold (Snails)
   - Kools (Yellow, Horse)
   - Chesterfields (Left or Right of Fox)
   - Lucky Strike (Orange Juice)
   - Parliament (April)

4. **Placement Clues**
   - May is Dog
   - April is Left or Right of Blue
   - January Tea
   - March is Parliament

Let's set up a grid to help us organize the information:

| Month | Color  | Beverage    | Cigar         | Pet      |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| October| Red    | Coffee      |               |          |
| May    |        |             | Dog           |          |
| January| Green  | Tea         |               |          |
| April  | Blue   | Orange Juice| Lucky Strike  | Horse    |
| March  | Ivory  | Milk        | Parliament    |          |

### Step-by-Step Placement

1. **October (Red, Coffee)**
   - October has Red and Coffee.

2. **May (Dog)**
   - May has Dog.
   - The only pet left for January is Fox (since April's Horse is placed).

3. **January (Tea, Green)**
   - January has Tea and Green.
   - Green is to the right of Ivory: So Ivory must be in the second column.

4. **April (Blue, Lucky Strike, Horse)**
   - April can only have Blue on its left or right.
   - April's position leaves March as Parliament.
   - April is thus to the right of Blue and has Lucky Strike and Horse.

5. **March (Parliament, Milk)**
   - March has Parliament and Milk.

6. **Placement of Other Pets and Cigars**
   - Kools Smoker: Yellow and Horse
   - Old Gold: Snails
   - Chesterfields: Fox or next to Fox.
   - October cannot be leftmost or rightmost (Red, Coffee), so it must be in the middle.

### Final Grid

| Month  | Color   | Beverage    | Cigar        | Pet      |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| October| Red     | Coffee      |              |          |
| May    |         |             | Dog          |          |
| January| Green   | Tea         |              | Fox      |
| April  | Blue    | Orange Juice| Lucky Strike | Horse    |
| March  | Ivory   | Milk        | Parliament   | Snails   |

### Placement of Chesterfields

- Chesterfields must be next to the owner of the Fox.
- So, Chesterfields can only be in January or May.

But May has Dog and January has Fox. Therefore:
- **Chesterfields: January**

### Final Answer
The zebra is located with the person whose birthday is in March.

**Zebra:March**"	zebra:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_1domain_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize and analyze the given clues step by step.

Firstly, let's set up a 5x5 grid:
```
| Color | Nationality | Cigars       | Beverage    | Movie Genre |
-----------------------------------------------------------
1      |            |              |             |            
2      |            |              |             |            
3      |            |              |             |            
4      |            |              |             |            
5      |            |              |             |            
```

Let's fill in the known information:

1. The English is the person who likes red.
   - (Red, English, _, _, _)

2. The Spanish is the person watching romance movies.
   - (_, _, _, _, Romance)
   
3. The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green.
   - (Green, _, _, Coffee, _)

4. The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea.
   - (_, Ukrainian, _, Tea, _)

5. The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
   - (Ivory, _, Green, _, _)
   
6. The old-gold-smoker is the person watching spy movies.
   - (_, _, Old-Gold, _, Spy)

7. The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow.
   - (_, _, Kools, Yellow, _)
   
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (position 3).
   - (_, _, Milk, _, _)

9. The Norwegian is on the far left.
   - (Norwegian, _, _, _, _)
   
10. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies.
    - (_, Chesterfields, _, _, Animation)
    
11. The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the person watching horror movies.
    - (Kools, _, _, _, Horror)
    
12. The lucky-strike-smoker is the person drinking orange-juice.
    - (_, Lucky-Strike, Orange-Juice, _)
    
13. The Japanese is the parliaments-smoker.
    - (_, Japanese, Parliaments, _, _)

14. The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
    - (Norwegian, Blue, _, _, _)

Using these clues and filling in:

```
| Color  | Nationality | Cigars       | Beverage   | Movie Genre |
-----------------------------------------------------------
1       | Norwegian   |             | Milk       |             |
2       |             | Ukrainian   | Kools      | Yellow      |
3       |             |             |            | Tea         |
4       | Green       |             | Coffee     |             |
5       | Ivory       |             |            |             |
```

Let's place the remaining elements:

- The old-gold-smoker is watching spy movies.
  - (Ivory, _, Old-Gold, _, Spy)

- The kools-smoker is to the left of horror and right of green.
  - Green -> (Green, _, Kools, Yellow, Horror)

- The lucky-strike-smoker drinks orange juice.
  - (Blue, Japanese, Lucky-Strike, Orange-Juice, _)
  
- The norwegian is on the far left:
  - Norwegian -> (Norwegian, Blue, Kools, Milk, _)
  
Now we need to determine who watches what:

Since the Spanish watch romance and it's in the last row, and old-gold-smoker is watching spy, chesterfields must be on the other side of animation movies.
- (Chesterfields -> (Chesterfields, _, _, _, Animation))
- Old-Gold -> (Ivory, _, Old-Gold, _, Spy)

The only remaining movie genre for the Spanish is Mystery.

```

The only beverage left is water. Since the milk is in position 2, and there's one more position to fill:
- (Water -> 3)

So, the final grid looks like:

```
| Color  | Nationality | Cigars       | Beverage   | Movie Genre |
-----------------------------------------------------------
1       | Norwegian   | Kools       | Milk       |            |
