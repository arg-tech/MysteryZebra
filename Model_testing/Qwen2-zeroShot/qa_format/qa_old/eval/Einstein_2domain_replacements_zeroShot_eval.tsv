Einstein_2domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will organize and analyze the given information step by step.

Firstly, let's summarize the key points:

1. The British person likes red.
2. The Swedish person eats strawberry.
3. The Danish person lives in a tower house.
4. The green-liking person is to the left of the white-liking person.
5. The green-liking person lives in the townhouse.
6. The pall-mall smoker eats onion.
7. The yellow-liking person smokes dunhill.
8. The palace house is in the middle (3rd position).
9. The Norwegian is on the far left.
10. The blend-smoker is next to the lemon-eater.
11. The eggplant-eater is next to the dunhill-smoker.
12. The bluemaster smoker lives in a cottage.
13. The German person smokes prince.
14. The Norwegian is next to the blue-liking person.
15. The blend-smoker is next to the modern house.

Let's start filling in what we know:

**House Position:**
1 - Norwegian
2 - (Unknown)
3 - Palace (Middle)
4 - (Unknown)
5 - (Unknown)

**Color:**
1 - Blue or Yellow
2 - (Unknown)
3 - Green
4 - White
5 - Red

**Food:**
1 - Lemon
2 - (Unknown)
3 - Strawberry
4 - (Unknown)
5 - Lime

**Nationality:**
1 - Norwegian
2 - (Unknown)
3 - German (Prince smoker)
4 - (Unknown)
5 - British (Red)

**Cigar:**
1 - Dunhill (Yellow)
2 - (Unknown)
3 - Pall-mall (Onion)
4 - Blend
5 - Bluemaster (Cottage)

Given the green person is to the left of the white and lives in a townhouse, we can place:
- Green at 2.
- White at 4.

**House Position:**
1 - Norwegian
2 - Danish (Tower house)
3 - Palace (Middle)
4 - White
5 - Red

Now for foods:
- Strawberry at 3.
- Lemon and Lime must be 1, 5 or 2, 4. Since the blend smoker is next to lemon:
    - If Lemon is 1: Blend can't fit in between as it needs a space, so Lemon cannot be 1.
    - Therefore, Lemon can only be at position 2, and Lime must be at 5.

**House Position:**
1 - Norwegian (Lemon)
2 - Danish (Tower) 
3 - Palace
4 - White
5 - Red (lime)

Since the dunhill smoker is on the left or right of the eggplant-eater:
- Dunhill can't be in position 1, thus:
    - Dunhill must be at 2.
    - Eggplant at 4.

**House Position:**
1 - Norwegian (Lemon)
2 - Danish (Tower) and Dunhill
3 - Palace
4 - White (Eggplant)
5 - Red (Lime)

The final positions are:

- **lime:5**

This solution satisfies all the given constraints."	lime:4	lime:5	False	True
Einstein_2domain_replacements_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the information and deduce step by step.

1. We have five people, each associated with a color, sport, beverage, cigar brand, and birth month.
2. Each piece of information will help us narrow down their attributes.

First, we'll organize the clues:

- **Sport and Color:**
  - (Tennis) -> Red
  - Parkour is on the far left; thus, it can't be associated with Blue as per Clue 15.
  - Snowboarding and January -> (Snowboarding) is in January.

- **Beverage and Sport:**
  - (Skateboarding) -> Tea (Clue 3)
  - (Parkour) on the far left, so it can be Blue or Green; but we need to find out which one.
  - (Soccer) associated with Prince (Clue 14).

- **Cigar and Month:**
  - Pall-mall -> April (Clue 6)
  - June is missing its association.

- **Beverage Position:**
  - Milk is in the middle, so it's on position 3.
  
- **Color Order and Association:**
  - Green is left of White. Since Red and Blue are already associated with sports, Green must be next to White (2nd or 4th).
  - The order could be: X -> Green -> White -> Y -> Z.

Now let's use the clues one by one:

1. **Tennis = Red**, so this person is not on the far left and not in January.
2. **Parkour is Blue** (since it can't be associated with Blue due to Clue 15, and if we assume Blue -> Parkour), as Green has a neighbor White, leaving Blue for far left.
3. **Snowboarding = January** (Clue 2).
4. **Skateboarding = Tea** (Clue 3).
5. **Pall-mall = April** (Clue 6).
6. **Dunhill = Yellow** (Clue 7, since Yellow is left of Dunhill-smoker and not in the middle or far left).
7. **Milk is in the middle**, thus it's at position 3.
8. **Soccer = Prince-smoker** (Clue 13).
9. **Tennis = Red** -> Not on the far left or in January, so it must be June.

Thus, by process of elimination and logical deduction:
- Parkour is Blue
- Red: Tennis
- Snowboarding: January
- Skateboarding: Tea
- Pall-mall: April
- Dunhill: Yellow (since it's not middle)
- Milk: Middle (3rd position)
- Prince-smoker: Soccer

The person with June as their birth month must be the one who is neither on the far left, in January, or at the middle. Therefore:

**June: 5**

This means the person whose birthday is in June is associated with Blue (Parkour) and Dunhill cigar."	june:4	june:5	False	True

1. The British likes red.
2. The Swede plays cricket.
3. The Dane drinks tea.
4. Green is on the left of white.
5. Green person drinks coffee.
6. Person playing climbing travels to Venice.

12. Beer drinker travels to New York.
13. German travels to Liverpool.
14. Norwegian is next to the blue lover.

Let's construct a table to keep track:

| Position | Nationality   | Favorite Color  | Beverage      | Sport          | Traveling To |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | Blue            |               |                |              |
| 2        |              |                 |               |                |              |
| 3        |             |                 | Milk          |                |              |
| 4        |              |                 |               |                |              |
| 5        |              |                 |               |                |              |

**Clue Analysis:**
- Norwegian is at position 1 (clue 9).
- British likes red (clue 1).
- Swede plays cricket (clue 2).
- Dane drinks tea (clue 3).

So, the table becomes:

| Position | Nationality   | Favorite Color  | Beverage      | Sport          | Traveling To |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | Blue            |               |                |              |
| 2        |             |                 |               |                |              |
| 3        |             |                 | Milk          |                |              |
| 4        |             |                 |               |                |              |
| 5        |             |                 |               |                |              |

**Continuing with Clues:**
- Green is on the left of white (clue 4).
- Green person drinks coffee (clue 5).
- Person playing climbing travels to Venice (clue 6).
- Yellow person travels to Edinburgh (clue 7).

Clue 12 states that the beer drinker travels to New York. So, let's place those:

| Position | Nationality   | Favorite Color  | Beverage      | Sport          | Traveling To |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | Blue            |               |                |              |
| 2        |             |                 |               |                |              |
| 3        |             |                 | Milk          |                |              |
| 4        |             |                 | Beer          | Climbing       | New York     |
| 5        |             |                 |               |                |              |

Since the yellow person travels to Edinburgh, and we have no beverage or sport for position 4 yet, let's place it there.

| Position | Nationality   | Favorite Color  | Beverage      | Sport          | Traveling To |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | Blue            |               |                |              |
| 2        |             |                 |               |                |              |
| 3        |             |                 | Milk          |                |              |
| 4        | Yellow       |                 | Beer          | Climbing       | New York     |
| 5        |             |                 |               |                |              |

Next, the German travels to Liverpool (clue 13). So, let's place that.

| Position | Nationality   | Favorite Color  | Beverage      | Sport          | Traveling To |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | Blue            |               |                |              |
| 2        |             |                 |               |                |              |
| 3        |             |                 | Milk          |                |              |
| 4        | Yellow       |                 | Beer          | Climbing       | New York     |
| 5        | German       |                 |               |                | Liverpool    |

From clue 10, the person traveling to London is left or right of lacrosse player. The only unassigned sport for position 3 (besides cricket) is ice-hockey.

Clue 8 states that milk drinker is in the middle:

| Position | Nationality   | Favorite Color  | Beverage      | Sport          | Traveling To |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | Blue            |               |                |              |
| 2        |             |                 |               |                |              |
| 3        |             |                 | Milk          | Ice-hockey     |              |
| 4        | Yellow       |                 | Beer          | Climbing       | New York     |
| 5        | German       |                 |               |                | Liverpool    |

The remaining sports are lacrosse and skateboarding. Since the person playing climbing travels to New York, the remaining sport for position 1 is ice-hockey.

Clue 6 states that the person who likes green is on the left of white (clue 4). Clue 5 states that the green person drinks coffee. So, we place it at positions accordingly:

| Position | Nationality   | Favorite Color  | Beverage      | Sport          | Traveling To |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | Blue            |               | Ice-hockey     |              |
| 2        | Danish       | Green           | Coffee        |                |              |
| 3        |             |                 | Milk          | Ice-hockey     |              |
| 4        | Yellow       | Red             | Beer          | Climbing       | New York     |
| 5        | German       | White           |               |                | Liverpool    |

Thus, the ice-hockey is in position 1.

**Final Answer:**
ice-hockey:1"	ice-hockey:4	ice-hockey:1	False	True
