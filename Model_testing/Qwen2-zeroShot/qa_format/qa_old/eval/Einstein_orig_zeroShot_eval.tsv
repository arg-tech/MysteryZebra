Einstein_orig_1	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: House Colors and Nationalities

1. The Brit lives in a Red house.
2. The Swede keeps Dogs as pets.
3. The Dane drinks Tea.
4. The Green house is on the left of the White house.
5. The Green house owner drinks Coffee.
6. The Norwegian lives in the first house.

From 9, we know the order of houses and colors:
- Since the Green house is to the left of the White house and they are different from each other and the Red house (Brit's), let's place them.
- From 4: Green - ?; White - ?
- The Norwegian lives in the first house. Let’s put that down.

We can start setting up the houses as follows:
1. Norwegian
2. ?
3. ?
4. Green
5. White

### Step 2: Beverages and Cigars

7. The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds.
8. The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.
9. The owner living in the center house drinks Milk.

Now, fill in the beverages and cigars:
1. Norwegian (Blue)
2. ?
3. ?
4. Green (Coffee)
5. White

### Step 3: Pets, Cigars, and Beverages

6. The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8. The owner living in the center house drinks Milk.

Now we know:
1. Norwegian
2. ?
3. ?
4. Green - Coffee
5. White

From 7 and 8: 
- Pall Mall smoker rears Birds (must be outside the Green/White row).
- Yellow house is Dunhill (center house).

So, center house drinks Milk and smokes Dunhill:
1. Norwegian (Blue)
2. ?
3. ?
4. Green - Coffee
5. White

### Step 4: Remaining Clues

10. The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats.
11. The owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.
12. The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer.
13. The German smokes Prince.
14. The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house (must be Blue).
15. The owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water.

From 10 and 11:
- Dunhill is in center, so neighbors must have Cats or Horses.
- Since Blend and Water are adjacent, one of them must be in middle two houses.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. Norwegian (Blue)
2. ?
3. ?
4. Green - Coffee
5. White

From 9:
- Center house drinks Milk and smokes Dunhill: House 3.
- Thus, House 2 or 4/5 must have Blend or Cats.

From 7, 6, and 12:
- Houses 2 or 4 must be Pall Mall (Birds) and Yellow (Dunhill).
- Bluemaster drinks Beer: Must be in a valid spot.
- House 3 is center so Drink Milk - Dunhill.

### Filling Remaining Holes:

- From Clue 15, Blend and Water are adjacent:
  - So if Blend is 2, then Water must be 4 or vice versa.
  
From clues 10 & 11:
- House with Cats next to Dunhill in center (House 3).
- Horse next to Dunhill: Must be in 2 or 4.

### Assigning Values:

1. Norwegian - Blue
2. German - Red
3. Dunhill, Milk (Drinkers)
4. Pall Mall, Birds (Pet)
5. White

Blend and Water:
- House 2: Blend (Water next to it)
- House 4: Cats (Dunhill neighbor)

Final placement:
1. Norwegian - Blue
2. German - Red
3. Dunhill, Milk
4. Pall Mall, Birds
5. White

### Fish Location:
From the remaining pet types and placements, Fish must be in the house with Horses.

Thus, Fish is in House 4 (Pall Mall, Birds).

**Fish:4**"	Fish:4	fish:4	True	True
Einstein_orig_2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information systematically into a 5-house grid. Here’s how we can approach it step-by-step:

1. **House Colors and Nationalities:**
   - The Brit lives in a Red house.
   - The Norwegian lives in the first house (Num 1).
   - The Dane drinks Tea (Clue 3).

2. **Beverages and Cigars:**
   - The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats (Clue 10).
   - The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill (Clue 7).
   - The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds (Clue 6).
   - The owner who drinks Milk lives in the center house (Num 3) (Clue 8).
   - The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer (Clue 12).
   - The German smokes Prince (Clue 13).

3. **Pets and Cigars:**
   - The owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill (Clue 11).
   - The Swede keeps Dogs as pets (Clue 2).
   - The Green house is on the left of the White house (Clue 4), so if we number houses from left to right, we can write: 
     - House 1: Norwegian
     - House 2: Blue
     - House 3: Milk
     - House 4: Coffee
     - House 5: White

4. **Color and Nationality of the Green House Owner:**
   - The owner who drinks Coffee lives in the fourth house (Clue 5).
   - Therefore, the green house is Num 4.
   - The Red house (Num 1) belongs to the Brit.

5. **Putting it all Together:**

Let's place this information into a grid:

```
House | Color       | Nationality  | Beverage     | Cigar        | Pet
----------------------------------------------
    1 | Norwegian   | Blue         |              | Dunhill      | Horses (since they're next to White)
    2 |            |              |              |              |
    3 | Milk        |              |              |              | 
    4 | Green       |              | Coffee       |              | Birds
    5 | White       |              |              |              | Fish

Now, we know:
- Brit (Red house): Drinks beer and smokes Bluemaster.
- German: Smokes Prince.
- The center house is the Milk drinker, so it must be Num 3.
```

Since the Norwegian lives in the first house and has horses, and House 4 contains birds:

The Blue house owner could not have pets (since each pet belongs to a unique owner), and considering the neighbor relationship for cats, we get:
- Blend cigarette holder is next to Cat owner. 
- The center is Milk.

Now focusing on Fish:
- The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill, which means the Norwegian lives in the first house with horses.
- The Blue house has no pets, so Fish must belong to someone else.

Let's re-evaluate:

House 1: Norwegian - Horses
House 2: Danish - Tea (since he drinks tea and cannot be Milk owner)
House 3: Milk drinker 
House 4: Coffee, Birds 
House 5: White - Fish

So the final positions are:
- The Fish belongs to the person living in House 5.

Thus, **Fish:5**."	Fish:4	fish:5	False	True
Einstein_orig_3	"To solve this puzzle, we will use deductive reasoning based on the given clues. Let's organize the information step by step:

1. **House Colors and Nationalities:**
   - Blue (B)
   - Green (G)
   - Red (R) - Brit lives here.
   - White (W)
   - Yellow (Y)

2. **Owners' Beverages:**
   - Beer
   - Coffee
   - Milk - center house.
   - Tea - Dane drinks this.
   - Water

3. **Cigars:**
   - Bluemaster - owner drinks Beer.
   - Blend - lives next to the one who keeps Cats.
   - Dunhill - Norwegian, owner of Yellow house.
   - Pall Mall - rears Birds.
   - Prince - German.

4. **Pets:**
   - Cats
   - Dogs - Swede
   - Fish (to be determined)
   - Horses - lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.
   - Birds

5. **House Order and Clues:**
   - Green is left of White.
   - Norwegian in first house, next to Blue.
   - The middle house drinks Milk.

We can use these clues step by step:

- From clue 9, the Norwegian lives in the first house. So, House 1 = Norwegian.
- Clue 14 states that the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house. Therefore, House 2 must be blue (B).
- Clue 1 tells us the Brit lives in a Red house. Since the Red house is not mentioned as being adjacent to any other specific color, it can't be the first or second house but has to fit somewhere logically.
- Clue 5 states that the Green house owner drinks Coffee. The Green house is left of White (Clue 4). Let's place these colors in a possible order: G, B, R, W, Y.

So, we have:
1. Norwegian - B
2. Blue - B (confirmed)
3. Red - Brit
4. Green - Drinks Coffee.
5. White - Milk

Since the Green house is left of White and there are only two houses remaining for the Red and White, let's fit them in order:

- House 3 = Red (Brit), House 4 = White.

Now we need to place Yellow and confirm the rest:

- From clue 7, Dunhill owner rears Birds.
- From clue 10, Blend lives next to Cats. So, the sequence for these must be: Y, (Blend - Cats), (Pall Mall - Birds).

Given that the Norwegian is in House 1:
- House 2 = B
- House 3 = Red (Brit)
- House 4 = White (Milk drinker)
- House 5 = Yellow.

From clue 8, center house drinks Milk. We confirm this already fits into House 4.
Now, let's place the last pieces:

- Dunhill in House 5 - Norwegian, Birds.
- From clues 12 and 6: Bluemaster (Beer) = Red (Brit).
- From clue 3: Dane drinks Tea, must be White house.
- From clue 11: Horses lives next to Dunhill. So, it's in the Yellow house.

We can now place Fish:

Since all other pets are placed:
- Cats - Blend
- Birds - Dunhill (Yellow)
- Dogs - Swede (not given a specific color but fits here logically).
- Fish - Remaining pet, must be in the Red or Blue house. Since the only available house with no pet yet is Red and it's not excluded from housing any pet.

So, **Fish:3** (Red).

Final arrangement:
1. Norwegian - B
2. Dane - G (Drinks Tea)
3. Brit - R (Drinks Water)
4. German - W (Blends Cats)
5. Swede - Y (Dunhill, Birds, Horses)

Fish is in the Red house: **Fish:3**"	Fish:4	fish:3	False	True
