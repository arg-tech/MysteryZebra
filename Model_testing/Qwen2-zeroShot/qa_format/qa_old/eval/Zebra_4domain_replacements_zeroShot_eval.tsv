Zebra_4domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize and deduce the information step by step based on the given clues. Let's break it down:

1. Lacrosse -> Mystery Movies
2. Polo -> Social-Worker
3. Coffee -> Horror Movies
4. Snowboarding -> Tea
5. Horror Movies (Num) -> Adventure Movies + 1
6. Cranberry -> Engineer
7. Spinach -> Western Movies
8. Milk -> Middle Position
9. Cricket -> Biathlon
10. Cranberry -> Chef (or Bartender, but we need to determine this)
11. Spinach -> Chef or Bartender
12. Grapes -> Orange Juice
13. Biathlon -> Lime
14. Cricket -> Drama Movies

Let's start by identifying the fixed positions and relationships:

- **Position 5 is middle**, so milk is in position 5.
- **Lacrosse** is with Mystery Movies, which means they are either adjacent or separated by one person (since Horror movies must be to the right of Adventure).
- Polo is associated with a Social-Worker. So, the social-worker has polo as their sport.
- Coffee is associated with Horror Movies, so the person who drinks coffee watches Horror movies.
- Snowboarding -> Tea
- Spinach -> Western Movies, so spinach is with Western movies.
- Cricket is on the far left and associated with Biathlon, which means Cricket -> Biathlon.
- Lime is with Biathlon (Cricket), so Lime must be in a position where it's adjacent to the person who watches Drama movies.

Now let's place everything step by step:

1. Let’s denote the positions as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:
   - Position 5 is Milk.
   
2. Since **Horror (Coffee) > Adventure (Movies)**, Horror must be to the right of Adventure.

3. **Lacrosse** -> Mystery Movies means Lacrosse must be adjacent to Mystery (Num1 or Num4).

4. Polo is with Social-Worker. Let's place them at position 2 (since it helps us use other clues better). So, Position 2: Social-Worker and Sport: Polo.

5. Cricket is on the far left, so let’s place it in Position 1. Position 1: Cricket -> Biathlon.
   
6. Spinach (Western) is not next to Coffee (Horror), so we need to find a suitable position for Western. Let's place Spinach at Position 3 since it can't be adjacent to Horror (Coffee).

7. That leaves Position 4 and 5, but Milk must be in 5.

8. So, let’s recheck:
   - Position 1: Cricket -> Biathlon
   - Position 2: Social-Worker & Polo
   - Position 3: Spinach -> Western Movies (not next to Horror)
   - Position 4: Mystery (Lacrosse) and not adjacent to Horror.
   - Position 5: Milk

9. So, Horror must be in Position 6 if Adventure is in position 2.

10. Position 4 must be Mystery with Lacrosse.

11. The person drinking Tea is doing Snowboarding, which means the Snowboarder is in a position not next to Coffee (Horror) or Lime (Biathlon).

So far:
- **Position 1: Cricket -> Biathlon** (Lime)
- **Position 2: Social-Worker & Polo**
- **Position 3: Spinach -> Western Movies**
- **Position 4: Mystery with Lacrosse**
- **Position 5: Milk**

And:
- The person drinking Tea is Snowboarding.
- The person eating Grapes is Orange Juice.

Now, let's assign jobs and sports based on the remaining clues:

12. The Chef has to eat something not next to Bartender, so if Chef eats Spinach (Western) or Cranberry (Engineer), Bartender must have something else. Let’s place:
   - Position 3: Spinach -> Western Movies, so Chef = Engineer.
   - Position 4: Mystery with Lacrosse.

Finally, the remaining positions and people fit as follows:

- **Position 1:** Cricket -> Biathlon (Lime)
- **Position 2:** Social-Worker & Polo
- **Position 3:** Spinach -> Western Movies (Chef, Engineer)
- **Position 4:** Mystery with Lacrosse
- **Position 5:** Milk

And the person who's sport is cricket (far left) and watches drama:

So, water must be in position 2 because it’s not specified to any other role.

Thus:
**water:2**"	water:1	water:2	False	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's organize and map out all the clues step by step.

1. The sport ""lacrosse"" corresponds to mystery movies.
2. The sport ""polo"" corresponds to social-worker.
3. The person drinking coffee is watching horror movies.
4. The sport ""snowboarding"" corresponds to tea.
5. The person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies.
6. The person eating cranberry is the engineer.
7. The person eating spinach is watching western movies.
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (position 3).
9. The sport ""cricket"" is on the far left.
10. The person eating cauliflower is to the left or right of the chef.
11. The person eating spinach is to the left or right of the bartender.
12. The person eating grapes is drinking orange-juice.
13. The sport ""biathlon"" corresponds to lime.
14. The sport ""cricket"" is to the left or right of the person watching drama movies.

Now, let's deduce step by step:

- Cricket (far left) -> Lacrosse (mystery)
- Polo (social-worker) 
- Coffee (horror)
- Snowboarding (tea)

Given that there are 5 positions and milk is in position 3:
- Since coffee (horror) is to the right of adventure movies, horror cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, horror must be in position 4 or 5.
- Position 3 is for milk.

Positions: 
1 - Cricket -> Lacrosse (mystery)
2 - ? 
3 - Milk
4 - Coffee (horror)  
5 - ?

From the remaining clues:
- Spinach (western movies) and cranberry (engineer) cannot be in position 3, so they must be in positions 1 or 2.
- Lime (biathlon) and grape-orange juice are the only other food-beverage pairs left for positions 1-5.

Since cricket is at far left (position 1):
1 - Cricket -> Lacrosse (mystery)

Polo (social-worker) can't be with lacrosse, so it must be in position 2:
2 - Polo (social-worker)

Horror movies are to the right of adventure, and coffee is horror. This leaves us with positions for adventure and drama.
Since horror is at position 4, adventure can only be at position 2.

3 - Milk
4 - Coffee (horror)  
5 - ?

The engineer eats cranberry:
6 - Cranberry -> Engineer

Spinach must go to the western movie spot, which can't be in position 1 or 2.
7 - Spinach -> Western movies

Grapes are with orange juice. Since spinach is not adjacent to bartender and chef (clue 10), and engineer has cranberry:
8 - Grapes -> Orange juice
9 - Lime -> Biathlon

Now, the leftmost sport ""cricket"" must be with drama since cricket is at position 1 and cannot be next to drama movies.
10 - Cricket -> Drama 

This leaves us with:
2 - Polo (social-worker)
3 - Milk
4 - Coffee (horror)  
5 - Biathlon (lime)

The only positions left are for adventure and bartender/chef, which must fit the remaining clues.

So, the final arrangement is:

- 1: Cricket -> Drama
- 2: Polo (social-worker)
- 3: Milk
- 4: Coffee (horror)  
- 5: Biathlon (lime)

The person who's sport is cricket is a social worker. Hence, the pilot must be in position 3.

**pilot:3**"	pilot:5	pilot:3	False	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person whose hobby is singing likes red.
2. The person whose hobby is video-games lives in the colonial house.
3. The journalist likes green.
4. The person whose hobby is board-games is the electrician.
5. The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
6. The person watching satire movies lives in the gothic-revival house.
7. The person watching documentary movies likes yellow.
8. The freelancer is in the middle (3rd position).
9. The person whose hobby is cooking is on the far left (1st position).
10. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the farmhouse house.
11. The person watching documentary movies is to the left or right of the craftsman house.
12. The person watching mystery movies is the lawyer.
13. The person whose hobby is magic-tricks watches horror movies.
14. The person whose hobby is cooking is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.

Let's summarize the information we have:

- The order must be such that green is to the right of ivory.
- Yellow likes documentary movies, and it is either next to the craftsman house or on its side.
- Satire movie watcher lives in gothic-revival.
- Fantasy movies are with farmhouse or to one side.
- Mystery movies are for the lawyer.

First, let's establish positions:

1. Cooking: This must be either 1st as stated.
2. Freelancer: In 3rd position.
3. Green (journalist): Must be after Ivory in the color sequence.

Let’s assign the houses and hobbies first based on fixed information:
- Cooking is at 1st
- Freelancer is at 3rd

Since we know yellow likes documentary, it must be either 2nd or 4th position to satisfy that it's next to craftsman or colonial.
Gothic-revival with satire movies can only fit in the remaining positions.

Now let’s figure out colors and their positions:
Ivory (1st), Red (Hobby of Singing, must be at a different position, not 1).
Green (Journalist) is after Ivory.
Yellow (Documentary) can't be first or third.
Blue and its relation to cooking and magic tricks need figuring out.

Let's place the houses:
House 1: Cooking
House 2: Yellow (Doc)
House 3: Freelancer
House 4: (Gothic or Colonial)
House 5: (Fantasy with Lawyer)

Now, let’s fill in colors and jobs:

Ivory is at 1st position.
Red is not 1st as it's the singer.
Green is after Ivory (2nd or 3rd).
Yellow likes documentary, so Yellow must be 2nd.
Blue can only fit as it doesn’t conflict with given constraints.

Now, sorting out:
1. Cooking - Ivory
2. Documentary - Yellow
3. Freelancer - Green
4. Magic Tricks - Horror
5. Fantasy - Lawyer

Given the constraints about blue and magic-tricks, and that cooking is left of blue, we can infer:

- Blue must be 5th (rightmost).

Finally:
Librarian must occupy a position not yet assigned. Given the structure and constraints, it fits best in 4th.

Therefore: **librarian:4**"	librarian:1	librarian:4	False	True

1. The person whose hobby is singing likes red.
2. The person whose hobby is video-games lives in the colonial house.
3. The journalist likes green.
4. The person whose hobby is board-games is the electrician.
5. The person who likes green (the journalist) is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
6. The person watching satire movies lives in the gothic-revival house.
7. The person watching documentary movies likes yellow.
8. The freelancer is in the middle.
9. The person whose hobby is cooking is on the far left.
10. The person watching fantasy movies is either to the left or right of the farmhouse house.
11. The person watching documentary movies is to the left or right of the craftsman house.
12. The person watching mystery movies is the lawyer.
13. The person whose hobby is magic-tricks watches horror movies.
14. The person whose hobby is cooking is either to the left or right of the person who likes blue.

Let's assign houses and colors, hobbies, movie genres, and jobs step by step:

### Step 1: Positions
- **House order:** Colonial (2), Farmhouse (3), Townhouse (4), Craftsman (5), Gothic-revival (1)
- Freelancer is in the middle -> Townhouse is House #4

Let's fill out the houses and their respective positions:
```
Hobby   Color  Job       Movie Genre
-----------------------------------
Magic-tricks    ?      Electrician  Horror
Cooking        Yellow Freelancer  Documentary
Singing        Red    Journalist  Satire
Board-games    Ivory Freelancer  ?
Video-games    Colonial?   ?       ?
Fantasy        ?      ?          Lawyer
Mystery        ?      Lawyer     Mystery
```

### Step 2: Placing People and Colors
- Person whose hobby is singing likes red.
  - Red -> Singing

- Person whose hobby is video-games lives in the colonial house:
  - Colonial -> Video-games (position 2)

- The journalist likes green, which is to the right of the person who likes ivory:
  - Green -> Journalist
  - Ivory -> must be on position 3 or earlier.
  
Since the Freelancer is in the middle (Townhouse), and the Journalist is to the right of the person who likes Ivory, the only spot for Ivory is position 3.

- Ivory -> Position 3

Thus:
```
Hobby   Color  Job       Movie Genre
-----------------------------------
Magic-tricks    ?      Electrician  Horror
Cooking        Yellow Freelancer  Documentary
Singing        Red    Journalist  Satire
Board-games    Ivory Freelancer  ?
Video-games    Colonial?   ?       ?
Fantasy        ?      ?          Lawyer
Mystery        ?      Lawyer     Mystery
```

### Step 3: Placing Jobs and Hobbies
- The person whose hobby is board-games is the electrician.
  - Electrician -> Board-games

- Person watching satire movies lives in the gothic-revival house:
  - Satire -> Gothic-revival (position 1)

- Person watching documentary movies likes yellow, must be left of craftsman:
  - Documentary -> Yellow
  - Craftsman -> must be on position 5 or earlier.

- Freelancer is in the middle (Townhouse):
  - Townhouse:4

### Step 4: Placing Remaining People and Colors
- The person whose hobby is cooking is on the far left, thus:
  - Cooking -> Far Left
  - Yellow -> Documentary (left of craftsman)

- Person watching fantasy movies must be either to the left or right of farmhouse.
  - Fantasy -> Must be either position 2 or 3

- Person who likes green (journalist) is to the right of ivory, thus:
  - Ivory -> Position 3
  - Green -> Journalist

### Step 5: Final Placement and Validation
```
Hobby   Color  Job       Movie Genre
-----------------------------------
Cooking        Yellow Freelancer  Documentary
Singing        Red    Journalist  Satire
Board-games    Ivory Freelancer  ?
Video-games    Colonial?   ?       ?
Fantasy        ?      ?          Lawyer
Mystery        ?      Lawyer     Mystery
```

- The person who likes green (Journalist) is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
- The person whose hobby is magic-tricks watches horror movies, thus:
  - Magic-Tricks -> Horror

- Person whose hobby is cooking is either left or right of blue. 
  - Blue -> Position 5
  - Cooking -> Far Left (Position 1)

Final arrangement:

```
Hobby   Color  Job       Movie Genre
-----------------------------------
Cooking        Yellow Freelancer  Documentary
Singing        Red    Journalist  Satire
Board-games    Ivory Freelancer  ?
Video-games    Colonial?   ?       ?
Fantasy        Blue     Electrician Horror
Mystery        ?      Lawyer     Mystery
```

Thus, the Townhouse is in position **4**.

The answer is: `townhouse:4`"	townhouse:5	townhouse:4	False	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_2	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues.

1. The fan of r&b is the person who grows aconite.
2. The fan of dubstep is the person whose birthday is in September.
3. The person drinking coffee is the person who grows iris.
4. The fan of punk is the person drinking tea.
5. The person who grows iris is to the right of the person who grows rose.
6. The person watching musical movies is the person whose birthday is in July.
7. The person watching western movies is the person who grows daffodil.
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle.
9. The fan of pop is on the far left.
10. The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in April.
11. The person watching western movies is to the left or right of the person whose birthday is in August.
12. The person watching fantasy movies is the person drinking orange-juice.
13. The fan of house is the person watching horror movies.
14. The fan of pop is to the left or right of the person who grows begonia.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Pop fan (9) must be on the far left.
- Aconite grower (1) must like r&b.
- Iris grower (3) drinks coffee and likes musicals (6).
- Dubstep listener (2) has a birthday in September.
- Rose grower is to the left of iris grower (5), so it cannot be on the far left or rightmost position.
- Daffodil grower watches western movies (7), and this person's birthday must not be in July, April, or August due to other constraints.
- Milk drinker is in the middle (8).
- House fan (13) likes horror movies, so they watch horror movies.
- Fantasy watcher drinks orange juice (12).

Let’s place these elements:

1. Pop fan: This person must be in position 1.
2. Aconite grower with r&b preference: This cannot be position 1 or the far right, so let's assume it is position 4 since other positions are taken.
3. Iris grower drinks coffee and watches musicals: This cannot be in position 1 (pop fan) or 4 (aconite), must be in one of the middle positions, let’s try position 2 for now.
4. Dubstep listener with September birthday: Must be on a different side, so we can place them in position 3 for now.
5. Rose grower to the right of iris grower: So it cannot be in position 1 or 2 but must be either 5 or 3 (since 4 is taken by Aconite), let’s assume 5.
6. Daffodil grower watches western movies and their birthday can’t be July, April, or August, so we place them at a different side, position 3 fits here as well but needs to be checked with other constraints.
7. Milk drinker in the middle: Position 4 for now.
8. House fan watching horror movies: This cannot be in positions where pop is (1) and aconite is (4), so it’s either 2 or 5, let's assume 5.

Let’s arrange it step-by-step while checking:
- Position 1: Pop fan
- Position 2: Iris grower drinking coffee and watches musicals.
- Position 3: Dubstep listener with September birthday.
- Position 4: Aconite grower with r&b preference (to the right of rose).
- Position 5: Rose grower, Daffodil grower watching western movies.

Now we place:
- Milk drinker in middle (Position 4), but we need to check if this works.
- House fan watches horror and must be either 2 or 5, let’s try 2.

Thus:

1. Pop
2. Iris (Coffee, Musical)
3. September birthday (Dubstep)
4. Aconite (r&b) -> Rose grower to the right.
5. Rose (Aconite to its left), Daffodil (Western).

So we place:
- Milk in 4.
- House fan with horror is 2.

Final arrangement:

1. Pop
2. Iris (Coffee, Musical)
3. September birthday (Dubstep)
4. Aconite (r&b) -> Rose grower to the right.
5. Rose (Aconite to its left), Daffodil (Western).

Now we need milk and water positions. The milk is in 4.

Thus:
- Water: 3

So, the final arrangement with all constraints satisfied:

1. Pop
2. Iris (Coffee, Musical)
3. Water
4. Aconite (r&b) -> Rose grower to the right.
5. Rose (Aconite to its left), Daffodil (Western).

Thus:
**water: 3**"	water:1	water:3	False	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down and solve this puzzle step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify Fixed Positions:**
   - The fan of r&b is the person who grows aconite.
   - The fan of dubstep is the person whose birthday is in September.
   - The person drinking coffee is the person who grows iris.
   - The fan of punk is the person drinking tea.
   - The person watching musical movies is the person whose birthday is in July.
   - The person watching western movies is the person who grows daffodil.
   - The person drinking milk is in the middle (position 3).
   - The fan of pop is on the far left (position 1).
   - The person watching fantasy movies is the person drinking orange-juice.
   - The fan of house is the person watching horror movies.

2. **Determine the Remaining Variables:**
   - The person who grows iris drinks coffee.
   - The person who grows aconite likes r&b.
   - The person who grows daffodil watches western movies.
   - The person whose birthday is in July watches musical movies.
   - The person drinking milk is in position 3.

3. **Positions and Preferences:**
   - Position 1 (leftmost) is occupied by the fan of pop.
   - Position 2 is the fan of house, who watches horror movies.
   - Position 3 (middle) drinks milk.
   - Position 4 is a vacant spot for now.
   - Position 5 (rightmost) is either the person drinking orange-juice or has a specific preference we need to determine.

From here, let's analyze and place the remaining variables:

### Placing Remaining Variables
1. **Fan of Pop:**
   - Position 1

2. **House Fan:**
   - Position 2 (watches horror movies)

3. **Milk:**
   - Position 3

4. **Orange Juice:**
   - Since the person drinking orange juice watches fantasy, this position is either 4 or 5.

5. **Aconite Grower:**
   - This is the fan of r&b.
   - Aconite must be in one of positions where r&b is preferred (not fixed yet).

6. **Iris Grower:**
   - Drinks coffee.
   - Position 1 or position to the right of rose.

7. **Daffodil Grower:**
   - Watches western movies.
   - Position 4 or 5, and not in aconite's position (position 2).

8. **R&b Fan:**
   - Grows aconite.

9. **Dubstep Fan:**
   - Birthday in September.

10. **Punk Fan:**
    - Drinks tea.

11. **Musical Movies:**
    - Person whose birthday is in July (already placed).

12. **Western Movies:**
    - Daffodil grower.
    - Position 4 or 5, not position 3 (milk), and not position 2 (house fan).

13. **Fantasy Movies:**
    - Orange juice drinker.

14. **Horror Movies:**
    - House fan, already placed at position 2.

### Determine the Specific Positions:
- Position 5 can only be orange juice or February.
- Daffodil grower watches western movies and must be in 4 or 5.
- Iris grower drinks coffee (position 1) and is to right of rose. So, aconite (r&b fan) is position 2.

Given the constraints:
- Iris (coffee): Position 1
- Aconite (r&b): Position 2
- Daffodil: Position 4 or 5.
- House (horror): Position 2.
- Milk: Position 3.

Now, let's place positions:

- Iris coffee in position 1.
- Aconite r&b in position 2.
- Dubstep is in September and must be in position 9 - so he can't be in 4 or 5. 
- Daffodil western: Must be in 4 (as 5 is left).
- Milk in middle, which is position 3.

Now, only February can fit:

### Final Placement:
1. Fan of pop
2. Aconite r&b
3. Coffee drinker (Iris)
4. Daffodil western
5. Orange juice (fantasy)

Thus, the position for **february** is in Position 5.
