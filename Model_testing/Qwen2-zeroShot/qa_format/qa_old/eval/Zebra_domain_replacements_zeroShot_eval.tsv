Zebra_5domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information into a structured format, such as a 5x4 grid where rows represent people (1-5) and columns represent categories (food, music genre, house type, game).

Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The fan of indie is the person eating onion.**
   - Indie: Person 1
   - Food: Onion

2. **The fan of pop is the person who grows azalea.**
   - Pop: Person 2
   - Flower: Azalea

3. **The person playing go is the person eating zucchini.**
   - Go: Person 3
   - Food: Zucchini

4. **The fan of techno is the person playing domino.**
   - Techno: Person 4
   - Game: Domino

5. **The person eating zucchini is to the right of the person eating carrot.**
   - Zucchini (Person 3) > Carrot (Person 2)

6. **The colonial house is the person who grows bellflower.**
   - Colonial: Person 4
   - Flower: Bellflower

7. **The victorian house is the person eating radish.**
   - Radish (Person 5)
   - House: Victorian

8. **The person playing monopoly is in the middle.**
   - Monopoly: Person 3

9. **The fan of electronic is on the far left.**
   - Electronic: Person 1

10. **The gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold.**
    - Let's denote this as a relationship for now.

11. **The victorian house is to the left or right of the person who grows orchid.**
    - Victorian (Person 5) > Orchid

12. **The townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg.**
    - Townhouse: Person 4
    - Game: Mah-Jongg

13. **The fan of trance is the futuristic house.**
    - Trance: Person 1
    - House: Futuristic

14. **The fan of electronic is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce.**
    - Electronic (Person 1) > Lettuce (Person 3)

From these relationships, we can fill in more details:

- The fan of indie is Person 1 and eats onion.
- The fan of pop is Person 2 and grows azalea.
- The person playing go is Person 3 and eats zucchini.
- The fan of techno is Person 4 and plays domino.
- The colonial house (Person 4) grows bellflower.
- The victorian house (Person 5) eats radish.
- Monopoly is played by Person 3.
- The electronic fan is on the far left (Person 1).
- The gothic-revival house must be either to the left or right of the person who grows marigold. Given the position, it's likely that this relation involves Person 2 or 3 since they are adjacent to Person 1.
- The victorian house is to the left or right of the person who grows orchid (Person 5).
- The townhouse plays mah-jongg and must be either to the left or right of the person playing go (Person 3).

Let's finalize based on the positions:

```
| Person | Food    | Music     | House      | Game       |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|------------|
|   1    | Onion   | Indie     | Futuristic | Electronic |
|   2    | Carrot  | Pop       |            |            |
|   3    | Zucchini|           | Colonial   | Go         |
|   4    |        | Techno    | Gothic-rev | Mah-jongg  |
|   5    | Radish  |           | Victorian  | Monopoly   |
```

Based on the clues, we can deduce:

- Person 2 (eating carrot) is to the left of Person 1.
- Person 4 (playing mah-jongg and colonial house) must be between Person 3 (go and zucchini) and Person 5 (monopoly and victorian).

This results in the following arrangement:
```
| Person | Food    | Music     | House      | Game       |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|------------|
|   1    | Onion   | Indie     | Futuristic | Electronic |
|   2    | Carrot  | Pop       |            |            |
|   3    | Zucchini|           | Colonial   | Go         |
|   4    |         | Techno    | Gothic-rev | Mah-jongg  |
|   5    | Radish  |           | Victorian  | Monopoly   |
```

Finally, the position of chess:
- The only game left is chess.
- Chess: Person 2

Thus, **chess:2**."	chess:1	chess:2	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically determine the position and corresponding attributes for each individual based on the given statements. Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Determine the positions of the houses**: There are 5 houses in total (colonial, victorian, gothic-revival, townhouse, futuristic), so we will assign them numbers from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

2. **Assign attributes based on given statements**:
   - The fan of indie is the person eating onion.
   - The fan of pop is the person who grows azalea.
   - The person playing go is the person eating zucchini.
   - The fan of techno is the person playing domino.
   - The person eating zucchini is to the right of the person eating carrot.
   - The colonial house is the person who grows bellflower.
   - The victorian house is the person eating radish.
   - The person playing monopoly is in the middle (position 3).
   - The fan of electronic is on the far left (position 1).
   - The gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold.
   - The victorian house is to the left or right of the person who grows orchid.
   - The townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg.
   - The fan of trance is the futuristic house (position 5).
   - The fan of electronic is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce.

3. **Start filling in the positions and attributes**:
   
   - Position 1: Electronic fan, must be colonial or victorian since victorian eats radish.
     - This implies position 2 cannot be victorian (since it's to the right).
     - So electronic fan is colonial.

4. **Colonial house**: Grows bellflower (from statement 6).

5. **Victorian house**:
   - Position 3, eats radish.
   - Gothic-revival can't be adjacent to marigold, so it must be position 1 or 2; but position 1 is colonial.
     - Therefore, Gothic-revival is either 4th or 5th.

6. **Position 3 (Victorian)**: Eats radish and plays monopoly.

7. **Tenth statement**:
   - Townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg (position 2).
   
8. **Mah-jongg player cannot be in position 1 or 5 since electronic fan and trance fan are there.
     - Position 2 must play mah-jongg.

9. **Position 4 or 5 (Gothic-revival)**:
   - Gothic-revival is adjacent to marigold, so it's either 4th or 5th.
   
10. **Fifth position**:
    - Fan of trance lives in the futuristic house: Position 5.

11. **Second position (Mah-jongg player)**:
     - Must be playing mah-jongg and not electronic fan, so it cannot be 4th or 5th.
     - Therefore, Gothic-revival is position 4.

12. **Third position**:
    - Eats radish and plays monopoly: Position 3 (Victorian).

13. **Fourth position**:
    - Can only be victorian or gothic-revival; but victorian is taken.
     - Therefore, Gothic-revival house is at position 4.

14. **First position**:
    - Electronic fan, grows bellflower: Position 1 (Colonial).

15. **Second position**:
    - Plays mah-jongg: Position 2.

16. **Third position**:
    - Eats radish and plays monopoly: Position 3 (Victorian).

17. **Fourth position**:
    - Gothic-revival house, marigold, can be on either side of the person who grows orchid.
     - Therefore, it is in this spot.

18. **Fifth position**:
    - Fan of trance, futuristic: Position 5 (Trance fan).

Now we determine the order:

- Colonial: Electronic fan, bellflower
- Townhouse: Mah-jongg player
- Victorian: Plays monopoly and eats radish
- Gothic-revival: Playing domino, marigold
- Futuristic: Trance fan

We need to place the flowers now:
- Azalea (Pop) in one of positions 1 or 2.
- Bellflower (Colonial).
- Marigold (Gothic-revival).
- Orchid (Victorian or Gothic-revival).
- Dahlia (TBC).

Since victorian and gothic-revival are adjacent, the only placement for orchid is position 3. This leaves:

- Azalea: Position 2.
- Marigold: Position 4.
- Dahlia: Position 3.

Thus, **dahlia** is in position **3**.

So, the final answer is:
```
dahlia:3
```"	dahlia:5	dahlia:3	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each element based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Gospel fan:** traveling to Prague.
2. **d&b fan:** plays ice-hockey.
3. **Chef:** traveling to Hannover.
4. **Ambient fan:** bartender.
5. **Hannover traveler is right of Edinburgh traveler**.
6. **Sudoku hobbyist:** baseball sport.
7. **Photography hobbyist:** Rome traveler.
8. **Dressmaker in the middle** (3rd position).
9. **Soul fan on far left**.
10. **Film hobbyist next to badminton sport**.
11. **Photography hobbyist next to cricket sport**.
12. **Skydiving hobbyist is software-developer**.
13. **Blues fan:** cooking hobby.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

#### Step 1: Placing the Soul Fan
The soul fan is on the far left, so:
```
Soul Fan: 1
```

#### Step 2: Placing the Chef and Traveler to Hannover
The chef is traveling to Hannover and the person traveling to Hannover is to the right of the person traveling to Edinburgh.
Let's place them in a tentative order for now:
```
Edinburgh, X, Hannover (Chef)
```

#### Step 3: Placing the Gospel Fan
The gospel fan travels to Prague. Since it can't be soul or d&b, and Prague is not next to Edinburgh (as they need a gap), we place it as:
```
Prague: Gospel Fan
```

#### Step 4: Placing the d&b Fan
d&b fan plays ice-hockey, so he's in position 2. He can't be on the far left or right of the soul fan.
```
Soul Fan (1): | Ice-Hockey Player (2)
Prague: Gospel Fan
```

#### Step 5: Placing the Traveler to Hannover and Edinburgh
The chef is traveling to Hannover, and Hannover is to the right of Edinburgh:
```
Edinburgh, X, Hannover (Chef)
```

Since the person playing ice-hockey (d&b fan) can't be in the middle or rightmost position due to positioning constraints.
```
Soul Fan: 1
Prague: Gospel Fan
Ice-Hockey Player: 2
X, Hannover (Chef), 
```

#### Step 6: Placing the Dressmaker and Software-Developer
Dressmaker is in the middle (position 3). Skydiving hobbyist is a software-developer.
```
Soul Fan: 1
Prague: Gospel Fan
Ice-Hockey Player: 2
X, Hannover (Chef), Software-Developer
```

#### Step 7: Placing Remaining Elements
Photography hobbyist travels to Rome. This means photography can't be skydiving or film.
```
Soul Fan: 1
Prague: Gospel Fan
Ice-Hockey Player: 2
Rome, Hannover (Chef), Software-Developer
```

Since the dressmaker is in position 3:
```
Soul Fan: 1
Prague: Gospel Fan
Ice-Hockey Player: 2
Photography Hobbyist, Hannover (Chef), Software-Developer
```

The remaining positions must fit the clues of soul fan next to blues or cricket and photography next to badminton.
```
Soul Fan: 1
Prague: Gospel Fan
Ice-Hockey Player: 2
Rome, Chef, Software-Developer
```

Blues is cooking:
```
Soul Fan: 1
Prague: Gospel Fan
Ice-Hockey Player: 2
Rome (Photography), Chef, Software-Developer (Cooking)
```

Finally, the remaining city Berlin must be the last city. We need to place the music genres and sports accordingly.

#### Final Placement:
```
Soul Fan: 1 | Prague: Gospel Fan
Ice-Hockey Player: 2 | Rome: Photography
Chef: 3 | Hannover (Dressmaker): Software-Developer, Cooking
Skydiving Hobbyist: 4 | Berlin
Blues Fan: 5 | Musician: 5
```

Thus, the musician is in position 5:
**Musician: 5**"	musician:1	musician:5	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_1	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. The fan of gospel is the person traveling to Prague.
2. The fan of d&b is the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
3. The chef is the person traveling to Hannover.
4. The fan of ambient is the bartender.
5. The person traveling to Hannover is to the right of the person traveling to Edinburgh.
6. The person who's hobby is sudoku is the person who's sport is baseball.
7. The person who's hobby is photography is the person traveling to Rome.
8. The dressmaker is in the middle.
9. The fan of soul is on the far left.
10. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person whose sport is badminton.
11. The person who's hobby is photography is to the left or right of the person whose sport is cricket.
12. The person who's hobby is skydiving is the software-developer.
13. The fan of blues is the person whose hobby is cooking.
14. The fan of soul is to the left or right of the person traveling to Berlin.

Let’s lay out the positions and fill in the information step-by-step:

- Since the fan of soul (Clue 9) is on the far left, let's place them in position 1:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - ? - ? - ? - ? \]

- The person traveling to Prague (Clue 1) is a gospel fan. Let’s assume Prague is at some unknown position for now:
\[ \text{Gospel Fan} - ? - ? - ? - ? \]
Prague = 5 (since it must be last because of clue 5)

- The chef travels to Hannover (Clue 3), so Hannover cannot be the first or fifth. Let's place them in position 2:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - \text{Chef} - ? - ? - Prague \]

- The bartender is a fan of ambient (Clue 4). Since we already know who travels to Hannover, this means they are not the chef and must be in position 3:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - \text{Chef} - \text{Ambient Bartender} - ? - Prague \]

- The person traveling to Hannover (Clue 5) is to the right of the one traveling to Edinburgh. Since Chef travels to Hannover, we place the other person in Edinburgh in position 1:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - \text{Chef} - \text{Ambient Bartender} - ? - Prague \]
Edinburgh = 1

- The person who's hobby is sudoku (Clue 6) plays baseball and must be on the right of photography. Photography goes to Rome, so let’s place the Sudoku fan accordingly:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - \text{Chef} - \text{Ambient Bartender} - \text{Photography} - Prague \]
Sudoku = Baseball

- The person who's hobby is photography (Clue 7) travels to Rome, so Rome must be in the fourth position:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - \text{Chef} - \text{Ambient Bartender} - Photography - Prague \]
Rome = 4

- The dressmaker is in the middle, which means they are in the third position (Clue 8):
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - \text{Chef} - \text{Dressmaker} - Photography - Prague \]

- The fan of soul (Clue 9) must be on the far left:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - Chef - Dressmaker - Photography - Prague \]
Soul = Soul Fan

- Skydiving is a hobby of the software-developer (Clue 12), and they are not in the middle. Since the dressmaker occupies position 3, skydiving must be in one of the remaining positions:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - Chef - Dressmaker - Photography - Prague \]
Skydiving = Software-Developer

- The fan of blues (Clue 13) is the person who's hobby is cooking. Since photography is already in position 4, we place it there and assign the remaining hobby:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - Chef - Dressmaker - Photography - Prague \]
Cooking = Blues Fan

- The fan of soul (Clue 14) must be to the left or right of Berlin. Since soul is already in position 1, Berlin cannot be there. Therefore, Berlin must be in position 2:
\[ \text{Soul Fan} - Chef - Dressmaker - Photography - Prague \]
Berlin = 2

- The fan of d&b (Clue 2) plays ice-hockey and must therefore be to the left of the one playing ice-hockey. Since we already have chess, photography, and Berlin in positions:
\[ \text{Gospel Fan} - Chef - Dressmaker - Photography - Prague \]
D&b = Ice-Hockey

- Now, we assign the sport of surfing:
Since only cricket is left for sports not assigned yet, and it must be to the right or left of badminton (Clue 10), we place it accordingly:
\[ \text{Gospel Fan} - Chef - Dressmaker - Photography - Prague \]
Cricket = Surfing

So, the final sequence based on clues is:

- Gospel: Prague
- D&b: Ice-Hockey
- Ambient: Bartender
- Soul: Chef
- Blues: Cooking
- Sudoku: Baseball
- Photography: Rome
- Dressmaker: Hannover
- Skydiving: Software-Developer

The location of surfing (cricket) is in the 4th position.

surfing:4"	surfing:5	surfing:4	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_2	"Let's solve this step by step based on the given clues.

First, we will list our known positions and relationships:

1. The manager (M) is traveling to Venice.
2. The journalist (J) likes writing.
3. The fan of rock (R) travels to Hamburg.
4. The analyst (A) likes salsa.
5. The person who travels to Hamburg is right of the one who travels to Colone.
6. The modern house (H_modern) has a collector as its resident.
7. The palace house (H_palace) is for the person traveling to New-York.
8. The fan of funk (F) is in the middle.
9. The police-officer (P) is on the far left.
10. The wooden house (H_wooden) is next to someone who likes drawing (D).
11. The palace house is next to someone who likes chess (C).
12. The colonial house (H_colonial) has a fan of dubstep (F_dubstep).
13. The engineer (E) lives in the gothic-revival house (H_gothic).

Let's place each element step by step:

### Step 1: Place the police-officer
P is on the far left, so:
\[ P - \_ - \_ - \_ - \_ \]

### Step 2: Determine travel positions and relationships

From clue 5 (the person who travels to Hamburg is right of the one who travels to Colone), we can have these two options for travel:
1. C -> H_colonial
2. C -> Hamburg, P -> Colone

Since P cannot be on both ends and must fit other clues, let's try \( P - \text{Colone} - \_ - \text{Hamburg} \).

### Step 3: Place the palace house
From clue 7 (the palace house is for the person traveling to New-York):
\[ P - \text{Colone} - \text{New-York} - \text{Hamburg} \]

So, H_palace must be between Colone and New-York. 

### Step 4: Place the modern house
From clue 6 (the modern house has a collector as its resident):
\[ P - \text{Colone} - H_modern - \text{Hamburg} \]

Since modern is not in the first position, it must be second.

### Step 5: Fan of funk and drawing

From clue 8 (funk fan is in middle), he or she can only be:
\[ P - \text{Colone} - F - \text{Hamburg} \]

The wooden house (H_wooden) has to be next to someone who likes drawing. Since drawing cannot be Colone, it could be \( F \).

### Step 6: Place the colonial house
From clue 12 (colonial is dubstep fan):
\[ P - \text{Colone} - F - \text{Hamburg} \]

Colonial must be next to H_dubstep.

### Step 7: Engineer and gothic-revival

From clue 13, the engineer lives in the gothic house:
\[ P - \text{Colone} - F - E - \text{Hamburg} \]

### Step 8: Fill remaining positions

The analyst (salsa fan) can only be in the last position as there is no restriction on his/her location:
\[ P - J - F - A - E - R \]

### Final Check:

- Manager travels to Venice, so it must be a different position.
- Check other constraints.

Given this setup:
\[ P - M - J - A - E - R \]

Let's reassign positions considering all clues and finalize the house types and preferences.

Final solution based on given constraints:
\[ P - M - J - A - E - R \]
\[ H_wooden - F - C - H_colonial - D - H_gothic \]
\[ Pop: 4 (since pop is the only genre not assigned yet, it must be in the 4th position) \]

So:
\[ pop: 4 \]"	pop:1	pop:4	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize and fill in the information step by step based on the clues provided. Let's start by creating a grid with People, Jobs, Cities, Houses, and Hobbies as rows and columns respectively.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
