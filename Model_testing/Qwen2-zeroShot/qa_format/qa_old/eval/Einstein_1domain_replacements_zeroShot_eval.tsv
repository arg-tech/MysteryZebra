Einstein_1domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use deductive reasoning based on the given clues to fill in the appropriate values for each category (nationality, color preference, hobby, cigar brand, and pet).

Let's start by organizing our information:

1. The British likes red.
2. The Swede owns the dog.
3. The Dane plays chess.
4. Green is left of White.
5. Green is fishing.
6. Pall-mall smoker has a bird.
7. Yellow is dunhill smoker.
8. Filmmaking is in the middle (position 3).
9. Norwegian is on the far left (position 1).
10. Blend-smoker is next to cat owner.
11. Horse owner is next to dunhill smoker.
12. Bluemaster smoker plays woodworking.
13. German is prince smoker.
14. Norwegian is left or right of blue person.
15. Blend-smoker is left or right of photography person.

Let's fill in the information step by step:

**Step 1: Positioning based on clues**
- Norwegian (position 1)
- The British likes red.
- The Dane plays chess (position 3).
- Filmmaking is in the middle, so it’s also position 3.
- Green is left of White.

Since green and white are adjacent, we have:
- Position 2: Green
- Position 4: White

**Step 2: Nationalities**
- Norwegian (1)
- British (red - must be right next to the person with white as preference, so it can only be position 3 or 4 but green is in position 2 and chess is already in 3, thus British has to be in 4).
- Dane (chess - in position 3)
- Danish and British: not yet determined.
- Swedish (dog - must be position 5).

**Step 3: Colors**
- Green (position 2) - fishing
- White (position 4)
- Red (British - position 4, so it’s not the one next to white).
- Yellow (dunhill smoker - thus position 1 since Norwegian is in 1 and must be right of blue person).

**Step 4: Hobbies**
- Filmmaking (middle) - position 3.
- Chess (Dane) - position 3.

**Step 5: Cigars**
- Pall-mall (bird) - position 5 (Swedish).
- Dunhill (yellow smoker) - position 1.
- Bluemaster (woodworking) - Danish.
- Prince (German) - position 4, so it’s not the British nor the Dane.

**Step 6: Pets**
- Dog (Swede) - position 5.
- Bird (Pall-mall smoker) - position 5.
- Cat (position 2 or 4).

Since cat is next to blend-smoker and horse owner is also adjacent to dunhill smoker, we deduce:
- Cat must be in position 3 because it's next to the filmmaking person.

**Step 7: Final Deduction**
- Horse - must be Swedish since he has a dog.
- Cat (position 3) - blend-smoker.
- Photography - not in 3 or 4, so it’s position 5 and it must be prince smoker (German).

Now we have:
1. Norwegian
2. Green - fishing
3. Blue - photography
4. Red (British)
5. Yellow - dunhill - horse

**Final Answer: Fish is kept by the German.**

Thus, fish:5"	fish:4	fish:5	False	True
Einstein_1domain_replacements_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information step by step. Let's break down the clues one by one:

1. The person eating cucumber likes red.
2. The person eating grapes owns the dog.
3. The person eating lettuce drinks tea.
4. The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.
5. The person who likes green drinks coffee.
6. The pall-mall smoker owns the bird.
7. The person who likes yellow smokes dunhill.
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (position 3).
9. The person eating radish is on the far left (position 1).
10. The blend-smoker is either to the left or right of the owner of the cat.
11. The horse owner is either to the left or right of the dunhill smoker.
12. The bluemaster smoker drinks beer.
13. The person eating pear smokes prince.
14. The person eating radish likes blue or another color (but not red, as per clue 1).
15. The blend-smoker is either to the left or right of the person drinking water.

Let's start with what we know definitively:

- Position 1: Radish eater (clue 9)
- Position 3: Milk drinker (clue 8)

From position 1:
- Clue 1: The radish eater likes red.
- Clue 14: This person also likes blue or another color, so we can place ""red"" in the first column for now and ""blue"" or another color in the other.

From position 3:
- Clue 8: This is the middle spot, so it's a fixed point. Let’s leave this as it is for now.
- Clue 5: The person who likes green (clue 5) drinks coffee (clue 5).
- Clue 4: The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.

Since position 3 is fixed, let's place clues around that:

Position 2:
- Clue 3: The lettuce eater drinks tea.
- Clue 7: The yellow smoker (dunhill) must be in a specific spot relative to other elements. Let’s consider this later after more information.

Positions 4 and 5:
- Clue 10: The blend-smoker is near the cat owner.
- Clue 11: The horse owner is either left or right of the dunhill smoker (clue 7).

Let's place some additional clues:

Position 2:
- Lettuce eater drinks tea. This could be any color except red and blue.

From clue 6:
- Pall-mall smoker owns bird, so this person must be in a specific spot relative to other elements.

Clues 12 and 13 give us fixed points for bluemaster (beer) and prince (pear):

Position 4 or 5: 
- Person eating pear smokes prince.
- Person drinking water is adjacent to blend smoker (clue 15).

Now, let's place the pets:

From clue 2:
- Grapes eater owns dog. This could be any color except red.

From clue 6 and 7:
- Pall-mall smoker owns bird. This person must be in a specific spot relative to other elements.
- Yellow (dunhill) is somewhere, but we need more information about this.

Finally, let’s place fish:

Since the dog is owned by grapes eater, the remaining pet for fish could be placed based on clues 10 and 11. The horse owner must be in a specific spot relative to dunhill smoker.

By process of elimination:
- Position 2: Radish (red)
- Position 3: Milk
- Position 4 or 5: Likely tea drinker, not milk or water.
- Position 5: Likely last remaining pet for fish based on all other placements.

So the placement is:

fish:5"	fish:4	fish:5	False	True
Einstein_1domain_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will organize the information and deduce step-by-step which nationalities like certain colors, have certain hobbies, smoke certain brands of cigars, keep certain pets, etc.

### Step 1: Organize and Interpret the Given Clues

1. The British person likes red.
2. The Swedish person owns a dog.
3. The Danish person's hobby is video-games.
4. The green-liking person is to the left of the white-liking person.
5. The green-liking person’s hobby is gardening.
6. The pall-mall smoker owns a bird.
7. The yellow-liking person smokes dunhill.
8. The card-games player is in the middle (3rd position).
9. The Norwegian is on the far left.
10. The blend-smoker is to the left or right of the cat owner.
11. The horse owner is to the left or right of the dunhill smoker.
12. The bluemaster smoker's hobby is drawing.
13. The German person smokes prince.
14. The Norwegian is to the left or right of the blue-liking person.
15. The blend-smoker is to the left or right of the fishing person.

### Step 2: Initial Setup

We can represent the setup as follows:

| Position | Nationality   | Color      | Hobby            | Cigar        | Pet           |
|----------|---------------|------------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 (Norwegian) |              |            |                  |              |               |
| 2        |               |            |                  |              |               |
| 3 (Card-Games)   |               |            |                  |              |               |
| 4        |               |            |                  |              |               |
| 5        |               |            |                  |              |               |

### Step 3: Deductions

1. **Norwegian is on the far left (Position 1)**:
   - Norwegian owns a fish (clue 9, we assume because ""norwegian"" and ""fish"" are not directly linked but this fits well).

2. **Danish person’s hobby is video-games (clue 3)**:
   - This means Danish cannot be in position 3.

3. **British likes red (clue 1)**:
   - British must like either blue, green, or white (since they can't have red as their color).

4. **Green-liking person is to the left of the white-liking person and their hobby is gardening (clues 4 & 5)**:
   - Green-liking person must be in positions 1,2 or 1,3 or 2,3.
   - Since Norwegian is already at position 1, green-liking must be in position 2 and white-liking must be in position 3.

5. **Pall-mall smoker owns a bird (clue 6)**:
   - Pall-mall smoker cannot be the one who likes red or green as it would contradict clues about positioning.

6. **Yellow-liking person smokes dunhill (clue 7)**:
   - This means yellow-liking is not in position 1 (Norwegian) and must be somewhere else, so let's place them at position 5 for now since they can't be in 3 (card-games).

7. **German is the prince-smoker (clue 13)**:
   - German cannot have a bird or fish as pets.

8. **Blend smoker is to the left or right of cat owner (clue 10)**, and **horse owner is to the left or right of dunhill smoker (clue 11)**.
   - Let's place the horse in position 4 for now.

9. **Bluemaster smoker’s hobby is drawing (clue 12)**:
   - Bluemaster smoker cannot be Danish as their hobby is video-games and must be somewhere else.

### Step 4: Final Placement

After careful placement, we can conclude:

- Position 1: Norwegian
- Position 2: Green-liking
- Position 3: White-liking (middle)
- Position 4: Horse owner
- Position 5: Yellow-liking

Now let's fill in the rest based on remaining clues.

#### Pet Placement:
- Swedish owns a dog, so Swedish can't be Norwegian or the one with horse.
- Danish has video-games as their hobby, they must have either cat, fish (but fish is already placed).

So:

1. Norwegian: Fish
2. Green-liking person
3. White-liking person (card-games)
4. Horse owner (German likely here if not others fit)
5. Yellow-liking person

#### Cigars:
- British likes red, so blue is left.
- German smokes prince, so blue must be British with red.
- Dunhill smoker is yellow, so pall-mall bird.
- Bluemaster drawing
- Blend fishing (but not cat or dog)

Final placement:

1. Norwegian: Fish
2. Green-liking person
3. White-liking person (card-games)
4. Horse owner (German likely here if not others fit)
5. Yellow-liking person

### Final Answer:
**fish: 1**"	fish:4	fish:1	False	True
