Einstein_orig_NL_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize and systematically fill out the information provided. Let's start by setting up a 5x5 grid with rows representing nationalities (Norwegian, Danish, German, Swedish, British) and columns for colors, beverages, cigars, pets, and their positions.

1. The Norwegian is on the far left.
2. The person who likes red is British (from clue 1).
3. The Danish person drinks tea (clue 3).
4. The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white (clue 4), and also drinking coffee (clue 5).
5. The Swedish owns the dog (clue 2).
6. The Pall-mall smoker owns the bird (clue 6).
7. The person who likes yellow is the Dunhill smoker (clue 7).
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle.
9. The German smokes Prince cigars (clue 13).

Now, let's place these clues on our grid:

| Nationality   | Color  | Beverage | Cigar    | Pet      |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Norwegian     |        |          |         |          |
| Danish        |        |          |         |          |
| German        |        | Tea      | Prince   |          |
| Swedish       |        |          |         | Dog      |
| British       | Red    |          |         |          |

From clue 4, the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Since we need to place these people correctly and ensure their positions align with other clues:

10. The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue (clue 14).
11. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (clue 10).
12. The bluemaster-smoker is drinking beer (clue 12).

Let's fill in some more information:

| Nationality   | Color  | Beverage | Cigar    | Pet      |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Norwegian     | Blue   |          |         |          |
| Danish        | Green  | Tea      | Prince   | Horse    |
| German        | Red    | Coffee   | Dunhill  | Bird     |
| Swedish       | Yellow | Milk     | Pall-mall| Dog      |
| British       | White  | Beer     | Bluemaster| Cat     |

Now, we need to place the fish correctly. The only remaining pet is ""fish,"" and it can be placed in one of the positions that are not occupied by any other pet:

13. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water (clue 15).

Let's finalize the grid with all clues applied:

| Nationality   | Color  | Beverage | Cigar    | Pet      |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Norwegian     | Blue   | Water    | Pall-mall| Fish     |
| Danish        | Green  | Tea      | Prince   | Horse    |
| German        | Red    | Coffee   | Dunhill  | Bird     |
| Swedish       | Yellow | Milk     | Blend    | Dog      |
| British       | White  | Beer     | Bluemaster| Cat     |

Thus, the fish is kept by the Norwegian. The answer in the requested format is:

fish:1"	fish:4	fish:1	False	True

| Denmark  |                | Tea          |           |           |
| Green    | Red            | Coffee       |           |           |
| Sweden   | Dog            |              | Pall-mall | Bird      |
| Germany  |                |              | Prince    | Cat, Horse|

|----------|----------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Norway   | Blue           | Milk         |           | Horse     |
| Denmark  |                | Tea          | Blend     |           |
| Green    | Red            | Coffee       | Blue-mast |           |
| Sweden   | Dog            |              | Pall-mall | Bird      |
| Germany  | Yellow         | Water        | Prince    | Cat       |

Thus, the position of fish is:

\[ \text{Fish:4} \]"	fish:4	fish:4	True	True
Einstein_orig_NL_3	"To solve this puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction based on the given clues. Let's organize the information step by step.

### Step-by-Step Deduction

1. **Nationalities and Colors**
   - The British person likes red.
   - The Norwegian is on the far left (position 1).
   - The Danish person drinks tea.
   - The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue.
   - The Swedish owns the dog.

2. **Drinks and Pets**
   - The person drinking milk is in the middle (position 3).
   - The person drinking coffee likes green, which is to the left of the person who likes white.
   - The Pall-mall smoker owns the bird.
   - The Dunhill smoker likes yellow.
   - The German is the prince-smoker.

3. **Cigars and Pets**
   - The person smoking blend is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
   - The horse owner is on the left or right of the Dunhill smoker.
   - The Bluemaster smoker drinks beer.
   - The person drinking water has the blend-smoker to their left or right.

### Organizing the Information

1. **Nationalities**
   - Position 1: Norwegian
   - We need to determine the other positions based on the given clues.

2. **Colors and Drinks**
   - Red: British (Position 4, as they like red)
   - Green: Coffee drinker (Position left of white)
   - White: Person in position right of green.
   - Blue: Norwegian is on the left or right of this person (we don't know their exact position yet).
   - Yellow: Dunhill smoker.

3. **Drinks**
   - Tea: Danish
   - Milk: Position 3
   - Coffee: Green drinker
   - Beer: Bluemaster smoker
   - Water: We need to find this person based on the clue about the blend-smoker's position.

4. **Cigars and Pets**
   - Pall-mall smoker owns bird.
   - Yellow (Dunhill smoker) must own a pet since they are in position 2 or 3, but we don't know which yet.
   - Horse owner is next to Dunhill smoker.
   - Blend-smoker is on the left or right of cat owner.

### Assigning Positions

1. **Norwegian (Position 1)**
   - Possible neighbors: British, Danish, German
2. **Danish (Drinks tea)**
   - Position not yet determined but must be next to Norwegian.
3. **British (Likes red)**
   - Must be in position 4 or 5 since Red is the only color left for them and they are on the right of green drinker.

### Further Deductions

- Since the German is the prince smoker, and we have the following:
  - German: Prince smoker
  - British (Position 4): Red
  - Danish (Drinks tea)
  - Norwegian: Position 1

Let's assign positions based on process of elimination:

1. **Norwegian**: Position 1
2. **Danish**: Position 2 or 3 (since they drink tea and next to Norwegian, Position 2 is more likely for the middle position clue).
3. **German**: Position 5 (since prince smoker must be at one end, farthest from other nationalities)
4. **British**: Position 4
5. **Blend-smoker (must be in Position 2 or 3) and Cat owner (Horse owner is next to them)**.

Now we know:
- Position 1: Norwegian
- Position 2: Danish (Drinks tea, so milk must go to Position 3).
- Position 3: Milk drinker.
- Position 4: British (Likes red)
- Position 5: German (Prince smoker).

### Assigning Colors and Pets

- Position 1 (Norwegian): Dog (since the Swedish owns it, they can only be in position 2 or 5 which is not applicable here).
- Position 2 (Danish): Cat
- Position 3 (Milk drinker): Bird (since bird is owned by pall-mall smoker who must be next to cat owner)
- Position 4 (British: Red)
- Position 5 (German): Horses.

### Final Assignments

1. **Norwegian**: Dog, position 1
2. **Danish**: Cat, position 2
3. **Milk drinker**: Bird, position 3
4. **British**: Red, position 4
5. **German**: Horse, position 5

### Pets

- Fish: Not directly assigned but can be determined based on the process of elimination.
   - The cat is in Position 2, the bird in Position 3, dog (Norwegian) and horse (German).
   
Therefore:

**Fish: Position 4**

This completes the puzzle with fish being owned by the British person."	fish:4	fish:4	True	True
