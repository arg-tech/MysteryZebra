Zebra_lexical_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the attributes accordingly. Let's start by organizing the clues:

1. The Malaysian likes orange.
2. The Italian owns the goldfish.
3. The person drinking cola is the one who likes black.
4. The Dutch drink almond-lemonade.
5. The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.
6. The Fonseca-smoker owns the bird.
7. The Havana-smoker likes chestnut.
8. The person drinking lemonade is in the middle (position 3).

12. The Baccarat-smoker drinks iced-tea.
13. The Mexican smokes Tiparillo.
14. The German is either to the left or right of the person who likes coral.

Let's set up a table with the five positions and start filling it based on the clues:

| Position | Nationality   | Favourite Color | Beverage         | Cigar          | Pet           |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1        | German        | -               | -                | -              | -             |
| 2        | -             | -               | -                | -              | -             |
| 3        | -             | -               | Lemonade         | -              | -             |
| 4        | -             | -               | -                | -              | -             |
| 5        | -             | -               | -                | -              | -             |

Now, let's apply the clues one by one:

1. The Malaysian likes orange.
   - Position 2: Malaysian, Orange

2. The Italian owns the goldfish.
   - Position 3: Italian, Goldfish (since position 3 is Lemonade)

3. The person drinking cola is the one who likes black.
   - Position 5: Black (Cola), Position 4: Black

4. The Dutch drink almond-lemonade.
   - Position 2: Dutch, Almond-Lemonade

5. The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.
   - Position 3 already has Black and Goldfish
   - Position 1 must have Aquamarine (since German is on the far left)

6. The Fonseca-smoker owns the bird.
   - Position 5: Bird, Fonseca

7. The Havana-smoker likes chestnut.
   - Position 4: Chestnut, Havana

8. The person drinking lemonade is in the middle (position 3).
   - Already set as Italian and Goldfish.

9. The German is on the far left (position 1).
   - Position 1: German

10. The Coralmaster-smoker is either to the left or right of the owner of the lizard.
    - Position 2 already has Dutch, so Coralmaster must be in position 4
    - Lizard cannot be with Coralmaster (position 5), so it can be in position 3

11. The Havana-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse.
    - Havana (Position 4) is to the right of Mouse, so Position 2 must have Mouse.

12. The Baccarat-smoker drinks iced-tea.
    - Position 5: Iced-tea, Baccarat

13. The Mexican smokes Tiparillo.
    - Position 4: Mexican, Tiparillo

14. The German is either to the left or right of the person who likes coral.
    - Position 2 already has Dutch, so Coral must be with Mexican in position 4.

Final table:

| Position | Nationality   | Favourite Color | Beverage         | Cigar          | Pet           |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1        | German        | Aquamarine      | -                | -              | -             |
| 2        | Dutch         | -               | Almond-Lemonade  | -              | Mouse         |
| 3        | Italian       | Black           | Lemonade         | -              | Goldfish      |
| 4        | Mexican       | Coral           | Iced-tea         | Tiparillo      | Lizard        |
| 5        | -             | Orange          | Cola             | Fonseca        | Bird          |

From the table, we can see that **hot-chocolate** is not directly mentioned. However, it can be inferred from the beverages list and the positions that **hot-chocolate** could logically fill position 1 or 5 (as no other beverage fits these positions). Given the clues provided, hot chocolate should fit in a spot where it's not contradictory to any given rules.

Therefore, the answer is: **hot-chocolate:4**

This means the person who drinks hot chocolate would be the Mexican, as they are the only one left with an undefined position and it does not conflict with other placements."	hot-chocolate:1	hot-chocolate:4	False	True
Zebra_lexical_replacements_0	"Let's break down and solve this puzzle step by step, considering each clue carefully:

1. **The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.**
   - Malaysian: Orange

2. **The Italian is the owner of the goldfish.**
   - Italian: Goldfish

3. **The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.**
   - Cola: Black

4. **The Dutch are the ones drinking almond-lemonade.**
   - Dutch: Almond-Lemonade

5. **The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.**
   - This means the order in terms of preferences from left to right must be: Aquamarine, Black.

6. **The fonseca-smoker owns the bird.**
   - Fonseca: Bird

7. **The havana-smoker is the person who likes chestnut.**
   - Havana: Chestnut

8. **The person drinking lemonade is in the middle.**
   - Lemonade: Middle (position 3)

9. **The German is on the far left.**
   - German: First position

10. **The coralmaster-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.**
    - Coralmaster: Left or Right of Lizard

11. **The havana-smoker (chestnut) is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse.**
    - Havana: Left or Right of Mouse

12. **The baccarat-smoker owns iced-tea.**
    - Baccarat: Iced-Tea

13. **The Mexican is the tiparillo-smoker.**
    - Mexican: Tiparillo

14. **The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral.**
    - German: Left or Right of Coral

From these, we can determine:
- Position 1 (German) must be Black because it's on the far left.
- Since Cola is Black and is in the middle, this is a contradiction unless we rearrange, so we need to place Black somewhere else that fits all conditions.

By placing the known items, let’s try to fit them:

1. **German (position 1):** Black
2. **Malaysian:** Orange (can be anywhere but not position 1)
3. **Italian:** Goldfish (can be anywhere but not position 1 or 5 due to cat location)
4. **Dutch: Almond-Lemonade**
5. **Lemonade is in the middle, so it’s position 3**

Considering all these clues:
- Mexican and Tiparillo (position 5 for Tiparillo-smoker) 
- Fonseca has bird.
- Havana-smoker (chestnut) with mouse or bird.
- Coralmaster has lizard.

Let's place these step by step:

1. **German: Black**
2. **Malaysian:** Orange
3. **Cola is middle: Black** (Contradict, so we need to reposition)
4. **Italian: Goldfish**
5. **Dutch: Almond-Lemonade**

Since Cola cannot be in the middle and Black must fit, let's place:
- **Black: Position 3**
- German: Black
- Malay: Orange

Reevaluate positions:
1. **German (position 1):** Black
2. **Malaysian:** Orange
3. **Italian:** Goldfish
4. **Dutch: Almond-Lemonade**
5. **Lemonade is middle, so it’s position 3**

Thus,
- Cola must be position 2

Let's place the remaining:
- Mexican (Tiparillo) in position 5
- Coralmaster (lizard) and Havana (chestnut), mouse.

This fits all conditions:

1. **German: Black**
2. **Cola:** Black
3. **Lemonade is middle, so it’s position 3**
4. **Italian: Goldfish**
5. **Mexican (Tiparillo): Cat**

Thus, the final answer is:
**cat:5**"	cat:5	cat:5	True	True
Zebra_lexical_replacements_1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down and analyze each clue step by step.

1. The Colombian is the person who likes light-chestnut.
2. The Brazilian owns the goldfish.
3. The person drinking cola is the one who likes lilac.
4. The Argentine drinks juice.
5. The person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes fuchsia.
6. The aristoff-smoker owns the mouse.
7. The oliveros-smoker likes coral.
8. The person drinking soy-milk is in the middle (3rd position).
9. The German is on the far left.
10. The dunhill-smoker is next to the owner of the cat.
11. The oliveros-smoker is next to the owner of the hamster.
12. The swisher-smoker drinks fanta.
13. The Nigerian smokes tiparillo.
14. The German is next to (left or right) the person who likes chestnut.

Let's start by placing individuals in their known positions and attributes:

- **German** must be 1st, as per clue 9.
- Since the Colombian likes light-chestnut (clue 1), and the German has not yet been associated with a color, the Colombian is not the German. The Colombian could be any of the remaining nationalities.

Since the person drinking cola likes lilac (clue 3) and the person who likes fuchsia is to the left of the one who likes lilac (clue 5), we can place the colors as follows:
1. Light-chestnut
2. Fuchsia
3. Lilac
4. 
5.

The German cannot like light-chestnut, so he could be Argentine or Nigerian and like fuchsia, lilac, or coral.

Since clue 8 says the person drinking soy-milk is in the middle (3rd position), we have:
1. Light-chestnut
2. Fuchsia
3. Soy-milk
4. 
5.

The oliveros-smoker likes coral and must be on either side of the hamster owner (clue 11). The dunhill-smoker is next to the cat owner (clue 10).

Since the person drinking cola has lilac, they can't drink fanta or soy-milk. The swisher-smoker drinks fanta (clue 12), so we have:
- **Cola**: Lilac
- **Fanta**: Swisher

Now, clue 6 says that the aristoff-smoker owns the mouse, and clue 7 says oliveros-smoker likes coral. That leaves us with dunhill for the swisher-smoker.

Let's place these in their respective positions:
1. German (can be Argentine or Nigerian)
2. Colombian (likes light-chestnut) - not yet placed
3. Soy-milk
4. Fuchsia
5. Lilac

Since clue 9 says the German is on the far left, and we can assume he likes fuchsia or lilac but not the light-chestnut.
The Argentine drinks juice (clue 4), so:
1. German
2. Colombian - light-chestnut
3. Soy-milk
4. Fuchsia
5. Lilac

Clues 7, 8 and 10-11 place the oliveros-smoker next to hamster owner and dunhill-smoker next to cat owner.

The nigerian smokes tiparillo (clue 13), so:
- 1st: German
- 2nd: Colombian - light-chestnut
- 3rd: Soy-milk, must be Argentine (juice)
- 4th: Fuchsia (oliveros-smoker) - next to cat owner and hamster owner
- 5th: Lilac

The swisher-smoker drinks fanta (clue 12), so:
- Swisher: Fanta

Now, the only place for 7up is in position 3rd or 4th. Since we already placed Argentine with juice, 7up must be in position 5.

**Final Arrangements:**
1. German
2. Colombian - light-chestnut
3. Soy-milk (Argentine)
4. Fuchsia (oliveros-smoker) - next to cat owner and hamster owner
5. **7Up**

Thus, the answer is:
**7up:5**"	7up:1	7up:7	False	True
Zebra_lexical_replacements_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements accordingly. Let's start by organizing the clues step-by-step.

1. The colombian is the person who likes light-chestnut.
2. The brazilian is the owner of the goldfish.
3. The person drinking cola is the person who likes lilac.
4. The argentine is the person drinking juice.
5. The person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes fuchsia.
6. The aristoff-smoker is the owner of the mouse.
7. The oliveros-smoker is the person who likes coral.
8. The person drinking soy-milk is in the middle.
9. The german is on the far left.
10. The dunhill-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
11. The oliveros-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
12. The swisher-smoker is the person drinking fanta.
13. The nigerian is the tiparillo-smoker.
14. The german is to the left or right of the person who likes chestnut.

Let's place these elements step-by-step:

### Step 1: Place the German
- Clue 9: The german is on the far left.
Thus, **German: 1**

### Step 2: Place the Colombian (light-chestnut)
- Clue 1: The colombian is the person who likes light-chestnut.
Since we don't know yet where he is placed in terms of other clues, we'll hold this for now. Let's denote it as **Colombian: light-chestnut**.

### Step 3: Place the Argentine (juice)
- Clue 4: The argentine is the person drinking juice.
Since we don't know yet where he is placed in terms of other clues, we'll hold this for now. Let's denote it as **Argentine: juice**.

### Step 4: Place the Oliveros-smoker
- Clue 7: The oliveros-smoker is the person who likes coral.
Thus, **Oliveros-smoker: coral**

Since the oliveros-smoker can be to the left or right of the hamster owner and we know he’s also drinking juice (Clue 4), let's place the Argentine in the middle for now:
- **Argentine: 3, juice**

### Step 5: Place the Dunhill-smoker
- Clue 10: The dunhill-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
Since we don't know where the cat owner is yet, let's hold this for now.

### Step 6: Place the Swisher-smoker (fanta)
- Clue 12: The swisher-smoker is the person drinking fanta.
Thus, **Swisher-smoker: fanta**

The argentine drinks juice and we know he’s in position 3. So dunhill-smoker can be on either side of cat owner, but let's consider the positions where others are not placed yet.

### Step 7: Place the Colombian
- Clue 1: The colombian is the person who likes light-chestnut.
Since we know he’s in position 2 (as german is at 1 and argentine at 3), thus:
- **Colombian: 2, light-chestnut**

### Step 8: Place the Brazilian
- Clue 2: The brazilian is the owner of the goldfish.
Thus, **Brazilian: 4, goldfish**

### Step 9: Place the Nigerian (tiparillo)
- Clue 13: The nigerian is the tiparillo-smoker.
Thus, **Nigerian: tiparillo**

### Step 10: Place the German’s position relative to chestnut
- Clue 14: The german is to the left or right of the person who likes chestnut.
Since German is at 1 and Colombian is drinking light-chestnut at 2, German can be on either side of the person who likes chestnut. Let's check for consistency.

### Step 11: Place the Lilac drinker
- Clue 3: The person drinking cola is the person who likes lilac.
Thus, **Lilac drinker: cola**

We know Lilac (cola) is to the right of Fuchsia. Therefore, Fuchsia must be at position 2 since light-chestnut (Colombian) is at 1 and Lilac (Cola) is at 3.

### Step 12: Place the Fuchsia drinker
- Fuchsia: 2

### Step 13: Place the Chestnut drinker relative to German
- Clue 14: The german is to the left or right of the person who likes chestnut.
Since German is at position 1, Chestnut (light-chestnut) must be on his right. Thus, Chestnut (light-chestnut) is at **3**.

### Step 14: Place the Hamster and Cat
- Clue 8: The person drinking soy-milk is in the middle.
Thus, Soy-milk drinker is at position 3.

Since the olive-smoker is to the left or right of hamster and dunhill-smoker can be on either side of cat owner. Let's place them:
- Cat: 5
- Hamster: 4 (since dunhill-smoker must not overlap with owner)

### Step 15: Confirm positions

**Final Placement:**
1. German
2. Colombian (light-chestnut)
3. Lilac drinker (cola), Fuchsia drinker
4. Brazilian (goldfish)
5. Nigerian (tiparillo)

Thus, the guinea-pig is owned by:
- Guinea-pig: 5

**Guinea-pig: 5**"	guinea-pig:5	guinea-pig:5	True	True
Zebra_lexical_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down and use each clue step by step.

1. **Clue 9:** The Dutch is on the far left.
   - Position 1 = Dutch

2. **Clue 14:** The Dutch is to the left or right of the person who likes white.
   - This means that the person who likes white cannot be in position 1.

3. **Clue 1:** The Nigerian is the person who likes ebony.
   - Position 5 = Nigerian (likes ebony)

4. **Clue 2:** The Canadian is the owner of the rabbit.
   - Position X = Canadian (owns rabbit), but we don't know where yet

5. **Clue 3:** The person drinking almond-soy-milk is the person who likes lilac.
   - Beverage: Almond-soy-milk, Color: Lilac
   - Position Y = (likes lilac and drinks almond-soy-milk)

6. **Clue 4:** The Brazilian is the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - Beverage: Hot-chocolate, Nationality: Brazilian
   - Position Z = Brazilian (drinks hot-chocolate), but we don't know where yet

7. **Clue 5:** The person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes blood-red.
   - Since Position Y = (likes lilac and drinks almond-soy-milk), and this must be to the right of someone who likes blood-red.

8. **Clue 6:** The swisher-smoker is the owner of the chinchilla.
   - Cigar: Swisher, Pet: Chinchilla
   - Position A = (smokes swisher and owns chinchilla)

9. **Clue 7:** The montecristo-smoker is the person who likes amber.
   - Cigar: Montecristo, Color: Amber
   - Position B = (smokes montecristo and likes amber), but we don't know where yet

10. **Clue 8:** The person drinking soy-milk is in the middle.
    - Beverage: Soy-milk
    - Position 3 = (drinks soy-milk)

11. **Clue 10:** The dannemann-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the pony.
    - Cigar: Dannemann, Pet: Pony
    - Position C or D = (smokes dannemann and owns pony), but we don't know where yet

12. **Clue 11:** The montecristo-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
    - Since Position B = (smokes montecristo and likes amber), and this must be near someone who owns a hamster.

13. **Clue 12:** The tiparillo-smoker is the person drinking fanta.
    - Cigar: Tiparillo, Beverage: Fanta
    - Position E = (smokes tiparillo and drinks fanta)

14. **Clue 13:** The Pakistani is the game-smoker.
    - Nationality: Pakistani, Cigar: Game
    - Position F = (smokes game and is Pakistani), but we don't know where yet

Let's piece it all together:

- **Position 1**: Dutch
- **Position 2** or **Position 4**: (This must be the Canadian who owns the rabbit)
- **Position 3**: Soy-milk
- **Position 5**: Nigerian (likes ebony)

Now, let's place the rest of the information based on the clues:

- **Clue 10:** The dannemann-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the pony.
  - This means if the pony owner is in Position 2, dannemann smoker could be in Position 1 or 3 (but position 1 is Dutch).

- **Clue 7 & Clue 11:** The montecristo-smoker (Position B) and the owner of the hamster.
  - Montecristo smoker can't be in Position 2, so it could be in Position 3 or 4.

- **Clue 6:** The swisher-smoker is the owner of the chinchilla.
  - This means the chinchilla is not owned by the person drinking almond-soy-milk (Position Y).

- **Clue 12:** The tiparillo-smoker is the person drinking fanta.
  - This means Position E = Tiparillo, Fanta.

By trial and error or systematic placement:

- Dutch: Position 1
- Pakistani: Game smoker, so they can't be in position 1, maybe Position 3.
- Canadian (rabbit owner): Position 2.
- Nigerian (ebony lover): Position 5.
- Brazilian: Hot-chocolate drinker, could be Position 4.
- Amber liker and Montecristo smoker must be near the hamster owner.

Let's place mirinda:

- Mirinda: Soy-milk drinker (Position 3)
  - This fits all conditions, as it is in the middle and not conflicting with any other positions.

Thus, the final answer for **mirinda**:
```
mirinda:3
```"	mirinda:1	mirinda:3	False	True
Zebra_lexical_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the elements accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's list the clues again for clarity:

1. The Nigerian likes ebony.
2. The Canadian owns the rabbit.
3. The person drinking almond-soy-milk likes lilac.
4. The Brazilian drinks hot-chocolate.
5. The person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes blood-red.
6. The Swisher-smoker owns the chinchilla.
7. The Montecristo-smoker likes amber.
8. The person drinking soy-milk is in the middle.
9. The Dutch are on the far left.
10. The Dannemann-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the pony.
11. The Montecristo-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
12. The Tiparillo-smoker drinks fanta.
13. The Pakistani smokes Game.
14. The Dutch are to the left or right of the person who likes white.

From clue 9, we know that the Dutch are on the far left, so they can be assigned position 1:

- **1: Dutch**

Next, from clues 2 and 10, since the Canadian owns the rabbit (clue 2), and the Dannemann-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the pony (clue 10), the Canadian cannot be the Dannemann-smoker. We will try to fit them in later.

From clue 4, we know that the Brazilian drinks hot-chocolate:

- **4: Brazilian** (drinks hot-chocolate)

Since the Dutch are on position 1 and can't have hot-chocolate, the only positions left for the Brazilian are 2, 3, or 5. We will place this later as well.

From clue 6, we know that the Swisher-smoker owns the chinchilla:

- **Swisher-smoker: chinchilla**

Since the Dutch are on position 1 and can't have the chinchilla, the only positions left for the Swisher-smoker are 2, 3, or 5.

From clue 7, we know that the Montecristo-smoker likes amber:

- **Montecristo-smoker: amber**

The Montecristo-smoker can't be in position 1 (Dutch), and we will need to fit this later as well.

From clue 3, the person drinking almond-soy-milk likes lilac. Since the almond-soy-milk drinker is in the middle (clue 8):

- **5: Almond-soy-milk** (likes lilac)

From clue 14, the Dutch are to the left or right of the person who likes white:

- The Dutch are on position 1. Therefore, the person who likes white can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Since we know the Nigerian (clue 1) and the Canadian (clue 2), they must fit somewhere else. Let's try to place them based on other clues:

- The Nigerian is position 2 because the Canadian owns the rabbit and cannot be in positions 1 or 3, 4, or 5.

So:
- **2: Nigerian** (likes ebony)

Since the Canadian owns the rabbit (clue 2), they must fit elsewhere:

- **Canadian: 3** (owns rabbit)

Now let's place the remaining elements:

From clue 5, the person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes blood-red. Since position 5 has almond-soy-milk and likes lilac, the person with blood-red must be in positions 2 or 3.

The owner of the chinchilla (Swisher-smoker) can't be in position 1 (Dutch), so they must fit elsewhere:

- **Swisher-smoker: 4** (owns chinchilla)

This means:
- **4: Swisher-smoker** (chinchilla, not a nationality or color, but fits here as per clue 6).

Now, the remaining nationality for position 3 is Pakistani, and they smoke Game:

- **3: Canadian** (owns rabbit) 
- **4: Nigerian** (likes ebony)

From clue 13, the Pakistani smokes Game:
- **Pakistani: 5** (smokes Game)

The only nationality left is Brazilian in position 2:
- **Brazilian: 2** (drinks hot-chocolate)
- **Nigerian: 4** (likes ebony) 

Now we fit the remaining color and pet:

From clue 1, the Nigerian likes ebony:
- **Nigerian: 4** (likes ebony)

The Brazilian drinks hot-chocolate:
- **Brazilian: 2** (drinks hot-chocolate)
  
Since the Montecristo-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster and the Montecristo-smoker likes amber, let's place these:

- **Montecristo-smoker: 3** (likes amber)
- **Owner of hamster: 2**

The tiparillo-smoker drinks fanta:
- **Tiparillo-smoker: 1** (drinks fanta)

Finally, the remaining pet and color fit as follows:
- **Pakistani: 5** (smokes Game) 
- **Hamster: 3**
- **Frog: 2**

Thus, the final arrangement is:

- **1: Dutch (Game-smoker)**
- **2: Canadian (owns rabbit, drinks fanta)**
- **3: Brazilian (drinks hot-chocolate)**
- **4: Pakistani (smokes Game)**
- **5: Montecristo-smoker (likes amber)**

So the frog is in position 2:

**frog:2**"	frog:5	frog:2	False	True
