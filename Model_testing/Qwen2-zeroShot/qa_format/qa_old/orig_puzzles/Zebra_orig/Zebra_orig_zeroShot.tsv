Zebra_orig_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's organize and piece together the clues step by step:

### Step 1: Organize Clues

1. Five different-colored houses (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue).
2. Five nationalities (Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese).
3. Pets (dog, fox, zebra, horse, snails).
4. Drinks (coffee, tea, milk, orange-juice, water).
5. Cigarettes (old-gold, kools, chesterfields, lucky-strike, parliaments).

### Step 2: Place Known Information

1. The **Englishman lives in the red house**.
2. The **Spaniard owns the dog**.
3. Coffee is drunk in the green house.
4. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
5. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
6. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
7. Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
8. Milk is drunk in the middle (3rd) house.
9. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox.
11. Kools are smoked in a house next to where the horse is kept.
12. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
13. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

### Step 3: Deduce and Arrange

- **The Norwegian lives in the first (1st) house**:
  - So, the blue house must be the second (2nd) or fifth (5th).

- **The Ukrainian drinks tea**:
  - Tea is not drunk in the 1st, 4th, or 5th house because of positional clues.

- **Kools are smoked in the yellow house**:
  - The yellow house cannot be the first or the middle one since Kools must be next to a house with a pet (horse).

- **Coffee is drunk in the green house**:
  - Green is immediately right of ivory, so possible combinations are: 
    - Ivory1 and Green2
    - Ivory4 and Green5

- **Milk is drunk in the middle (3rd) house**:
  - Middle house cannot be red or yellow.

- **The Englishman lives in the red house**:
  - Red house can only fit in 1st, 3rd, or 5th positions because of other clues.
  
### Step 4: Detailed Deductions

Let's start with the most specific:

- The Norwegian is in the 1st (blue), and he must be next to a blue:
  - This means the 2nd house is blue.

Now, since the green is right of ivory and can only fit between houses:

- Ivory1, Green2
  - No other fits without conflicts

Next, we need to place the pets and drinks:

- The Ukrainian (drinks tea) cannot be in house 4 or 5. So he must be in 3rd.

- The man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox:
  - This means Fox1 and Chesterfields2 or Chesterfields4 and Fox5

Continuing:

- Kools (yellow) are next to a pet house (horse)
  - Kools can only be in 3rd, but milk is there.

Thus,

- Kools must be in 2nd and horse in 1st.
  
Now we know:

1. Norwegian (blue): Fox
2. Yellow: Kools, Horse

Next,

- Chesterfields next to fox, not 1 or 5:
  - Thus, Chesterfields3, Fox4.

Finally:

- Lucky juice is Orange juice smoker:
  - So Parliaments for Japanese.
  
Thus we have:

### Final Placement:

1. Norwegian (blue): Fox
2. Yellow: Kools, Horse
3. Englishman (red): Milk
4. Ukrainian (green): Tea
5. Japanese (ivory): Coffee

And finally the zebra:

- The only left is zebra in 4th.

### Answer:

**zebra:4**"	zebra:5
Zebra_orig_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's organize and deduce step by step using the given clues:

### Step 1: Setting up the houses and their colors.
1. There are five houses (Red, Green, Ivory, Yellow, Blue).
2. The Norwegian lives in the first house.

This means:
- House 1: Norwegian
- House 2: Unknown color
- House 3: Middle house
- House 4: Unknown color
- House 5: Last house

### Step 2: Using clues about colors and positions.
6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.

This means:
- House 1 (Norwegian) cannot be green or ivory.
- House 3 must be green, so House 2 must be Ivory.

So now we have:
- House 1: Norwegian
- House 2: Ivory
- House 3: Green
- House 4: Unknown color
- House 5: Blue

### Step 3: Using clues about drinks.
9. Milk is drunk in the middle house (House 3).
5. Coffee is drunk in the green house (House 3).

This means:
- House 1: Norwegian, no milk or coffee.
- House 2: Ivory
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee.
- House 4: Unknown color
- House 5: Blue

### Step 4: Using clues about pets.
8. Kools are smoked in the yellow house (House 4).

So:
- House 1: Norwegian, no milk or coffee, no kools.
- House 2: Ivory.
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee.
- House 4: Yellow, Kools
- House 5: Blue

### Step 5: Using clues about residents and their pets.
7. Old Gold smoker owns snails.

We know:
- House 1: Norwegian, no milk or coffee, no kools, no old gold (snails).
- House 2: Ivory.
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee.
- House 4: Yellow, Kools
- House 5: Blue

### Step 6: Using clues about residents:
10. The Norwegian lives in the first house.

This reaffirms our setup so far. Let's continue with:
- House 1: Norwegian (no milk or coffee, no kools, no old gold)
- House 2: Ivory
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee.
- House 4: Yellow, Kools
- House 5: Blue

### Step 7: Using clues about the Englishman:
2. The Englishman lives in the red house.

Since we have no red or red-clued information for houses 1-4 (Norwegian, Ivory, Green, Yellow), it must be the last one:

So:
- House 1: Norwegian
- House 2: Ivory
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee.
- House 4: Yellow, Kools
- House 5: Blue (Red)

### Step 8: Using clues about the Spaniard's dog:
3. The Spaniard owns the dog.

We need to find a house for the Spaniard that fits all conditions:

Since the Norwegian is in 1 and the Englishman in 5, let’s check if Spaniard can fit into 2 or 4:
- House 2 (Ivory) cannot be Spanish.
- House 3 (Green with Milk/Coffee) not Spanish.
- House 4 (Yellow with Kools) not Spanish.

So Spaniard must be in the Blue house 5. And that makes:
- House 1: Norwegian
- House 2: Ivory
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee.
- House 4: Yellow, Kools
- House 5: Blue (Spanish with Dog)

### Step 9: Using clues about pets and drinks.
6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.

So:
- House 2: Ivory, Spaniard with dog.
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee.

This confirms all previous placements.

11. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.

Since House 4 (Yellow) has Kools, the only spot left for Chesterfields is:
- House 2 (Ivory) cannot be Chesterfields.
- House 3 (Green) must have the Fox, so
- House 4: Yellow, Kools and Horse

This leaves:
- House 5 (Blue): Spaniard with Dog.

12. Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
 
So:
- House 5: Blue, Spanish, Dog

Finally:
- House 3: Green, Milk, Coffee, Fox
- House 4: Yellow, Kools, Horse

Now using:
13. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.

The only one left for Lucky Strike is the Norwegian (House 1):

So:
- House 1: Norwegian, no milk or coffee, no kools, no old gold (snails), Lucky Strike and Orange Juice
- House 2: Ivory, Spaniard with dog.
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee, Fox.
- House 4: Yellow, Kools, Horse
- House 5: Blue, Spanish, Dog

Finally:
14. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.

So the only place left for the Japanese (House 2):

Thus:
- House 1: Norwegian, Lucky Strike and Orange Juice
- House 2: Ivory, Japanese with Dog.
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee, Fox
- House 4: Yellow, Kools, Horse
- House 5: Blue, Spanish, Dog

The only pet left for the Ukrainian is Zebra:
- House 1: Norwegian, Lucky Strike and Orange Juice
- House 2: Ivory, Japanese with Dog.
- House 3: Green, Milk and Coffee, Fox
- House 4: Yellow, Kools, Horse
- House 5: Blue, Spanish, Zebra

### Conclusion:
The zebra is in the last (Blue) house. So the answer is:

**zebra:5**"	zebra:5
Zebra_orig_3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each element according to the given clues and deduce the correct placement of the zebra. Let's start by organizing the information and solving step-by-step:

1. There are five houses.
2. The Englishman lives in the red house.
3. The Spaniard owns the dog.
4. Coffee is drunk in the green house.
5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
7. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
8. Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
9. Milk is drunk in the middle (3rd) house.
10. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
11. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
12. Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
13. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
14. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
15. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

Let's start by placing some of these elements based on their direct clues:

- **The Norwegian lives in the first house** and **next to the blue house**: Therefore, the second house is blue.
  - First House: Norwegian (blue)
  - Second House: Blue
- The **Ukrainian drinks tea**, so this must be in one of the houses. Given that **milk** is drunk in the middle (3rd) house, we need to find a place for the Ukrainian.
- The **green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house**: This means the sequence involving green and ivory can only fit into certain positions.

Let's deduce more based on the other clues:

- The **Englishman lives in the red house**. Since there are five houses, this must be a different color than the first or second (blue). Let’s place it as the fourth.
  - First House: Norwegian (blue)
  - Second House: Blue
  - Third House: Milk
  - Fourth House: Red (Englishman)

- The **Spaniard owns the dog** and this must be placed with a corresponding clue. Since Kools are in yellow, and Kools are next to the house with horses:
  - Fifth House: Yellow (Kools)
  
Now we have:

1. Norwegian (blue)
2. ?
3. Milk
4. Red (Englishman)
5. Yellow (Kools)

Next, let's fit the other elements:

- **Old Gold smoker owns snails**: This must be in a specific house.
- **The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice**:
  - Let’s place this as the third or fourth since we have no clear clue for these yet.

Let's fill in more logically:

- The green and ivory sequence: Green must be next to Ivory, so they can only fit into positions 1,2; 3,4; 4,5.
Since Norwegian is already in house 1 (blue), the sequence could be:
  - House 3: Green
  - House 4: Ivory

This fits well as we need green next to ivory and milk is middle.

Now:

1. Norwegian (blue)
2. ?
3. Green
4. Ivory
5. Yellow (Kools)

Next, place the rest based on clues:
- **Chesterfields next to fox**: The only house left for fox is 2nd.
- **Fox in House 2** and Chesterfields in 1 or 3.

Checking:

1. Norwegian (blue)
2. Fox
3. Green
4. Ivory
5. Yellow (Kools)

Now place the rest:
- **Old Gold owns snails**: Only fits 3rd.
- **Lucky Strike drinks orange juice** only left is 5th.
- **Parliaments for Japanese**: Only house left.

Thus:

1. Norwegian (blue)
2. Fox
3. Green (Coffee)
4. Ivory
5. Yellow (Kools, Parliaments)

Finally, the zebra must be owned by Spaniard in House 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
**zebra:2**"	zebra:5
Zebra_orig_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the correct placement of each element based on the given clues. Let's organize and piece together the information step by step.

1. There are five houses: red, green, ivory, yellow, blue.
2. The Englishman lives in the red house.
3. The Spaniard owns the dog.
4. Coffee is drunk in the green house.
5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
7. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
8. Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
9. Milk is drunk in the middle (third) house.
10. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
11. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
12. Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
13. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
14. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
15. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

Let's start by placing some basic elements:

- **Norwegian** lives in the first house and next to a **blue** house (Clue 10 & 15).
- Therefore, the second house is **blue**.

Now we can use Clue 6: The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house. Since there are only five houses, this means:
- Green must be in position 3 or 4.
- Ivory must be one position before that (2 or 3).

Given Milk is drunk in the middle (third) house (Clue 9), and green house drinks coffee (Clue 4):
- The third house cannot be green, so it's **milk**.

So far:
1. Norwegian - Blue
2. Blue
3. Milk - Green
4. Coffee - Ivory
5. ?

Now we can deduce the remaining elements based on other clues:

- Since the Spanish owns the dog (Clue 3), and there are no dogs in the first or third house, let's place it next to the green house as a possibility.
- The Japanese smokes Parliaments (Clue 14).
- Kools are smoked in the yellow house (Clue 8), which must be position 2.

So now we have:
1. Norwegian - Blue
2. Kools - Yellow
3. Milk - Green
4. Coffee - Ivory
5. ?

Using Clue 7: The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
- This can't be in the first, second, third, or fourth house as it must be next to one that we've already placed (no neighbors left for these).

Now place:
1. Norwegian - Blue
2. Kools - Yellow
3. Milk - Green
4. Coffee - Ivory
5. Old Gold - Red

Finally, check Clue 12: Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
- Kools (Yellow) must be next to Horse (can't fit now).

Since the green and ivory are already placed, and Kools next to yellow can't place Horse.

Now use Clue 13: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
- Lucky Strike (Orange Juice) fits in last blue.

So final:
1. Norwegian - Blue
2. Kools - Yellow
3. Milk - Green
4. Coffee - Ivory
5. Old Gold - Red

Check:
- Fox next to Chesterfield, Lucky Strike is Orange Juice, Japanese smokes Parliament.
- Water must be in remaining:

water: 4"	water:1
Zebra_orig_2	"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. There are five houses: red, green, ivory, yellow, blue.
2. The Englishman lives in the red house.
3. The Spaniard owns the dog.
4. Coffee is drunk in the green house.
5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
7. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
8. Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
9. Milk is drunk in the middle (3rd) house.
10. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
11. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
12. Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
13. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
14. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
15. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

From clues 6 and 7:
- Green = Ivory + 1
- Yellow = Kools (8th)

From clue 9, milk is in the middle (3rd) house. Let's place this information first:

1. Norwegian (Num1): ?
2. ? (Num2): ?
3. Milk (Num3)
4. ? (Num4): Green/Ivory
5. ? (Num5): ?

From clue 10, the Norwegian lives in the first house and next to a blue house:
- Num1 = Norwegian, Num5 = Blue

Now we need to place the green and ivory houses correctly based on clue 6:

Since the green house is right after the ivory one, let's assume:
- Ivory (Num2)
- Green (Num4)

From clues 3 and 7:
- Spaniard owns dog
- Kools are in yellow (Num8), so other pet clues need to fit.

Clue 15: Norwegian next to blue.
This means Num1 = Norwegian, Num5 = Blue.

Clue 2: Englishman lives in the red house.
Red is not Num1, Num3, or Num5, so it must be either Num2 (Ivory) or Num4 (Green).

From clue 5:
- Ukrainian drinks tea.
Since milk is in the middle (Num3), and we have already placed Norwegian (Num1), blue (Num5):
- Ukrainian can't be in house 1 or 5, so it must be either Num2, Num4.

Let's place Englishman in Num2 (Ivory):
- Englishman = Ivory

This means:
- Ukrainian is in the remaining spot (Num3 - middle) because they drink tea and milk is there.
- Red: Englishman
- Ivory: Norwegian + Blue
- Green: Middle, Coffee
- Yellow: Kools, Horse

Now for pets:
- Spaniard owns dog (Clue 3)
- Fox next to Chesterfield smoker (Clue 11)
- Horse in Kool's house (Clue 12)

From clues:
- Lucky Strike drinks Orange Juice (Clue 13)
- Japanese smokes Parliaments (Clue 14)

So, let's place drinks and cigarettes left over:

- Lucky Strike = Num5
- Japanese is in the remaining spot for cigarette brand.

Finally, we need to assign pets correctly:
- Dog: Spaniard (Num8)
- Fox: Chesterfield smoker next to horse (Kool's house).
- Zebra: Lucky Strike drinker

Now placing water and final check:

1. Norwegian (Blue) - Num1
2. Englishman (Ivory, red left) - Num2
3. Ukrainian (Milk) - Num3
4. Green house (Coffee) - Num4
5. Japanese (Parliaments) - Num5

From pets:
- Spaniard = Dog (Num8)
- Fox: Chesterfields next to Kool's house with horse.
- Zebra = Lucky Strike drinker (Num5)

Finally, the only pet left is Horse in yellow (Kools):

Therefore, water must be in the remaining place:

**water:3**

The water is in the middle house."	water:1
Zebra_orig_3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and logically deduce the placement of each element based on the given clues. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **House Colors**: Red, Green, Ivory, Yellow, Blue.
2. **Residents**: Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese.
3. **Pets**: Dog, Fox, Zebra, Horse, Snails.
4. **Drinks**: Coffee, Tea, Milk, Orange Juice, Water.
5. **Cigarettes**: Old Gold, Kools, Chesterfields, Lucky Strike, Parliaments.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **The Norwegian lives in the first house (Clue 10)**:
   - House 1: Norwegian

2. **The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (Clue 6)**:
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2) or (House 2, House 3) or (House 3, House 4)
   - Since Norwegian lives in House 1, it can't be green. Therefore, it must be Ivory and Green.

3. **The Englishman lives in the red house (Clue 2)**:
   - House 5: Red

4. **The Ukrainian drinks tea (Clue 5)**:
   - Since the Norwegian is in House 1, the Ukrainian can't live there.
   - The Ukrainian must be in one of the remaining houses.

5. **The green house drinks coffee (Clue 4)**:
   - Green: Coffee

6. **Milk is drunk in the middle house (House 3) (Clue 9)**:
   - House 3: Milk

7. **The Norwegian lives next to the blue house (Clue 15)**:
   - Since Norwegian lives in House 1, Blue must be in House 2.
   - Therefore, Ivory is in House 2.

8. **Kools are smoked in the yellow house (Clue 8)**:
   - Yellow: Kools

9. **The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice (Clue 13)**:
   - Lucky Strike: Orange Juice

10. **The Japanese smokes Parliaments (Clue 14)**:
    - Japan: Parliaments

11. **The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox (Clue 11)**:
    - Chesterfields: House 2 or House 3, and Fox must be in an adjacent house.

12. **Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept (Clue 12)**:
    - Kools: Yellow
    - Horse: Either House 4 or House 5

13. **The Old Gold smoker owns snails (Clue 7)**:
    - Old Gold: Snails

### Final Placement:

- **House 1**: Norwegian, Blue
- **House 2**: Ukrainian, Ivory, Kools
- **House 3**: Milk, Green, Coffee
- **House 4**: Horse, Yellow, Kools
- **House 5**: Red, Lucky Strike, Orange Juice

Since the Japanese smokes Parliaments (Clue 14) and there are no other restrictions on where the Japanese can live, we place them in House 2.

- **House 2**: Ukrainian, Ivory, Kools, Parliaments
- **House 3**: Milk, Green, Coffee
- **House 4**: Horse, Yellow, Kools
- **House 5**: Red, Lucky Strike, Orange Juice

The Englishman lives in the red house (Clue 2). Since there are no other restrictions for the Englishman's pet or drink:

- House 1: Norwegian, Blue
- House 2: Ukrainian, Ivory, Kools, Parliaments
- House 3: Milk, Green, Coffee
- House 4: Horse, Yellow, Kools (Fox cannot be here)
- House 5: Englishman, Red, Lucky Strike, Orange Juice

The remaining pets and drinks must fit:

- **House 2**: Fox (Chesterfields smoker), because it's next to the man with the fox.
- **House 3**: Tea for Ukrainian
- **House 4**: Zebra for Kools smoker.

### Final Answer:
Water is in House 5, as all other drinks are assigned.

**water:5**"	water:1
