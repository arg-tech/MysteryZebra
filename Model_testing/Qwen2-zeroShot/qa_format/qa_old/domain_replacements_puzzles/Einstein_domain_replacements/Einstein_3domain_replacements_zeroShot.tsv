Einstein_3domain_replacements_0	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues and deducing information based on each clue:

1. The British is the person traveling to Venice.
2. The Swedish is the owner of the dog.
3. The Danish is the person who's hobby is photography.
4. The person traveling to Miami is on the left of the person traveling to Hannover.
5. The person traveling to Miami is the person who's hobby is traveling.
6. The person watching documentary movies is the owner of the bird.
7. The person traveling to Nizza is the person watching Western movies.
8. The person who's hobby is fishing is in the middle.
9. The Norwegian is on the far left.
10. The person watching horror movies is the German.
11. The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool.
12. The person watching comedy movies is the person who's hobby is woodworking.
13. The person watching documentary movies is the owner of the bird (this reiterates clue 6).
14. The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool.
15. The person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading.

First, let's establish some basic placements and relationships:
- Norwegian is on the far left (Position 1)
- Danish has photography as a hobby
- British travels to Venice
- German watches horror movies

Let’s use these clues:

### Step-by-step Analysis:

#### Clue 4: 
The person traveling to Miami is on the left of the person traveling to Hannover.

#### Clue 5: 
The person traveling to Miami has the hobby of traveling (itself).

#### Clue 6:
The owner of the bird watches documentary movies.

#### Clue 7: 
The person traveling to Nizza watches Western movies.

#### Clue 8: 
The person with fishing as a hobby is in the middle.

#### Clue 9: 
Norwegian is on the far left (Position 1).

Since Norwegian is on the far left, they cannot be British or Danish. Thus, Norwegian can only be Swedish, German, or norwegian if we consider other countries. Since it mentions ""on the far left,"" let’s place the person:

- **Position 1: Norwegian**.

#### Clue 9 and 14:
The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool. This means the Norwegian can be in Position 1, and the person traveling to Liverpool must be next to them (Position 2).

So,
- **Position 1: Norwegian**
- **Position 2: Person Traveling to Liverpool**

#### Clue 4 & 5:
The person traveling to Miami is on the left of the person traveling to Hannover. And they have the hobby of traveling.

Since Position 2 must be for someone traveling, we place this next:

- **Position 2: Travelling to Liverpool**
- **Position 3: Traveling to Miami**

#### Clue 5:
The person traveling to Miami (and thus Position 3) has the hobby of traveling. 

So,
- **Position 3: Traveling to Miami (Hobby: Traveling)**

Thus, we have:

1. Norwegian
2. Person Traveling to Liverpool
3. Travelling to Miami (Hobby: Traveling)

Next clues help us further:
4. German watches horror movies.
5. Danish has photography as a hobby.

#### Clue 6 & 7:
Owner of the bird watches documentary movies, and person traveling to Nizza watches Western movies.

So,
- **Position 5: Nizza (Western Movies)**

Thus, we have:

1. Norwegian
2. Person Traveling to Liverpool
3. Travelling to Miami (Hobby: Traveling)
4. German (Horror)
5. Nizza (Western)

#### Clue 8:
Person with fishing as a hobby is in the middle.

So,
- **Position 3: Fishing (Middle)**

Thus, we have:

1. Norwegian
2. Person Traveling to Liverpool
3. Fishing (Hobby: Middle)
4. German (Horror)
5. Nizza (Western)

#### Clue 9:
Norwegian is on the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool.

This confirms our setup for Positions 1 and 2.

Now, we need to place hobbies:

- Danish has photography.
- British travels to Venice.
- Swedish keeps dog as a pet.
- German watches horror movies.
- Norwegian’s placement with travel context is established.
- Fishing in middle.

For pets:
1. Swedish has the dog.
2. Position 3 (middle) should be fishing.
3. Others must fit other placements.

Thus, fish:

**Fish:3**

This satisfies all conditions based on our logical placements and given clues."	fish:4
Einstein_3domain_replacements_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's organize and analyze each clue step-by-step to fill out a 5x5 grid that represents the people, their preferences, jobs, cities, and birthdays.

1. The person traveling to New York likes red.
2. The person traveling to Nicea is the dressmaker.
3. The person traveling to San Francisco has a birthday in February.
4. The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.
5. The person who likes green has a birthday in March.
6. The Pall-mall smoker is the dancer.
7. The person who likes yellow smokes Dunhill.
8. The person with a birthday in July is in the middle (position 3).
9. The person traveling to Prague is on the far left.
10. The Blend-smoker is on the left or right of the nurseerman.
11. The librarian is on the left or right of the Dunhill smoker.
12. The Bluemaster smoker has a birthday in November.
13. The person traveling to Venice is the prince-smoker.
14. The person traveling to Prague is on the left or right of the person who likes blue.
15. The Blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in May.

Let's start placing known values:
- Person 1 (far left) travels to Prague, so they are the dressmaker by clue 2.
- Person 3 has a birthday in July (clue 8).
- Person 5 likes green and was born in March (clues 4 & 5), which means person 4 must like white.

Now we can deduce:
- Nicea is not Prague, so Nicea's person could be born in February.
- New York's person has red as a preference.
- San Francisco's person is the dancer because of clue 6 (Pall-mall smoker) and clue 3 states it's not Nicea.

Next, we can place other values:
- Prague's person cannot like blue or green by clue 14. So, Prague's person could be born in November.
- The Bluemaster smoker has a birthday in November, so they are on the far right (position 5).
- Nicea is not Prague and must travel to Nicea with the dancer as the profession.
- New York's person likes red.

Next step:
- Venice's traveler is the prince-smoker by clue 13. Person 2 could be born in May since they are on the left of the November-born person (Bluemaster smoker).
- The librarian must be next to the Dunhill smoker, so if Nicea is the dressmaker and the person with a birthday in February, and Venice is the prince-smoker in position 4 or 2, then Prague's person could have a job of nurseerman.

Let’s finalize:
- Person 1 (Prague) can be the librarian.
- Person 2 (Nicea) could be born in February.
- Person 3 has July as a birthday.
- Person 4 is the prince-smoker and likes blue.
- Person 5 is the Bluemaster smoker.

Thus, the nurseerman must be person 9. 
The final answer is:
**nurse:3**"	nurse:4
Einstein_3domain_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a step-by-step approach based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing and interpreting each clue:

1. The person whose birthday is in April is the fan of metal.
2. The person whose birthday is in September is the owner of the dog.
3. The person whose birthday is in June is the one drinking tea.
4. The fan of country is on the left of the fan of salsa.
5. The fan of country is the one drinking coffee.
6. The musician owns the bird.
7. The fan of soul is the photographer.
8. The one drinking milk is in the middle.
9. The person whose birthday is in July is on the far left.
10. The paramedic is to the left or right of the owner of the cat.
11. The owner of the horse is to the left or right of the photographer.
12. The teacher drinks beer.
13. The person whose birthday is in December is the police-officer.
14. The person whose birthday is in July is to the left or right of the fan of indie.
15. The paramedic is to the left or right of the one drinking water.

We will now construct a table and fill it step by step:

| Month       | Music   | Beverage  | Job          | Pet         |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| April       | Metal   |           |              |             |
| July        | Indie   | Beer      | Teacher      |             |
| September   |         |           |              | Dog         |
| June        |         | Tea       |              | Bird        |
| December    | Soul    | Water     | Police-officer|            |

Now, let's use the clues to fill in more details:

- Clue 5: The fan of country is on the left of the fan of salsa. Since July and June are already filled, the fan of country must be in April.
- Clue 4: The fan of country drinks coffee. So, April also has coffee.
- Clue 7: The musician owns the bird. Bird is already assigned to June, so this detail needs re-evaluation.
  
Let's reassess:
- The musician’s pet is bird (Clue 6), so it must be in a different row.

Now, let's continue filling and re-evaluating:

| Month       | Music   | Beverage  | Job          | Pet         |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| April       | Metal   | Coffee    |              |             |
| July        | Indie   | Beer      | Teacher      |             |
| September   | Country |           |              | Dog         |
| June        | Salsa   | Tea       | Musician     | Bird        |
| December    | Soul    | Water     | Police-officer|            |

- Clue 10: The paramedic is to the left or right of the owner of the cat. This means the cat must be either in July, September, or December.
  
Since July and December are already filled:
- Cat can only be in September.

Now we have:

| Month       | Music   | Beverage  | Job          | Pet         |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| April       | Metal   | Coffee    |              |             |
| July        | Indie   | Beer      | Teacher      |             |
| September   | Country | Milk      | Paramedic    | Cat         |
| June        | Salsa   | Tea       | Musician     | Bird        |
| December    | Soul    | Water     | Police-officer| Horse      |

Finally, let’s fill in the missing job and pet:

- Clue 2: The dog is September's pet. This fits.
  
Thus, the final table:

| Month       | Music   | Beverage  | Job          | Pet         |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| April       | Metal   | Coffee    |             |             |
| July        | Indie   | Beer      | Teacher      |             |
| September   | Country | Milk      | Paramedic    | Dog         |
| June        | Salsa   | Tea       | Musician     | Bird        |
| December    | Soul    | Water     | Police-officer| Horse      |

Since the fish is not directly specified, we can infer it as:

**fish: 4**

The fish is in June."	fish:4
