Einstein_5domain_replacements_0	"Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify Direct Assignments
- From statement 5, we know that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house.
- Statement 6 tells us the architect was born in May.

### Step 2: Analyze Statements Involving Houses and People
- Statement 3 says the fan of rock lives in the palace. So, palace is taken.
- Statement 8 indicates that the gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 3).

### Step 3: Analyze Statements Involving Means of Transport
- From statement 1, the fan of trance drives the train.
- From statement 2, the fan of reggae has a birthday in September.
- Statement 4 tells us that the person driving the subway is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
- Statement 5 indicates the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house. 
- From statement 7, we know the mechanic drives the quad-bike.

### Step 4: Analyze Statements Involving Jobs and Birthdays
- Statement 6 tells us that the architect was born in May.
- Statement 9 says the fan of folk is on the far left (position 1).
- From statement 10, we know the librarian is either to the left or right of the person with a June birthday.
- From statement 11, the person born in July is either to the left or right of the mechanic (who drives the quad-bike).
- Statement 12 tells us that the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house.

### Step 5: Analyze Statements Involving Music Genres and People
- From statement 13, we know the bartender is the fan of ambient.
- From statement 14, the fan of folk is either to the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the fan of folk is on position 1 (statement 9), this means the person who drives the motorbike must be in position 2.

### Step 6: Determine Remaining Positions and Assignments
- From statement 15, we know the librarian is either to the left or right of the futuristic house. Since the architect's birthday is May (position 3 - from step 8), and the librarian can't be there due to the gothic-revival house being in position 3, we place the futuristic house on one end.

### Step 7: Finalize Positions
- Given all the constraints:
    1. Fan of folk: Born in February (statement 9)
    2. Born in May: Architect (statement 6)
    3. Born in July: Cannot be librarian or architect.
    4. Born in June: Can't be architect, so it must be librarian.

From the positions:
1. Fan of folk
2. Person driving motorbike
3. Gothic-revival house - Architect (May)
4. Suburban (left of subway driver)
5. Futuristic

Let's assign the rest:

- February is for the fan of folk, who must be in position 1.
- June: Librarian, so can't be in 2 or 3.
- July: Can only be in position 4.

Therefore:
```
february:1
```"	february:4
Einstein_5domain_replacements_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down and place each piece according to the given clues:

1. The fan of pop is the person traveling to venice.
2. The fan of disco is the person playing chess.
3. The fan of funk is the person who plays parkour.
4. The person traveling to paris is on the left of the person traveling to nizza.
5. The person traveling to paris is the person who plays lacrosse.
6. The goerman is the person playing backgammon.
7. The person traveling to london is the architect.
8. The person who plays biathlon is in the middle.
9. The fan of techno is on the far left.
10. The dressmaker is on the left or right of the person playing whist.
11. The person playing scrabble is on the left or right of the architect.
12. The teacher is the person who plays swimming.
13. The fan of blues is the entrepreneur.
14. The fan of techno is on the far left (already stated in clue 9).
15. The dressmaker is on the left or right of the person who plays cycling.

Now, let's assign these to positions based on their order:

1. **Fan of Techno** (clue 9 and 14) - far left.
2. Since the fan of techno is the only one in this position, we can place them as follows: 
   - Position 1: Fan of Techno
3. The person playing scrabble is on the left or right of the architect (clue 11).
4. The person traveling to london is the architect (clue 7), so they are in:
   - Position 2: Architect (London traveler)
5. The fan of blues is the entrepreneur (clue 13). Entrepreneurs can be placed as follows, considering scrabble and techno are already assigned.
6. Since the teacher plays swimming (clue 12), let's place them next:
   - Position 3: Teacher (Swimming)
7. The person who plays biathlon is in the middle (clue 8):
   - Position 4: Biathlon player
8. Now, we need to fit remaining pieces.
9. The fan of disco is playing chess (clue 2), so:
   - Position 5: Chess/Disco fan
10. Let's place the remaining:
    - Since the fan of funk plays parkour (clue 3):
      - Position 3 or 4 (but already taken by Teacher and Biathlon, so it must be 5)
      - Position 5: Fan of Funk/Parkour
11. We still have pop and the remaining traveler positions to fill.
    - The fan of pop travels to venice (clue 1), and since the architect is in position 2:
      - Position 3 or 4, but Teacher and Biathlon are taken by 3.
      - Position 5: Fan of Pop/Venice
12. Now we need to fit the sports and the remaining traveler to nizza (clue 4).
    - The person traveling to paris is on the left of the person traveling to nizza, and Parisian plays lacrosse:
      - Position 3 or 5 taken by Teacher and Fan of Pop.
      - Position 4: Lacrosse player/Parisian
      - Position 5: Nizza traveler (remaining)

Now let's summarize:

- **Fan of Techno**: Position 1
- **Architect (London)**: Position 2
- **Teacher (Swimming)**: Position 3
- **Biathlon Player**: Position 4
- **Chess/Disco Fan**: Position 5

Since the positions for sports and travelers are fixed, we now fit jobs and games:

1. The fan of disco is playing chess.
2. The goerman plays backgammon (clue 6).
3. The person traveling to miami is a fan of techno or blues (clue 14).

Given all constraints, the only remaining job for the remaining game:

- **Go**: Position 5

Thus, the final answer is:
**go:5**"	go:4
Einstein_5domain_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each element based on the given clues. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Assign months and food:**
   - May: Corn (Clue 1)
   - February: Baseball (Clue 2)
   - August: Electronic (Clue 3)

2. **Determine the order of eating foods based on Clues 4, 5:**
   - Tomato is to the left of Nectarine.
   - Tomato fan of Salsa.

3. **Assign means of transport and sports based on other clues:**
   - Boat: Climbing (Clue 6)
   - Car: Blueberry (Clue 7)
   - Train: Jazz (Clue 12)
   - Airplane: July (Clue 13)

4. **Determine the positions based on Clues 8, 9, and others:**
   - Indie fan is in the middle.
   - March birthday is on the far left.
   - March birthday is to the left or right of Kale.

5. **Positioning people with trike and handball:**
   - Trike: Handball or Pop (Clue 10, Clue 15)
   - Car: Blueberry (already assigned)
   - Airplane: July

Now let's place these elements step-by-step:

1. **Leftmost position: March birthday**
   - Let's assume it is Kale for now.

2. **Indie fan in the middle:**
   - This means the person's birthday must be in June (since we have May, July, August, February, and March).

3. **February: Baseball**
   - Person eating Tomato on left of Nectarine.
   
4. **August: Electronic**

5. **May: Corn** (Clue 1)

6. **July: Airplane (Clue 13)**

7. **Car: Blueberry (Clue 7)**

8. **Train: Jazz (Clue 12)**

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

- Boat: Climbing (Clue 6)
- Trike: Handball or Pop (Clue 10 and Clue 15)

Since Tomato is to the left of Nectarine:
- If March is Kale, then Tomato must be next to it.

Given all these clues, let's finalize:

**Sequence:**

1. **March: Kale**
2. **April: Tomato (left of Nectarine)**
3. **June: Indie fan**
4. **July: Airplane**
5. **August: Electronic**
6. **May: Corn**
7. **February: Baseball and Boat: Climbing**
8. **Car: Blueberry**
9. **Train: Jazz**

Given the remaining elements:
- Trike can be either Handball or Pop.

Since Handball is to the right of July (Airplane) or February (Baseball), it must be placed accordingly.

Final placement:

1. **March: Kale**
2. **April: Tomato**
3. **May: Corn**
4. **June: Indie fan**
5. **July: Airplane**
6. **August: Electronic**
7. **February: Baseball and Boat: Climbing**

Thus, the handball is in position 7 or 8 (trike).

**handball:7**"	handball:4
