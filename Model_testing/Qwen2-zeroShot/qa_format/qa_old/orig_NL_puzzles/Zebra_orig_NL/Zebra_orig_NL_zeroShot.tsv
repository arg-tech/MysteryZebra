Zebra_orig_NL_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use a process of elimination and logical deduction based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the information:

1. English: likes red
2. Spanish: owns dog
3. Green drinker: likes green (to the right of ivory)
4. Ukrainian: drinks tea
5. Green drinker is to the right of ivory
6. Old-Gold smoker: owns snails
7. Kools smoker: likes yellow
8. Milk drinker: in the middle
9. Norwegian: on the far left
10. Chesterfields smoker: next to fox owner
11. Kools smoker is next to horse owner
12. Lucky-Strike smoker: drinks orange juice
13. Japanese: smokes Parliaments
14. Norwegian is next to blue

Let's lay out the 5 houses from left to right, noting that the Norwegian is on the far left (House 1).

### Step-by-step Deduction:

1. **Norwegian** is in House 1.
2. **Spanish** owns a dog: Since the Spanish person can't be in House 1 (Norwegian), we will place them later as needed.
3. **English** likes red, so they must be in House 2 or 5 because of the green drinker's position.
4. **Green drinker** is to the right of ivory, meaning green cannot be in House 1 and ivory can't be in House 5.
5. **Ukrainian** drinks tea: They can only be in Houses 3-5 since Norwegian (House 1) has no beverage clue directly related.
6. **Old-Gold smoker owns snails**: This person is not the Spanish (who own dog).
7. **Kools smoker likes yellow and is next to horse owner**: Kool's user must be House 2 or 4, so they can't be in Houses 1 or 5.
8. **Milk drinker is in the middle** (House 3): This narrows down possible occupants for that house.
9. **Chesterfields smoker next to fox owner**: This means Chesterfield and Fox owners are House 2-4, with one of them being adjacent.
10. **Lucky-Strike drinks orange juice**: They must be in a House where this is the only given clue so far.
11. **Japanese smokes Parliaments**: This person can't own any pet directly (no clues yet).
12. **Norwegian is next to blue**: Since Norwegian is at 1, Blue can be in 2.

### Placing People and Pets:

- **House 1: Norwegian**
- **House 2: English (likes red) or Kools smoker (next to horse)**

Since the English likes red, they must be in a position where green drinker is not directly next. Therefore:
- House 2 can't be for green since it's right of ivory.

- **House 3: Milk drinker**
- **House 4: Chesterfield or Lucky-Strike (Orange juice) smoker**

### Pets and Beverages:

1. **Spanish** owns dog, so they must be in a position not 1.
2. Kools are at House 2 since Kool's user is next to horse owner.
3. Horse owner can only be House 2 or 4.

Thus:
- **House 2: Kools smoker (yellow drinker) and Horse**
- **House 4: Lucky-Strike smoker, Orange juice drinker**

### Beverage Placement:

1. **Ukrainian drinks tea** must be in a position where no direct clue about beverages or pets is specified.
2. **Green drinker to the right of Ivory**: This places Green at House 3 (Milk).

So:
- **House 4: Lucky-Strike, Orange juice**
- **House 5: Japanese, Parliaments**

### Final Clues:

1. **Spanish own Dog** should be in a position where no direct pet or beverage clue is specified.
2. **Norwegian next to Blue**: This means Norwegian must have blue as a color.

Thus:
- **House 3: Ukrainian (Tea), Green drinker**
- **House 5: Japanese, Parliaments**

### Final Layout:

1. Norwegian
2. Kools smoker, Yellow, Horse owner
3. Ukrainian, Tea, Green drinker
4. Lucky-Strike, Orange juice
5. Japanese, Parliaments

### Beverage Placement:
- Milk (middle), so House 3.
- Water: Must be in the remaining position.

Thus:

**Water:2**

This layout satisfies all clues and constraints given."	water:1
Zebra_orig_NL_2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information into a grid that represents the five houses lined up from left to right. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **House 1 (leftmost): Norwegian** - From clue 9.
2. **English likes red** - From clue 1.
3. **Spanish owns dog** - From clue 2.
4. **Person drinking coffee likes green** - From clue 3.
5. **Ukranian drinks tea** - From clue 4.
6. **Green is to the right of Ivory** - Clue 5, so if Green is in House 2 or higher, Ivory must be one house left of it.
7. **Old-gold-smoker owns snails** - Clue 6.
8. **Kools-smoker likes yellow** - From clue 7.
9. **Milk-drinker is in the middle (House 3)** - Clue 8.
10. **Chesterfields-smoker is left or right of fox-owner** - Clue 10, indicating these can't be far apart.
11. **Kools-smoker is left or right of horse-owner** - Clue 11.
12. **Lucky-strike-smoker drinks orange-juice** - From clue 12.
13. **Japanese smokes parliaments** - Clue 13.
14. **Norwegian (House 1) is left or right of the blue-liking person** - Clue 14, so if Norwegian is House 1, blue must be in House 2 or higher.

Let's place some key points first:

- House 1: Norwegian
- House 3: Milk-drinker (from clue 8)

Now, we know the sequence of colors and nationalities should align properly. Let’s determine the order based on clues related to positions and relationships:
- The English likes red, so they can’t be in House 1 or 5.
- The Spanish owns a dog, and since he must be different from the Norwegian (House 1), he can be placed anywhere except House 1.

Since the green drinker is to the right of the ivory drinker:
- If Ivory is in House 1 or 2, Green cannot be in those houses.
- Therefore, if Ivory is in House 2, then Green must be in House 3 (the middle house).

Given milk is in House 3 and coffee is green (House 4), we can deduce the following:
- If Coffee is in House 4, Tea must be in House 5 because Ukranian drinks tea.

Now, let's place the brands of cigars:
- Kools-smoker likes yellow.
- Lucky-strike-smoker drinks orange juice.
- Old-gold-smoker owns snails (snails can only be in one of the houses).

We know that Japanese smokes Parliaments, so Parliaments must be in House 5.

Now we need to place the pets and final nationalities:
- The Spanish owns a dog. Since the German is in House 1, it means the Spanish cannot be in House 1.
- The person drinking coffee likes green (House 4), so this person can't be Norwegian or Ukranian.
- The person who drinks milk is in House 3 and must like blue.

Now placing everything:
1. Norwegian
2. Ivory
3. Milk, Blue
4. Coffee, Green
5. Tea, Parliaments

The only beverage left for the water is House 2:

**Water:2**

So, the final arrangement is:

- **House 1:** Norwegian (Blue)
- **House 2:** Water
- **House 3:** Milk, Blue
- **House 4:** Coffee, Green
- **House 5:** Tea, Parliaments"	water:1
Zebra_orig_NL_3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to arrange the information into a grid that helps us figure out the correct positions for each piece of data. Let's start by setting up our 5x5 grid with rows representing the nationalities and columns representing the colors, beverages, pets, cigars, and order (1-5). Here’s how it might look initially:

|      | Color   | Beverage    | Pet       | Cigar     | Order |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1.   | Norway  |             |           |           |       |
| 2.   | Spain   |             |           |           |       |
| 3.   | Ukraine |             |           |           |       |
| 4.   | Japan   |             |           |           |       |
| 5.   | England |             |           |           |       |

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Norwegian is on the far left** (Rule 9):
   - Place Norway in column 1.

2. **English likes red** (Rule 1):
   - The English person must like Red, so place ""Red"" for England in the Color column.

3. **Spanish owns dog** (Rule 2):
   - The Spanish person owns a Dog, so place ""Dog"" under Spain's row and Pet column.

4. **Person drinking coffee likes green** (Rule 3):
   - Coffee is placed in the Beverage column.
   - Green is placed in the Color column for this person.

5. **Ukrainian drinks tea** (Rule 4):
   - Tea is placed under Ukraine's row and Beverage column.

6. **Person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory** (Rule 5):
   - Place Ivory in a cell, then Green must be placed one cell to its right.

7. **Old-gold-smoker owns snails** (Rule 6):
   - Old-Gold is placed under the Snail's row and Cigar column.
   
8. **Kools-smoker likes yellow** (Rule 7):
   - Yellow is placed in the Color column for the Kools smoker.

9. **Person drinking milk is in the middle** (Rule 8):
   - Place Milk in the third row of Beverage, which is the middle.

10. **Chesterfields are on the left or right of the owner of the fox** (Rule 10):
    - Place Chesterfields and Fox accordingly to fit this rule.

11. **Kools smoker is left or right of horse owner** (Rule 11):
    - Place Kools and Horse in adjacent columns.

12. **Lucky-strike drinks orange juice** (Rule 12):
    - Orange Juice is placed under Lucky-Strike's row and Beverage column.

13. **Japanese smokes parliaments** (Rule 13):
    - Parliaments are placed under Japan's row and Cigar column.
   
14. **Norwegian is to the left or right of person who likes blue** (Rule 14):
    - Place Blue next to Norway.

### Final Grid:

|      | Color   | Beverage     | Pet       | Cigar     | Order |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1.   | Norway  | Milk         | Horse     | Kools     |       |
| 2.   | Spain   | Orange Juice | Fox       | Lucky-Strike |      |
| 3.   | Ukraine | Coffee      |           | Chesterfields |  3 |
| 4.   | Japan   | Tea         | Zebra    | Parliaments |       |
| 5.   | England | Red         | Green     | Old-Gold  |       |

**Water is in the Beverage column for the last row (England's row)**.

So, **water:5**."	water:1
Zebra_orig_NL_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each given clue and arrange them accordingly. Let's start by organizing the information into a grid or table for clarity:

|  Nationality | Color        | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet          |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Norwegian    |              |               |             |              |
| English      | Red          |                |             |              |
| Spanish      |              |                | Kools       | Dog          |
| Ukrainian    | Tea          | Coffee        |             |              |
| Japanese     |              | Water         | Parliament  |              |

Let's fill in the clues step by step:

1. The Norwegian is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Norwegian

2. The English likes red and drinks coffee (clues 1 and 3).
   - Position 5: English, Color = Red, Beverage = Coffee

3. The Spanish owns a dog (clue 2).
   - Position 4: Spanish, Pet = Dog

4. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
   - Position 3: Ukrainian, Beverage = Tea

5. The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory (clues 5 and 6).
   - We need to find positions for these colors.

6. The Old-Gold smoker owns snails.
   - Clue 6 gives us another piece of information about the position and cigar, but we don't know the exact color or beverage yet.

7. The Kools smoker likes yellow (clue 7).
   - Position 4: Spanish, Cigar = Kools, Color = Yellow

8. The person drinking milk is in the middle.
   - Position 3: Beverage = Milk

9. The Chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
   - This narrows down potential positions for both.

10. The Kools smoker (Spanish) is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.
    - Since Spanish owns dog, and we need a position for the horse, it must be in Position 2.

11. The Lucky-Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
    - Position 5: Cigar = Lucky-Strike, Beverage = Orange Juice

12. The Japanese is the Parliament smoker (clue 13).
    - Position 5: Nationality = Japanese, Cigar = Parliament

Now let's place everything we have:

|  Nationality | Color        | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet          |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Norwegian    |              |               |             |              |
| English      | Red          | Coffee        |             |              |
| Ukrainian    | Tea          | Milk          |             |              |
| Spanish      | Yellow       | -             | Kools       | Dog          |
| Japanese     | -            | Water         | Parliament  | -            |

From clue 9, we know the owner of the fox is either in Position 2 or 4. Let's check:

- If the owner of the fox were in Position 4 (Spanish), it would contradict with the Kools smoker.
- Therefore, the fox must be in Position 2.

|  Nationality | Color        | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet          |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Norwegian    |              |               |             |              |
| English      | Red          | Coffee        | -           |              |
| Ukrainian    | Tea          | Milk          |             |              |
| Spanish      | Yellow       | -             | Kools       | Dog          |
| Japanese     | -            | Water         | Parliament  | Fox          |

From clue 10, the Chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. Since the owner of the fox (Spanish) is in Position 4:

- The Chesterfields smoker must be in Position 3.
  
|  Nationality | Color        | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet          |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Norwegian    |              |               |             |              |
| English      | Red          | Coffee        | -           |              |
| Ukrainian    | Tea          | Milk          | Chesterfields  |              |
| Spanish      | Yellow       | -             | Kools       | Dog          |
| Japanese     | -            | Water         | Parliament  | Fox          |

Now, we need to place the remaining pet and color. The only pet left is the zebra, so it must be in Position 1 (Norwegian).

The remaining color for the Ukrainian is blue.

|  Nationality | Color        | Beverage      | Cigar       | Pet          |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Norwegian    | Blue         | -             | Lucky-Strike | Zebra        |
| English      | Red          | Coffee        | -           |              |
| Ukrainian    | Tea          | Milk          | Chesterfields  |              |
| Spanish      | Yellow       | -             | Kools       | Dog          |
| Japanese     | -            | Water         | Parliament  | Fox          |

So, the zebra is in position 1.

**zebra:1**"	zebra:5
Zebra_orig_NL_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each element based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Nationalities and Colors**: 
   - English likes red.
   - Norwegian is on the far left (position 1).
   - Ukrainian drinks tea.
   - The person drinking milk is in position 3.

2. **Pets**:
   - Spanish owns the dog.
   - Fox and Zebra need to be placed, but let's wait until we have more information.

3. **Cigars and Beverages**: 
   - Old-gold smoker is the owner of snails (10th clue).
   - Kools smoker likes yellow (7th clue) and also owns horse (from 11th clue, left or right of fox).
   - Ukrainian drinks tea.
   - Person drinking coffee likes green (3rd clue), so position 4 must be green.
   - Lucky-strike smoker is the one drinking orange-juice (12th clue).
   - Japanese smokes parliaments.

4. **Relative Positioning**:
   - Green is to the right of ivory (5th clue). This means if a person likes ivory, they cannot be in position 5.
   - Person drinking milk is in the middle (3rd clue), so it's in position 4.
   - Norwegian is on the far left (1st position).
   - Zebra and fox need to be placed.

Let's arrange them step by step:

- Position 1: Norwegian
- Position 2: English, likes red
- Position 3: Milk drinker
- Position 4: Green (drinker)
- Position 5: Ivory, then red (since green is to the right of ivory)

Now, we need to place the rest considering all clues:

- Ukrainian drinks tea and has no position yet. Let's check if it fits in positions where tea can be.
- Kools smoker likes yellow (7th clue) and owns horse (11th clue). This must fit between Norwegian and Ukrainian since only two slots left for them, and the kools owner should be left or right of the fox.

Let's place the remaining elements:
- Japanese smokes parliaments (13th clue).
- Old-gold smoker has snails. Since we have 2, 4, 5 taken, let's assume they are in positions 1 and 5 for now.
- Kools smoker likes yellow and owns horse.

We can fit the rest:
- Spanish is with dog at some position (2 or 3).
- Lucky-strike drinks orange juice (12th clue), so that must be a position not yet taken.

Let's see if we can arrange them:

1. Norwegian
2. English, red
3. Milk drinker (position 3)
4. Green drinker
5. Ivory, then Red

We still need to place Ukrainian, Japanese, fox, and zebra in the remaining slots.

- Position 2: Spanish with dog.
- Position 6 or 7 for fox and zebra (since Zebra should be next to Fox).

Considering all clues:

1. Norwegian
2. English, red
3. Milk drinker (position 3)
4. Green drinker
5. Ivory, then Red

Ukrainian is left with Tea.
Japanese has Parliaments.

Let's place the remaining:
- Position 6: Fox
- Position 7: Zebra (next to fox)

So, we have:

1. Norwegian
2. English, red
3. Milk drinker (position 3)
4. Green drinker
5. Ivory, then Red

Ukrainian is left with Tea.
Japanese has Parliaments.

- Spanish is with dog at position 2.
- Kools with yellow and horse in positions 6 or 7.
- Lucky-strike drinks orange juice (in a free spot).

Final arrangement:

1. Norwegian
2. Spanish, dog
3. Milk drinker
4. Green drinker
5. Ivory, then Red

Ukrainian: Tea
Japanese: Parliaments
Kools with Horse at 7th position.
Lucky-strike drinks Orange Juice.

Thus, the zebra is in position 6:

**zebra:6**"	zebra:5
Zebra_orig_NL_3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each element (nationality, favorite color, brand of cigar, beverage, pet) according to the given clues. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The Norwegian is on the far left.
2. The English person likes red.
3. The Spanish owns the dog.
4. The person drinking coffee likes green.
5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
6. The Old-Gold smoker owns the snails.
7. The Kools smoker likes yellow.
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (3rd position).
9. The Japanese smokes Parliament cigars.
10. The Chesterfield smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
11. The Kools smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.
12. The Lucky-Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
13. The person liking green is to the right of the person liking ivory.
14. The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.

Let's start by placing some initial information:

1. **Position 1:** Norwegian
   - Nationality: Norwegian

2. Since the English person likes red, and the Norwegian is on the far left:
   - Position 1: Norwegian (Nationality), Red (Color)

3. The Spanish owns the dog.
   - Position 2 or 4 must be Spanish (Nationality) with Dog.

4. The person drinking coffee likes green.
   - Position 3: Coffee (Beverage), Green (Color)

5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
   - Position 5: Ukrainian (Nationality), Tea (Beverage)

6. Since the Old-Gold smoker owns the snails:
   - We need to place Old-Gold and snails.

7. The Kools smoker likes yellow:
   - Kools is not in position 1 or 5, so it must be in Position 2, 3, or 4.
   - Position 2: Spanish (Nationality), Dog

8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (Position 3) and likes green already.

9. The Japanese smokes Parliament cigars:
   - Position 5: Japanese (Nationality), Tea (Beverage), Parliament Cigars

10. The Lucky-Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
    - This must be someone else, not Kools or Old-Gold.

Now we need to place the remaining elements:

11. Chesterfield smoker is on left or right of fox owner:
   - Possible positions: 2 or 4
   - If Position 2 (Spanish) owns dog and likes yellow, then Position 3 (middle) has coffee and green.
   - This leaves Positions 4 and 5 for Chesterfield and Fox.

12. Kools smoker is left or right of horse owner:
    - Possible positions: 2 or 3
    - Since Kools must be in one of these, we place it here as well.

So far, the setup looks like:

- Position 1: Norwegian (Nationality), Red (Color)
- Position 2: Spanish (Nationality), Dog (Pet), Yellow (Favorite Color)
- Position 3: Coffee (Beverage), Green (Color)
- Position 4 or 5: Chesterfield (Cigar) and Fox (Pet)
- Position 5: Japanese (Nationality), Tea (Beverage), Parliament Cigars

From the remaining:
- Kools must be in position 2, not 3.
- Lucky-Strike is orange juice.

This gives us:

1. Position 1: Norwegian (Nationality) - Red (Color)
2. Position 2: Spanish (Nationality) - Dog (Pet), Yellow (Favorite Color)
3. Position 3: Coffee (Beverage) - Green (Color)
4. Position 4 or 5: Chesterfield (Cigar), Fox (Pet)
5. Position 5: Japanese (Nationality) - Tea (Beverage), Parliament Cigars

Since the Lucky-Strike is orange juice and Kools are yellow, this leaves us with:

**Position 4:** Chesterfield (Cigar), Fox (Pet)

So, the zebra must be in position 3 or 5. Given that Position 3 has coffee and green, and position 5 has tea and Japanese, the only place left for the zebra is **position 2**.

Thus, the final placement is:

- Zebra: 2

The answer is:
**zebra:2**"	zebra:5
