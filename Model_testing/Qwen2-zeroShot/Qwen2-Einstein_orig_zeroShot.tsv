- If Green is in House 2, then White must be in House 3.
- If Green is in House 3, then White must be in House 4.
- If Green is in House 4, then White must be in House 5.

- Bluemaster is in House 5.

From clue 13, German smokes Prince:

- Blend is in House 4, so Water must be in House 3 (Red house, but already Milk).

From clue 2, Swede keeps Dogs:
- Swede keeps Dogs in House 5 (Bluemaster).

From clue 3, Dane drinks Tea:
- Dane drinks Tea in House 2 (Blue).

Now we can fill in the rest:
- Danish in House 2 (Blue, Dane, Tea).
- German in House 4 (Prince, Bluemaster, Beer).

Let's go through the clues step-by-step:

1. **The Brit lives in a Red house.**
   - British person in Red house.

2. **The Swede keeps Dogs as pets.**
   - Swede owns Dog.

3. **The Dane drinks Tea.**
   - Dane drinks Tea.

4. **The Green house is on the left of the White house.**
   - Green and White are adjacent, with Green to the left of White.

5. **The Green house owner drinks Coffee.**
   - Green house owner drinks Coffee.

6. **The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds.**
   - Pall Mall smoker owns Bird.

7. **The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.**
   - Yellow house owner smokes Dunhill.

8. **The owner living in the center house drinks Milk.**
   - Center house (3rd house) owner drinks Milk.

9. **The Norwegian lives in the first house.**
   - Norwegian in 1st house.

10. **The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats.**
    - Blend smoker is next to Cat owner.

11. **The owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.**
    - Horse owner is next to Dunhill smoker (Yellow house).

12. **The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer.**
    - Bluemaster smoker drinks Beer.

13. **The German smokes Prince.**
    - German smokes Prince.

14. **The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house.**
    - Norwegian in 1st house, so Blue house must be 2nd house.

15. **The owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water.**
    - Blend smoker is next to Water drinker.

Now let's place the pieces together:

- Norwegian in 1st house, so 1st house is Blue (from clue 14).
- Green house is next to White (clue 4), and Green house owner drinks Coffee (clue 5).
- German smokes Prince (clue 13), so German cannot be in 1st or 5th house.
- British in Red (clue 1), so British cannot be in 1st or 5th house.
- Swede keeps Dogs (clue 2), so Swede cannot be in 1st or 5th house.
- Danish drinks Tea (clue 3), so Danish cannot be in 1st or 5th house.
- Dunhill smoker is in Yellow house (clue 7), so Yellow house is 5th.
- Blend smoker is next to Cat owner (clue 10), and Blend smoker has a neighbor who drinks Water (clue 15). So Blend must be in 4th house, and Water drinker in 3rd house (since 4th house is Blend, 3rd house must be Water).

So we can place the following:
- 1st house: Blue (Norwegian)
- 2nd house: Yellow (Dunhill)
- 3rd house: Water (Milk drinker)
- 4th house: Blend (Cat owner)
- 5th house: White (Green house, Coffee drinker)

Since the British lives in the Red house (clue 1), the only place left for Red is the 3rd house (Milk drinker).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
||1|2|3|4|5|
| Color     | Yellow | Blue  | Red   | Green | White |
| Nationality | Norwegian | Danish | British | German | Swedish |
| Pet       | Cat    | Horse | Bird  | Fish  | Dog   |
| Beverage  | Water  | Tea   | Milk  | Coffee| Beer  |
| Cigar     | Dunhill| Blend | Pall-mall | Prince | Bluemaster |

And the final solution is:
- Norwegian: Blue, Cat, Water, Dunhill
- Danish: Yellow, Horse, Tea, Blend
- British: Red, Bird, Milk, Pall-mall
- German: Green, Fish, Coffee, Prince
- Swedish: White, Dog, Beer, Bluemaster
