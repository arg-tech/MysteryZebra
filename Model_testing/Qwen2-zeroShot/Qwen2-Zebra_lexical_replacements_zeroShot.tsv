Zebra_lexical_replacements_1	"Let's solve the puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 9**: The German is on the far left.
   - Position 1: German

2. **Clue 1**: The Colombian is the person who likes light-chestnut.
   - Position 5: Light-chestnut (Colombian)

3. **Clue 2**: The Brazilian is the owner of the goldfish.
   - Position 2: Goldfish (Brazilian)

4. **Clue 3**: The person drinking cola is the person who likes lilac.
   - Position 4: Cola (Lilac)

5. **Clue 4**: The Argentine is the person drinking juice.
   - Position 3: Juice (Argentine)

6. **Clue 5**: The person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes fuchsia.
   - Lilac must be in position 4 and Fuchsia must be in position 3.

7. **Clue 7**: The Oliveros-smoker is the person who likes coral.
   - Position 5: Coral (Oliveros)

8. **Clue 13**: The Nigerian is the tiparillo-smoker.
   - Position 5: Tiparillo (Nigerian)

Since we already have the Colombian in position 5, this means the Nigerian cannot be in position 5, so let's place the Nigerian in another position. We'll need to determine which one later.

9. **Clue 10**: The Dunhill-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
   - Position 1 or 5: Dunhill (left or right of cat)

10. **Clue 11**: The Oliveros-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
    - Position 2 or 4: Oliveros (left or right of hamster)

11. **Clue 12**: The Swisher-smoker is the person drinking fanta.
    - Position 4: Fanta (Swisher)

Since we already have the person drinking cola in position 4, this means the person drinking fanta must be in position 4 as well. This confirms that the person drinking cola is the person who likes lilac, and the person drinking fanta is the person who smokes Swisher.

12. **Clue 6**: The Aristoff-smoker is the owner of the mouse.
    - Position 5: Mouse (Aristoff)

This means the Colombian who likes light-chestnut cannot be the owner of the mouse, so the mouse must belong to someone else.

13. **Clue 14**: The German is to the left or right of the person who likes chestnut.
    - Position 1 or 2 or 3 or 4: Chestnut

Since the German is in position 1, the person who likes chestnut can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

### Final Table Setup:

| Nationality | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Light-chestnut | Colombian |        |        |        |        |

| Coral        |        |        |        |        | Nigerian |
| Fanta        |        |        |        | Swisher|        |
| Chestnut     |        |        |        |        |        |

### Determining Remaining Values:

- Position 1: German
- Position 2: Brazilian (Goldfish)
- Position 3: Argentine (Juice)
- Position 4: Cola (Lilac)
- Position 5: Light-chestnut (Colombian), Coral (Oliveros), Fanta (Swisher), Chestnut (unknown), Nigerian (Tiparillo)

Given the constraints:
- The Oliveros-smoker (position 5) is to the left or right of the hamster.
- The Dunhill-smoker is to the left or right of the cat.
- The German is to the left or right of the person who likes chestnut.

From these constraints and the positions, we can deduce:
- Position 1: German (Dunhill, cat)
- Position 2: Brazilian (Goldfish)
- Position 3: Argentine (Juice)
- Position 4: Cola (Lilac)
- Position 5: Light-chestnut (Colombian), Coral (Oliveros), Fanta (Swisher), Chestnut (Aristoff, mouse), Nigerian (Tiparillo)
