### Initial Assignments:
- **Electronic** must be in the far left position.
- **Indie** is in the first position since it corresponds to Onion.
- **Pop** must be in the second position because it grows Azalea.
- **Victorian** must be in the second or third position as it eats Radish.
- **Zucchini** is in the third or fourth position because it is to the right of Carrot.

Let's assign these positions:

| Music-Genre | Indie  | Pop   |      |      |      |
| Food        | Onion  | Azalea|      |      |      |
| Game        |       | Go    |      |      |      |
| House       | Colonial|       |      |      |      |
| Flower      | Bellflower|      |      |      |      |

Next, we can place the remaining positions based on the clues:

- **Monopoly** must be in the middle (position 3).
- **Trance** must be in the fifth position.
- **Gothic-revival** must be in the first or second position (left of Marigold).

Since **Electronic** is in the first position and **Trance** is in the fifth position, let's place them:

| Food        | Onion      | Azalea|      |      | Lettuce|

| House       | Colonial  |       |      | Gothic-revival |      |
| Flower      | Bellflower|      |      |      |      |

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:

- **Zucchini** is in the third position (to the right of Carrot), so Carrot must be in the second position.
- **Radish** is in the second position for the victorian house.
- **Futuristic** is the fifth position for Trance.

Thus, the final assignments are:

| Music-Genre | Electronic | Pop   | Techno | Trance | Indie  |
| Food        | Onion      | Azalea| Domino | Lettuce| Carrot |
| Game        |       | Go    | Monopoly | Chess |      |
| House       | Colonial  | Gothic-revival | Townhouse | Victorian |      |
| Flower      | Bellflower| Marigold | Dahlia | Orchid |      |
