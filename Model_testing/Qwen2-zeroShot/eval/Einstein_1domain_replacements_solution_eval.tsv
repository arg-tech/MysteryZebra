5. **Putting it all together:**

Let's start filling the table based on these clues:

| Color     | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Nationality | British | Norwegian | German  | Danish  | Swedish |

| Hobby     | Fishing | Gardening | Drawing | Video-Games | Card-Games |

|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|

| Pet       | Horse   | Bird    | Fish    | Cat     | Dog     |
| Hobby     | Fishing | Gardening | Drawing | Video-Games | Card-Games |
| Cigar     | Blend   | Dunhill | Pall-Mall | Prince | Bluemaster |

Now, we assign the colors:

- The British likes red.
- The Norwegian likes blue.
- The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.
- The person who likes green is the gardener.
- The person who likes yellow is the Dunhill smoker.

So, the table is:

| Color     | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Nationality | British | Norwegian | German  | Danish  | Swedish |
| Pet       | Horse   | Bird    | Fish    | Cat     | Dog     |
| Hobby     | Fishing | Gardening | Drawing | Video-Games | Card-Games |

Finally, the correct assignment for the colors is:

Thus, the final solution table is:
