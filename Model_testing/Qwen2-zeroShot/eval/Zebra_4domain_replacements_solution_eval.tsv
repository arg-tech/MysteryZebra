Let's start filling in the table with the information we can deduce directly from the clues.

### Step-by-Step Deduction

1. **Sport**:
   - Clue 9: Cricket is on the far left (position 1).
   - Clue 1: Lacrosse (mystery) must be in position 5.
   - Remaining sports: water-polo, snowboarding, cricket, biathlon.
   - Clue 2: Water-polo is the social-worker, so it must be in position 2.
   - Remaining sports: snowboarding, cricket, biathlon.
   - Clue 14: Cricket is to the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since cricket is in position 1, the drama movie-watcher must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Clue 13: Biathlon is the person eating lime, and since biathlon cannot be in position 1 or 5 (as cricket is there), it must be in position 3.
   - Remaining sport: snowboarding.
   - Clue 4: Snowboarding is the person drinking tea, so it must be in position 4.
   - Remaining sport: cricket.
   - Therefore, the sports are:
     | Sport | cricket | water-polo | snowboarding | tea | biathlon |

2. **Movie-Genre**:
   - Clue 1: Lacrosse (mystery) is in position 5.
   - Clue 3: Coffee is horror, and it is in position 3.
   - Clue 5: Horror is to the right of adventure. Since horror is in position 3, adventure must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Clue 7: Spinach is western, and it must be in position 2 or 4. Since adventure is either in position 1 or 2, spinach must be in position 4.
   - Remaining genres: mystery, adventure, drama.
   - Clue 14: Cricket is to the left or right of drama. Since cricket is in position 1, drama must be in position 4.
   - Remaining genre: adventure.
   - Therefore, the movie-genres are:
     | Movie-Genre | mystery | adventure | western | horror | drama |

3. **Beverage**:
   - Clue 8: Milk is in the middle (position 3).
   - Clue 4: Tea is in position 4.
   - Clue 3: Coffee is in position 3.
   - Remaining beverages: milk, tea, coffee.
   - Clue 10: The person eating cauliflower is to the left or right of the chef. Since the chef cannot be in position 1 (cricket), 2 (social-worker), 4 (horror), or 5 (biathlon), the chef must be in position 3 (milk). This means the person eating cauliflower must be in position 1 (cricket) or 5 (biathlon).
   - Clue 11: Spinach is to the left or right of the bartender. Since the bartender cannot be in position 1 (cricket), 2 (social-worker), or 5 (biathlon), the bartender must be in position 4 (horror). This means the person eating spinach must be in position 2 (water-polo) or 3 (milk).
   - Therefore, the beverages are:
     | Beverage | tea | milk | coffee | orange-juice | water |

4. **Food**:
   - Clue 6: Cranberry is the engineer, so the engineer must be in position 2 (water-polo).
   - Clue 7: Spinach is western, and the person eating spinach must be in position 2 (water-polo) or 4 (horror). Since the person eating spinach is not in position 2, it must be in position 4 (horror).
   - Clue 12: Grapes is orange-juice, so the person eating grapes must be in position 4 (horror).
   - Clue 13: Lime is biathlon, and the person eating lime must be in position 3 (biathlon).
   - Remaining foods: cranberry, cauliflower, grapes.
   - Clue 10: Cauliflower is to the left or right of the chef. Since the chef is in position 3 (milk), cauliflower must be in position 1 (cricket) or 5 (biathlon). Since biathlon is in position 3, cauliflower must be in position 5 (biathlon).
   - Therefore, the foods are:
     | Food | chesterfield | olg-gold | olg-gold | grapes | lime |

5. **Job**:
   - Clue 2: Social-worker is in position 2 (water-polo).
   - Clue 6: Engineer is in position 2 (water-polo), but this conflicts with the social-worker, so re-evaluate.
   - Clue 10: Chef is in position 3 (milk).
   - Clue 11: Bartender is in position 4 (horror).
   - Remaining jobs: social-worker, engineer, pilot.
   - Clue 10: Chef is in position 3 (milk), so the person eating grapes (orange-juice) is the bartender.
   - Clue 11: The person eating spinach is to the left or right of the bartender. Since the bartender is in position 4 (horror), the person eating spinach must be in position 2 (water-polo) or 3 (milk).
   - Clue 6: Cranberry is the engineer, so the engineer must be in position 2 (water-polo).
   - Clue 2: Social-worker is in position 2 (water-polo), so the social-worker must be in position 2 (water-polo).
   - Remaining job: pilot.
   - Therefore, the jobs are:
     | Job | social-worker | engineer | pilot | bartender | chef |
