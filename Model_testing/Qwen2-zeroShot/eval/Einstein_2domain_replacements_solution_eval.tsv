### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 9**: The Norwegian is on the far left.
   - Position 1: Norwegian

2. **Clue 14**: The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes blue cannot be in position 1 (since the Norwegian is already there).

3. **Clue 1**: The British is the person who likes red.
   - Position 2: British, Red

4. **Clue 3**: The Danish is the tower house.
   - Position 5: Danish, Tower

5. **Clue 8**: The palace house is in the middle.
   - Position 3: Palace

6. **Clue 2**: The Swedish is the person eating strawberry.
   - Position 5: Swedish, Strawberry

7. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.
   - Let's denote the positions for green and white as G and W respectively, where G is to the left of W.

8. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green is the townhouse house.
   - Position 2: Green, Townhouse

9. **Clue 6**: The pall-mall-smoker is the person eating onion.
   - Position 4: Pall-mall, Onion

10. **Clue 7**: The person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker.
    - Position 1: Yellow, Dunhill

11. **Clue 12**: The bluemaster-smoker is the cottage house.
    - Position 1: Bluemaster, Cottage (but we already have Yellow, Dunhill at position 1, so this must be re-evaluated)

12. **Clue 13**: The German is the prince-smoker.
    - Position 4: German, Prince

13. **Clue 10**: The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person eating lemon.
    - Let's denote the positions for blend and lemon as B and L respectively, where B is to the left or right of L.

14. **Clue 11**: The person eating eggplants is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker.
    - Let's denote the positions for eggplant and dunhill as E and D respectively, where E is to the left or right of D.

15. **Re-evaluation of Clue 12**: Since the first position is already occupied by Yellow, Dunhill, we need to find another place for Bluemaster.
    - Position 4: Bluemaster, Cottage (as it can't be position 1)

Now let's fill in the remaining positions:

- Position 1: Norwegian, Yellow, Dunhill
- Position 2: British, Red, Townhouse
- Position 3: Palace
- Position 4: German, Prince, Bluemaster, Cottage
- Position 5: Danish, Tower, Swedish, Strawberry

We still need to determine the exact placements for Green, White, Onion, Lemon, and Eggplant.

From Clue 4:
- Green is to the left of White.
- Green is the Townhouse.
- So, Position 2: Green, Townhouse

From Clue 6:
- Pall-mall-smoker is the person eating onion.
- Position 4: Pall-mall, Onion

From Clue 7:
- Person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker.
- Position 1: Yellow, Dunhill (Norwegian)

From Clue 10:
- Blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person eating lemon.
- Let's assume Position 3: Blend, Lemon

From Clue 11:
- Person eating eggplants is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker.
- Let's assume Position 5: Eggplant

Final Solution:

```
