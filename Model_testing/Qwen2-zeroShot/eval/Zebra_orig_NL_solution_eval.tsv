|-------------|---------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Color       | Red     |         |          |           |          |
| Beverage    | Coffee  |         | Tea      |           |          |
| Cigar       |         | Chesterfield |        |           | Parliament |

| Color       |         |         | Green    |           |          |

Since the Norwegian is on the far left (1) and the Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes Blue, the person who likes Blue must be in position 2.

1: Norwegian, 2: Blue

We also know that the middle (position 3) is for Milk, and the person drinking coffee likes Green, which is to the right of Ivory. Since the Norwegian is on the far left, the person who likes Ivory must be in position 2.

1: Norwegian, 2: Blue, 3: Milk, 4: Coffee, 5: Water

The Spanish owns the dog, so the Spanish must be in position 2.

1: Norwegian, 2: Spanish, 3: Milk, 4: Coffee, 5: Water

The Old-Gold smoker is the owner of the Snails, so the Old-Gold must be in position 5.

1: Norwegian, 2: Spanish, 3: Milk, 4: Coffee, 5: Old-Gold (Snails)

The Kools smoker is the person who likes yellow, so the Kools must be in position 2.

1: Norwegian, 2: Kools (Yellow), 3: Milk, 4: Coffee, 5: Old-Gold (Snails)

The Japanese is the Parliament smoker, so the Japanese must be in position 5.

1: Norwegian, 2: Kools (Yellow), 3: Milk, 4: Lucky-Strike (Orange-Juice), 5: Japanese (Parliament)

The Chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the Fox. Since the Kools smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the Horse, and the Kools smoker is in position 2, the owner of the Horse must be in position 4.

1: Norwegian, 2: Kools (Yellow), 3: Milk, 4: Horse, 5: Japanese (Parliament)

The owner of the Fox must be in position 3, as the Chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the Fox.

1: Norwegian, 2: Kools (Yellow), 3: Fox, 4: Horse, 5: Japanese (Parliament)

The remaining color for position 1 is Ivory.

1: Norwegian (Ivory), 2: Kools (Yellow), 3: Fox, 4: Horse, 5: Japanese (Parliament)

The remaining color for position 4 is Green, as it is to the right of Ivory.

1: Norwegian (Ivory), 2: Kools (Yellow), 3: Fox, 4: Coffee (Green), 5: Japanese (Parliament)

The remaining color for position 3 is Blue.

1: Norwegian (Ivory), 2: Kools (Yellow), 3: Blue, 4: Coffee (Green), 5: Japanese (Parliament)

The remaining color for position 1 is Red.

1: Norwegian (Red), 2: Kools (Yellow), 3: Blue, 4: Coffee (Green), 5: Japanese (Parliament)

Finally, the remaining nationality for position 3 is Ukrainian.

1: Norwegian (Red), 2: Kools (Yellow), 3: Ukrainian (Blue), 4: Coffee (Green), 5: Japanese (Parliament)
