From Clue 14, since Prague is in position 1, the person who likes blue must be in position 2. From Clue 10, the nurseerman cannot be in position 1 or 5, so they must be in position 3. From Clue 15, the blend-smoker must be in position 2 or 4. Since the green lover is in position 2 and the white lover is in position 3, the blend-smoker must be in position 4.

From Clue 11, the librarian is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker. Since the dunhill-smoker is in position 5, the librarian must be in position 4. The nurseerman is in position 3.

Final Table:

   - This means the person with a July birthday is in position 1.

2. **Clue 13**: The person who's birthday is in December is the police-officer.
   - Since the July birthday is in position 1, the December birthday must be in position 5 (the only remaining slot for a December birthday).

    - This means the person drinking milk is in position 3.

11. **Clue 10**: The paramedic is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
    - This means the paramedic is either in position 2 or 4, and the owner of the cat is in position 1, 3, or 5.

12. **Clue 11**: The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the photographer.
    - This means the owner of the horses is in position 2 or 4, and the photographer is in position 3.

13. **Clue 12**: The teacher is the person drinking beer.
    - This means the person drinking beer is the teacher.

14. **Clue 14**: The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the fan of indie.
    - Since the July birthday is in position 1, the fan of indie must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

15. **Clue 15**: The paramedic is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
    - This means the paramedic is in position 2 or 4, and the person drinking water is in position 1, 3, or 5.

### Placing Information:

- **Position 1**: July birthday, not the fan of indie (since July is on the far left).
- **Position 5**: December birthday, police-officer.
- **Position 3**: Middle, drinking milk.
- **Position 2 and 4**: Paramedic and owner of the cat (from Clue 10), but we need more information to decide between them.

Let's try to fill in the rest:

- **Position 1**: July birthday, not the fan of indie (so it can't be indie, country, salsa, or soul).
- **Position 5**: December birthday, police-officer.
- **Position 3**: Middle, drinking milk, so it's the teacher (from Clue 12).
- **Position 2 and 4**: Paramedic and owner of the cat (from Clue 10).

Since the July birthday is in position 1 and the December birthday is in position 5, the June birthday (drinking tea) must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the June birthday is in position 2, 3, or 4, and the July birthday is in position 1, the fan of indie must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

### Final Table:

```
| Music-Genre | Indie | Country | Salsa | Soul  | Metal |
| Birthday    | July  | April   | June  | Dec   | Sep   |
| Pet         | Cat   | Bird    | Dog   | Fish  | Horse |
| Beverage    | Beer  | Coffee  | Milk  | Tea   | Water |
