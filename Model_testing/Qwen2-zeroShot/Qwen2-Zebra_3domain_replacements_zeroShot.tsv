Let's start by placing the known elements:

|        | 1       | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Nationality | Norwegian |        |        |        |        |
| Transport | Motorbike |        |        |        |        |
| Beverage | Coffee   |        | Milk   |        |        |

From Clue 5, the person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the ship:

- If the person driving the bus is in position 4, the person driving the ship must be in position 3.
- If the person driving the bus is in position 5, the person driving the ship must be in position 4.

Since the Norwegian is in position 1, let's assume the person driving the ship is in position 2 and the person driving the bus is in position 3.

|        | 1       | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|

- The person whose hobby is photography must be in position 2 or 4.

Since the Norwegian is in position 1, the fan of quad-bikes cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the fan of quad-bikes must be in position 2 or 3.

Let's assume the fan of quad-bikes is in position 2:
- The person whose hobby is photography must be in position 4.
- The fan of trance must be in position 3.
