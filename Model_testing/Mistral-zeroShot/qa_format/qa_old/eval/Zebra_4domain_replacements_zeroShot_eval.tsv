Zebra_4domain_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a combination of deductive reasoning and the process of elimination. Here's how it goes:

1. From point 2, we know that the social-worker plays polo. This leaves lacrosse, snowboarding, cricket, biathlon for the remaining sports.
2. From points 9 and 14, we know that cricket is on the far left and to the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since there are only five people, cricket cannot be on the far left (as stated in point 9) and must be next to the person watching drama.
3. From points 6, 7, and 10, we know that the engineer eats cranberry, the person eating spinach watches western movies, and the person eating spinach is either to the left or right of the bartender. Since the chef cannot be on the far left (as stated in point 10), the bartender must be second from the left, and the person watching western movies must be third from the left. This leaves spinach for the fourth position and cranberry for the fifth position (since the engineer eats cranberry).
4. From points 3 and 6, we know that the person drinking coffee is the one watching horror movies and the engineer drinks water. Since coffee has already been assigned to the person watching horror movies, water must be in a different position.
5. From point 11, we know that the person eating spinach is to the left or right of the bartender. Since the person watching western movies (spinach eater) cannot be on the far left (as stated in point 7), they must be next to the bartender, which means the bartender is second from the left, and the person eating spinach is third from the left.
6. From points 5 and 8, we know that the person watching adventure movies is to the right of the person watching horror movies and the person drinking milk is in the middle. Since the person watching horror movies (coffee drinker) cannot be on the far right (as stated in point 12), they must be second from the left. This leaves the first position for adventure, the third position for western, and the fourth position for drama.
7. From points 4, 12, and 13, we know that the person drinking tea is the snowboarder, the person drinking orange-juice eats grapes, and the biathlon participant eats lime. Since the drinker of milk is in the middle (as stated in point 8), the middle position cannot be occupied by tea, coffee, or milk (due to points 3, 4, and 6). This means that the snowboarder drinks tea, leaving coffee for the person watching horror movies and milk for the middle position.
8. From points 1 and 2, we know that the lacrosse player watches mystery movies and the social-worker plays polo. Since lacrosse is not any of the sports we have assigned yet, the lacrosse player must be the first person, which means they watch mystery movies. This leaves polo for the second position (as stated in point 2), making the social-worker a polo player.
9. From points 6 and 10, we know that the engineer eats cranberry and the person eating cauliflower is either to the left or right of the chef. Since the chef cannot be on the far left (as stated in point 10), the chef must be second from the right, which leaves the far left for the engineer. This means the engineer eats cranberry, and since spinach has already been assigned to the third position, cauliflower must be fourth.
10. Finally, from points 8 and 9, we know that the person drinking milk is in the middle (point 8) and the engineer eats cranberry (point 9). Since the drinker of coffee is the person watching horror movies (point 3), the only remaining beverage (water) must go to the person watching adventure movies.
11. Putting all this information together, we get the following arrangement:
   1. Mystery movies - Lacrosse player
   2. Polo - Social-worker
   3. Horror movies - Coffee drinker (who is also engineer's left neighbor)
   4. Western movies - Chef's right neighbor (who eats cauliflower)
   5. Adventure movies - Water (far right)
   6. Cricket - On the far left and to the left or right of drama movies
   7. Drama movies - Right neighbor of cricket
   8. Middle position - Milk drinker (who is also the chef's left neighbor)

So, water goes to the fifth position from the right, making **water:5** the final answer."	water:1	water:5	False	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, let's first assign a number (1-5) to each category and then use the given information to fill in the table. We can start by looking for connections between different categories:

1. For sport, we have five unique sports: Lacrosse, Polo, Snowboarding, Cricket, Biathlon.
2. For movies, we have five genres: Mystery, Horror, Adventure, Western, Drama.
3. For food, there are five types: Cranberry, Spinach, Cauliflower, Grapes, Lime.
4. For beverages, there are five options: Coffee, Tea, Milk, Orange-Juice, Water.
5. For jobs, there are five professions: Social-worker, Chef, Pilot, Bartender, Engineer.

Now let's use the given information to fill in the table (assuming we start from left to right):

1. Since the person who plays Lacrosse watches mystery movies, and there is only one sport that corresponds to mystery movies, assign Lacrosse to the first row and Mystery to the corresponding column.
2. The person playing Polo is a Social-worker, so we assign Polo to the second row and Social-worker to the corresponding column.
3. Since the person drinking Coffee watches horror movies, and there is only one beverage that corresponds to horror movies, assign Coffee to the third row and Horror to the corresponding column.
4. The fourth row will be the person playing Snowboarding, who drinks tea; we know that the person on the right of the person drinking milk drinks tea, so place Milk in the second-to-last position (row 5). Therefore, assign Snowboarding to row 4 and Tea to its corresponding column.
5. We know that the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since we have already assigned horror movies, we can now assign Adventure to the fifth row.
6. The person eating cranberries is an Engineer (from point 13), so assign Cranberry to the first column and Engineer to the sixth row.
7. The person eating spinach watches Western movies, which are to the left of adventure movies (since we have already assigned Adventure). Since spinach cannot be in the first position because it is already occupied by cranberries, place Spinach in the second column.
8. We know that milk is in the fifth position from our previous analysis. As there are only five options for each category, Milk must be in the middle row (row 3). So, assign Western to the third row and its corresponding column to either the second or fourth position based on the information about spinach.
9. The person playing cricket is on the far left; since we have already assigned three sports, let's place Cricket as the first sport, so it corresponds to the first row. From point 14, the person watching drama movies should be either on the left or right of the person playing cricket.
10. The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the chef, and we cannot place cauliflower in the first position (since we have already placed spinach there). So let's place Cauliflower in the third column, which corresponds to either row 2 or 4 (chef is not assigned yet).
11. The person eating spinach is to the left or right of the bartender; since spinach is already placed in the second position, place Bartender either in the first or third position based on the information about cauliflower.
12. The person eating grapes is the person drinking orange-juice (from point 12). Since we know that milk cannot be at the end, Grapes and Orange-Juice must be placed somewhere between spinach and lime. To avoid placing them together, let's place Grapes in the fourth column (to the right of cauliflower) and Orange-Juice in the fifth column (next to lime).
13. Finally, the person playing biathlon eats lime (from point 13); since there are no more empty positions, place Lime in the last column.

Now we can assign jobs based on the remaining empty rows:

- Since cauliflower is between two unknowns, one of them must be a chef. Assign Chef to the third row and its corresponding job (we don't have any other information about this position).
- Similarly, since grapes are on the right side of an unknown, one of them must be a bartender. Assign Bartender to the fourth row.
- Since there is only one option left for a sport that corresponds to drama movies (from point 9), assign Drama to the second column and its corresponding movie genre to the last row.
- The remaining person playing cricket (from point 9) must be in the first row, as it is on the far left, and their job should be assigned based on our previous analysis.

After rearranging the table according to the given information, we can find the position of the pilot:

- Since milk is in the middle, the person drinking tea must be either at the beginning or the end. However, since we have already assigned positions for tea and the corresponding sport (Snowboarding), the only remaining possibility for the last row (which corresponds to the rightmost position) would be Pilot or Engineer. But we know that Cranberry is already placed in the first column, so the person eating lime must be an Engineer instead. Therefore, Pilot cannot be at the end.
- Since spinach is to the left of Bartender, and both grapes and cauliflower are on the right side of unknowns, there remains only one position for Pilot: the second row (which corresponds to the leftmost position).

So **pilot:2**."	pilot:5	pilot:2	False	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's organize the information into a table to make it easier to follow. We will assign each person a number from 1-5.

| Color | Hobby      | Job       | House     | Movie-genre |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R    | Singing   | x         | Colonial  | Satire     |
| G    | x        | Journalist| x       | Documentary|
| I    | x        | Electrician| x        | Board-games  |
| Y    | x        | Freelancer| x          | Fantasy   |
| B    | Cooking  | Lawyer    | Farmhouse | Mystery   |

Based on the given information, let's fill in the table:

1. The person who's hobby is singing is the person who likes red (R). Let's assign Singing to person 1. So color 1 = Red
2. The person who's hobby is video-games is the colonial house. We already know that Singing is related to the Colonial house, so let's assume Video-games belongs to person 2 (since only Colonial and Farmhouse are left). So house 1 = Colonial
3. The journalist is the person who likes green (G). Since Freelancer is in the middle and we don't know the job for any other person yet, let's assign Journalist to person 5 for now. So color 5 = Green
4. The person who's hobby is board-games is the electrician (I). From point 2, we know that Video-games belongs to person 2, so Board-games must belong to person 4. So job 4 = Electrician
5. The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory (I). Since we don't have any other colors yet, let's assume that Ivory belongs to person 3 for now. Since Green can only be on the right side of Ivory (as Green can't be the first or last person), and we already assigned Green to person 5, it means Ivory must belong to person 2 (since there are only 2 spaces to the left of Green). So color 2 = Ivory
6. The person watching satire movies is the gothic-revival house (GR). From point 1, we know that Singing is related to the Colonial house, so it's not GR. Since Farmhouse and Craftsman are left, let's assume Satire belongs to person 3 (since GR can only be Farmhouse or Craftsman). So movie-genre 3 = Satire
7. The person watching documentary movies is the person who likes yellow (Y). Since we don't have any other colors yet, let's assign Documentary to person 5 (since we already assigned Green and Yellow can only be on the left side of Green). So movie-genre 5 = Documentary
8. The freelancer is in the middle (since we already assigned Freelancer to person 3, it must be the middle person). It also means that the remaining jobs will not be Freelancer.
9. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the far left (since it can only be the first or second person). So house 1 = Farmhouse (as Craftsman and Colonial are taken) and since we already assigned Cooking to person 5, it means person 1 is Cooking. So color 1 = Yellow
10. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the farmhouse house. Since we already placed Fantasy with Documentary (person 5), we know that Farmhouse can't be the second-to-left house, so it must be the far-left house. So house 2 = Craftsman
11. The person watching documentary movies is to the left or right of the craftsman house. Since Documentary belongs to person 5 and we already placed Craftsman as the far-left house, it means that person 5 can only be on the right side of Craftsman. So let's move Documentary from person 5 to person 4 (since there is only one space left). So movie-genre 4 = Documentary
12. The person watching mystery movies is the lawyer (L). Since we already placed Freelancer, Journalist, Electrician, and Cooking, the remaining job must be Lawyer. So job 3 = Lawyer
13. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the person watching horror movies. Since we know that Documentary belongs to person 4, it means Horror can only belong to either person 1 or person 5. However, since we already placed Satire and Cooking with the remaining houses (Colonial, Farmhouse, Craftsman, GR), there is no space left for Horror on the right side of Craftsman. Therefore, Horror must belong to person 1. So movie-genre 1 = Horror
14. The person who's hobby is cooking is to the left or right of the person who likes blue (B). Since we already placed Cooking with Yellow and Blue can only be on the left side of Green, it means that Blue must belong to person 2. So color 2 = Blue

Now let's fill in the table with our deductions:

| Color | Hobby      | Job       | House     | Movie-genre |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Y    | Cooking   | Freelancer| Farmhouse | Documentary |
| R    | Singing   | Electrician| Colonial  | Horror     |
| G    | Journalist| Lawyer    | Craftsman | Satire     |
| B    | x         | x          | x          | Mystery   |
| I    | Board-games| Journalist| GR        | Fantasy   |

Since we already placed all colors, hobbies, jobs, and houses except for Blue, let's deduce the remaining information:
- Since we know that Farmhouse can't be the second-to-left house (as it would conflict with Cooking), Craftsman must be the second-to-left house. So house 2 = Craftsman.
- Since there is only one space left for Blue, and we already placed all colors except Blue, it means that person 5 must like Blue (since there is no other place left for Blue). So color 5 = Blue

Final answer: librarian: 4 (as the Electrician job is still unassigned, and we know that the remaining jobs are Journalist and Librarian. Since Electrical work is more likely to be done by a man than a woman in this context, it's reasonable to assume that the electrician might not be a librarian. The librarian is traditionally associated with reading and knowledge, so let's assign the Librarian job to person 4 who likes board-games as they seem to have an interest in games which could relate to their work.)"	librarian:1	librarian:4	False	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_1	" Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We know that the person who sings likes red, so we can assign red to singing (let's put it as position 1).
2. The person who has a colonial house likes video-games, so we can assign colonial to video-games (position 3).
3. The journalist likes green, so we can assign green to the journalist (position 5).
4. The electrician enjoys board-games, and since freelancer is in the middle, we know that there must be an even number of spaces between board-games and freelancer, thus we cannot place board-games yet.
5. We can now place red (singing) to the left of green (journalist) as per rule 5.
6. Satire is watched by the gothic-revival house, so we can place gothic-revival at position 6.
7. Documentary is watched by the person who likes yellow, so we can place documentary at position 7 and yellow next to it (position 8). Since there are only 5 people, this means that video-games must be in position 3.
8. Now, we can place board-games between electrician (4) and freelancer (6), so let's put it at position 5. This means that electrician is the person who likes ivory (position 2).
9. Cooking is on the far left, which cannot be position 1 since red (singing) is there already. So, cooking must be at position 9. The only color left for cooking is blue, so we can assign cooking to blue (position 9).
10. Fantasy movies are either left or right of the farmhouse. Since documentary and yellow are on the far right, fantasy cannot be on the far right, so let's place it at position 2 (red, which corresponds to singing, is already taken). This means that magic-tricks (horror) must be at position 4, as they have to be together.
11. Now we can place mystery movies (lawyer) at position 10. Since documentary and yellow are on the far right, craftsman cannot be the farmhouse or gothic-revival houses. Thus, let's put craftsman at position 11, which leaves townhouse for position 12.

   So, **townhouse:12** is the final answer."	townhouse:5	townhouse:12	False	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, we'll use a method called ""backward chaining."" We'll start by finding out where ""water"" is placed and then work our way back to satisfy all given conditions.

1) First, let's identify each person with their corresponding attributes (flower, music-genre, movie-genre, beverage, birthday month).

   Let A = aconite, I = iris, R = rose, D = daffodil, B = begonia
   Let M1 = r&b, M2 = dubstep, M3 = punk, M4 = pop, M5 = house
   Let F1 = musical, F2 = western, F3 = sports, F4 = fantasy, F5 = horror
   Let B1 = coffee, B2 = tea, B3 = milk, B4 = orange-juice, B5 = water
   Let BM = september, A = april, F = february, U = august, J = july

2) From the last condition (14), we know that pop is on the left or right of the person who grows begonia. Since pop is already assigned to the far left (from condition 9), B must be placed to the right of A.

3) Now, let's use condition 5 to place I and R in their positions: since I is to the right of R, their order should be R, A, I, _ , _

4) From condition 7, we know that the person growing daffodil watches western movies. Since D is now positioned between A (left) and I (right), it must be in the second position. So our current arrangement is: _ , D, R, A, I

5) Condition 12 tells us that the person drinking orange-juice watches fantasy movies. We already have a free space after A for this person, so our arrangement is: B, _ , D, R, A, I

6) From condition 6, we know that the person watching musicals has a birthday in July. Since J is now filled in the second position (after satisfying conditions 1-5), our current arrangement is: B, _, _, R, A, I

7) Condition 8 tells us that milk is in the middle (3rd position). But we already have a free space after D for this person. So our current arrangement is: B, _, M3, _, _ , I

8) From condition 4, we know that punk is the person drinking tea. Since we already filled in the third position with milk, there's only one empty space left to place tea (M4). Our arrangement is now: B, _, M4, D, R, A, I

9) Condition 10 tells us that the sports movies fan is on the left or right of the person who has a birthday in April. Since we already filled in positions 1-5 and have only one more empty space to place F3, it must be in either the first or last position. The first position would violate condition 9 (pop on the far left). So our final arrangement is: B, M4, _, D, R, A, I

10) Condition 11 tells us that the person watching western movies is to the left or right of the person who has a birthday in August. Since we already placed D (western movies fan) after A (August), the only possible position for him is the last one. So our final arrangement is: B, M4, _, D, R, A, I

11) Condition 2 tells us that the dubstep fan has a birthday in September. Since we already placed BM in the second position and A in the fifth, there's only one empty space left to place it (M2). Our final arrangement is: B, M4, _, D, R, A, I, M2

12) Condition 3 tells us that the coffee drinker grows iris. Since we already placed I in the last position and have all other flowers assigned, coffee must be B1 (Beverage 1). Our final arrangement is: B1, M4, _, D, R, A, I, M2

Finally, condition 13 tells us that the house fan watches horror movies. Since we already placed F5 in the last position, it must be M5. Our final arrangement is now complete:

B1, M4, _, D, R, A, I, M2, M5, F5"	water:1	NA	False	False
Zebra_4domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down and find out as much information as we can for each variable. I'll write the given information in a table to keep track of what we know:

| Variable | Information | Unknowns |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Flowers  | aconite, iris, rose, daffodil, begonia | |
| Music   | r&b, dubstep, punk, pop, house | |
| Movies  | musical, western, sports, fantasy, horror | |
| Beverages | coffee, tea, milk, orange-juice, water | |
| Birthdays | september, april, february, august, july | **february:?** |

1. From point 1 we know that the fan of r&b grows aconite. Let's fill this in the table:

| Flowers   | aconite, iris, rose, daffodil, begonia | iris (unknown) |
| Music    | r&b, dubstep, punk, pop, house         |               |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| Beverages| coffee, tea, milk, orange-juice, water  |             |
| Birthdays| september, april, february, august, july   | **february:?**  |

2. From point 2 we know that the fan of dubstep has a birthday in September. We can fill this in too:

| Flowers   | aconite, iris, rose, daffodil, begonia | iris (unknown) |
| Music    | r&b, dubstep, punk, pop, house         |               |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| Beverages| coffee, tea, milk, orange-juice, water  |             |
| Birthdays| september, april, **february**, august, july   |            |

3. From point 3 we know that the person drinking coffee grows iris:

| Flowers   | aconite, iris, rose, daffodil, begonia | iris (coffee) |
| Music    | r&b, dubstep, punk, pop, house         |               |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| Beverages| coffee, tea, milk, orange-juice, water  |             |
| Birthdays| september, april, **february**, august, july   |            |

Now we know that the person drinking coffee grows iris. Let's update the table and add the information from points 4 to 14:

| Flowers   | aconite, iris (coffee), rose, daffodil, begonia | iris (coffee) |
| Music    | r&b, dubstep, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| Movies   | musical, western (daffodil), sports, fantasy, horror  |            |
| Beverages| coffee, tea, milk (middle), orange-juice, water  |             |
| Birthdays| september, april, **february**, august, july   |            |
| ...      |                                       |              |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose  |              |
|          | the fan of pop is on the far left                |              |
|          | the person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in april      |             |
|          | the person watching western movies is to the left or right of the person who's birthday is in august    |            |
|          | the person drinking milk is in the middle         |            |
|          | the fan of punk is on the person drinking tea     |            |
|          | the person watching musical movies is the person who's birthday is in july                |            |
|          | the person watching fantasy movies is the person drinking orange-juice       |            |
|          | the fan of house is the person watching horror movies        |            |
|          | the fan of pop is to the left or right of the person who grows begonia   |            |

Let's focus on solving these constraints one by one:

- From point 5 we know that iris is to the right of rose. We have already found that the person drinking coffee (iris) is in the middle, so rose must be on the left.
- From point 9, we know that pop is on the far left. Since pop isn't on the left of iris (rose), it must be on the right of begonia.
- Now we can fill in the information for the flowers variable:

| Flowers   | aconite, rose, begonia (pop left), iris (coffee middle), daffodil (western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b, dubstep, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| ...      |                                       |               |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose                  |            |
|          | the fan of pop is on the right of begonia    |            |

- From point 7 we know that daffodil grows western. Since rose and begonia are already placed, daffodil must be in position 3 (index counting starts from 0)

| Flowers   | aconite, rose, begonia(pop left), iris(coffee middle), **daffodil**(western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b, dubstep, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| ...      |                                       |               |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose                  |            |
|          | the fan of pop is on the right of begonia    |            |

- From point 10, since daffodil (western) is in position 3, it must be the one watching sports movies. However, we still don't know if it's on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in April. So for now let's update our table like this:

| Flowers   | aconite, rose, begonia(pop left), iris(coffee middle), **daffodil**(western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b, dubstep, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| ...      |                                       |               |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose                  |            |
|          | the fan of pop is on the right of begonia    |            |
|          | the person watching **sports** movies is in position 3 (daffodil)   |            |

- From point 11, since daffodil is in position 3, it must be to the left or right of the person who's birthday is in August. We still don't know the exact position, but we can assume that the person with Aug-birthday is in positions 0 (aconite) or 1 (rose).
- From point 12, since daffodil is in position 3, it must be the one drinking milk. We still don't know if it's the middle position, but we can assume that the person who drinks milk is either in position 3 or 4 (since milk isn't on the far left).
- From point 14, since begonia is to the right of pop, it must be in position 2.
- Since we have placed rose, begonia and daffodil, we can place aconite in position 0.
- Now our table looks like this:

| Flowers   | **aconite**, rose, begonia(pop left), iris(coffee middle), daffodil(western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b, dubstep, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| ...      |                                       |               |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose                  |            |
|          | the fan of pop is on the right of begonia    |            |
|          | the person watching **sports** movies is in position 3 (daffodil)   |            |

- From point 15, since iris is in the middle, punk must be on the far left or in position 2. However, we still don't know if punk is on the left of aconite or rose. We can only assume that it could be in positions 0, 1 or 2.
- From point 16, since iris is to the right of rose, punk cannot be in position 0 (aconite) since we have already placed an item on the left. Punk must be in either position 1 (rose left) or position 2.
- Now let's place the remaining flowers:

| Flowers   | aconite, **punk**, rose, begonia(pop left), iris(coffee middle), daffodil(western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b, dubstep, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| ...      |                                       |               |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose                  |            |
|          | the fan of pop is on the right of begonia    |            |
|          | the person watching **sports** movies is in position 3 (daffodil)   |            |

- Now we can place the remaining music:

| Flowers   | aconite, punk, rose, begonia(pop left), iris(coffee middle), daffodil(western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b **, dubstep**, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| ...      |                                       |               |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose                  |            |
|          | the fan of pop is on the right of begonia    |            |
|          | the person watching **sports** movies is in position 3 (daffodil)   |            |

- Since r&b is at position 0, dubstep must be either in position 1 or 2. However, since we have already placed punk, house cannot be in position 2 (since the fan of pop must be on the right of begonia). So, dubstep must be in position 1.
- Finally, let's place the remaining music:

| Flowers   | aconite, punk, rose, begonia(pop left), iris(coffee middle), daffodil(western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b ***, dubstep**, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| ...      |                                       |              |
| ...      |                                       |               |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose                  |            |
|          | the fan of pop is on the right of begonia    |            |
|          | the person watching **sports** movies is in position 3 (daffodil)   |            |

- Now we can place house at position 4:

| Flowers   | aconite, punk, rose, begonia(pop left), iris(coffee middle), daffodil(western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b ***, dubstep**, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| ...      |                                       |              |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose                  |            |
|          | the fan of pop is on the right of begonia    |            |
|          | the person watching **sports** movies is in position 3 (daffodil)   |            |

- Finally, we can place tea in position 2:

| Flowers   | aconite, punk, rose, begonia(pop left), iris(coffee middle), daffodil(western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b ***, dubstep**, punk (tea), pop, house        |             |
| ...      |                                       |              |
|          | the person who grows iris is to the right of rose                  |            |
|          | the fan of pop is on the right of begonia    |            |
|          | the person watching **sports** movies is in position 3 (daffodil)   |            |

At this point, we have placed all the items in their respective positions.

| Flowers   | aconite, punk, rose, begonia(pop left), iris(coffee middle), daffodil(western)  | iris (coffee middle) |
| Music    | r&b ***, dubstep**, punk (tea), pop, house        |                       |
| Sports   |                                          |                       |
| ...      |                                       |                       |

However, we still have not placed the ""Sports"" item. Since the person watching sports is in position 3 and daffodil is in position 4, there are no available positions for sports. This means that our current arrangement is not possible. There must be an error or inconsistency in the initial information provided.

Here is the final arrangement assuming the information given is correct:

| Position | Item           |
|---------|---------------|
| 0       | aconite       |
| 1       | punk          |
| 2       | tea           |
| 3       | begonia (pop) |
| 4       | iris (coffee) |
| 5       | daffodil      |
| 6       | r&b           |
| 7       | dubstep       |
| 8       | pop           |
| 9       | house         |
| 10      | sports        |"	february:5	NA	False	False
