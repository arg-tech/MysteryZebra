Zebra_lexical_replacements_0	" To solve this logic puzzle, we will assign numbers from 1 to 5 to the five places in order. We'll use variables for unknowns and then deduce information from the given clues.

Let's start by filling in what we know:

1. The malaysian (M) likes orange (O)
2. The italian (I) owns the goldfish (G)
3. The person drinking cola (C) likes black (B)
4. The dutch (D) drinks almond-lemonade (A)
5. B is to the right of aquamarine (Aq)
6. The fonseca (F) owner keeps the bird (Br)
7. The havana (H) smoker likes chestnut (Ch)
8. Lemonade (L) is in the middle (M)
9. The german (G) is on the far left (FL)
10. F or Br is to the left or right of the owner of the lizard (Lz)
11. H is to the left or right of the mouse (Ms) owner
12. The baccarat (Bc) smoker drinks iced-tea (It)
13. The mexican (Mx) smokes tiparillo (Tp)
14. G is to the left or right of coral (Co)

Now let's start deducing:

Since L is in the middle, L cannot be G or I as they have been assigned earlier. So, let's assume L represents the person who likes coral or hot-chocolate (Hc). However, since G is not to the left of Co and we already know where G is, it must mean Hc is on the far right (FR).

Since 10 states that F or Br is to the left or right of Lz, Lz cannot be in the first two positions because if so, both F or Br would have to go before Lz and there are no more open spots before FL. Therefore, Lz must be either the third position (L3) or fifth position (L5).

Now let's look at clue 11. Since we know H is in FR and there's only one person left before Ms, H cannot be on the left of Ms. Therefore, H has to be in the second position (H2). But that means Lz must be in the fifth position (L5), because F or Br needs to be placed somewhere other than the third position for clue 10 to hold true.

Now we can place F or Br according to clause 10: if Lz is in the fifth position, then F has to be in the first position (F1) and Br must be in the fourth position (Br4).

Since we know I owns G, it cannot be on the far right as there's already a goldfish owner there. So, let's assume I is in the second position (I2), which leaves us with only Aq and C in the first two spots (Aq1 and C3).

Since we know B likes black, it cannot be on the far left because there's no one to its right that could like aquamarine or coral. Therefore, C3 must represent the person who likes black (C3=B3).

Now since C3 is to the right of Aq1 and we know B5 cannot be to the right of Aq, it means Aq1=A4.

Since A4 has already been taken by goldfish owner, I2 must represent a different nationality. The only remaining choice is M (malaysian), so I2=M2.

Now we have:

1. Malay (M) likes orange (O)
2. Italian (I) owns the goldfish (G) and is Malaysian (M)
3. Person drinking black (B, C3) is the person who likes black
4. Dutch (D) drinks almond-lemonade (A4)
5. The person with black to his right likes aquamarine
6. Fonseca (F1) owner keeps the bird (Br4)
7. Havana (H2) smoker likes chestnut
8. Lemonade (L, Aq4) is in the middle
9. German (G) is on the far left (FL)
10. Fonseca or Bird owner is to the left or right of the owner of the lizard
11. Havana is to the left or right of the mouse owner
12. Baccarat (Bc5) smoker drinks iced-tea
13. Mexican (Mx, I3) smokes tiparillo
14. German is to the left or right of coral

Since we know M and I are both Malaysian, we can eliminate them from the nationalities list. So the only remaining choice for G's nationality is Dutch (D), making D the owner of the goldfish (G=D).

We also know that F1 is to the left or right of L5, so either F1=L4 or Br4=L4. But since we know the goldfish owner is Dutch and there's no one else on the left of L5, it must mean F1=L4 (F1=Aq5).

Now we have only one choice for I2: M2. So we can rewrite the nationalities as follows:

1. Malay (M) likes orange
2. Italian (I=M) owns the goldfish and is Malaysian
3. Person drinking black (B, C3) is the person who likes black
4. Dutch (D) drinks almond-lemonade (G)
5. The person with black to his right likes aquamarine
6. Fonseca owner keeps the bird (Br4) and is in position 4
7. Havana smoker likes chestnut
8. Lemonade is in the middle (Aq4)
9. German is on the far left (FL, I2)
10. Fonseca or Bird owner is to the left or right of the owner of the lizard
11. Havana is to the left or right of the mouse owner
12. Baccarat smoker drinks iced-tea
13. Mexican smokes tiparillo (I3)
14. German is to the left or right of coral

Since we know I=M, it means M2 cannot be the person who likes black or aquamarine as there are no more available spots after him. So let's assume C3 represents the person who drinks cola and likes orange (O). Since C3 is to the right of Aq4, B must like coral (B=Co).

Since we know G=D and D drinks almond-lemonade, it means Aq5 cannot be D. So let's assume Aq5 represents the person who likes chestnut (Ch) and smokes havana (H2). Since H2 is to the left or right of Ms owner, Ms must be in position 3 (Ms=Bc3).

Since we know I=M, it means M cannot be the mexican (Mx, I3). So let's assume I3 represents the person who likes coral and smokes coralmaster (Co). Since G is to the left or right of Co, L4 (F1) must be German (I2), which contradicts our earlier assumption that F1=Aq5.

So our initial assumptions were incorrect, and there's a mistake in the information provided. It seems impossible to solve the problem with the given constraints."	hot-chocolate:1	NA	False	False
Zebra_lexical_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign arbitrary positions from left to right (1-5) to each individual, starting with the german on the far left (position 1).
2. From statements 1 to 4, we can assign the following favorites and pets:
   - Position 1: German (G), doesn't like orange, owns no pet
   - Position 2: Malaysian (M) likes orange, owns no pet
   - Position 3: Italian (I) drinks cola, owns goldfish
   - Position 4: Dutch (D) drinks almond-lemonade, own no pet (since position 1 and 2 are taken)

3. From statements 5 to 8, we can arrange the following individuals based on their favorites:
   - Aquamarine is in positions 5 or 6 (since position 1-4 are taken, and it's not black or orange)
   - Black is in position 3 (since cola drinker is in position 3, and it's not aquamarine or orange)
   - Lemonade is in position 5 (since it's neither black nor aquamarine and must be between black and chestnut)
   - Chestnut is in position 2 or 6 (since the havana-smoker drinks chestnut, so it can only be in positions 2 or 6)
   - Since chestnut cannot be in position 3 due to black being there already, chestnut must be in position 6 (it doesn't matter which side of the lizard the havana-smoker is, as long as they are both on opposite sides of position 1 and 5).
   - Iced-tea drinker is at position 4 (since it's neither black nor chestnut and must be to the left of aquamarine or coral)

4. From statements 9 to 12, we can arrange the following individuals based on their nationalities and cigar brands:
   - Coralmaster smoker must be in positions 1 or 5 (since fonseca-smoker is the bird owner, and coralmaster cannot be the goldfish owner due to statement 2)
   - Since the havana-smoker cannot be in position 3 due to chestnut being there already, and it cannot be in position 4 due to iced-tea drinker being there already, the havana-smoker is in position 5 (since it doesn't matter which side of the lizard the havana-smoker is, as long as they are both on opposite sides of position 1 and 5).
   - The mexican must be in position 2 or 3 due to statement 13. Since position 3 is already occupied, the mexican is in position 2 (tiparillo-smoker)
   - Fonseca smoker cannot be in position 4 due to baccarat drinker being there already. So, fonseca smoker is in position 1 (coralmaster-smoker is on the left or right of the lizard, so we cannot place it yet)
   - Baccarat drinker is at position 4 (since it's neither black nor chestnut and must be to the left of aquamarine or coral)

5. Finally, from statement 10 and 11, we can determine that:
   - The lizard owner cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since they would violate statements about cigar brands and drinks), so the lizard owner must be in position 3.
   - Coralmaster smoker is on the left side of the lizard owner (position 3)

6. Now we have all individuals assigned their favorites, nationalities, and pets:
   - Position 1: Fonseca-smoker (coralmaster), doesn't drink cola or lemonade, owns no pet
   - Position 2: Mexican (Mex), smokes tiparillo, drinks hot-chocolate, keeps bird
   - Position 3: Lizard owner, doesn't like any color, keeps mouse
   - Position 4: Baccarat drinker (iced-tea), doesn't smoke coralmaster or havana, owns no pet
   - Position 5: Havana-smoker (chestnut), drinks lemonade, keeps goldfish

Unfortunately, we cannot determine the exact position of the cat from the provided information. We need more clues to find its specific location.

Zebra_lexical_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a systematic approach by making educated guesses and verifying them using the given clues. Here's the final arrangement:

1. Colombian (Position 1) likes light-chestnut
2. Goldfish owner (Position 4) is Brazilian
3. Cola drinker (Position 5) likes lilac
4. Argentine (Position 2) drinks juice
5. Lilac lover (Position 5) is to the right of Fuchsia lover
6. Mouse owner (Position 5) smokes aristoff
7. Oliveros-smoker (Position 3) likes coral
8. Soy milk drinker (Position 2) is in the middle
9. German (Position 1) is on the far left
10. Dunhill-smoker (Position 5, 6 or 7) is to the left or right of the cat owner
11. Oliveros-smoker (Position 3) is to the left or right of hamster owner
12. Swisher-smoker (Position 4) drinks fanta
13. Nigerian (Position 6) smokes tiparillo
14. German (Position 1) is to the left or right of chestnut lover

From clues 6, 7, and 13, we know that aristoff, oliveros, and tiparillo have been assigned to positions 5, 3, and 6 respectively. We also know that cola (Position 5) is a lilac lover. Clue 8 tells us that soy milk drinker is in the middle of the arrangement, which means position 2. This leaves fanta for either Position 1 or Position 4.

Since the swisher-smoker drinks fanta and we know from clue 10 and 11 that oliveros-smoker (Position 3) must be to the left of hamster owner (Position 7) and aristoff-smoker (Position 5) is to the right of cat owner, it implies that only Position 4 is available for swisher-smoker.

Now we know the brand of cigar for all positions except for dunhill:
1. German (Position 1): ____
2. Soy milk drinker (Position 2): soy-milk
3. Oliveros-smoker (Position 3): oliveros
4. Swisher-smoker (Position 4): fanta
5. Aristoff-smoker (Position 5): aristoff
6. Nigerian (Position 6): tiparillo
7. Hamster owner (Position 7): ____

Since the german is on the far left, Position 1 must be either a nationality or a pet, but not both as we already have goldfish at position 4 and soy milk at position 2. If it were a nationality, that would mean argentine (Position 2) would be the only Argentine left (as per clue 4), which contradicts the fact that there are 5 different nationalities. So Position 1 must be a pet, let's assume cat, and Position 6 must be nigerian.

Now we know that german is in position 1, so the only remaining possibility for chestnut lover (clue 14) is position 2 as neither position 3 or 7 can accommodate it due to clues 10 and 11. Since Position 2 was already occupied by soy milk drinker, it implies that Position 2 must be a pet. Let's assume goldfish (as per clue 2) is in position 4, which means Position 2 should be the cat owner.

Now we know the nationalities and pets for all positions except for argentine and hamster:
1. German (Position 1): ____
2. Cat owner (Position 2): argentine
3. Oliveros-smoker (Position 3): oliveros
4. Goldfish owner (Position 4): brazilian
5. Aristoff-smoker (Position 5): aristoff
6. Nigerian (Position 6): tiparillo
7. Hamster owner (Position 7): ____

Since the argentine drinks juice, Position 2 is occupied by cat owner and Position 4 is occupied by goldfish owner, it means that Position 4 must be a nationality. Since positions 1, 5, and 6 are already occupied by German, Colombian, and Nigerian respectively, position 4 can only be the Argentine (as per clue 4).

Now we know the arrangement for all nationalities:
1. German (Position 1): ____
2. Cat owner (Position 2): argentine
3. Oliveros-smoker (Position 3): oliveros
4. Argentine (Position 4): juice drinker
5. Aristoff-smoker (Position 5): aristoff
6. Nigerian (Position 6): tiparillo
7. Hamster owner (Position 7): ____

Since the cola drinker is a lilac lover, it implies that Position 5 must be a colour as we already know the position of goldfish owner and soy milk drinker. We also know from clue 3 that Position 5 cannot be light-chestnut (since Colombian likes light-chestnut), lilac or fuchsia (as per clues 5 and 15). So, Position 5 can only be either coral or chestnut.

Since the german is to the left of the chestnut lover (clue 14) and we know that Position 7 must be a pet, it implies that Position 1 cannot be chestnut lover as well. So, Position 5 must be coral and Position 2 can only be chestnut lover as it's the only remaining position to accommodate this colour (as per clues 1, 4, and 14).

Now we know the arrangement for all colours:
1. German (Position 1): ____
2. Chestnut lover (Position 2): colombian
3. Oliveros-smoker (Position 3): oliveros
4. Argentine (Position 4): juice drinker
5. Coral lover (Position 5): lilac drinker
6. Nigerian (Position 6): tiparillo
7. Hamster owner (Position 7): ____

Since the position of the cat is known (Position 2) and the position of the goldfish is known (Position 4), it means that Position 7 must be a pet. Since positions 1, 3, 5, and 6 are already occupied, only Position 7 remains for the remaining pet.

Since Position 1 cannot accommodate both German and any other nationality as we have 5 different nationalities (as per clue 9), it must be a colour (as it's the only position left). Since positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 are already occupied by respective nationalities, the remaining colour can only be fuchsia or chestnut.

Since the colombian is the light-chestnut lover (clue 1) and we know that Position 2 is a colombian, it implies that Position 1 cannot be light-chestnut (since Colombians already have a color assigned). So, Position 1 must be fuchsia.

Now we know the arrangement for all pets:
1. Fuchsia lover (Position 1): ____
2. Cat owner (Position 2): argentine
3. Oliveros-smoker (Position 3): oliveros
4. Argentine (Position 4): juice drinker
5. Coral lover (Position 5): lilac drinker
6. Nigerian (Position 6): tiparillo
7. Hamster owner (Position 7): brazilian

Since we have assigned colours to all positions except for Position 2, it implies that Position 2 cannot be a colour as well. Since Position 2 is already occupied by cat owner, it means that Position 1 must be the only remaining position for a colour (as per clue 9). But since Position 1 is already occupied by fuchsia lover, it contradicts the fact that Position 2 cannot be a colour.

This results in a contradiction, implying that there might be an error in the problem statement or my solution. I will leave this question for someone else to explore further.

Final Answer: The arrangement is not possible based on the given clues. There might be an error in the problem statement or my solution."	7up:1	NA	False	False
Zebra_lexical_replacements_1	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's create a table representing each attribute (color, nationality, cigar, beverage, pet) and assign a number to each character based on their position from left to right.

We'll start with the given information and gradually fill in the table:

1. Nationality: [German, Argentine, colombian, brazilian, nigerian]
   Position: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2. Color: [chestnut, ?, ?, ?, ?] (given the colombian likes light-chestnut)

   Since we know that the argentine is not drinking juice and the german is on the far left, the only option for the person who likes chestnut is the argentine: Color: [chestnut, ?, ?, ?, ?], Position: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

3. Beverage: [cola, juice, ?, ?, ?] (given that the cola drinker likes lilac)
   Since we know that the argentine is drinking juice and the person who drinks soy-milk is in the middle, the only option for the person drinking cola is the colombian. Beverage: [cola, juice, ?, ?, ?], Position: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

4. Cigar: [dunhill, oliveros, aristoff, swisher, tiparillo] (given that the oliveros-smoker is the person who likes coral)
   Since we know that the oliveros-smoker cannot be to the left of the owner of the hamster and the owner of the mouse, the only options for the oliveros-smoker are positions 4 or 5. However, since we also know that the swisher-smoker drinks fanta, position 5 is already filled, so the oliveros-smoker must be at position 4: Cigar: [dunhill, oliveros, aristoff, swisher, tiparillo], Position: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

5. Color: [chestnut, ?, fuchsia, lilac, ?] (given that the person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes fuchsia)
   Since we know that position 1 (German) and position 2 (Argentine) have already been assigned colors, the only options for position 3 are light-chestnut or fuchsia. However, since we also know that the colombian is at position 3 drinking cola (which likes lilac), so the person at position 3 must like fuchsia: Color: [chestnut, ?, fuchsia, lilac, ?], Position: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

6. Pet: [goldfish, cat, guinea-pig, hamster, mouse] (given that the brazilian is the owner of the goldfish)
   Since we know that the person owning the goldfish is at position 2 and there are only two pets left to assign (guinea-pig and hamster), the guinea-pig must be at position 5: Pet: [goldfish, cat, guinea-pig, hamster, mouse], Position: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

7. Beverage: [cola, juice, ?, fanta, ?] (given that the swisher-smoker drinks fanta)
   Since we know that position 4 is occupied by the oliveros-smoker who likes coral and position 3 is filled with the person who likes fuchsia, the only remaining option for the fanta drinker is position 5: Beverage: [cola, juice, ?, fanta, ?], Position: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

8. Cigar: [dunhill, oliveros, aristoff, swisher, tiparillo] (given that the remaining cigars are aristoff, tiparillo)
   Since we know that the person smoking aristoff is to the left of the owner of the cat and the owner of the mouse, the only option for the aristoff-smoker is position 1. Tiparillo must be at position 5: Cigar: [dunhill, oliveros, aristoff, swisher, tiparillo], Position: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

9. Color: [chestnut, ?, fuchsia, lilac, coral] (given that the remaining colors are light-chestnut and coral)
   Since we know that position 1 is occupied by the person who smokes aristoff (German), the only option for the person liking light-chestnut is position 5: Color: [light-chestnut, ?, fuchsia, lilac, coral], Position: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

10. Pet: [goldfish, cat, guinea-pig, hamster, mouse] (given that the remaining pets are cat, guinea-pig, and hamster)
   Since we know that the owner of the mouse is at position 6 (oliveros-smoker), and the owner of the cat must be to the left or right of the oliveros-smoker, the only options for the cat owner are positions 2 and 3. However, since we also know that the person who likes fuchsia is at position 3, so there's no way the cat owner can be at position 3. Therefore, the only option for the cat owner is position 2: Pet: [goldfish, cat, guinea-pig, hamster, mouse], Position: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

11. Finally, we know that the remaining pets are guinea-pig and hamster. Since the owner of the hamster must be to the left or right of the oliveros-smoker (position 4) and the person smoking tiparillo (position 5), and we also know that there's no cat at position 3, the only remaining option is position 2 for the guinea-pig: Pet: [goldfish, cat, **guinea-pig**, hamster, mouse], Position: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

So, **guinea-pig:2** is the solution."	guinea-pig:5	guinea-pig:2	False	True
Zebra_lexical_replacements_2	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down into smaller parts and try to figure out each person's characteristics one by one. We will represent each person with a letter from A to E, and we will fill in their details step by step.

Let's start:

1. Nigerian likes ebony (A)
2. Canadian owns rabbit (E)
3. Almond-soy-milk drinker likes lilac (B)
4. Brazilian drinks hot-chocolate (D)
5. Person who likes lilac is to the right of blood-red (C, B, A, D, E)
6. Swisher smoker owns chinchilla (F)
7. Montecristo smoker likes amber (G)
8. Soy-milk drinker is in the middle (D)
9. Dutch is on the far left (A)
10. Dannemann smoker is left or right of pony owner (B, C, D, E, F)
11. Montecristo smoker is to the left or right of hamster owner (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
12. Tiparillo smoker drinks fanta (H)
13. Pakistani is game smoker (I)
14. Dutch is to the left or right of person who likes white (B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I)

Now we know that the nigerian is on A and the canadian on E. Since the dutch is on the far left (A), the pakistani must be in position I, and the dutch is to the left or right of the person who likes white (position B or C).

Next, since the soy-milk drinker is in the middle (D), the hot-chocolate drinker (Brazilian) must be on either side of D. Since the Dutch is to the left of someone who likes white (D or A), the only possible position for Brazilian is E (right of D).

At this point, we know that A - Nigerian, ebony, B - Canadian, rabbit, C - ?, lilac, D - Brazilian, hot-chocolate, E - Pakistani, game. We can also tell that F - Swisher, chinchilla, G - Montecristo, amber, H - Tiparillo, fanta, I - Dutch, (position B or C), white.

Now let's fill in the remaining positions:

Since the montecristo smoker is to the left of the hamster owner (A, B, C, D, E) and the swisher smoker is the chinchilla owner (F), we can rule out F as the hamster owner. The only option left for the hamster owner is D (Brazilian).

Since the person who likes lilac (C) is to the right of the person who likes blood-red, and C cannot be on position E (Pakistani), it means that C can only be B or A. But since B is already taken by the Canadian (lilac owner), it must be A (Nigerian).

With Nigerian now having lilac, there's only one color left for each person: ebony for A, white for B, amber for G, soy-milk for D, fanta for H. Now we know that the positions are as follows:

A - Nigerian, ebony
B - Canadian, rabbit, white
C - Dutch, lilac
D - Brazilian, hot-chocolate, game
E - Pakistani, soy-milk
F - Swisher, chinchilla
G - Montecristo, amber
H - Tiparillo, fanta
I - Dutch, white (since Dutch is to the left or right of person who likes white)

Now we can identify **mirinda**'s position: Since the tiparillo smoker drinks fanta (position H), and since the soy-milk drinker (E) is in the middle, the only positions left for mirinda are A, B, C, D, or E. However, we know that position E is already taken by soy-milk drinker, and since the person drinking soy-milk is in the middle, it means that fanta (mirinda) cannot be any of A, B, C, or D. Therefore, mirinda must be I.

So **mirinda:I**"	mirinda:1	NA	False	False
Zebra_lexical_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a systematic approach by considering each fact and finding the possible positions for each character. Here's how I approached it:

1. Assign numbers (1-5) to each favourite color, nationality, cigar brand, beverage, and pet.
2. Start filling in the possible positions based on the given facts. For example, since we know that the nigerian likes ebony, we can assign ebony to a number that doesn't belong to the nigerian. Similarly, we can assign nationalities, cigar brands, etc., based on their respective information.
3. Use logical deductions to find other possible positions when they are not explicitly given. For example:
   - Since the person drinking almond-soy-milk is the person who likes lilac (fact 3), and we know that the position of lilac is already filled, we can find the number for almond-soy-milk.
   - If we know that a person drinks a certain beverage, we can assign the corresponding beverage number to a position next to the position of the smoker who owns the pet that matches the given fact (e.g., swisher-smoker and chinchilla).
4. Since there are no more explicit facts to use, we will have to make educated guesses and check them against previously established facts to find inconsistencies. For example:
   - We know that the montecristo-smoker likes amber (fact 7), but we also know that the position of amber is already filled (let's say with number 3). Since montecristo has not been assigned yet, we can try assigning it to one of the remaining positions and checking whether this assignment leads to any contradictions.
5. Once all positions are assigned and there are no inconsistencies, the puzzle is solved.

After solving the puzzle, I found that:
1. The nigerian (favourite color: ebony) is on position 1 (based on fact 1).
2. The canadian (pet: rabbit) is on position 5 (based on fact 2).
3. Almond-soy-milk (favourite beverage of the person who likes lilac) is in position 3, and the corresponding colour is lilac, which belongs to the dutch (based on facts 3 and 14).
4. The brazilian (favourite beverage: hot-chocolate) is in position 4 (based on fact 4).
5. Based on fact 5, we know that lilac is to the right of blood-red. Since lilac belongs to the dutch and the dutch is already placed, we can assume that blood-red belongs to the person in position 2. Therefore, the colour for position 2 is blood-red, and its corresponding nationality is nigerian (based on fact 1).
6. Based on facts 6, 9, and 10, we can determine that swisher-smoker, who owns the chinchilla, should be placed either in positions 1 or 5. Since the chinchilla hasn't been assigned yet, we can assume that it is in position 1 (based on fact 6). This means that the swisher-smoker is the dutch (position 3), and the nationality for position 1 is nigerian.
7. Based on facts 7 and 8, we know that amber belongs to the montecristo-smoker and soy-milk is in the middle. We already have the positions of both the nationalities (amber: brazilian, soy-milk: dutch). Since the brazilian is already placed in position 4, we can place the montecristo-smoker in position 2 (based on fact 7). This means that the cigar brand for position 5 is dannemann.
8. Based on facts 11 and 12, we know that the tiparillo-smoker is next to the hamster owner, and the hamster owner drinks fanta. Since we already have the positions of both the nationalities (tiparillo: pakistani, fanta: canadian), we can place the tiparillo-smoker in position 4 and the hamster in position 3.
9. Based on facts 13 and 14, we know that the pakistani is the game-smoker and the dutch is to the left or right of the person who likes white. Since we already have the positions of both the nationalities (game: pakistani, white: canadian), we can place the pakistani in position 4 and the canadian in position 3.
10. Now that all nationalities are placed, we know that the remaining pet belongs to the dutch (position 2). The only pet left is the frog, so we can assign it to position 2 (frog: 2).

So the answer for this puzzle is **frog:2**."	frog:5	frog:2	False	True
