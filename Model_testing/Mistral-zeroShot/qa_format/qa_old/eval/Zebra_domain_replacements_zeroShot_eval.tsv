Zebra_5domain_replacements_0	" This is a complex logic puzzle! Let's break it down and solve it step by step:

1. Identify commonalities between the lists (food, music-genres, houses, games, flowers). We have 5 items in each list, so we will assign them numbers from 1 to 5 for simplicity.

2. From rule 9, we know that the fan of electronic is on the far left, so the first item in the music-genre list must be ""electronic"". Let's assign the number 1 to it. The rest of the music genres must then have the following order: [indie, pop, techno, trance].

3. From rule 14, we know that the fan of electronic is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce. Since electronic is already assigned as the first item in the music-genre list (far left), the only possible position for ""lettuce"" is the last position in the food list (5th).

4. From rule 1, we know that the fan of indie is the person eating onion. So, onion must be the first item in the food list (1st). Since lettuce is already assigned as the last item (5th), the rest of the items in the food list must have the following order: [onion, zucchini, carrot, radish].

5. From rule 3, we know that the person playing go is the person eating zucchini. So, zucchini must be the third item in the food list (3rd).

6. From rule 7, we know that the victorian house is the person eating radish. So, radish must be the fourth item in the food list (4th).

7. Now let's place the remaining items in their corresponding lists based on the positions of the food items:
   - Houses: [colonial, victorian, gothic-revival, townhouse, futuristic]
   - Games: [go, domino, monopoly, mah-jongg, chess]
   - Flowers: [azalea, marigold, dahlia, orchid, bellflower]

8. From rule 10 and 11, we know that the gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold (3rd item in flowers list), and the victorian house is to the left or right of the person who grows orchid (4th item in flowers list). Since the houses are already placed based on the food items, we can't determine their exact positions.

9. From rule 12, we know that the townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg, but its position in the houses list is not determined yet. We also don't have enough information to find the exact positions of the colonial and futuristic houses either.

10. Without more information, it's impossible to determine where ""chess"" (the fifth game) is located since we don't know its corresponding position in the games list. So, I can't give you a specific answer for **chess**."	chess:1	NA	False	False
Zebra_5domain_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by listing all the available possibilities for each category (food, music-genre, house style, game, and flower variety). We will then use the given clues to eliminate possibilities until we can determine the position of dahlia.

1. Food: onion, zucchini, carrot, radish, lettuce
2. Music-genres: indie, pop, techno, electronic, trance
3. House styles: colonial, victorian, gothic-revival, townhouse, futuristic
4. Games: go, domino, monopoly, mah-jongg, chess
5. Flowers: azalea, marigold, dahlia, orchid, bellflower

We can start by noting that the fan of electronic is on the far left and the fan of trance is the futuristic house (clue 9 and 13). Since there are only two genres on the far left (electronic and indie), it follows that the fan of indie must be somewhere else. Let's assign positions to the music-genre fans:

a) Indie -> onion
b) Pop -> azalea (since pop fan is the person who grows azaleas, as per clue 2)
c) Techno -> domino (since techno fan is playing domino, as per clue 4)
d) Electronic (on the far left)
e) Trance (futuristic house)

Now we know that the fan of pop grows azaleas. Since there are only two types of flowers on the left (azalea and marigold), it follows that the marigold must be grown by either the indie, electronic, or trance fan (since all other houses have been assigned). However, we know that the electronic and trance fans grow azalea and dahlia (the only two remaining flowers left), so the marigold must be grown by the indie fan. Therefore:

a) Indie -> onion and grows marigold
b) Pop -> azalea (since pop fan is the person who grows azaleas, as per clue 2)
c) Techno -> domino (since techno fan is playing domino, as per clue 4)
d) Electronic (on the far left)
e) Trance (futuristic house)

Now let's look at the food: we know that the fan of indie eats onion, and we know the marigold is grown by the indie. Since there are only three positions remaining for food (zucchini, carrot, and lettuce), it follows that zucchini must be eaten by the electronic or trance fan (as they are the only ones left). However, since the trance fan eats the futuristic house (which is not a food), the zucchini must be eaten by the electronic fan. Therefore:

a) Indie -> onion and grows marigold
b) Pop -> azalea (since pop fan is the person who grows azaleas, as per clue 2)
c) Techno -> domino
d) Electronic eats zucchini
e) Trance (futuristic house)

Now let's look at the houses: we know that the colonial house grows bellflowers and the victorian house grows radishes. Since there are only three positions remaining for houses (gothic-revival, townhouse, mah-jongg), it follows that the gothic-revival house must be to the left or right of the person who grows marigold (as per clue 10). Since we know the indie fan grows marigolds, it means the gothic-revival house cannot be on the far left. However, since there is only one position left for the gothic-revival house (between the victorian and townhouse), it must be the gothic-revival house that grows orchids (the only remaining flower). Therefore:

a) Indie -> onion and grows marigold
b) Pop -> azalea (since pop fan is the person who grows azaleas, as per clue 2)
c) Techno -> domino
d) Electronic eats zucchini
e) Trance (futuristic house)

Now let's look at the games: since we know that the monopoly player is in the middle (clue 8), it means the mah-jongg player must be on either side of the monopoly player. Since there are only two positions remaining for games (go and chess), it follows that go must be played by the electronic fan, as the trance fan already plays domino. Therefore:

a) Indie -> onion and grows marigold
b) Pop -> azalea (since pop fan is the person who grows azaleas, as per clue 2)
c) Techno -> domino
d) Electronic plays go (and eats zucchini)
e) Trance (futuristic house)

Now we know that go is played by the electronic fan. Since there are only two positions remaining for food (carrot and lettuce), it follows that carrot must be eaten by the trance fan (as the futuristic house cannot eat food). Therefore:

a) Indie -> onion and grows marigold
b) Pop -> azalea (since pop fan is the person who grows azaleas, as per clue 2)
c) Techno -> domino
d) Electronic plays go (and eats zucchini)
e) Trance eats carrot

Finally, we know that the zucchini and carrot are on opposite sides of the person who eats carrots (clue 5). Since the trance fan eats the carrot, it means the electronic fan must eat the zucchini. Therefore:

a) Indie -> onion and grows marigold
b) Pop -> azalea (since pop fan is the person who grows azaleas, as per clue 2)
c) Techno -> domino
d) Electronic plays go (and eats zucchini)
e) Trance eats carrot

Since we have assigned positions to all categories except for dahlia, let's check which position corresponds to the dahlia:

1. The only remaining possibility for flowers is dahlia.
2. Since the gothic-revival house grows orchids, the gothic-revival house cannot grow dahlia.
3. Since the victorian house grows radishes, the victorian house cannot grow dahlia.
4. Since the colonial house grows bellflowers and there are no other houses left to assign flowers, the colonial house cannot grow dahlia.
5. Since the townhouse plays mah-jongg and there are no more game positions left to assign, the townhouse cannot play mah-jongg.
6. Since all music-genre fans have been assigned, none of them can grow dahlia.
7. Since all food positions have been assigned, none of the people can eat dahlia.
8. Therefore, since no category has any remaining possibilities, the only conclusion is that there must be an error in the puzzle or information provided, and it's impossible to assign a position for the dahlia based on the given constraints."	dahlia:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_5domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, let's use a method called elimination and deduction. Here's how I approached it:

1. From rule 9, we know the fan of soul is on the far left. So, the person traveling to berlin must be the fan of gospel or blues since they are the only ones remaining for that city. However, the fan of blues can't be on the far left (rule 9), so the musician (since there's no other information about who prefers blues) is traveling to berlin and prefers gospel music: **musician:berlin**.

2. Now we know the person traveling to berlin can't be in the middle since the dressmaker is there (rule 8). So, the musician (who travels to berlin) must be on the left or right of the person traveling to Edinburgh. The only remaining positions for the person traveling to Edinburgh are the far left and directly to the left of the musician.

3. From rule 7, we know the person who's hobby is photography is in rome. Since we now have a position (rightmost) for the photographer, the person traveling to Edinburgh must be on the left side.

4. The only remaining options for the person traveling to Edinburgh are the far left or directly right of the musician. However, from rule 10, we know the filmmaker is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton, and since there's only one position left (directly right of the musician), the person with badminton must occupy that position. This means the filmmaker is on the far left, so the photographer (who travels to rome) cannot be in the middle (since the dressmaker is there). Therefore, the person traveling to Edinburgh must be the photographer and the musician must be on the far right: **musician:berlin**.

5. To check our solution, we can see that all other information matches with this arrangement:

   - The fan of gospel (musician) is in berlin
   - The fan of d&b plays ice-hockey
   - The chef is in hannover
   - The fan of ambient is the bartender
   - The person traveling to hannover is to the right of the person traveling to edinburgh (photographer)
   - The person who's hobby is sudoku plays baseball
   - The person who's hobby is photography is in rome
   - The dressmaker is in the middle
   - The fan of soul is on the far left (filmmaker)
   - The person who's hobby is skydiving is the software-developer
   - The fan of blues is the chef (cooking)

So, our solution holds."	musician:1	NA	False	False
Zebra_5domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a combination of logic and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Since we know that the gospel fan travels to Prague, let's assign 'P' for Prague and 'G' for Gospel (the fan of Gospel).
2. The D&B fan plays ice-hockey, so let's assign 'IH' for Ice-Hockey.
3. Since the chef is traveling to Hannover, we can assign 'H' for Hannover and 'C' for Chef.
4. The Ambient fan is the bartender, so let's use 'B' for Bartender and assign another city (since it's known that the bartender isn't in Prague or Hannover). We will come back to this later.
5. The person traveling to Hannover is to the right of the person traveling to Edinburgh. Since we know C is in Hannover, let's assign 'E' for Edinburgh.
6. The Sudoku fan plays baseball, so let's use 'BS' for Baseball.
7. The Photography fan travels to Rome, so we can assign 'R' for Rome and 'Ph' for Photography.
8. Since the dressmaker is in the middle (5th position), we can write down all other cities in the puzzle so far: P, H, E, R, B(unknown). This means there should be 4 more people after the dressmaker, so let's assign 'D1', 'D2', 'D3', and 'D4' for these unknown positions.
9. The person on the far left is a Soul fan, so this must be D1 or P (since they're known to be in Prague and Hannover). Since the Soul fan cannot be in Prague (as it's already assigned to G), let's assume D1 = S(Soul) for now.
10. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton, and we don't know where B is yet. So, we can't use this information at the moment.
11. The Photography fan is to the left or right of the person who's sport is Cricket, but again, we don't know where C is. So, we can't use this information either.
12. Since the Skydiving fan is the software-developer, let's assign 'SD' for Software Developer and 'SK' for Skydiving.
13. The Blues fan cooks, so we can write SD as 'Ck'. We know that 'C' already represents Chef, so this isn't possible. Since the only other option is 'D4', let's assume D4 = Bl(Blues) for now.
14. The Soul fan is to the left or right of the person traveling to Berlin. Since we don't know the position of Berlin yet, we can't use this information at the moment.

At this point, we have a few unknowns: B, D2, D3, and the position of Berlin (Brl). Let's analyze the relationships between the remaining positions:

- From point 10, we know that Filmmaking is either on the left or right of Badminton. Since D2 isn't Soul or Photography yet, it must be Filmmaking.
- From point 11, since we don't know where Cricket is yet, we can't use this information at the moment.
- If we look again at point 9, we can see that the only remaining option for D1 is Prague (P). So, D1 = S(Soul) in Prague.
- From point 8, since the dressmaker is in the middle, there should be 4 people before Dressmaker (Dm), and they are G, C, E, and now S. This means that the remaining cities must be R, B, D2, D3, Brl (in this order). So, let's assign: R = Ambient, B = DB (since we know that the D&B fan is the ice-hockey player), D2 = Fm(Filmmaking), and D3 = Ambient.

Now we have filled all the cities except Berlin. Since we know where all other music genres are, the only remaining option for Brl is Blues or Ambient. However, if Brl was Ambient, it would contradict our earlier placement (D3). So, Brl must be Bl(Blues).

Now that we have filled all the cities, let's recap the final positions:

- P: Gospel, Soul
- H: Chef
- E:
- R: Photography, Ambient
- B: D&B
- D1: Soul
- D2: Filmmaking
- D3: Ambient (repeated)
- D4: Blues
- Brl: Blues

Since we have assigned all music genres, let's find their corresponding sports. From our earlier placement, we know that the ice-hockey fan is the D&B fan (B), so Ice-Hockey = DB. Since we don't have any other known relationships for other sports yet, we can leave them as BS, Cricket, Surfing, and Baseball for now.

At this point, we can't find an exact relationship between hobbies and jobs since we still need to find the correct order of D2, D3, and Brl. However, we know that the Photography fan travels to Rome (R), so Photography = Ph. Similarly, we can assume that Sudoku = BS and Skydiving = SD based on our earlier placements.

In summary, we were unable to find an exact order of the people for their hobbies and jobs, but we have determined that:

- Surfing is one of Baseball, Cricket, or Sudoku (since it's associated with BS). However, without further information, we cannot definitively determine the position of Surfing."	surfing:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_5domain_replacements_2	" This puzzle requires a systematic approach to solve. Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's assign jobs and houses to the cities based on given conditions:
   - The manager is traveling to Venice (V)
   - The journalist is the person who's hobby is writing (W), so we can assume that W is either New York (N), Liverpool (L), or Colone (C).
     Since the journalist is not in Hamburg (H), and the fan of rock is traveling to Hamburg, W cannot be H. So, W = N, L, or C. Since the manager is not in any city next to a journalist (as per conditions 5 & 14), W cannot be Liverpool either. So, W = New York.
   - The palace house is in New York (N), so we know that N has a palace house.
   - The modern house is the person who's hobby is collecting (C), so we can assume that C is either H, Venice (V), or Colone (C). Since the manager is not in any city next to a journalist (as per conditions 5 & 14) and since the palace house is in New York, C cannot be H. So, C = V or C. But since the fan of rock is traveling to Hamburg, it means that H cannot be Colone, so C must be Colone. Now we know that Venice has a modern house (V), a manager, and nothing else yet.
   - The wooden house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing (D). Since the police-officer is on the far left and the palace house is in New York, it means that neither H nor N can have the wooden house. So, D must be V or C, but as we know D cannot be Colone because the modern house is there. So, D = Venice.
   - Since the colonial house is not New York and not Colone (as per conditions 11 & 12), it means that Liverpool has a colonial house (L).
   - The gothic-revival house is the engineer (E).
   - The fan of funk is in the middle, so we can assign Funk to any city except New York and Liverpool (since they have a palace and a colonial house respectively), so let's try placing it in Hamburg (H). Now Hamburg has a fan of rock (R) and a fan of funk (F). Since the modern house is in Venice and the colonial house is in Liverpool, there are only two remaining houses left for Hamburg: Palace (P) and Wooden (Wd), but as we know that the wooden house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing (D), it means that Hamburg cannot have a wooden house. So, P = Hamburg.
   - Now the only remaining house for Colone is wooden (Wd), so Wd = Colone.
   - Since the police-officer is on the far left and the wooden house is in Venice, it means that the police-officer is in Liverpool (L).
   - The fan of pop is not in New York or Liverpool (as per conditions 6, 11, and 14), so let's try placing it in Hamburg (H). Now Hamburg has a fan of rock (R) and a fan of funk (F). Since the modern house is in Venice and the colonial house is in Liverpool, there are only two remaining houses left for Hamburg: Palace (P) and Wooden (Wd), but as we know that the wooden house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing (D), it means that Hamburg cannot have a wooden house. So, P = Hamburg.
   - Now the only remaining houses for Venice are modern (M) and gothic-revival (Gr). But as we know that the engineer is in Gr, it means that Venice must have a modern house (M), which contradicts our earlier assignment of M to Colone. This means that our initial assumption about placing Pop in Hamburg was wrong. So let's try placing Pop in Colone (C).
   - Since the manager is in Venice and the journalist is in New York, it means that the only remaining job for Colone is analyst (A), which also happens to be a fan of salsa (S). Now Colone has an analyst (A) and a fan of dubstep (Ds), so let's try placing Dubstep in Liverpool (L).
   - Now there are only two remaining cities: Hamburg (H) and New York (N). Since the fan of funk is already placed in Hamburg, the only remaining music genre for Hamburg is Rock (R). So now Hamburg has a fan of rock (R) and a journalist (J), which means that the hobby of the journalist must be something other than writing. But we know that the journalist's hobby is writing (W), so it contradicts our earlier assignment of J to Hamburg. This means that our initial assumption about placing Pop in Colone was correct, but our final assignment of Dubstep in Liverpool was incorrect.
   - Now the only remaining city for Dubstep is Liverpool (L). Since the police-officer is on the far left and the colonial house is in Liverpool, it means that Liverpool cannot have a wooden house. But we know that the wooden house is in Venice or Colone. So, our assumption about placing Pop in Hamburg was correct but our final assignment of Dubstep in Liverpool was incorrect.
   - Now the only remaining cities for Rock and Pop are Hamburg (H) and New York (N). Since the fan of funk is already placed in Hamburg, the only remaining music genre for Hamburg is Rock (R), which contradicts our earlier assumption that Pop is in Hamburg. This means that our initial assumption about placing Pop in Colone was correct, but our final assignment of Dubstep in Liverpool was incorrect and our current assignment of Rock in Hamburg is incorrect.
   - Now the only remaining city for Rock is New York (N). Since the palace house is in New York and there are no more conditions that can help us find the position of Rock, we will assign Rock to any city that fits the conditions. But since we know that the fan of funk is already placed in Hamburg, it means that Rock cannot be in Hamburg. So, our assumption about placing Pop in Colone was correct and Rock must be in New York (N).

Now let's summarize the final assignments:

- City: Venice(V), Hamburg(H), Colone(C), New-york(N), Liverpool(L)
- Job: Manager(M), Journalist(J), Analyst(A), Police-officer(Pd), Engineer(E)
- House: Modern(M), Palace(P), Wooden(Wd), Colonial(Cd), Gothic-revival(Gr)
- Music-genre: Rock(R), Salsa(S), Funk(F), Dubstep(Ds), Pop(P)
- Hobby: Writing(W), Drawing(D), Puzzles(Z), Chess(Ch), Collecting(Cc)

After solving, **pop** is in Colone (P:2)."	pop:1	NA	False	False
Zebra_5domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, we need to find a systematic way to create combinations that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's start by finding the position of the police-officer and travel destinations since they have unique constraints.

1. The police-officer is on the far left (position 1).
2. The person traveling to venice is the manager (position 6, as we will see later), so the person traveling to Liverpool must be in position 5.
3. The person traveling to hamburg (position 4) is to the right of the person traveling to colone (position 3). Thus, positions 1(police-officer), 2, 3, and 5 are determined.

Now let's find the other factors for each position:

1. The police-officer's hobby is not specified, but we know it cannot be puzzles (as puzzles have to be on a different position). So let's assume its hobby is writing, as the journalist's hobby is writing and the journalist is not in position 1.
2. The hobby of the person in position 2 is drawing (since wooden house is on the left or right of this person). We also know that this person cannot be a manager, as they are traveling to a different city than the manager. So let's assume this person is an analyst with the rock genre preference and the modern house (the hobby of collecting matches the modern house, so let's place it there).
3. The person in position 3 is traveling to colone and cannot be a journalist or a fan of rock, so we know that this person is neither the journalist nor the fan of rock (which was placed in position 4) and not the police-officer (as they are in position 1). Let's assume this person has the salsa music preference and lives in the palace house.
4. The person in position 4 is traveling to hamburg, is a journalist, and a fan of rock. This leaves us with no other options for the remaining factors.
5. The person in position 5 is traveling to Liverpool (as we found earlier) and cannot be a manager, as the manager is traveling to venice. Let's assume this person has the hobby of puzzles and the dubstep music preference.
6. Finally, the manager must be in position 6, traveling to venice, with the gothic-revival house (as the remaining houses are already placed). We also know that this person cannot have the rock music preference, as it is already assigned to the journalist traveling to hamburg. Let's assume the manager has a hobby of writing (as this hobby is already taken by the analyst in position 2), so the only remaining option for the manager is the pop music genre preference.

Now that we have placed all people and their factors, let's verify if our assumptions are correct:

1. The police-officer is in position 1, with a hobby of writing (which is not puzzles).
2. The analyst is in position 2, with the modern house, hobby of drawing, and salsa music preference.
3. The person traveling to colone is in position 3, with the palace house, and neither journalist nor rock fan.
4. The journalist is in position 4, with the wooden house (which is on the left or right of the drawing hobby), traveling to hamburg, and a fan of rock.
5. The person traveling to Liverpool is in position 5, with the dubstep music preference, puzzles as a hobby, and not a manager.
6. The manager is in position 6, with the gothic-revival house, living in venice, and a fan of pop.

The given conditions are satisfied, so our final answer is **puzzles:5**."	puzzles:5	puzzles:5	True	True
