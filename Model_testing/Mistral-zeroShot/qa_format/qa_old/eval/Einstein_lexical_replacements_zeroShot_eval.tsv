Einstein_lexical_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, we'll use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by filling up the table below based on the given information:

| Color | Nationality  | Beverage | Cigar Brand | Pet  | Position (from left)  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chestnut | Dutch (14) or Far Left(14) | Fantas(12) or ? | Davidoff (12) or ? | Ferret | ? (10) or ? (15) |
| Grey    |  7up (5)  | 7up (5)  | Baccarat (6) or ?  | Chinchilla (6)  | Left of Aquamarine (4) and Right of Ferret (10) or Left of Hot-Chocolate(15) |
| Black   | Japanese (1) | Almond-Milk (3)  | Havana (13)    | ? (TBD) | ? |
| Aquamarine |   Right of Grey (4) | Mirinda (8)  | Game (7)       | Lizard (TBD) | Middle(8) |
| Azure    | Game (7)  | Hot-Chocolate (15)  | Chaman (15)   | Turtle (TBD) | Right of Grey(4) and Left or Right of the owner of the Ferret (10) or Right of the owner of the Chinchilla (6) |

Let's start by solving some positions:
- Since the Dutch is on the left or right of the person who likes chestnut, the only available option for the dutch is the left position. So, we have: Chestnut -> Dutch (position 14) and Dutch (position 9).
- Since the chaman-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret, the only available option for the chaman-smoker is the left position because Davidoff (fanta drinker) is already on position 12. So, we have: Ferret -> Chaman (position 15).
- Since the game-smoker likes azure, and the only person who likes azure is the person in position 7, we have: Azure -> Game (position 7).
- Since the mirinda drinker is in the middle, we have: Mirinda -> Middle(8) which means the Spanish keeps the guinea pig because the only remaining option for the Spanish is to be the owner of the guinea-pig. So, we have: Guinea-Pig -> Spanish (position 5).

Now let's move on to solving the cigar brands and beverages:
- Since the Japanese likes black, and the only remaining option for the Japanese is position 1, it means that person drinks almond milk. So, we have: Almond Milk -> Japanese (position 1).
- Now we know the Dutch likes chestnut, so the only cigar brands left are davidoff, baccarat and havana. Since Havana is already assigned to the french, the only remaining option for the dutch is Davidoff. So, we have: Fanta -> Dutch (position 12).
- Now we know that the Australian likes almond milk, so the only beverages left are fanta, mirinda and hot chocolate. Since fanta drinker is already assigned to position 12, the only remaining option for the Australian is Hot Chocolate(15) because mirinda is already assigned to position 8. So, we have: Hot-Chocolate -> Australian (position 15).
- Now we know that the person drinking 7up likes grey and is on the left of Aquamarine. The only remaining option for the person with grey as a favorite color is the position 2. Since the spanish is already assigned to position 5, the only cigar brands left are baccarat, havana, and chaman. Since Havana is already assigned to the french, the only remaining option for the owner of the grey pet (chinchilla) is Baccarat. So, we have: Baccarat -> Chinchilla owner (position 6).
- Now we know that the person in position 8 drinks mirinda, so the only cigar brand left is chaman, and since it's already assigned to Ferret owner (position 15), we have: Mirinda -> Position 8.

Now let's move on to solving the pets:
- Since the guinea pig is owned by the Spanish(position 5), the only remaining pet options for the Japanese and Australian are turtle, lizard, and ferret. Since both of them have already been assigned pets (Japanese - almond milk drinker, Australian - hot chocolate drinker), and we know that the Dutch likes chestnut, it means that the only remaining option for the dutch is Lizard because Turtle and Ferret are left for the far right positions. So, we have: Lizard -> Dutch (position 4).
- Since the person with grey as a favorite color keeps chinchilla, the only remaining pet options for the Japanese and Australian are turtle and ferret. Since both of them have already been assigned pets (Japanese - almond milk drinker, Australian - hot chocolate drinker), we know that the last pet is Turtle because it's the only remaining option for the far right position. So, we have: Turtle -> Position 3.
- Since the person with aquamarine as a favorite color is to the right of the grey pet owner and there are no more positions left, it means that the last pet is Ferret because it's the only remaining option for the far right position. So, we have: Ferret -> Position 2.

Now we can confirm our answers:
- Chestnut: Dutch (position 9)
- Grey: Japanese (position 2)
- Black: Almond Milk (Japanese position 1)
- Aquamarine: ? (no information available)
- Azure: Game (position 7)
- Beverages: Fanta -> Dutch (position 12), Mirinda(8), Hot Chocolate(Australian, Position 15)
- Cigar Brands: Davidoff -> Dutch (position 12), Baccarat -> Chinchilla owner (position 6), Game(7), Chaman -> Ferret owner (position 15)
- Pets: Lizard->Dutch (position 4), Turtle(Position 3), Guinea-Pig -> Spanish (position 5), Ferret -> Position 2."	lizard:4	NA	False	False
Einstein_lexical_replacements_1	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can place the Nigerian as the turquise-lover since it is given directly (Nigerian:1).
2. The Chinese owns the hamster, so let's put him next to 1 since the Indonesian is on the far left (Chinese:5 or 6).
3. Since the Japanese drinks soy-milk, he can only be placed after the almond-milk drinker (Japanese:4,8,9...).
4. The person who likes brown is on the left of the person who likes lavender. Since the Nigerian already occupies position 1 and likes turquise, not brown, the brown-lover must be placed before him. Also, the person drinking lemonade is the brown-lover (Brown-lover:2 or 3).
5. Now we know that the brown-lover is also the lemonade drinker, so his position is determined by the above steps.
6. The davidoff-smoker owns a goat, so he can only be placed after the Chinese (Davidoff-smoker:6 or 7). Also, since the person who likes brown is on the left of the person who likes lavender and the brown-lover is already placed, the goat owner must be to the right of the Nigerian.
7. The emerald-liker is also the old-henry-smoker (Emerald-liker:7). This puts a restriction on the positions of the Aristoff-smoker and the person who likes pink. Since the indonesian is on the left or right of the person who likes pink, the emerald-liker must be in between them.
8. The almond-milk drinker is placed at position 8 since it is given directly.
9. The Aristoff-smoker is an Indian (Aristoff-smoker:3). Since he is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret, he must be to the left of the Nigerian and to the right of the Indonesian. This leaves only one possible position for him.
10. The indonesian is on the left or right of the person who likes pink (Indonesian:2). Since we know that the Chinese and the Aristoff-smoker are already placed, the only possible color preference for the Indonesian is pink (Pink-liker:4).
11. Now we know where the Indonesian is placed, we can determine the position of the old-henry-smoker as he must be on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk, and since the Indonesian likes pink, not emerald, the only possibility for the old-henry-smoker is to the left of the almond-milk drinker.
12. The havana-smoker drinks mirinda (Havana-smoker:9). Since the indian is the Aristoff-smoker and he is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret, the only possible position for the mirinda drinker is 9.
13. We know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is placed on the left or right of the Cain-smoker (Hot-chocolate-drinker:5 or 6). Since the cain-smoker must be on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, he can only be placed before the hot-chocolate-drinker.
14. Now we know that the positions of all smokers are determined, and since the davidoff-smoker is to the right of the Nigerian (who likes turquise) and owns a goat, there is only one possible position for him. This leaves the remaining pet, lizard.
15. Since the cain-smoker must be on the left or right of the hot-chocolate drinker, he must be placed after the mirinda drinker (Cain-smoker:9). Since there are only two positions left and both should not be occupied by the mirinda drinker, the Cain-smoker must occupy position 10. This leaves us with only one possible position for the hot-chocolate drinker (Hot-chocolate-drinker:6).

Now we can determine the final arrangement:

- Nigerian (Turquise):1
- Pink-liker (Indonesian):2
- Brown-lover (Lemonade drinker):2 or 3
- Japanese (Soy-milk):4,8,9...
- Aristoff-smoker (Indian):3
- Emerald-liker (Old-henry-smoker):7
- Almond-milk drinker:8
- Davidoff-smoker (Goat owner):6 or 7
- Old-Henry-smoker:1 or 2
- Cain-smoker (Rat owner):10
- Hot-chocolate drinker:6

Since we don't know the exact order of people within each group, we cannot definitively determine the position of lizard. However, we do know that it must be after the Cain-smoker (lizard>Cain) and before the hot-chocolate drinker (hot-chocolate<lizard). So we can only say **lizard:11 or 12**."	lizard:4	lizard:11	False	True
Einstein_lexical_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, let's first assign each person a variable. We have variables A (Malaysian), I (Indian), Ar (Argentine), C (Chinese), Fr (French). Similarly, we have variables L1 (person who likes light-blue), R (blood-red), E (emerald), La (lavender). For the nationality order, let A < C < Ar < Fr. Since I is next to A and on the left of R, I < A < R.

Now we have the following additional information:
1. L1 likes light-blue and drinks fanta
2. L1 is on the left of R (so A < L1 < R)
3. L1 is the owner of the rat (I)
4. Ar drinks 7up
5. Swisher smoker has a frog pet (6th variable F)
6. E likes emerald and is an oliveros-smoker
7. The soy-milk drinker is in the middle (between L1 and R, but not A or I due to their relationships with L1)
8. C is on the far left
9. Chaman smoker is either to the left or right of Turtle's owner (T) or Almond-Milk drinker (M)
10. Vegafina smoker drinks mirinda (we don't have any direct information about this person yet)
11. The Frog owner is on the left or right of the oliveros-smoker (E)
12. The swisher-smoker is the owner of the frog (F)
13. The french is the cain-smoker (F)
14. C is on the left or right of L (lavender)
15. Chaman smoker is either to the left or right of M

Now let's break it down:

- Since 7up drinker is Ar, we have Ar > SoM > A > L1 > R. Swisher is the frog owner, so F < E. Lavender and Chinese are neighbors, but not the first two (C < L). So L > C > La.
- From above, we know that Chaman smoker cannot be on both left and right of M or T, but Chaman smoker has to be next to one of them. Since Ar is fixed at his place, Chaman smoker can only be on the right of M if T is on the far right, which contradicts C > La. So Chaman smoker must be on the left of M (C < M).
- From 13 and 14, we have Fr > Ca > La. Since F cannot be to the right of E, Fr cannot be in the middle. So F is either A or R. But F cannot be A since Ar drinks 7up which is on the right, so F = R.
- Now we know that the frog owner (F) is also the argentine (R). We can now find out who the swisher smoker is: Since Swisher cannot be E or M (since they are both known to be next to Chaman), and it's not A, it has to be C. So we have Swisher-C > F = R.
- With this information, we know that La is on the left of Fr (A < Fr). Since L1 and I are neighbors, La cannot be I. Therefore, La = A.
- From the fact that soy-milk drinker is in the middle, we have SoM < L1 < A < R.
- Now the only way to place Chaman smoker is between SoM and L1 (because he's left of M). Since E is right of Chaman, we also know that Emerald liker is on the right of A (E > A). This means that Emerald is not a lavender or light-blue liker (since they are known to be next to A). So Emerald = C.
- Finally, since Vegafina smoker drinks mirinda and cannot be Fr (french), it can only be C (as the vegafina smoker is now on the right of E). Therefore, Vegafina-C > M > Chaman-C > SoM > L1 > A > R.

After solving the puzzle, we find that the chinchilla owner is **Chinese**: **chinchilla: C**"	chinchilla:4	NA	False	False
