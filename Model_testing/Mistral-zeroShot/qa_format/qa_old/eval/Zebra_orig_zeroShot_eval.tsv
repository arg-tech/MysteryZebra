Zebra_orig_1	" To solve this puzzle, we need to find a systematic way to organize and solve the given information. Let's create tables for each variable (house color, nationality, pet, drink, cigarette) and fill them based on the clues:

1. House Color: Red, Green, Ivory, Yellow, Blue
2. Nationality: English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese
3. Pet: Dog, Fox, Zebra, Horse, Snails
4. Drink: Coffee, Tea, Milk, Orange-juice, Water
5. Cigarette: Old-Gold, Kools, Chesterfields, Lucky-strike, Parliaments

Now let's fill the tables using the clues:

| House Color | Nationality  | Pet           | Drink         | Cigarette      |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Red        | English    |              |              |                |
| Green      |            | Coffee       |              |                |
| Ivory      |            |              | Tea          |                |
| Yellow     | Spanish    | Dog          |              | Kools          |
| Blue       | Norwegian   |              |              |                |

Since the Norwegian lives in the first house, we can fill the table with that information:

| House Color | Nationality  | Pet           | Drink         | Cigarette      |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Blue       | Norwegian   |              |              |                |
| Green      |            | Coffee       |              |                |
| Ivory      |            |              | Tea          |                |
| Yellow     | Spanish    | Dog          |              | Kools          |
| Red        | English    |              |              |                |

From clue #6, the green house is to the right of the ivory house. Since there are only five houses and we already know that the first house is blue, it must be that the ivory house is the second one (Green, Ivory, Yellow, Spanish, English). Now we can fill in the Green row:

| House Color | Nationality  | Pet           | Drink         | Cigarette      |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Blue       | Norwegian   |              |              |                |
| Green      |            | Coffee       |             |                |
| Ivory      | Ukrainian  |              | Tea          |                |
| Yellow     | Spanish    | Dog          |              | Kools          |
| Red        | English    |              |              |                |

Since the green house is to the right of the ivory house, we can move on to the next clues. From clue #5, the Ukrainian drinks tea, so we know that the Ivory house belongs to the Ukrainian (we already knew this, but now we have more confirmation). Fill in the Ivory row:

| House Color | Nationality  | Pet           | Drink         | Cigarette      |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Blue       | Norwegian   |              |              |                |
| Green      |            | Coffee       | Tea          |                |
| Ivory      | Ukrainian  |              | Tea          |                |
| Yellow     | Spanish    | Dog          |              | Kools          |
| Red        | English    |              |              |                |

Now we can use clue #9, milk is drunk in the middle house. Since there are five houses and the Blue and Red houses are already taken, it must be that the Yellow house is the third one (Blue, Green, Milk, Ivory, English). Fill in the Milk row:

| House Color | Nationality  | Pet           | Drink         | Cigarette      |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Blue       | Norwegian   |              |              |                |
| Green      |            | Coffee       | Tea          |                |
| Ivory      | Ukrainian  |              | Tea          |                |
| Yellow     | Spanish    | Dog          | Milk         | Kools          |
| Red        | English    |              |              |                |

From clue #10, the Norwegian lives in the first house. This is already filled in (Blue). From clue #11, the Chesterfield smoker lives next to the man with a fox. Since we know that the Spanish owns a dog, it must be that the Red house belongs to the Chesterfield smoker (Spanish, Chesterfields, Dog, Milk, Kools). Fill in the Red row:

| House Color | Nationality  | Pet           | Drink         | Cigarette      |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Blue       | Norwegian   |              |              |                |
| Green      |            | Coffee       | Tea          |                |
| Ivory      | Ukrainian  |              | Tea          |                |
| Yellow     | Spanish    | Dog          | Milk         | Kools          |
| Red        | English    | Fox          |              | Chesterfields  |

Now we can use clue #12, which tells us that Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse. Since the Yellow house has a dog (not the horse), it must be that the house to the right of the Yellow house (Spanish) has the horse. Fill in the Yellow row:

| House Color | Nationality  | Pet           | Drink         | Cigarette      |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Blue       | Norwegian   |              |              |                |
| Green      |            | Coffee       | Tea          |                |
| Ivory      | Ukrainian  |              | Tea          |                |
| Yellow     | Spanish    | Dog          | Milk         | Kools          |
| Red        | English    | Fox          |              | Chesterfields  |
|           | Horse      |              | Orange-juice  | Parliaments    |

From clue #13, the Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice. Since we know that the horse is kept in a house with Parliaments (clue #14), it must be the Red house belongs to the Lucky Strike smoker (Red, English, Fox, Orange-juice, Chesterfields). Fill in the Red row again:

| House Color | Nationality  | Pet           | Drink         | Cigarette      |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Blue       | Norwegian   |              |              |                |
| Green      |            | Coffee       | Tea          |                |
| Ivory      | Ukrainian  |              | Tea          |                |
| Yellow     | Spanish    | Dog          | Milk         | Kools          |
| Red        | English    | Fox          | Orange-juice  | Lucky Strike    |
|           | Horse      |              | Orange-juice  | Parliaments    |

Now we know that the only unfilled rows are for pet and cigarette. From clue #7, the Old Gold smoker owns snails. Since we have already filled all the houses except one (Green), it must be the Green house belongs to the Old Gold smoker. Fill in the Green row:

| House Color | Nationality  | Pet           | Drink         | Cigarette      |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Blue       | Norwegian   | Snails       |              |                |
| Green      |            | Old Gold     | Coffee       | Old Gold       |
| Ivory      | Ukrainian  |              | Tea          |                |
| Yellow     | Spanish    | Dog          | Milk         | Kools          |
| Red        | English    | Fox          | Orange-juice  | Lucky Strike    |
|           | Horse      |              | Orange-juice  | Parliaments    |

We have now filled in all the rows, and the final solution is:

House 1 (Blue): Norwegian, Snails
House 2 (Green): Old Gold
House 3 (Milk): Spanish, Dog
House 4 (Ivory): Ukrainian
House 5 (Red): English, Fox, Orange-juice, Lucky Strike
House 6 (Horse): -, Horse, Orange-juice, Parliaments

Since we have determined the nationality and pet for every house except the last one (Horse), we can conclude that the horse is owned by a person who drinks orange juice and smokes Parliaments."	zebra:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_orig_2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down and create a table to organize our information:

| Nationality | House Color | Pet | Drink | Cigarette |
|------------|------------|-----|-------|-----------|
| English    | Red        | N/A  | N/A    | Old-Gold   |
| Spanish    | N/A        | Dog  | N/A    | Kools      |
| Ukrainian  | Green      | N/A  | Tea     | N/A        |
| Norwegian  | First      | N/A  | N/A    | Chesterfields |
| Japanese   | Blue       | N/A  | N/A    | Parliaments|

Now let's fill in the missing information using clues:

1. The Spaniard owns the dog, so the Spanish lives in a house with a pet that isn't dog yet (we know there are five pets). Since Norwegian already has a pet, and Japanese doesn't own a dog, it must be the Ukrainian who owns the dog. So, the green house is occupied by the Ukrainian, as he drinks tea and the Ukrainian was not the first resident.
2. The Ukrainian drinks tea, so we mark that in the table.
3. The Englishman lives in the red house, which has been assigned to the nationality already (and it's not the same as the Spanish).
4. Coffee is drunk in the green house, and we know the Ukrainian drinks tea, so it must be the Norwegian who drinks coffee, in the first house. Mark coffee for the Norwegian in our table.
5. Milk is drunk in the middle house, so the yellow or ivory house can't have milk. As there are only three possibilities left (red, green, and blue), it must be the red house with the Englishman. Mark milk for the Englishman in our table.
6. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house, so the Japanese must live either first or third. Since the Norwegian is already placed, the Japanese must live in the third house (blue). Mark Japanese and Parliaments in the table.
7. The man who smokes Old-Gold owns snails, so we know that it can't be the Englishman, Spanish, Ukrainian, or Japanese because they all have been assigned a pet already. It must be either Norwegian or the remaining resident (living in the ivory house). Since we already know the Norwegian smokes Chesterfields, it has to be the remaining resident who owns snails and smokes Old-Gold. The greenhouse was occupied by the Ukrainian, so the only remaining option for the red house is the ivory house. Mark Old-Gold and snails in our table.
8. Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse, but we know already that the Norwegian has the horse. It must be either the Spanish or Japanese who smoke Kools (since they haven't been assigned cigarettes yet). As the Spanish already owns a pet, it can't be them. So the Japanese must smoke Kools, and the house next to the blue house (Japanese) must have a pet that isn't horse, which is fox. Mark Kools and Fox in our table.
9. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox. We know already that the Spanish owns a fox, so it has to be either the Norwegian or Japanese who smokes Chesterfields. Since we've already assigned cigarettes for the Japanese and Norwegian, there must be another house left unassigned (red), which means there is one more resident yet to be placed. This new resident will have to live in the red house, smoke Chesterfields, and own the remaining pet (zebra).
10. The only drink left is orange-juice. As we know that the Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice, it can't be assigned yet because we don't know who smokes Lucky-Strikes.
11. We have all five residents, and all five pets have been assigned. However, there is still no match for orange juice or Lucky-Strikes. This puzzle might be impossible to solve with the given information (assuming all clues are correct). If you find another clue that helps to determine who smokes Lucky-Strikes, you can use the same process to assign the remaining details.
12. In this case, we'll assume that there is an additional clue about the position of the house where Lucky-Strike is smoked in relation to the other houses, which helps us solve the puzzle completely:
- If the house with orange juice and Lucky-Strikes is immediately to the left of the horse (yellow) house, we can easily assign those details. However, this would mean that the Norwegian or Japanese must be the one who smokes Lucky-Strikes, which contradicts our previous assumption that the last resident lives in the red house (with Chesterfields).
- If the house with orange juice and Lucky-Strikes is immediately to the right of the horse (yellow) house, it would be possible to assign those details without conflicts. The Ukrainian would smoke Lucky-Strikes, as he's the only one left unassigned cigarettes, and the last resident lives in the red house with Chesterfields and the remaining pet (zebra).

So, assuming the additional clue is ""The house with orange juice and Lucky-Strikes is immediately to the right of the horse (yellow) house,"" we can complete our table as follows:

| Nationality | House Color | Pet | Drink | Cigarette |
|------------|------------|-----|-------|-----------|
| English    | Red        | N/A  | Milk   | Old-Gold   |
| Spanish    | Green      | Dog  | Coffee | Kools     |
| Ukrainian  | Blue       | N/A  | Tea    | Lucky-Strikes|
| Norwegian  | Ivory      | Horse| Orange-juice| Chesterfields|
| Japanese   | Yellow     | Fox  | Water  | Parliaments|

Now we know that the zebra is kept in the ivory house, so: **zebra:Ivory**."	zebra:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_orig_3	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a table and fill it with all the given information:

| Color | Nationality | Pet | Drink | Cigarette Brand |
|-------|------------|----|------|-----------------|
| Red   | English    |    |      |                  |
| Green |           | Coffee |     |                |
| Ivory |           |       | Tea         |                |
| Yellow| Spanish    | Dog   |       | Kools          |
| Blue  | Norwegian  |     |     |                |
|      | Ukrainian  |     | Milk        | Lucky-Strike   |
|      | Japanese   | Horse| Orange juice| Parlaments     |

1. Using information from point 2 and 10, we know that the Englishman lives in the red house (row 1) and the Norwegian lives in the first house (column 5). So, the Norwegian must be the Englishman because there are only two houses left for the Englishman to live in.
2. From point 3, the Spaniard owns a dog, so the Spanish man lives in the yellow house (row 4).
3. Using points 6 and 7, we know that the green house is immediately right of the ivory house (columns 2 and 3) and the Old Gold smoker owns snails. Since there are only two empty columns left for these conditions, the Old Gold smoker must live in the Ivory house, and thus the Snails live in the Ivory house.
4. From point 9, we know that milk is drunk in the middle house (column 4), but we already know who the Norwegian (Englishman) and Spanish man are, so it can't be either of them. The only remaining column is for the Ukrainian, meaning he drinks milk.
5. Using points 11 and 12, we learn that the Chesterfields smoker lives next to the man with a fox (row 3 or 5), and Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse (column 6 or 7). Since the Spanish man owns a dog (which is not a fox) and the Snails live in the Ivory house, there's only one possible position for the Chesterfields smoker (row 3), which means the fox must be in that house. Also, the horse lives in column 6 since Kools are smoked in the yellow house, which is next to column 7.
6. From point 13 and 14, we find out that Lucky-Strike smoker drinks orange juice (column 5) and the Japanese smokes Parlaments (row 6). So, we know the Ukrainian drinks milk (column 4), Lucky-Strike drinks orange juice (column 5), and the Japanese smokes Parlaments (row 6).
7. The only remaining information is about the location of the Zebra, which isn't explicitly given yet. We can infer that since the Norwegian (Englishman) lives in the first house, he cannot be the owner of any of the pets other than the horse or zebra, and both the horse and dog have been assigned to the Spanish man and Snails live in the Ivory house. So, the Zebra must be owned by the Japanese (row 6).

Finally, **zebra:6**."	zebra:5	zebra:6	False	True
Zebra_orig_1	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a systematic approach by creating a table with each of the five variables in separate columns and rows for each resident. We will then fill in each row based on the given clues.

| Resident  | Color  | Nationality | Pet      | Drink    | Cigarettes  |
|----------|-------|------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1        | Nor   | Norwegian   | Fox     | -       | Chesterfield|
| 2        | Red   | English    | -       | -       | Old Gold     |
| 3        | -     | -          | Snails  | -       | -            |
| 4        | Green| -          | Dog     | Coffee   | Kools       |
| 5        | Ivory| -          | Horse   | -       | Lucky Strike|
|         | Blue  | Japanese   | Zebra   | Water    | Parliaments  |

Since the Norwegian lives in the first house, we know that row 1 corresponds to him. Since he lives next to the blue house, it must be house 2 or 5 (since house 1 is already occupied). However, since the Englishman lives in the red house and it cannot be house 2 because it would conflict with the green house being immediately to the right of the ivory house, house 1 can't contain a Norwegian. So house 5 must contain the Norwegian, making house 1 the blue house and Japanese.

Since the horse is not in house 1 or 5 (because they are occupied by the Norwegian and Japanese respectively), it must be either house 2, 3, or 4. Since kools are smoked next to the horse and the kool-smoker drinks coffee, we know that the green house cannot contain the horse because the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, which means that the horse cannot be in any house closer to the left end of the row. So the horse must be in house 4.

Since kools are smoked in a house next to the man with the fox, and the Chesterfield smoker lives in the first house, the fox must be in house 3. Since the Englishman cannot live in house 2 because it conflicts with the green house being immediately to the right of the ivory house, the Englishman cannot smoke Kools or drink coffee. So the Englishman cannot live in house 4 either (because it contains the horse and kool-smoker). Therefore, the Englishman must live in house 5, making house 2 the green house.

Since milk is drunk in the middle house and the Englishman cannot live in house 2 or 4, the Ukrainian cannot live in house 3 either (because it would conflict with the Englishman living in house 5). So the Ukrainian must live in house 1, making the Spaniard live in house 3.

Since the Spaniard owns the dog, and the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, we know that the green house cannot be house 2 because it would conflict with the Spaniard living in house 3 (since the Spanish house must be next to the green house). So the Spaniard cannot live in house 4 either. Therefore, the Spaniard must live in house 5, making the Englishman live in house 2.

Since kools are smoked in a house next to the horse and the Chesterfield smoker lives in the first house, the horse cannot be in house 1 or 3 (because they are occupied by the Norwegian and Spaniard respectively). So the horse must be in house 4.

Since the Englishman drinks coffee and the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, we know that the green house cannot be house 5 because it would conflict with the Englishman living in house 2. Therefore, the green house must be house 3.

Since the Ukrainian drinks tea and the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, we know that the green house cannot be house 4 either. So the green house must be house 3, making the Ukrainian live in house 1.

Since milk is drunk in the middle house, and the Englishman lives in house 2 (not the middle), the middle house cannot contain a resident who drinks milk. Since the Spaniard owns the dog and the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, we know that the green house cannot be house 4 either. So the middle house must be house 5, making the Norwegian live in house 4.

Since the Japanese smokes Parliaments, and the Englishman drinks coffee, we know that the Englishman cannot smoke Parliaments. Since the Norwegian lives next to the blue house (which is house 1), the blue house cannot be house 5. So the blue house must be house 2, making the Japanese live in house 3.

Since kools are smoked in a house next to the horse and the Chesterfield smoker lives in the first house, we know that the horse cannot be in house 1 (because it is occupied by the Norwegian). So the horse must be in house 4.

Since Kools are smoked in a house next to the man with the fox, the fox cannot be in house 1 or 3 (because they are occupied by the Japanese and Ukrainian respectively). So the fox must be in house 5.

Since the Spaniard owns the dog, we know that the green house cannot contain a resident who owns the horse because the horse is in house 4 and the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house. Since the green house cannot be house 2 either (because it would conflict with the Englishman living in house 5), the only possible green house left is house 3.

Since the Ukrainian drinks tea, we know that the green house cannot contain a resident who smokes Lucky Strike because the Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice. Since the green house cannot be house 4 either (because it would conflict with the horse being in house 5), the only possible green house left is house 3.

Since milk is drunk in the middle house, and we already know that the Norwegian lives in house 4, the only remaining option for the milk-drinker is the Englishman (since the Ukrainian drinks tea). So the Englishman must live in house 2.

Since the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, and we already know that the Spaniard lives in house 3, the only remaining option for the ivory house is house 1.

Since Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse (which is in house 4), and the Chesterfield smoker lives in the first house, the only remaining options for the Kool-smoker are houses 2 and 5. Since the Spaniard cannot smoke Kools because the Spaniard owns the dog, and we already know that the Englishman drinks coffee, the only remaining option for the Kool-smoker is house 5 (because the Ukrainian drinks tea).

Since kools are smoked in a house next to the man with the fox (which is in house 5), and the Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice, the only remaining option for the fox-owner is the Norwegian (since we already know that the Englishman cannot be the fox-owner). So the Norwegian lives in house 3.

Since milk is drunk in the middle house (which is occupied by the Englishman), and we already know that the Ukrainian drinks tea, the only remaining option for the milk-drinker in the first house is the Japanese (since we already know that the Spaniard cannot drink milk). So the Japanese lives in house 1.

Since the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (which is in house 1), and we already know that the Ukrainian drinks tea, the only remaining option for the green house is house 4.

Since Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse (which is in house 4), the only remaining option for the horse-owner is the Spaniard. So the Spaniard lives in house 2.

Since kools are smoked in a house next to the man with the fox (which is in house 5), and we already know that the Norwegian owns the fox, the only remaining option for the Chesterfield smoker is the Japanese. So the Japanese smokes Chesterfield.

Since the Englishman drinks coffee and the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (which is occupied by the Ukrainian), the only remaining option for the Lucky Strike smoker is the Norwegian. So the Norwegian smokes Lucky Strike.

Since the Spaniard lives in house 2, the only remaining option for the owner of the ivory house is the Japanese (since the Ukrainian drinks tea). So the Japanese lives in house 4.

Since the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, and we already know that the Ukrainian drinks tea, the only remaining option for the green house is house 5.

Since the Englishman lives in house 2, the only remaining option for the owner of the blue house is the Spaniard (since the Japanese smokes Chesterfield). So the Spaniard lives in house 2.

Since the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (which is occupied by the Ukrainian), and we already know that the Englishman drinks coffee, the only remaining option for the owner of the ivory house is the Japanese (since the Norwegian smokes Lucky Strike). So the Japanese lives in house 4.

Since the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, and we already know that the Englishman drinks coffee, the only remaining option for the owner of the green house is the Spaniard (since the Ukrainian drinks tea). So the Spaniard lives in house 5.

Since the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (which is occupied by the Japanese), and we already know that the Englishman drinks coffee, the only remaining option for the owner of the ivory house is the Ukrainian. So the Ukrainian lives in house 1.

Since the Spaniard owns the dog, the only remaining options for the dog-owner are houses 1, 3, and 5 (since we already know that the Englishman cannot own the dog). Since the Ukrainian drinks tea and the Japanese smokes Chesterfield, the only remaining option for the dog-owner is house 3.

Since the Spaniard lives in house 2, and the Ukrainian drinks tea, the only remaining options for the owner of the blue house are houses 1, 4, and 5 (since we already know that the Norwegian smokes Lucky Strike). Since the Japanese smokes Chesterfield and the Ukrainian drinks tea, the only remaining option for the owner of the blue house is house 1.

Since the Spaniard lives in house 2, and the Englishman drinks coffee, the only remaining options for the owner of the ivory house are houses 3, 4, and 5 (since we already know that the Ukrainian drinks tea). Since the Japanese smokes Chesterfield, the only remaining option for the owner of the ivory house is house 5.

Since the Spaniard lives in house 2, and the Norwegian owns the fox, the only remaining options for the owner of the green house are houses 1, 3, and 4 (since we already know that the Ukrainian drinks tea). Since the Japanese smokes Chesterfield, the only remaining option for the owner of the green house is house 3.

Since the Spaniard lives in house 2, and the Spaniard cannot own the horse because the horse is in house 4, the only remaining options for the owner of the horse are houses 1, 3, and 5 (since we already know that the Ukrainian drinks tea). Since the Japanese smokes Chesterfield, the only remaining option for the owner of the horse is house 1.

Since the Englishman drinks coffee, the Ukrainian drinks tea, the Japanese smokes Chesterfield, and the Norwegian smokes Lucky Strike, there are no further options left to determine who lives in houses 3 and 5. However, since we know that the Spaniard cannot own the dog or horse, the only remaining option for the owner of the dog is house 1, and the only remaining option for the owner of the horse is house 4.

In conclusion, the arrangement of the characters in the houses is as follows:
House 1: Ukrainian (ivory), Japanese (blue), Dog
House 2: Spaniard (ivory)
House 3: Norwegian (green)
House 4: Japanese (horse), Englishman (ivory)
House 5: Spaniard (green)

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Your helpful assistant

To clarify, we started with the following information:
- Each character lives in one of the five houses (ivory, blue, green, horse, or dog)
- Each house can only be inhabited by one character
- We know that the Ukrainian drinks tea, the Englishman drinks coffee, the Japanese smokes Chesterfield, and the Norwegian smokes Lucky Strike
- The Spaniard owns the ivory house, the dog, and cannot own either the horse or the green house
- The Spaniard lives in one of the houses (not necessarily the ivory house)

Using this information, we were able to deduce the arrangement of characters in each house."	water:1	NA	False	False
Zebra_orig_2	" To solve this puzzle, we can create a table with five rows representing each house and six columns for their properties (color, resident, pet, drink, cigarettes, and position). We will fill the table one by one based on the given clues.

| House | Color | Resident  | Pet   | Drink    | Cigarettes | Position  |
|-------|-------|----------|---|---------|---|-----------|
| 1     | Norweigan (N)      |           |       |          |           | First     |
| 2     | Blue (B)           |           |       |          |           | Next to 1 |
| 3     | Middle (M)         |           |       | Milk     |            |          |
| 4     | Green (G)          | English   | Coffee |         | Old Gold   | Right of B|
| 5     | Ivory (I)          | Ukrainian |        | Tea      | Snails     | Left of M |
| 6     | Red (R)            | Spanish   | Dog    |          | Kools      | Not used  |
| 7     | Yellow (Y)         |           |       | Orange-juice    | Lucky Strike  | Next to K |

Now we can find the missing properties based on the given clues:
1. The Englishman lives in the red house, so English = R. Since Norwegian is already assigned to house 1 and houses are numbered from left to right, the Spanish resident must live in house 6 (R is the only unassigned English).
2. Coffee is drunk in the green house, so Coffee = G. We already know that English = G, which means Spanish can't be the Spaniard because the Spaniard owns a dog and we know the dog owner can't be English or Ukrainian (since there is only one coffee drinker). So let's assume the Japanese resident drinks coffee, as there is no other option for coffee. This leaves the Spaniard with Orange-juice.
3. The Norwegian lives in the first house and the Ukrainian lives next to the blue house, so U = B - 1 = 2 (remembering that houses are numbered from left to right). Since there is only one option for tea drinker, we can assign Tea to the Ukrainian.
4. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house. We know G and I positions already. So, I - 1 = G + 1 means the Ivory house is 3rd from the left (since there are 5 houses in total).
5. Since there is only one middle house with milk drinker, we can assign Milk to the Middle house.
6. The Old Gold smoker owns snails, so O = S (since we already know L = Orange juice). This means the Englishman must smoke old gold cigarettes since the only remaining option for snail owners is Japanese and the Japanese smokes Parliaments.
7. Kools are smoked in the yellow house and a house next to the horse owner, so Y = K (since we already know O = S and L = Orange juice). Since there is only one horse owner left, let's assign Horse to house 5 (Ivy is not possible because the only remaining option for ivory color is Norwegian and he drinks milk).
8. Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice, so L = OJ (we already know that the Japanese smokes Parliaments). Since there are no more options for orange juice drinkers, we can assign Lucky Strike to the yellow house.
9. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house, so B - 1 = N + 1 means the first house is the Norwegian's (since the houses are numbered from left to right). Since there are only two nationalities left for the first house (English and Spanish), let's assume the Englishman lives in the first house. However, we need to check the contradiction caused by this assumption because the Spaniard owns a dog, but the only remaining pet option for English is zebra (since horse is assigned to house 5). But English can't own a zebra because there are no more options left for zebra owners. This means our initial assumption was incorrect, and actually, the Spanish resident lives in the first house and the Englishman lives in the second house.
10. Now we can check if our new arrangement works: English = 2, Spanish = 1, Ukrainian = 2, Japanese = 5, Norwegian = 1 (in this order from left to right). This time everything fits correctly, and there are no contradictions in the arrangement.
11. With this arrangement, Chesterfields can be assigned to the third house since the horse owner lives next to it (Horse = 5, so its neighbor is Chesterfields).
12. Finally, we can check if there are any remaining contradictions: Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse owner, which means the second house should have Kools, but it's already assigned to the Spanish resident who drinks coffee. However, since the only other option for the second house is Lucky Strike (Y = LS), we can move Kools from the yellow house (Y) to the second house (Spanish). Everything fits correctly now without any contradictions.

Finally, let's find where water is: Water is not explicitly mentioned in the given information, but we can infer its position based on the arrangement of nationalities and pets in houses. Since the order of the five residents from left to right is English (2), Spanish (1), Ukrainian (2), Japanese (5), Norwegian (1), this means that water must be drunk by the resident who isn't already assigned a drink, which is the Norweigan (house 1). So, **water:1**

This puzzle was quite tricky due to the contradiction caused by our initial assumption about the Englishman living in the first house. It's essential to carefully check and revise assumptions when solving logic puzzles like this one!"	water:1	water:1	True	True
Zebra_orig_3	" To solve this puzzle, we'll use a table to keep track of the information:

| House Number | Color      | Nationality    | Pet          | Drink         | Cigarette Brand |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1           | Norwegian  | Norweigan     |             |              |                |
| 2           | Blue      |             |            |              |                |
| 3           | Middle    |             | Milk        |              |                |
| 4           | Green     | English       |            | Coffee        |                |
| 5           | Ivory     | Right of 2    |            |              | Old Gold        |

Since the Norwegian lives in the first house, we know that the Japanese can't live there (because only one person per house). So, the Japanese must live in either the blue house (house 2) or the ivory house (house 5). However, if the Japanese lived in the ivory house, then the English would have no place to live. Therefore, the Japanese lives in the blue house (house 2), and the English lives in the house next to the Japanese, which is house 1.

Now we know that the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house. Since there are only three houses left (the remaining houses are 3, 4, and 5), the green house must be either house 3 or 5. If it were house 5, then the green house would be next to the ivory house (which contradicts point 6). Therefore, the green house is house 3.

Now we know that coffee is drunk in the green house, so we can fill in the drink column for house 3 as Coffee. The Ukrainian drinks tea, and since there's only one house left unassigned (house 4), the Ukrainian lives there, and the drink in house 4 is Tea.

Since the Englishman lives in house 1, the Spaniard must live in house 5 because the Englishman can't be next to the Spaniard due to point 11. So the pet for house 5 is the dog. We also know that Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept. Since there are only two remaining unassigned houses (houses 2 and 4), neither of these houses can have the horse as a pet. Therefore, the horse must be in house 3, which means that Kools are smoked in house 5.

Now we know that the Old Gold smoker owns snails. Since there's only one unassigned house left (house 2), the Old Gold smoker lives in house 2, and the pet for house 2 is snails. This also means that the Ukrainian drinks milk because they drink tea, which leaves orange juice as the drink for the remaining unassigned house (house 4).

Since the Norwegian lives next to the blue house, the only unassigned house left is house 5. Therefore, the Norwegian must live in house 5, and since there's no more information about the Norwegian's pet, we can't determine it. However, we do know that the Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice (because the Ukrainian drinks milk), so we can fill in the cigarette brand for house 4 as Lucky-Strike and the drink column for house 4 as Orange Juice.

Now we have:

| House Number | Color      | Nationality    | Pet          | Drink         | Cigarette Brand |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1           | Norwegian  | Norweigan     |             | Water         |                |
| 2           | Blue      | Japanese      | Snails       |              | Old Gold        |
| 3           | Green     | English       | Horse        | Coffee        | Chesterfields  |
| 4           | Ivory     | Ukrainian     |             | Orange Juice   | Lucky-Strike    |
| 5           | Red       | Spanish       | Dog          |              | Kools          |

We still don't know the pet for house 1, but we do know that the drink in house 1 is water. So the answer to your question is: **water: 1**"	water:1	water:1	True	True
