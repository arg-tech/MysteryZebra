Einstein_3domain_replacements_0	" This puzzle can be solved using a combination of deductive reasoning and logic. Here is the solution:

1. First, let's place the people based on their cities (since we know one person per city). Since the Norweigian is on the far left, Liverpool must be on the far right as it is the only city left. So, Liverpool -> Rightmost.
2. Now we have Miami, Venice, Hannover, and Nizza left for 4 people. Let's place them based on their hobbies:
   - Since traveling is a unique hobby and it must be associated with a city (point 5), Traveling->Miami.
   - Similarly, since fishing is a unique hobby (point 8) but we already placed a person with a travel hobby in Miami, so Fishing goes to the remaining city Hannover.
3. Next, let's place people based on their pets:
   - Since dog and cat are unique pets, we can place them now. The Swedish has a dog (point 2), so Dog->Swedish=Leftmost or Middle depending on the arrangement of the cities. For convenience, let's assume it's the leftmost (as we still have to place other pets).
   - Since the cat is on the left or right of the owner of the zombie (point 10), the Cat must be with someone who watches zombie movies. However, we already know that the person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person reading (point 15). Therefore, the person watching zombie movies can't be in the middle due to rule 8. Thus, the cat is placed with the person watching zombie movies, which means the Zombie movies owner must be somewhere to the right of the Dog owner and before Fishing, as we already placed Fish at Hannover.
   - Since there are only two cities remaining for the Person watching comedy movies (as we know the German watches horror movies), Comedy goes to one of the remaining cities, let's assume it's Venice. So, Woodworking -> Venice.
4. Next, let's place people based on their movie genres:
   - Since there are only two cities left for Horror and Comedy, Horror must be at Hannover (as we placed Comedy in Venice). Therefore, the German is at Hannover.
   - Now, since there's only one city left for Western movies, it goes to Nizza (point 7). So, the person watching western movies is at Nizza.
5. Finally, let's place the remaining people based on their hobbies:
   - Since Reading is a unique hobby and we still have an open spot in our arrangement (due to the cat placement), Reading goes to the last position which must be Liverpool. So, Reading -> Liverpool
6. Now that we have all the cities filled, we can easily place pets based on their owners:
   - Since Bird is associated with Documentary movies (point 6), it must go to the person who watches documentaries, which was placed at Hannover due to rule 11. Therefore, Fish -> Hannover.
7. Lastly, since Horse is associated with the person watching comedy movies (which we know is not in Liverpool or Miami due to their respective nationalities), Horse goes to Venice as it's the only remaining city. So, Horse -> Venice.

Einstein_3domain_replacements_1	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. From points 2, 9 and 13, we know that the person traveling to New York can't be the nurse (as it's not in New York), the dressmaker (since it's in Nizza) or the prince-smoker (since it's in Venice). So, the person traveling to New York must be red-liker.

2. The red-liker can't be on the far left (point 9) and can't be the blend-smoker (points 7, 15), so they must be the librarian (as there are only three jobs left: nurse, dancer, and dressmaker).

3. The librarian can't be on the far right as the blend-smoker is on their left or right (point 11), so the librarian is in the middle. That means the person who's birthday is in July is also the librarian (**librarian:3**).

4. The librarian can't be the nurseerman as they are on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker (point 11), and the nurseerman can't be the blend-smoker (points 10, 15), so the nurseerman must be the nurse (**nurse:1**).

5. The nurse can't be on the far right as the blend-smoker is on their left or right (point 15), and the nurse can't be the dancer (as pall-mall smoker is the dancer, so they are not next to each other according to point 6). So, the nurse is on the left of the blend-smoker.

6. The only job left for the person on the far left is the dressmaker (point 9), and the only color left for the dressmaker is green (as the red-liker is already taken, the blue-liker can't be the dressmaker as they are traveling to Venice according to point 13, and the white-liker is on the right of the green-liker according to point 4). So, the dressmaker likes green (**dressmaker:5**).

7. Now we know that the green-liker is the dressmaker and their birthday is in March (point 5). Since the July-birthday person is already known as the librarian, the person with a birthday in May can't be the blend-smoker (as the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the May-birthday person according to point 15). So, the May-birthday person must smoke dunhill (**dunhill-smoker:5**).

8. The only job left for the green-liker (who is also the dressmaker) is the nurseerman, but it contradicts point 6 as the pall-mall smoker can't be next to the nurseerman (the blend-smoker and the nurse are known to be on their left or right of the nurseerman). So, the green-liker can't be the dressmaker. This means there is an error in the puzzle, as it's impossible to determine the dressmaker's color preference based on the given information.

9. Without knowing the dressmaker's favorite color, we can't determine the exact order of people from left to right or their jobs for sure. But we can make some educated guesses:

   - Since the nurse is on the left (point 4), and the green-liker can't be the dressmaker, the nurse must like a color other than red, white, blue, or yellow (as those are already taken). Let's assume the nurse likes green. Then, according to point 14, the person traveling to Prague must also like green as they are on the left or right of the person who likes blue (who is the nurse in this case). This means that Prague-traveler can't be the nurse (as the nurse is already known), so it should be a different color. Let's assume the Prague-traveler likes red.

   - Now we have two people who like green: the librarian and the dressmaker, but we don't know their exact order as they can't both be on the left (points 4, 9). One possible solution could be: librarian-green, dressmaker-unknown, nurse-green, Prague-red, San Francisco-February, New York-red, Nizza-dressmaker, Venice-prince.

10. However, this solution doesn't satisfy point 6 as the pall-mall smoker (the dancer) would be on the left of the nurseerman in this case, which contradicts the given information. So, there seems to be a logical error in the puzzle that prevents us from determining the exact order and positions of all people based on the provided information."	nurse:4	nurse:1	False	True
Einstein_3domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction:

Let's start by finding out who prefers which genre:
1. Metal - April
2. Country - Not known yet, but it's not September (6) and it's not July (9), so it must be either JUne or December. Let's denote C as the month of country.
3. Salsa - September (4)
4. Indie - July (14)
5. Soul - Known to be a photographer (7)

Let's find out who drinks which beverage:
6. Tea - June (3)
7. Milk - Middle (8)
8. Beer - Teacher (12), so it can only be December
9. Coffee - Country (5), so C = December
10. Water - Not known yet

Now let's find the jobs:
11. Bird - Musician (6), so the music-officer lives next to the bird owner, which means the police-officer can't be on the left of the photographer (11). So the police-officer is the fan of Indie (4) and he is in December (13).
12. Teacher - Beer (12), so it must be December
13. Paramedic - Not known yet, but it's not on the left or right of the person drinking water (15). Also, it can't be next to the cat owner (10) and it can't be on the left of the photographer (11), so it must be on the far right.
14. The remaining job is the photographer (7), as we know he drinks tea (6) and he can't be on the left or right of the police-officer (11). So he must be in June.
15. Now we know the paramedic is on the far right, so the person drinking water must be on the left, making him the owner of the horse (as he can't be a pet owner if he's in December, as it's already taken by the teacher and police-officer).
16. The remaining pet owners are September (dog) and January or February (cat), but we know the cat owner is on the left of the paramedic (10), so the cat owner must be either JUne or July, but as JUne has already been taken by the photographer, it must be July.
17. So the cat owner is also the fan of Indie (4) and he is in July (9).

Now we know all the information:
- The person who's birthday is April likes metal
- The person who's birthday is September owns a dog
- The person who's birthday is June drinks tea
- The fan of country is on the left of the fan of salsa and he drinks coffee
- The musician owns a bird
- The fan of soul is the photographer
- The person drinking milk is in the middle
- The person who's birthday is July is on the far left and also the fan of indie
- The paramedic is on the far right
- The person who's birthday is December is a teacher and a police-officer
- The person who's birthday is July is on the left or right of the fan of indie
- The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the photographer
- The person drinking beer is a teacher
- The person who's birthday is in January or February is the cat owner

Since we know all the information, we can find out where the fish lives. We know that the only month left for the fan of country and drinker of water is JAnuary or February. Since we also know the pet owners, it means that January or February can't be a pet owner as well, so they must be the drinkers of water.

**fish: Not applicable in this puzzle since there are no empty positions left for pet owners.**"	fish:4	NA	False	False
