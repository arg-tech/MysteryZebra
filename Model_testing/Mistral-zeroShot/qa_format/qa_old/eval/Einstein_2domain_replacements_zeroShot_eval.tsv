Einstein_2domain_replacements_0	" This puzzle requires a systematic approach to solve it. Let's start by finding some initial information:

1. We know that there are five different nationalities, houses, favorite colors, etc., so each of these categories must be assigned exactly once.
2. The palace is in the middle (position 3), and the norwegian is on the far left or position 1. Since we have 5 positions, this implies the norwegian occupies the first position.
3. From point 4 and point 5, we know that green is next to white, and green is a townhouse. The only available positions for these conditions are (2,4) or (2,5). Let's assume it's (2,4) because if it were (2,5), the townhouse would be in position 1 which contradicts the fact that norwegian is in position 1.
4. Now let's see who smokes pall-mall and eats onion: from point 6, the pall-mall-smoker eats onion, so we need to find someone eating onion. Since onions are in positions 2 (green) or 4 (eggplant), let's assume it's position 4 for now (we will verify later if it makes sense).
5. Now let's see who smokes bluemaster, lives in a cottage: from point 12, the bluemaster-smoker is the cottage house. Since cottages are in positions 1, 4, or 5, let's assume it's position 1 for now (we will verify later if it makes sense).
6. From point 7, the person who likes yellow smokes dunhill, so we need to find a person smoking dunhill and whose favorite color is not yet assigned. The only available candidate is the person in position 5 because positions 2, 4, and 3 have colors already assigned (green, eggplant, white).
7. Now let's see who smokes pall-mall and lives in a tower: from point 10, the pall-mall-smoker is either on the left or right of the person eating lemon. Since position 4 has already been occupied by someone else (eggplant), the only available candidates for the person eating lemon are positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's assume it's position 2 (green) because if it were position 1 or 3, it would contradict the fact that the pall-mall-smoker is on the left or right of the person eating lemon.
8. From point 9, the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the modern house: since positions 2 and 4 have been occupied, the only available positions for the modern house are positions 1 and 5. Let's assume it's position 1 because if it were position 5, it would contradict the fact that the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the modern house.
9. From point 13, the german smokes prince: since there are only 5 brands of cigars, and positions 2 (green), 4 (eggplant) and 1 (bluemaster) have cigar brands assigned already, the only available position for the german is position 5.
10. From point 14, the norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue: since positions 1, 2, and 3 have colors already assigned (norwegian, green, lemon), and position 5 has been occupied by the german, the only available positions for the person liking blue are positions 4 (eggplant) and 5. Since the norwegian cannot be in position 5 (as already explained), let's assume it's position 4 (eggplant).
11. Now we can verify our assumptions: if green is in position 2, the pall-mall smoker is in position 4 eating onion, bluemaster smokes in position 1, and the german smokes prince in position 5. This satisfies all given conditions except point 6, which requires the pall-mall smoker to be on the left or right of the person eating lemon. Since our current arrangement puts them as next to each other (positions 2 and 4), we need to swap green and eggplant's positions: so green is in position 4 and eggplant is in position 2.
12. With this change, all conditions are now satisfied, and the final arrangement is as follows:
    - Position 1: norwegian (eats blue), bluemaster smoker, lives in a cottage
    - Position 2: swedish (eats eggplant), pall-mall smoker
    - Position 3: palace house
    - Position 4: green (eats onion), blend smoker
    - Position 5: german (smokes prince)

Now let's find the location of lime. Since we know that green is in position 4, and green is to the left of white, the only available position for white is position 5. So the final answer is **lime:5**."	lime:4	lime:5	False	True
Einstein_2domain_replacements_1	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's use a table to represent the information:

| Color | Sport  | Beverage | Cigar Brand | Birthday Month | Position (L/M/R) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Blue   |      |          |            |               | L or R        |
| Green | Tennis | Coffee    | Dunhill     | April         | L              |
| Red   | Skateboarding | Tea    | Pall-Mall   | June          | M              |
| White | Snowboarding | Milk  | Blend       | January       | S             |
| Yellow| Soccer    | Water     | Prince      | February      | L or R         |
|      | Parkour   | Beer      | Bluemaster  | November      | L or R         |

From the puzzle statements, we can deduce the following:
1. The person who's sport is tennis is the person who likes red (Green is Red's left neighbor and Green drinks Coffee). So Red = Tennis.
2. The person who's sport is snowboarding is the person who's birthday is in January (The pall-mall-smoker is the person whose birthday is in April, so Snowboarding cannot be April). Thus, Snowboarding = January.
3. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person drinking tea (Since the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water and the person who likes green is the person drinking coffee, Skateboarding cannot be Green or Coffee). So Skateboarding = Tea.
4. The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white (Green is Red's left neighbor, so Green cannot be Red). Thus, Position of White = Right (Since Green is to its left, and the only other position left is the middle which is already occupied by the skateboarder, so it must be on the right.)
5. The person who likes green is the person drinking coffee (As deduced earlier from points 3 and 4). So Coffee = Green.
6. The pall-mall-smoker is the person who's birthday is in April (as deduced earlier). So Pall-Mall = April.
7. The person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker (As deduced later from points 11 and 13). So Yellow = Dunhill.
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (Since Green, Red, and White have been placed already, leaving only the skateboarder as an option for the middle position). Thus, Milk = Skateboarding.
9. The person who's sport is parkour is on the far left (Since Soccer cannot be April and it cannot be on the right of the dunhill-smoker, so Parkour must be on the leftmost position). So Parkour = January.
10. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in february (Since Snowboarding, Soccer, Skateboarding, and Milk have been placed already, leaving only the blend-smoker as an option for this condition). So Blend = February or March.
11. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker (Since Green, Red, White, and Yellow have been placed already, leaving only the Blend smoker as an option for this condition). However, since Blend cannot be on the far left (as Parkour is already there), it must be on the right of Dunhill. Thus, Blend = March or May.
12. The bluemaster-smoker is the person drinking beer (As deduced later from points 13 and 14). So Beer = Bluemaster.
13. The person who's sport is soccer is the prince-smoker (Since Soccer cannot be April and it cannot be on the right of the dunhill-smoker, so Soccer must be Prince. Also, since the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water, which can only be in January if parkour is there, Soccer cannot be Parkour either.) So Soccer = Prince.
14. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the person who likes blue (Since Blue cannot be April and it cannot be on the far right since Snowboarding is already there, so Parkour must be to the left of Blue). However, since Soccer has been placed already, it cannot be in this position. Since there are only two positions left for parkour, it must be either February or November (as May and June are already taken by Blend and Tea respectively). But if Parkour was February, then Blend would have to be March as per condition 10, which contradicts the fact that Blend is on the right of Dunhill (who's birthday is in April) as per condition 11. Thus, June = November.

So, **June:November** is the correct answer."	june:4	NA	False	False
Einstein_2domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down and find out the information systematically:

1. We know the british likes red, so we can place the red color with the British nationality (let's call it B).
2. The swedish plays cricket, so we have Sweden (S) playing Cricket (C).
3. The Danish drinks tea, so Denmark (D) is associated with Tea (T).
4. From points 4 and 7, the green color (G) can't be on the right of white since green travels to Edinburgh (E), but we know from point 1 that the British likes red which comes before white in the spectrum (red is on the left of white), so green must be on the left of white. Now we have G < W (green is to the left of white).
5. From points 4 and 5, the person who likes green drinks coffee, so Coffee (K) is associated with the left side of white (G < W).
6. The person playing climbing travels to Venice (V), so we have Climbing (Cl) associated with V.
7. We don't have enough information yet to determine the yellow color (Y).
8. The middle position is taken by Milk (M).
9. The norwegian is on the far left, and since the British is not on the far left, the Norwegian must be to the left of B but not D (as we know D < G) or M (since M is in the middle). So N comes before B and neither D nor G.
10. From points 10 and 7, the person traveling to london (L) should be on the left or right of Lacrosse (La), but since we don't have any other information about the position of Lacrosse yet, we can only determine that L is not in the middle.
11. From points 11 and 7, Skateboarding (Sk) is on the left or right of E but not L.
12. The person drinking beer travels to New-York (NY), so Beer (Be) goes with NY.
13. From points 13 and 10, we know the German (Ger) travels to Liverpool (Li).
14. Since N is on the left or right of B (not D or M) and neither is in the positions 2nd or 3rd from the left (since M is in the middle), N must be in position 1 or 4 (the far left, but not the 1st, since B and D are already taken). Now we know that B < N.
15. From points 15 and 10, L should be on the left or right of Water (Wa), but since we don't have any other information about Wa yet, we can only determine that L is not in the middle.

Now let's analyze the remaining positions:
- The position to the right of NY must contain either Cl, La, or Sk, but it can't be Cl (as it's traveling to Venice), so it can be either La or Sk. But since we don't have any other information about their positions yet, we can't determine whether La or Sk is there.
- The position to the right of L should contain Wa or T, but not M as it's in the middle. We still don't have enough information to place Wa and T.
- Since the position to the left of Li must contain Ger, and we know Ger can't be in positions 1, 2, 3 (since B, N, and M are already taken), Ger should be in position 4 or 5. But since B < N, Ger can't be in position 5. So Ger is in position 4.
- The position to the left of Ger must contain either C, K, or La (as we now know that Sk and Cl are on the right side). We don't have enough information yet to determine their positions.
- The position to the left of E should contain Y and G. Since we know that G < W, and Y can't be in position 1 since N is there, Y must be in position 2. So Y is in position 2.
- Since La or Sk should be on the right side of E, and Sk is not in position 6 (since Cl is traveling to Venice), La should be in position 6. Now we know that La is climbing.
- The position to the left of D must contain B. As B can't be in position 1 or 3 (since N and Ger are already placed), B must be in position 5.

Now let's examine the remaining positions:
- Since Wa or T should be on the left side of L, if Wa was in position 1, it would conflict with Y in position 2. So Wa is in position 3. Now we know that Wa is water.
- The position to the left of Wa must contain T or C, but not M as it's in the middle. Since Ger is already placed, if C was there, it would conflict with the rule that German plays ice hockey (as Ice Hockey (Ih) hasn't been placed yet). So T should be in position 1. Now we know that Denmark drinks tea.
- The position to the left of T must contain either Ih or La (since La is climbing). Since La is already placed, Ih should be there. Now we know that Ice Hockey is played by the Danish person.

The final arrangement looks like this:
[N] [B] [T] [Ger] [Ih] [La] [Wa] [D] [Cl] [M] [Sk] [Y] [Be] [L] [V] [E] [NY]

So the location of Ice Hockey (Ih) is **ice-hockey:4**."	ice-hockey:4	ice-hockey:4	True	True
