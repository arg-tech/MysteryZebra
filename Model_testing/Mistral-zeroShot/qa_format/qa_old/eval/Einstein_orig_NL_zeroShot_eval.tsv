Einstein_orig_NL_1	" To solve this puzzle, let's use a combination of deductive reasoning and creating hypotheses for each variable. We will assign numbers to the five positions (1-5 from left to right) and find the value for each variable based on the given clues.

Let's start with colors:
1 - blue or white (clue 14)
2 - green (clue 5, 4)
3 - milk (clue 8), which means this person cannot be drinking tea (clue 2), coffee (clue 5), water (no given clue), or beer (no given clue). Since the only remaining option is white, we have:
   - 1: blue or white
   - 2: green
   - 3: white

Let's proceed with nationalities:
Since the norwegian is on the far left (clue 9), then:
   - 5: norwegian

Now we know that the swedish owns a dog, which means they can't be on the far left (clue 6), so they must be on positions 1 or 2. Since the norwegian is already at position 5, the swedish must be at position 1:
   - 1: british (since the british likes red and it must be one of the first three colors) or swedish
   - 2: green
   - 3: white
   - 4: unassigned
   - 5: norwegian

Now we have a bit more information about pets: the bird owner smokes pall-mall (clue 6), and the pall-mall smoker cannot be on the far left (clue 10, since the blend smoker is next to or far from the cat owner). Since the norwegian is already at position 5 and the swedish is at position 1, the only remaining position for the bird owner is 2. This means the swedish owns a dog and the british owns a bird:
   - 1: swedish (since we know the swedish drinks neither tea nor coffee)
   - 2: green, pall-mall smoker
   - 3: white
   - 4: unassigned
   - 5: norwegian

Let's continue with beverages: the person drinking milk is at position 3, so no one else can drink milk. Since the danish drinks tea (clue 2), they must be on a different position than 3. This leaves us with four possible positions for the remaining drinks: beer, coffee, water, and undefined.

Now let's work on cigars:
   - The bluemaster smoker cannot be on the far left (clue 10), so it must be at positions 2, 3, or 4. Since the pall-mall smoker is already at position 2, and we know that no one drinks milk in those positions, the only option is beer (clue 12). This means the bluemaster smoker likes blue and drinks beer:
      - 1: swedish, tea drinker
      - 2: green, pall-mall smoker
      - 3: white, milk drinker (unassigned)
      - 4: unassigned (bluemaster smoker or undefined)
      - 5: norwegian
   - The dunhill smoker cannot be on the far left or right of the cat owner (clue 10, 11), so it must be at positions 2, 3, or 4. Since we know that the bluemaster smoker drinks beer, and no one can drink milk in those positions, there are only two possible options: coffee and water. Considering the dunhill smoker is mentioned later (clue 7), they must be at position 4 or 5. Also, the blend smoker cannot be on the left or right of the dunhill smoker (clue 15), so the dunhill smoker must be at position 4 and the blend smoker is at position 3:
      - 1: swedish, tea drinker
      - 2: green, pall-mall smoker
      - 3: undefined (blend smoker)
      - 4: coffee or water, dunhill smoker
      - 5: norwegian

At this point, we know that position 1 is a tea drinker and position 3 is a milk drinker. Since the only remaining options for drinks are beer, coffee, water, and undefined, the person at position 4 must be drinking either coffee or water. We also know that the german smokes prince (clue 13), which means they can't be on the far left (clue 10) nor in the middle (clue 8). Since the only remaining positions for the prince-smoker are 2, 4, and 5, the person at position 4 must be drinking coffee to make room for the german smoker. So now we know that position 4 drinks coffee:
   - 1: swedish, tea drinker
   - 2: green, pall-mall smoker
   - 3: white, milk drinker (unassigned)
   - 4: coffee, german (since the prince is smoked by the german and the blend is next to or far from the dunhill)
   - 5: norwegian

Now we can easily find out who drinks beer: since the only remaining option is position 2 (clue 12), and we know that it cannot be a milk drinker or a tea drinker, then the green owner must like blue and drink beer:
   - 1: swedish, tea drinker
   - 2: blue, green, bluemaster smoker
   - 3: white, milk drinker (unassigned)
   - 4: coffee, german
   - 5: norwegian

Finally, we have a complete setup, so let's identify the pets:
- The bird owner is at position 2 (pall-mall smoker), and since no one else can own a bird, it must be the green pet. So the green is the bird.
- Since the blend smoker is next to or far from the cat owner (clue 10), the only remaining positions for the cat are 1, 4, or 5. Since we already know that position 2 is occupied by a bird and position 3 is a milk drinker (unassigned), the only option left is position 1. This means the british owns a cat:
   - 1: british, red, tea drinker, pet:cat
   - 2: blue, green, bluemaster smoker, bird
   - 3: white, milk drinker (unassigned)
   - 4: coffee, german
   - 5: norwegian, pet:unassigned

However, without more information about the position of the undefined milk drinker, we cannot definitively assign the fish to a specific position. But we can say that since the remaining options for pets are dog, cat, bird, fish, and horse, the fish must be one of positions 3 or 5: **fish:3 or fish:5**."	fish:4	fish:5	False	True
Einstein_orig_NL_2	" To solve this puzzle, let's first make a table and assign numbers to each variable (color, nationality, beverage, cigar brand, pet). Then we will use the given clues to eliminate possibilities and find the unique solutions.

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (british)   | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat)    |
| 2 (green)  | 3 (danish)    | 4 (coffee) | 3 (pall-mall)  | 1 (bird)   |
| 3 (red)    | 5 (swedish)   | 2 (milk)  | 2 (dunhill) | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  |              | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)  | 5 (horse)  |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)   | 2 (fish)   |

From clue 1, the british likes red, so we know that 3 = british. We can fill in the table like this:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (british)   | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat)    |
| 2 (green)  | 3 (danish)    | 4 (coffee) | 3 (pall-mall)  | 1 (bird)   |
| 3 (red)    | 5 (swedish)   | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  |              | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)  | 5 (horse)  |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)   | 2 (fish)   |

From clue 3, the swedish is the owner of the dog, so we know that 5 = swedish. We can fill in the table like this:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (british)   | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat)    |
| 2 (green)  | 3 (danish)    | 4 (coffee) | 3 (pall-mall)  | 1 (bird)   |
| 3 (red)    | 5 (swedish)   | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  |              | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)  | 5 (horse)  |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)   | 2 (fish)   |

From clue 4, the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Since we know that green and white are 2 and 4 respectively, this implies that 2 < 4 (in our numbering system). Also, since the nationalities are numbered from 1 to 5, the norwegian (1) must be on the far left (clue 9), so the only possible arrangement is:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  | 1 (norwegian)  | 4 (coffee) | 3 (pall-mall)| 1 (bird)   |
| 4 (white)  |              | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)| 5 (horse)  |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 2 (fish)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 1 (blue)   |              | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat)    |

From clue 5, the person who likes green is the person drinking coffee. Since we already know that 2 = green and 1 (bird) = coffee, this is consistent with our arrangement.

From clue 6, the pall-mall smoker is the owner of the bird. Since we already know that 3 (pall-mall) = pall-mall smoker and 1 (bird) = owner of the bird, this is consistent with our arrangement.

From clue 7, the person who likes yellow is the dunhill smoker. Since we don't have a yellow yet, we cannot solve this clue now.

From clue 8, the person drinking milk is in the middle. Since there are only 5 options for nationalities and we already placed 4 of them, the only possible position for the milk drinker is in the middle (clue 15 also implies that the milk drinker cannot be on either end). This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  | 1 (norwegian)  | 4 (coffee)| 3 (pall-mall)| 1 (bird)   |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 2 (fish)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish)    | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)| 5 (horse)  |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish)   | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat)    |

From clue 9, the blend smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since we already know that 4 (cat) = cat and there are only two empty spaces left for the blend smoker, it can only be on the left or right of the danish (2). This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  | 1 (norwegian)  | 4 (coffee)| 3 (pall-mall)| 1 (bird)   |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 2 (fish)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish)    | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)| 5 (horse)  |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish)   | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, left of blend smoker if blend is on the right) |

From clue 10, the dunhill smoker cannot be a milk drinker. Since we already know that the milk drinker is in the middle and the only empty position for the dunhill smoker is next to the milk drinker (since they can't be at either end), this implies that the dunhill smoker must be a water drinker (4). This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  | 1 (norwegian)  | 4 (coffee)| 3 (pall-mall)| 1 (bird)   |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 2 (fish)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)| 5 (horse)  |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish)   | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, left of blend smoker if blend is on the right) |

From clue 11, the bluemaster cannot be a milk drinker. Since we already know that the milk drinker is in the middle and the only empty position for the bluemaster is next to the milk drinker (since they can't be at either end), this implies that the bluemaster must be a beer drinker (1). This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  | 1 (norwegian)  | 4 (coffee)| 3 (pall-mall)| 1 (bird)   |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 2 (fish)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)| 5 (horse)  |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, left of blend smoker if blend is on the right) |

From clue 12, since the norwegian likes coffee and we know that the only coffee drinker is the bird owner (clue 6), the norwegian cannot be the bird owner. This means that the bird owner must be one of the remaining nationalities. Since we already placed all nationalities except for the swedish, this implies that the bird owner is the swedish (5). This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              | 4 (coffee)| 3 (pall-mall)| 5 (swedish, bird owner)   |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 2 (fish)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)| 5 (horse)  |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, left of blend smoker if blend is on the right) |

From clue 13, since we already placed the bird owner and the only remaining nationality is the swedish, the cat must be on the right of the blend smoker. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              | 4 (coffee)| 3 (pall-mall)| 5 (swedish, bird owner)   |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 2 (fish)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)| 5 (horse)  |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, on the right of blend smoker) |

From clue 14, since we know that the bird owner is the swedish and the cat is on the right of the blend smoker, we can determine the order of the remaining pets. The horse must be to the left of the cat because it can't be to the right (since the cat is already there). This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              | 4 (coffee)| 3 (pall-mall)| 5 (swedish, bird owner)   |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 5 (horse), 2 (fish)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)|          |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, on the right of blend smoker) |

From clue 15, since we know that the horse is to the left of the cat and the only remaining pet is the fish, the fish must be to the right of the horse. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              | 4 (coffee)| 3 (pall-mall)| 5 (swedish, bird owner)   |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 5 (horse), 2 (fish, right of horse)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)|          |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, on the right of blend smoker) |

From clue 16, since we know that the horse is to the left of the cat and the fish is to the right of the horse, we can determine the nationalities. The swedish is the bird owner, so it must be one of the remaining two nationalities (danish or green). Since the only remaining pet is the fish, which is on the right side, and the only remaining position for a nationality is to the left of the blend smoker, this implies that the danish must be to the left of the blend smoker. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              | 4 (coffee)| 3 (pall-mall)|          |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 5 (horse), 2 (fish, right of horse)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)|          |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, on the right of blend smoker) |

From clue 17, since we know that the danish is to the left of the blend smoker and there's only one nationality left (green), the green must be to the right of the blend smoker. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 5 (horse), 2 (fish, right of horse)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)|          |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, on the right of blend smoker), 2 (green, on the right of blend smoker) |

From clue 18, since we know that the green is to the right of the blend smoker and there's only one nationality left without a pet (danish), the danish must have the dog. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 5 (horse), 2 (fish, right of horse)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog), 2 (danish)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)|          |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, on the right of blend smoker), 2 (green, on the right of blend smoker) |

From clue 19, since we know that the green is to the right of the blend smoker and there's only one pet left without a nationality (fish), the fish must have the horse. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 5 (fish, right of horse), 2 (horse, left of fish)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog), 2 (danish)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)|          |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat, on the right of blend smoker), 2 (green, on the right of blend smoker) |

From clue 20, since we know that the fish is to the right of the horse and there's only one nationality left without a pet (horse), the horse must have the cat. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 5 (horse, left of fish), 2 (fish, right of horse)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog), 2 (danish)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)| 4 (cat, on the horse), 2 (horse, left of fish) |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)|          |

From clue 21, since we know that the horse is to the left of the fish and there's only one nationality left without a pet (cat), the cat must have the prince. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |
| 5 (yellow) |              |          | 4 (blend)  | 5 (horse, left of fish), 2 (fish, right of horse)   |
| 3 (red)    |              | 2 (milk)  |           | 3 (dog), 2 (danish), 4 (cat)    |
| 4 (white)  | 2 (danish, water drinker) | 5 (water)| 1 (prince)|          |
| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat), 2 (horse, left of fish), 2 (fish, right of horse), 3 (dog) |

From clue 22, since we know that the prince is with the cat and there's only one nationality left without a pet (blend), the blend must have the pall-mall. This gives us:

From clue 23, since we know that the pall-mall is with the blend and there's only one nationality left without a pet (horse), the horse must have been the missing pet. This gives us:

| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |

From clue 28, since we know that the missing pet is the fish and there's only one nationality left without a pet, the missing nationality must be horse. This gives us:

| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat), 2 (fish, left of horse), 3 (dog) |

From clue 29, since we know that the missing pet is horse and there's only one nationality left without a pet, the missing nationality must be fish. This gives us:

From clue 30, since we know that the missing beverage is milk and there's only one nationality left without a pet, the missing pet must be the dog. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |

| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat), 2 (horse, left of fish), 3 (dog) |

From clue 31, since we know that the missing nationality is dog and there's only one pet left without a nationality, the missing nationality must be cat. This gives us:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |

| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (cat), 2 (horse, left of fish), 4 (dog) |

From clue 32, since we know that the missing nationality is cat and there's only one pet left without a nationality, the missing nationality must be prince. This gives us:

|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |

| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (dog), 2 (horse, left of fish), 4 (cat) |

Finally, from clue 33, since we know that the missing nationality is prince and there's no more pets to assign, we have solved the puzzle. The final arrangement is:

| Colors     | Nationalities  | Beverages | Cigars     | Pets        |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2 (green)  |              |          | 3 (pall-mall)|          |

| 1 (blue)   | 5 (swedish, beer drinker) | 3 (beer)  | 5 (bluemaster)| 4 (dog), 2 (horse, left of fish), 4 (cat) |"	fish:4	NA	False	False
Einstein_orig_NL_3	" This is a complex logic puzzle, but let's solve it step by step:

1. From points 5 and 6, we know that the green-lover (Coffee) owns the bird.
2. From point 7, we know that the yellow-lover (Dunhill) smokes cigars.
3. Since the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (from points 10 and 14), and the green-lover (Coffersonally owns a bird, which is not a pet that can be kept with a cat), the blend-smoker cannot be next to the cat owner. Therefore, the cat owner must smoke either Bluemaster or Pall-mall.
4. Since the pall-mall smoker owns the bird (point 6), the cat owner smokes Bluemaster. Now we know that the cat is on the right of the Dunhill-smoker, as per point 10.
5. From point 8, we know that the milk drinker is in the middle. Since the cat and bird are already placed, the only remaining pets are fish, horse, and dog. The dog is owned by the Swede (point 2), so the middle position cannot be a pet. Therefore, the milk drinker must be a nationality other than British, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, or German.
6. From point 9, we know that the Norwegian is on the far left. Since the cat and blend are already placed on the right, the only remaining positions for Norway are the first and third from the left. However, since the blend-smoker cannot be next to the cat (point 10), the Norwegian must be on the third position from the left. This means that the person who drinks water is on the far left (Norwegian).
7. From points 2, 9, and 14, we know that the Swede (dog owner) is to the right of the Norwegian (water drinker), and both are to the left of the German (Prince smoker from point 13). This means that all nationalities are placed except for the British.
8. Since the milk drinker cannot be a pet owner (point 5), the only remaining options for the milk drinker are blue, green, red, white, and yellow. However, since the green-lover is already placed (Coffee drinker with Bird), the milk drinker cannot like green. Similarly, since the British is the person who likes red (point 1), the milk drinker cannot be British.
9. Since the blend-smoker cannot be next to the cat owner (point 10) and the Norwegian is on the third position from the left (point 6), the only remaining option for the blend-smoker is the fifth position from the left, as the fourth position must be a pet.
10. From points 15 and 9, we know that the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the water drinker (Norwegian). Since the cat and bird are already placed, the only remaining positions for blend are second and fourth from the left. However, since the second position must be a pet (the first position is occupied by Norway), the blend-smoker must be in the fourth position from the left.
11. From point 11, we know that the horse owner is on the left or right of the Dunhill-smoker. Since both the cat and bird are already placed, the only remaining options for horse are the second and fifth positions from the left. However, since the fourth position is occupied by blend, the horse can only be in the second position from the left.
12. From point 4, we know that the person who likes green (Coffee drinker with Bird) is on the left of the white-lover. Since the blend-smoker and horse owner are already placed to the left of the Dunhill-smoker, the only remaining position for the white-lover is the third from the right.
13. Since the milk drinker cannot be a pet owner (point 5), the only remaining option for the milk drinker is blue or red. However, since the British is the person who likes red (point 1), and we already know that the British cannot be the milk drinker, the milk drinker must like blue.
14. Since the horse owner is in the second position from the left (point 11), the only remaining position for the dog is the fourth from the right (as per point 2). This means that the Swede drinks water.
15. Since the Norwegian drinks water, and since Norway is on the third position from the left (point 6), the only remaining position for the British is the fifth from the right (as per points 1, 13, and 14).
16. Finally, we know that the British likes red (point 1) and drinks beer (point 12). Therefore, **fish:1** (The first person is the fish owner)."	fish:4	fish:1	False	True
