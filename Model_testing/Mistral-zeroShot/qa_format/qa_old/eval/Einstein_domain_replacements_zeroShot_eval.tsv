Einstein_5domain_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a systematic approach to assign each attribute to a person (Transport, Music-genre, House type, Job, Birthday month) one by one. Here's my solution:

1. Trance: train
2. Reggae: September (Let's call this Person A)
3. Rock: palace (Since the subway is to the left of the snowmobile and both have already been assigned, it means they cannot be rock or reggae.)
4. Subway: Let's say B, so Snowmobile = C
5. Since Gothic-revival house is in the middle (House type: G), and we know Quad-bike, Motorbike, Train, Subway, Snowmobile are left to right, it means the house with remaining transports (except for motorbike) should be in the following order: B, C, Q, T.
6. Architect is May (Job: D). Since Gothic-revival house cannot be D (as it's in the middle), this leaves us with Quad-bike, Motorbike, Train, Snowmobile.
7. Mechanic is Quad-bike, since the architect cannot have a transport other than Gothic-revival house (Jobs: Q).
8. This leaves Motorbike and Train for the remaining transports, as both are left to right (T, M).
9. Folk: Since we already know that folk is not on the far left (Folk cannot be leftmost in the transport order), it must be either between the librarian or the person who's birthday is in june. But based on the fact that the fan of ambient, bartender, cannot be on the left of the motorbike driver, the only possible place for Folk would be to the left of June.
10. Given that the librarian is on the left or right of June (Let's say Librarian = E), there are two possibilities: T-F-E-M or M-F-E-T. Based on the fact that February cannot be on the far right, the correct order should be T-F-E-M.
11. Now we know the transport order (T, F, E, M). This means the motorbike driver is not in july (Transport: T). Let's say this person's birthday is June (Person B)
12. Since Motorbikemaster cannot have a house other than ranch-style (House: R), we already know the remaining houses (G, F, E, M). This leaves us with no more available places for February (The only remaining birthdays are April, August, October, and November)
13. Ambient: Bartender (Ambient is not on the left of the motorbike driver, so it cannot be Librarian or June. And since it cannot be on the far right, it must be in the middle between Gothic-revival house and February.)
14. We know that the librarian is to the left or right of the futuristic house (Let's say K). But if we assign Librarian as June, there will not be enough places for the remaining 3 people (Ambient, Reggae, and January/August/October/November)
15. Since Futuristic house is rightmost (H: F), and January/August/October/November are left to librarian, the only possibility left for January would be on the far left, which means Reggae must be in September (Person A).

Now we have all the attributes assigned. Here's the final arrangement:

- Transport: Train (Trance), Subway (B), Snowmobile (C), Quad-bike (Mechanic), Motorbike (June)
- Music genres: Trance, Reggae (Sept.), Rock (Palace), Ambient (Bartender), Folk (Far left of June)
- House types: Ranch-style (Motorbikemaster), Wooden (Subway), Gothic-revival (Architect), Futuristic (Librarian, right of February), Palace (Rock)
- Jobs: Motorbikemaster, Mechanic (Quad-bike), Architect (May), Bartender (Ambient), Librarian (Left or Right of June), Far left (Folk)
- Birthday months: June (June), September (Reggae), May (Architect), February (January), July (Not assigned yet)

Since January is assigned to the far left and we already have a person there, February cannot be in January. As for now, we don't know where February is placed. We only know it's not on the far left or right. However, since we know that Reggae (Sept.) and Librarian (Far right of Feb) are assigned, we can eliminate July as a birthday month for the librarian. The only remaining birthdays for the librarian are April, August, October, and November. This means February must be in one of those months:

Einstein_5domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down and try to find connections between variables.

1. Let's start with music genres. Since we know the fan of pop travels to Venice, we can assign pop to Venice's person (V). Now, since we know the fan of disco is playing chess (C), we can assign disco to C. The remaining three genres are assigned to the remaining persons in an arbitrary way: funk (F), blues (B), and techno (T) in some order.

2. Next, let's look at sports. We know that the person traveling to Paris plays lacrosse (L). Since we know that the person playing backgammon is the goerman (G), we can assign backgammon to G. The remaining three sports are assigned to the remaining persons in an arbitrary way: swimming (S), biathlon (Bi), and cycling (Cy) in some order.

3. Let's move on to jobs. Since we know that the person traveling to London is the architect (A), we can assign architecture to A. The remaining four jobs are assigned to the remaining persons in an arbitrary way: teacher (T), dressmaker (D), entrepreneur (E), and goerman (G) in some order.

4. Now, let's look at games. Since the person playing scrabble is on the left or right of A (the architect), we know that either A plays scrabble or the person next to A plays scrabble. However, since we have no other information about where A and scrabble are located, it's impossible to assign this game definitively at this point. Similarly, since the dressmaker is on the left or right of the person playing whist (W) and the person who's sport is cycling, we cannot determine these games either.

5. Let's look at some other relationships:
   - The fan of techno is on the far left (T is assigned already).
   - The fan of blues is the entrepreneur (E), so E cannot be the teacher since T is on the far left, and the teacher plays swimming which can only be the first or last position. Therefore, E must be in the middle, making the teacher the first person.
   - The teacher is the person who's sport is swimming, meaning S is in the first position. However, since we know that the fan of techno is on the far left (S cannot be the far left), it means S is second, and T must be the first (which we already determined).
   - The person traveling to paris is on the left of the person traveling to nizza (P < N). However, since we know that L (lacrosse) is played by the person traveling to Paris, it means P cannot be the last position. Since the teacher is the first and the fan of techno is second, P must be in the third position.
   - The person playing chess is a disco fan (C = D). Since we know that F plays parkour, C cannot be the last position, so C must be in the fourth position. This also means N cannot be the last position either, as we already determined P is not last and N is to the right of P.
   - Now we have: [T (S), V (P), C (D), F (N), A (G)]. However, since we know that the goerman plays backgammon (G = B), it means G cannot be the last position, so G must be in the fifth position.
   - Finally, we have: [T (S), V (P), C (D), F (N), A (G)]. However, since we know that the dressmaker is on the left or right of the person playing whist (W), and since W cannot be the first or last position, it means W must be in the third position. But this would place V next to W, contradicting that the fan of pop is the person traveling to Venice. This creates a loop in the puzzle as there's no logical solution with these constraints.

Unfortunately, based on the given constraints, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle, making it impossible to determine the location of ""go"". It appears that either some constraints are incorrect or missing, or there might have been an error while creating the puzzle."	go:4	NA	False	False
Einstein_5domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From rule 6, we know that the person eating climbing (climber) is on a boat. Since there are only three people left to place (handball, skiing, and rugby), let's assume that handball or skiing drives the boat for now.
2. From rule 7, we know that the blueberry eater drives the car, so they can't be handball or skiing since the boat is taken. Therefore, handball must drive either the train, airplane, or trike.
3. Since the indie fan is in the middle (rule 8), we have placed three people on the left side of the seating arrangement. As a result, the person driving the train (jazz fan) is on the rightmost side, so handball can't be the jazz fan.
4. Now let's examine rule 12 and place the jazz fan on the train since there are no more left options for handball or skiing to drive.
5. From rule 10, we know that the trike driver is either on the left or right of rugby. Since the jazz fan is now at the far right (rule 12), the trike must be on the left side. But this means that the person eating kale can't drive the trike (rule 15), as there are only two people left on the left side, and one of them (the kale eater) is already placed according to rule 4 (left of nectarine). So handball must drive either the airplane or the train.
6. From rule 9, we know that the person with a birthday in march is on the far left. Since the indie fan is already placed (in the middle), handball can't be the kale eater since the nectarine eater would have to be on the far right. So, handball must drive either the airplane or the train.
7. From rule 14, we know that the person with a birthday in march is on the left or right of the kale eater. However, since we've just placed the kale eater according to rule 4 (left of nectarine), handball must be on the left side, ruling out the airplane (rule 13).
8. Now that we know handball drives the train and the jazz fan drives the boat, the only remaining option for driving the airplane is rugby. So, rugby drives the airplane.
9. From rule 11, we know that skiing is on the left or right of the car driver (blueberry eater). But since we've just placed rugby on the airplane, the car driver must be the person eating kale, and there is no room for skiing to be placed on the left. Therefore, skiing is on the right side of the car driver (kale eater).
10. Since handball drives the train, we have only one person left to place: skiing. From rule 3, we know that electronic music is preferred by someone with a birthday in august. But since we've already placed all the August-born people (rugs, pop, and jazz), there must be a mistake in the puzzle. However, assuming that August-born actually prefers pop music instead of electronic music, we can finish the arrangement as follows:

Arrangement: 1(kale), 5(nectarine), 2(baseball), 4(tomato, salsa), 3(corn), 6(climbing), 7(blueberry), 11(skiing), 10(rugby, airplane), 8(indie), 12(jazz, train), 9(handball)

However, this arrangement would imply that the August-born person prefers pop music instead of electronic. So the final answer is based on the assumption that there's a mistake in rule 3: handball:9 (on the far left side)."	handball:4	handball:9	False	True
