Zebra_1domain_replacements_0	" This puzzle requires a systematic approach to solve it. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign numbers from 1 to 5 for each person, and we will place them on a line from left to right.
2. From rule 9, the norwegian is on the far left, so Norweigan goes at position 1.
3. Rule 14 tells us that the norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue, but we don't know who likes blue yet. For now, let's assume that the blue-lover will go at position 2 or 3.
4. From rule 10, the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. As the norwegian already occupies position 1, we can only place chesterfields at position 2 or 3. Let's assume that chesterfields goes at position 2. Then, the fox owner must be at position 5 since there are only 5 people and all positions have to be occupied.
5. Rule 7 tells us that the kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow. Since kools can't occupy position 1 (since the norwegian is there), position 2 or 3, and we placed chesterfields at position 2, then kools must go at position 3. Now we know that the yellow-lover is the kools-smoker, which also means that the person who likes ivory can't be to the right of the person who likes green (from rule 5).
6. From rule 11, the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since we placed kools at position 3 and the fox owner occupies position 5, the horse owner can only be at position 4 or 5. Let's assume that the horse owner goes at position 4.
7. From rule 12, the lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's sport is handball. Since we already placed chesterfields, kools, and horse owners, the only available sport left for lucky-strike is weightlifting (since baseball, biathlon, and parkour are already taken). So, the lucky-strike-smoker must go at position 5. Now we know that the handball player is the lucky-strike-smoker, which also means that the person who likes green can't be on the far left (since the norwegian is there), so the person who likes green goes at position 2 or 4.
8. From rule 6, the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails. Since we already placed kools and horse owners, the only available pet left for old-gold is either zebra (since dog and fox are already taken) or parkour (since baseball, biathlon, and weightlifting are already taken). As we don't have enough information to determine which one is the snails yet, let's assume that old-gold is the owner of parkour. This means that the old-gold-smoker goes at position 1 since there are no other smokers left.
9. Now we know who owns parkour (old-gold), so it must be placed at position 5, as all other pet owners have already been placed.
10. From rule 4, the ukranian is the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we already placed chesterfields, kools, horse, lucky-strike, and old-gold, the only available sport left for the ukranian is parkour (since baseball, biathlon, and weightlifting are already taken). This means that the ukranian goes at position 4 since we already placed norwegian, chesterfields, kools, horse, lucky-strike, and old-gold.
11. From rule 13, the japanese is the parliaments-smoker. Since we already placed kools and horse owners, the only available smoker left for japanese is lucky-strike (since old-gold, chesterfields, and cigars are already taken). This means that the japanese goes at position 3 since we already placed norwegian, chesterfields, kools, horse, old-gold, and ukranian.
12. Since there are only 5 people and all positions have been occupied, it means that the person who likes blue must be on the far right (since the norwegian is to the left or right of the blue-lover). As we don't know who likes blue yet, let's assume that the blue-lover goes at position 5.
13. From rule 8, the person who's sport is weightlifting is in the middle. Since we already placed norwegian, chesterfields, kools, horse, old-gold, ukranian, japanese, and a blue-lover (either position 2 or 4), the only available sport left for the middle person is baseball (since baseball, biathlon, and weightlifting are already taken). This means that the blue-lover must occupy position 5 since we already placed all other people with their sports.
14. Now we know who likes baseball, so it must be at position 3 since we already placed norwegian, chesterfields, kools, horse, old-gold, ukranian, japanese, and a blue-lover (at position 5).
15. From rule 1, the english is the person who likes red. Since we already placed norwegian, chesterfields, kools, horse, old-gold, ukranian, japanese, baseball, and a blue-lover (at position 5), the only available spot left for the english is position 1.
16. From rule 2, the spanish is the owner of the dog. Since we already placed norwegian, chesterfields, kools, horse, old-gold, ukranian, japanese, baseball, english (at position 1), and a blue-lover (at position 5), the only available pet left for spanish is fox (since dog and zebra are already taken). This means that the spanish goes at position 2 since we already placed all other people and pets.
17. From rule 3, the person who's sport is baseball is the person who likes green. Since we already placed the baseball player at position 3, it means that the person who likes green must be at position 3 as well.
18. Now we know the colors of all people: red (english), green (baseball player and someone to the right of ivory), ivory (unknown yet), yellow (kools-smoker), blue (blue-lover at position 5).
19. From rule 15, since there are only 5 different favorite colors, the person who likes ivory must like one of the remaining colors: red, green, or blue. Since we know that the english likes red and the blue-lover is already in position 5, the person who likes ivory can only be at position 4 (since position 2 is taken by the spanish).
20. Now we have the complete arrangement:
```
1. English - Red
2. Spanish - Dog
3. Baseball Player - Green
4. Ukrainian - Parkour
5. Blue-lover - Blue
```
Since we don't know the exact color of each person yet, let's assign colors based on their order:
```
1. English - Red
2. Spanish - Dog - Yellow (since cigars are taken)
3. Baseball Player - Green
4. Ukrainian - Parkour - Blue (since there is no other available color for ukranian yet)
5. Blue-lover - Blue
```
21. To find the actual colors of each person, we need to check their preferences based on their positions:
- Since the english likes red and is at position 1, it means that the person who likes ivory must like blue (since there are only 5 different favorite colors).
- Since the spanish likes a color other than red, green, or blue (as they are already taken by other people), it means that the spanish likes ivory. This makes the spanish's pet fox.
- Since the ukranian is at position 4 and likes parkour, it means that the person who likes ivory must like yellow (since there are only 5 different favorite colors).
- Now we have:
```
1. English - Red
2. Spanish - Fox - Ivory
3. Baseball Player - Green
4. Ukrainian - Parkour - Yellow
5. Blue-lover - Blue
```
As we don't know the exact order of colors yet, let's assign them based on their positions:
```
1. English - Red
2. Spanish - Fox - Ivory
3. Baseball Player - Green
4. Ukrainian - Parkour - Yellow
5. Blue-lover - Blue
```
Since the person who likes ivory (spanish) also has a pet (fox), it means that the spanish's original color is red and the english's original color is ivory. To maintain the order, let's switch their colors:
```
1. English - Ivory
2. Spanish - Fox - Red
3. Baseball Player - Green
4. Ukrainian - Parkour - Yellow
5. Blue-lover - Blue
```
Now we have a valid arrangement with all people and pets assigned:
```
1. English - Ivory (switched from red)
2. Spanish - Fox - Red (switched from ivory)
3. Baseball Player - Green
4. Ukrainian - Parkour - Yellow
5. Blue-lover - Blue

Zebra_1domain_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a methodical approach by assigning each characteristic to variables and then deducing relationships between them. Let's represent:

- Colors as C1 (Red), C2 (Green), C3 (Ivory), C4 (Yellow), C5 (Blue)
- Nationalities as N1 (English), N2 (Spanish), N3 (Ukranian), N4 (Norwegian), N5 (Japanese)
- Sports as S1 (Baseball), S2 (Biathlon), S3 (Weightlifting), S4 (Handball), S5 (Parkour)
- Cigars as G1 (Old-Gold), G2 (Kools), G3 (Chesterfields), G4 (Lucky-Strike), G5 (Parliaments)
- Pets as P1 (Dog), P2 (Fox), P3 (Zebra), P4 (Horse), P5 (Snails)

From the given clues, we can deduce some initial relationships:

1. C1 = N1, C3 ≠ N1, C2 = S1, C4 = N4, C5 < C2 in terms of position
2. P1 = N2, P3 ≠ P1, P5 = G6, P2 ≠ P5, P4 ≠ P5
3. S3 = 'middle' (position), S2 = N3, S5 > S2
4. G1 = P5, G2 = C3, G3 is left or right of P2 and not equal to P2, G4 is either P1's neighbor or P2's neighbor
5. G5 = N5, G5 ≠ P1's neighbor (left or right), G5 is to the left or right of C5
6. N1 < N4 (position), N4 < N5 (position) and N5 cannot be on the far left
7. If N4 and N5 are neighbors, then G2 = P3's neighbor (left or right) as well as G4 is not equal to P3
8. If N4 and N5 are not neighbors, then G4 is either P1's or P2's neighbor
9. Since C5 cannot be at the far left, N4 cannot be on the far left, which means that N4 must be left of N5 (as N5 cannot be on the far left)

Now let us find out where our **zebra** (P3) is:

Since we know the positions of N1, N2, N4, and N5, we can conclude that P3 cannot be at the far left (N4 < P3). Also, as N5 cannot be on the far left, P3 must not be the neighbor of N5. So, if G2 = P3's neighbor (left or right), it means that both N4 and N5 are neighbors which leads to a contradiction with clue 7. Therefore, G2 cannot be P3's neighbor.

Now let us consider the case where G4 is either P1's or P2's neighbor:

If P3 = P4 (Horse), then neither P1 nor P2 can be horses because they must have different pets. But since horse cannot be on the far left, this means that N4 and G4 are neighbors which contradicts clue 8 (G4 is not equal to P1 or P2). Hence, P3 cannot be the horse.

Now let us consider the case where G4 is P5's neighbor:

- If P3 = P1 (Dog), then P2 must be P5 and N5 would need to be on the far left which contradicts the fact that N5 cannot be on the far left. So, this possibility can also be discarded.
- If P3 = P5 (Snails), then we have two possibilities:
  - P1 is a horse. But since horse cannot be on the far left, it means that both P2 and N4 are to the right of N5 which contradicts clue 9 (N4 must be left of N5).
  - P2 is a dog. In this case, we have another contradiction: If G2 = Kools (C3), then C3 cannot be at the far left as well, but since N1 < N4 and N5 > N4, it means that both C3 and C1 must be to the right of N4 which contradicts clue 1 (C1 = N1).

Finally, if G4 is not a neighbor of P5:

- If P3 = P1 (Dog), this case is similar to what we discussed earlier. Since horse cannot be on the far left, it leads us to another contradiction that both P2 and N4 are to the right of N5 which contradicts clue 9 (N4 must be left of N5).
- If P3 = P5 (Snails), then we have two possibilities:
  - P1 is a dog. In this case, since C3 cannot be at the far left and N1 < N4 and N5 > N4, it means that both C3 and C1 must be to the right of N4 which contradicts clue 1 (C1 = N1).
  - P2 is a horse. This possibility does not lead us to any contradiction. But since horse cannot be on the far left, it means that both P1 and N4 are to the right of N5. Since we know that N5 < N4, this implies that C1 must be to the right of C3 which contradicts clue 1 (C1 = N1).

In summary, none of the possibilities lead us to a valid arrangement without contradiction. However, it seems that there is an error in the given clues as the puzzle cannot be solved with these given information."	zebra:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_1domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information and find patterns. We will assign numbers to the variables based on their respective positions from left to right (1 being the far-left person). Let's start by identifying some relationships:

1. Since green drinker is in the middle, we know that there are three people to the left of it, and two people to its right. So, the number of people is 6. This means that the far-right person (6) smokes parliaments, since it was stated that the march-born person smokes them (13).
2. Since ivory-liker is to the right of green-liker, we know that the numbers for red- and blue-likers are higher than 3. However, since there are only five favourite colors, neither of these people can be on the far left (position 1) or at position 2 (the owner of the dog).
3. Since kools-smoker is to the left or right of horse-owner and fox-owner, neither of them can be at position 1 or 6. This means that either one of these smokers could potentially be in position 5 (middle), but since there's already a drinker of milk in this position, it must be kools-smoker who drinks milk. Therefore, the owner of the horse is either 2 or 4, and the owner of the fox is either 3 or 5. Let's assume that the owner of the horse is at position 2 (dog owner being at position 5). This means that the owner of the fox is at position 3 (neither can be on the far left or right, and we just confirmed the dog and horse owners can't be in positions 1 or 6).
4. Since old-gold smoker is the snails-owner, we know that this person can't be on the far left (position 1) since there are no pets mentioned for position 2 or higher. This means that old-gold smoker must be at position 6. However, since kools-smoker drinks milk and can't be in position 5, old-gold smoker must actually be in position 4 (the only remaining position for an old-gold smoker).
5. Since chesterfields smoker is either to the left or right of fox-owner, it means that chesterfields smoker is either at position 2 or 3. However, we already determined that both positions are taken by horse- and fox-owners. Therefore, since there's only one brand left (lucky-strike), it must be the chesterfields-smoker who drinks orange-juice (12).
6. Now we have enough information to determine the remaining brands: lucky-strike smokes chesterfields, and kools smoke either green or yellow. Since kools drink milk and can't be in position 5, it must be the yeller-liker who drinks kools (7). This leaves us with blue-liker drinking either cigarettes or cigars. Given that there are only five favorite colors, we know that the blue-liker cannot also like red (since the person born in October already likes red), and green has already been taken. So, the last remaining color is for blue-liker, making it impossible for blue-liker to drink coffee or tea (the two beverages already assigned). This contradiction means that our initial assumption about the position of horse-owner being 2 was incorrect; instead, let's assume it's at position 4. This gives us a clear layout:

   ```
   1 5 2 3 4 6
   dog kools milk horse old-gold tea snails
   may green october coffee january tea march parliaments
   ```

7. Now we can determine the colors of all people by using information from points 1, 3, and 5: red is October (position 1), green is in May (position 5), ivory/yellow are not yet known, and blue is March (position 6).
8. Since we know that the middle position has a drinker of milk, we can determine the favorite beverages of other people: coffee is in October, tea is in January, orange-juice is in April, water must be somewhere on the left side (positions 1 to 3), and the last remaining beverage is for the far-right person (position 6).
9. Since the chesterfields smoker drinks orange-juice, we know that kools-smoker can't be drinking green or coffee (since they are taken already); it must be tea. This means that ivory/yellow is for the kool-smoker:

   ```
   1 5 2 3 4 6
   dog kools milk horse old-gold tea snails
   may green october coffee january tea march parliaments
   ```

10. Now we can deduce that the person who likes ivory is actually the yeller-liker (since it's impossible for the red- and green-likers to be on the far left or right, and they are already taken):

    ```
     2 5 3 4 1 6
    horse kools milk dog old-gold tea snails
    may green october coffee january tea march parliaments
    ```

11. Since the ivory/yellow-liker drinks kools, we know that it must be either position 2 or 5 (the only remaining positions for drinkers). However, since the position of horse-owner has already been determined, the ivory/yellow-liker can't be at position 2. This means that the ivory/yellow-liker is in position 5:

    ```
     2 5 3 4 1 6
    horse chesterfields tea kools milk dog old-gold snails
    may green october coffee january tea march parliaments
    ```

12. Since water is on the left side and not yet assigned, we can assign it to position 1 (far left) since there are no other beverages available:

    ```
     1 5 3 4 2 6
    water horse chesterfields tea kools milk dog old-gold snails
    may green october coffee january tea march parliaments
    ```

So the answer to your question is **water:1**."	water:1	water:1	True	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, we will try to find the positions for each variable one by one based on the given conditions. Let's assign a number from 1 to 5 to each position (leftmost being 1 and rightmost being 5).

1. From condition 1, the person with birthday in October likes red, so let's put Red with October which can only be Position 5 (since Position 1 is April, and we will assign the colors for other positions later.)
2. From condition 2, the dog owner is the one with a birthday in May, but there's no available position left for May. So let's swap Dog and Snails between Positions 4 and 6. Now, we have: May (Dog) <-- Position 4 --> June <-- Position 5 --> October (Red)
3. From condition 3, the coffee drinker likes Green, but there's no available position left for Green. Let's swap Coffee and Milk between Positions 2 and 3. Now, we have: May (Dog) <-- Position 4 --> June (Milk) <-- Position 3 --> October (Red)
4. From condition 4, the person with a birthday in January drinks Tea, which can only be Position 1. So now we have: January (Tea) <-- Position 1 --> May (Dog) <-- Position 4 --> June (Milk) <-- Position 3 --> October (Red)
5. From condition 5, the person who likes Green is to the right of the person who likes Ivory. Since we don't know which color corresponds to which position yet, let's assume that Ivory is in Position 2. Now, there's no available position left for Green (Condition 3 tells us that Green can't be Position 5), so let's swap Coffee and Tea between Positions 2 and 4. Now we have: January (Tea) <-- Position 1 --> May (Dog) <-- Position 4 --> June (Coffee) <-- Position 2 --> October (Red)
6. From condition 6, the old-gold smoker is the owner of Snails, but we already swapped them in Condition 2. So let's swap Old-Gold and Kools between Positions 3 and 4. Now we have: January (Tea) <-- Position 1 --> May (Dog) <-- Position 4 --> June (Kools) <-- Position 3 --> October (Red)
7. From condition 7, the kools smoker likes Yellow, but there's no available position left for Yellow. Let's swap Kools and Lucky-Strike between Positions 2 and 4. Now we have: January (Tea) <-- Position 1 --> May (Dog) <-- Position 4 --> June (Lucky-Strike) <-- Position 3 --> October (Red)
8. From condition 8, the person drinking milk is in the middle. But we already placed milk in Position 2, so that condition holds true.
9. From condition 9, the person with a birthday in April is on the far left, but there's no available position left for April. Since we have to assign colors and brands for the other positions first, let's move on to other conditions.
10. From condition 10, the chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. But we don't know who the chesterfields smoker is yet, so let's skip this condition for now and return to it later.
11. From condition 11, the kools smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since we already swapped Kools with Lucky-Strike, let's skip this condition for now and return to it later.
12. From condition 12, the lucky-strike smoker drinks Orange-Juice, but there's no available position left for Orange-Juice (Condition 13 tells us that Orange-Juice can't be Position 5). So let's swap Lucky-Strike and Parliaments between Positions 2 and 4. Now we have: January (Tea) <-- Position 1 --> May (Dog) <-- Position 4 --> June (Parliaments) <-- Position 3 --> October (Red)
13. From condition 13, the person with a birthday in March is the parliaments smoker. Since we already placed Parisments in Position 4 (swapped from Lucky-Strike), that means March is Position 4 and Person A has a birthday in March. Now we have: January (Tea) <-- Position 1 --> May (Dog) <-- Position 2 --> June (Parliaments) <-- Position 3 --> October (Red)
14. From condition 14, the person who's birthday is in April is to the left or right of the person who likes Blue. Since we already placed Person A with a birthday in April, let's find out who likes Blue. Looking at conditions 1 and 5, the only color left for Position 2 is Blue (since Ivory can't be Position 2 from condition 5). That means the person who likes Blue is Position 2. Now we have: January (Tea) <-- Position 1 --> May (Dog) <-- Position 3 --> June (Blue) <-- Position 4 --> October (Red)
15. Finally, let's revisit conditions 10 and 11 which are the constraints for the Chesterfields smoker and Kools smoker locations. Since the chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox (which we don't know yet), and the kools smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse, we can deduce that the only possibility for both conditions to be satisfied is when the Chesterfields smoker is in Position 2 (left of Dog and Horse) and Kools smoker in Position 3 (right of Dog but left of Horse). Now we have: January (Tea) <-- Position 1 --> May (Dog) <-- Position 2 (Chesterfields) --> June (Blue) <-- Position 3 (Kools) --> October (Red)
16. Lastly, let's assign the remaining colors and pets. Since we already placed Red in October and Green in Position 5 (swapped from Coffee), there's only one color left for Position 5: Yellow. There's also only one pet left for Position 5: Zebra. So now we have: January (Tea) <-- Position 1 --> May (Dog) <-- Position 2 (Chesterfields) --> June (Blue) <-- Position 3 (Kools) --> October (Red) <-- Position 4 (Parliaments) --> May (Zebra)

We have successfully assigned all the variables based on their conditions. Here's the final result: January (Tea), May (Dog), June (Blue), Kools, October (Red), Parisments, May (Zebra)

And for the question you asked: **zebra:May**."	zebra:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_1domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a methodical approach by assigning variables and applying the given clues. Let's denote:

- C (Color) : Red, Green, Ivory, Yellow, Blue
- N (Nationality) : English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese
- S (Cigar Brand) : Old-Gold, Kools, Chesterfields, Lucky-Strike, Parliments
- B (Beverage) : Coffee, Tea, Milk, Orange-Juice, Water
- M (Movie Genre) : Romance, Animation, Mystery, Horror, Spy

Let's analyze the clues and start forming our solution:

1. From clue 1, we know that the English likes Red. Let's assign C(English) = Red
2. Clue 3 gives us that the person drinking coffee (B) prefers Green. We can now say B(Middle) = Green, since Milk was already assigned to another position in clue 8.
3. From clues 6 and 10, we know that the old-gold smoker watches Spy movies, and they are either on the left or right of animation movies. Since there is only one person watching animation movies (which we will assign to the position next to Norwegian in clue 9), Old-Gold must be on the opposite side. Let's say M(Right) = Spy.
4. Now that we know the position of the spy movie watcher, we can identify the kools smoker. From clues 10 and 11, we deduce that Kools is either left or right of horror movies (which we haven't placed yet). Given that Old-Gold is to the right of animation movies, Kools must be on the left. Let's say S(Left) = Kools
5. From clue 7, we know that the kools smoker likes Yellow. Since Green is already assigned, let's assign C(Left) = Yellow.
6. With Yellow assigned, we can now find the ivory lover by elimination (since there are only two remaining colors: Red and Blue). Therefore, we assign C(Right of English) = Ivory.
7. Now that we know where Ivory is placed, we can find the position for the person drinking water (B(Right)) since they must be to the right of the person who likes ivory. Let's say B(Right of Ivory) = Water.
8. Since Milk was assigned earlier and cannot move due to being in the middle, there is only one position remaining for Orange-Juice (Beverage), so we assign B(Left of English) = Orange-Juice.
9. From clues 4 and 14, we know that the Ukrainian drinks tea (which was already assigned). Since Tea must be to the left or right of the person who likes blue, we can place the Ukrainian next to Milk or Water since those are the remaining positions for the nationalities. Let's say N(Left of English) = Ukrainian.
10. The Norwegian is on the far left (clue 9), so they must be in position 1. Since their position is already assigned, we know that the person who likes Blue must be in one of the remaining positions. Let's say C(Right of Japanese) = Blue.
11. Clue 13 tells us that the japanese smokes Parliments. Since Parliments has been assigned to a position (clue 13 itself), we know that the Japanese must be in another position. They cannot be on the left side, since there is already an English and Norwegian there (clue 9). Thus, they can only be either in the middle or on the right side of the arrangement. Since Milk and Orange-Juice are already assigned to the middle positions, we know that Japanese must be on the right. Let's say N(Right) = Japanese
12. Since there is no remaining position for Horror movies (Movie Genre), we can deduce that Animation must be in one of the two remaining positions: either left or right of the English. However, since Chesterfields cannot be next to the animation movie watcher (clue 10), Animation must be on the far left. So, M(Left) = Animation.
13. From clues 5 and 12, we know that Green is not adjacent to Ivory. Since Animation is already assigned as an adjacent position for Ivory, Chesterfields must be placed opposite of Ivory. Therefore, let's say M(Right) = Mystery.
14. The only position remaining for Chesterfields (S(Right)) can now be assigned, since we know they cannot be to the left of animation movies.
15. Finally, the only position left for Horror is on the right side of the arrangement (M(Right)), since all other movie genres are already placed.

Here's our final arrangement:

  1. Norwegian
  2. Ukrainian
  3. Milk (Middle)
  4. English (Red, Left of Ukrainian)
  5. Old-Gold (Spy, Right of Animation)
  6. Kools (Yellow, Left of Horror)
  7. Chesterfields (Right of Ivory, Mystery)
  8. Water (Right of English)
  9. Orange-Juice (Left of English)
 10. Japanese (Parliments, Right of arrangement)
 11. Animation (Far left, adjacent to Norwegian)
 12. Horror (Far right)
 13. Ivory (Right of English, adjacent to Old-Gold and Chesterfields)
 14. Mystery (Right of Japanese, adjacent to Chesterfields)

Given this arrangement, **water** is located in position 5: Water:5."	water:1	water:5	False	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, we can create a matrix with rows corresponding to people (from left to right: Norwegian, English, Ukaranian, Person1, Person2) and columns for their characteristics (color preference, nationality, brand of cigar smoked, movie genre preferred, beverage preference).

| Person2  | Ivory  | -           | Kools   | Animation/Horror | Orange-Juice/Water |

We can fill in some additional values based on the clues:
- Since the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the person watching horror movies, Person2 must be watching horror movies. Therefore, Person1 must watch animation movies (as there are only two remaining options). So, Beverage for Person1 can be determined by the other available option - Water.
- The norwegian is on the far left and not drinking milk. Since person 1 drinks water and is on the right of the person liking ivory (person 3), the norwegian must be person 3, and Norwegian becomes Tea in row 3 of the matrix.
- The japanese is the parliaments-smoker and not drinking milk or coffee, so the japanese can only be Person2. Therefore, Person2's Movie preference must be romance, as there are no remaining options for Person1. So, Beverage for Person2 becomes Coffee since Person1 drinks water.
- The old-gold smoker is to the right of the person liking ivory (Person3) and cannot be the spanish or japanese. Since the english is already taken and only one more option remains, the old-gold smoker must be the ukranian, making Cigar for Person4 Old-Gold in the matrix.
- The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies (Person1). Since the norwegian and english have already been placed, the chesterfields smoker can only be the spanish. Therefore, Cigar for Person5 becomes Chesterfields in the matrix.
- The lucky-strike-smoker is the person drinking orange-juice. Since the spanish cannot drink milk or coffee and there are only two remaining options, the lucky-strike-smoker must be the english. Therefore, Cigar for Person6 becomes Lucky-Strike in the matrix.
- Finally, we know that the green person is to the right of the ivory person (Person3). Since Person4 already drinks orange juice, there is only one remaining option - blue. So, Color preference for Person5 becomes Blue in the matrix.

Now, we can find mystery's position and favorite genre:
- Since the kools smoker (Person2) is to the left or right of the horror movie watcher (Person2), there must be another person watching mystery movies between Person1 and Person2. Thus, Person1 watches animation movies, and Person2 watches horror movies.
- Finally, we find that the position for Mystery is Person4 since Person4 drinks orange juice (which was given to the English/Lucky-Strike smoker) and prefers the color blue (the only remaining option). Therefore, Mystery: 4

In summary, the final matrix looks like this:

|      | Color  | Nationality  | Cigar   | Movie       | Beverage  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Norwegian  | -     | Norwegian | -         | -        | Milk  |
| English   | Red    | English    | -        | Animation  | Water  |
| Ukrainian | -     | Ukrainian  | Old-Gold  | Tea       | Coffee  |
| Person1   | Green  | -          | -         | Mystery  | Orange-Juice/Water |
| Person2   | Ivory  | Spanish    | Kools    | Horror     | Coffee |
| Person3   | -     | -          | -        | Animation  | Water  |
| Person4   | Blue    | English    | Lucky-Strike| Mystery   | Orange-Juice |
| Person5   | Yellow  | Spanish    | Chesterfields| -        | Coffee  |

The final answer is **mystery: 4**."	mystery:5	mystery:4	False	True
