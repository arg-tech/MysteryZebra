Zebra_2domain_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, we will use logical deduction based on the given information:
1. Assign a number to each person (from left to right) and start filling positions with their jobs, colors, cities, pets, cigars, etc.
2. From point 1, there is only one person who likes red and travels to berlin, so that's our first position with the job, color, city assigned.
3. Point 2 says the dog owner travels to nizza, which means the dog owner cannot be in the first position (since the person traveling to berlin has been placed already), so the dog owner must be in position 2 or more. Since the social worker is in the middle and we don't have enough positions yet, the dog owner cannot be in the second position as well. So, the dog owner must be in position 3 or higher. But since there are only 5 people and the architect is already placed (position 1), the dog owner cannot be an architect. This leaves us with:
   - Position 1: Architect (Green)
   - Position 2: Can't be assigned yet
   - Position 3: Not possible for the dog owner
   - Position 4: Dancer (travels to marseilles)
   - Position 5: Can't be assigned yet
4. From point 5, we know that the person who likes green must be to the right of the person who likes ivory. Since position 1 is already occupied by the architect and they like green, the person who likes ivory must be in position 2 or less (otherwise, there would be no way for the green-liker to be to their right). But we know that the dog owner cannot be in position 2, so the ivory-liker must be in position 1. This means our current arrangement is:
   - Position 1: Architect (Ivory)
   - Position 2: Can't be assigned yet
   - Position 3: Not possible for the dog owner
   - Position 4: Dancer (Green, marseilles)
   - Position 5: Can't be assigned yet
5. Continue this process until all positions are filled and we can find the electrician. Here is the final arrangement based on the given points:

```
Position 1: Architect (Ivory)
Position 2: Social Worker (Yellow, kools)
Position 3: Project Manager (Lucky Strike)
Position 4: Dancer (Green, Marseilles)
Position 5: Electrician (Blue) <-- electrician found!
```

So the final answer is **electrician:5**."	electrician:1
Zebra_2domain_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step and use logical deductions to find out where each element is located. Here's how I approached it:

1. From statement 6, we know that the old-gold smoker owns snails. Since the kools smoker is not an option for pet owners (statement 8), the old-gold smoker cannot be the kools smoker. The only available options are parliaments and lucky-strike, so let's assume that either the owner of the snails smokes parlament or lucky-strike.
2. Since the social worker is in the middle (statement 8), we can start by placing them between the two known people (based on statements 1, 3, and 9). This gives us a possible arrangement: red-social-worker-green-blue-... or green-social-worker-red-blue-... or any permutation of these three.
3. The kools smoker likes yellow, so the social worker can't be the kools smoker (since the green and ivory positions are filled). This means that the person who owns snails must smoke either parliaments or lucky-strike. Let's assume for now that they smoke parliaments.
4. The parliaments smoker is traveling to colone (statement 13), so we place them at the end of the line. This gives us: green-social-worker-red-blue-parliaments (or any permutation of these four).
5. Since the kools smoker can't be to the left or right of the horse owner, we know that the kools smoker must be the old-gold smoker because both cannot be on the end. Therefore, our line should now read: green-social-worker-red-blue-old-gold.
6. The only remaining option for the person who owns snails is lucky-strike (since they can't be old-gold or parliaments). But since the chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the fox owner, we know that the chesterfields smoker cannot be in the first three positions. So our line should now read: blue-old-gold-social-worker-lucky-strike
7. The only remaining job for lucky-strike to take is project-manager (since they can't be architect, dancer, or electrician). This gives us our final arrangement: blue-old-gold-social-worker-project-manager.
8. Since the kools smoker likes yellow and can't be on the end of the line, we know that the kools smoker must be the electrician because only they remain unassigned. This gives us our final job arrangement: red-architect-green-dancer-electrician (since they cannot be on the left or right of the horse owner).
9. The only remaining pet for the electrician to keep is zebra, so our answer is: zebra:5 (or any permutation of the arrangement that places red as architect, green as dancer, and zebra as the fifth element)

The final arrangements would be:
Cities: berlin, nizza, marseilles, london, colone
Colours: red, green, ivory, yellow, blue
Brands of Cigars: old-gold, kools, chesterfields, lucky-strike, parliaments
Jobs: architect, dancer, social-worker, project-manager, electrician
Pets: dog, fox, zebra, horse, snails

**zebra:5**"	zebra:5
Zebra_2domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by assigning each variable a number from 1-5. We will use colors for fruits, sports, pets, and cigar brands, and we will find the smoker of each brand.

1. Since strawberry is eaten by the person who likes red, let's assign red to color #1: strawberry = #1
2. The person eating lime is the owner of the dog; let's assign dog to color #3 (since we don't have colors 1 and 2 assigned yet).
   - From 6, we know that the old-gold smoker owns snails; since we haven't assigned a color to snails yet, let's assign snails to #5: old-gold = #5
3. The person who's sport is skiing is the person who likes green (#2), so let's assign skiing to #2
4. The person eating potato is the person who's sport is cycling (#4)
5. The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory, which means green can't be on the left side, so let's assign ivory to #3.
6. Since we already know that the old-gold smoker owns snails (#5), this clue doesn't add any more information.
7. The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow (#4).
8. The person who's sport is surfing is in the middle, which means sport #3 can't be surfing or cycling (since those are already assigned to #2 and #4), so let's assign surfing to #5.
9. The person eating pomegranate is on the far left, which means pomegranate = #1.
10. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. Since we already know that old-gold smokes old gold (#5), let's assign chesterfields to #2 (to the left or right of #3).
11. The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since we already know that kools smokes yellow (#4), and snails are assigned to #5, let's assign horse to #1. This leaves us with only one possible position for horse, which is to the left of kools.
12. The lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's sport is handball (#3).
13. The person eating peach is the parliaments-smoker; since we already know that strawberry = #1 and pomegranate = #1, there are no more peaches left, so this clue doesn't add any more information.
14. The person eating pomegranate is to the left or right of the person who likes blue, which means blue must be on the opposite side of the pomegranate (#1). This leaves us with only two positions for blue: #2 and #5. Since we already know that green (#2) and surfing (#5) are assigned to those colors, this means that blue can't be either #2 or #5. However, since we don't have any other colors left to assign, we can't definitively determine the position of blue at the moment.

Without knowing the exact position of blue, I cannot give a definitive answer for where golf is located, but we know that golf can be neither #1 (since pomegranate is there) nor #2 (since skiing is there).

If you manage to find the position of blue based on the given clues, you will be able to determine the position of golf."	golf:1
Zebra_2domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a combination of logical deductions and the process of elimination. Let's start by placing some individuals based on the given information.

1. Strawberry eater likes red (let's call this person A)
2. Lime eater owns dog (let's call this person B)
3. Skiing lover likes green (let's place Green-lover above A, as per the condition 5)
4. Potato eater does Cycling (let's call this person D, but we don't know the color preference yet)
5. Green-lover and Ivory-lover arrangement is known (we don't need to worry about their positions right now)
6. Snails owner smokes Old-gold (this person we'll place at the end since we don't have more information)
7. Kools smoker likes Yellow (let's call this person C, but we don't know the position yet)
8. Surfing lover is in the middle (let's assume D does surfing for now)
9. Pomegranate eater is on the far left (we'll place this person first, let's call this person E)
10. Kools-smoker position is determined by conditions 10 and 11 (still can't place C yet)
11. Chesterfields smoker is to the left or right of Fox owner (we don't know the position of Fox yet)
12. Lucky-Strike smoker does Handball (let's call this person F)
13. Peach eater smokes Parliaments (let's place it on the end)
14. Pomegranate eater is to the left or right of Blue-lover (we don't know the position of Blue-lover yet)

Now, let's analyze the remaining clues and solve them step by step:

* From conditions 4 & 12, we know that D doesn't do Handball. So D must be either Cycling or Surfing (as Green-lover already does Skiing). Since condition 8 says the middle person does Surfing, D cannot do Surfing anymore. Thus, D does Cycling.
* From conditions 10 & 11, we know that C cannot be on the far left or right of Horse owner (since there's only one spot left for horse). So, C must be either to the left or right of Dog owner B (as there are no other options). As per condition 4, D doesn't own a dog, so C can't be on the left side of B. Thus, C is to the right of B.
* From conditions 9 & 14, we know that E is not Blue-lover, as Blue-lover cannot be on the far left and cannot be next to Pomegranate eater (since Pomegranate eater must be on the far left). So, E is either Red-lover A or Ivory-lover (as there are no other options). Since Green-lover is placed above A (condition 3), E can't be Green-lover. Thus, E is Red-lover A.
* Now, since C is on the right of B and E is on the far left, we know that the remaining positions must be as follows: Blue-lover, Fox owner, Lime eater, Yellow-lover, and Zebra (arranged from left to right).
* As for the sports and cigars preferences, we have already placed Green-lover, D (Cycling), A (Red), B (Dog, Lime), E (Strawberry), C (Yellow), F (Handball), and Peach eater (Parliaments). The remaining preferences are as follows: Ivory-lover, Fox owner, Blue-lover, Horse owner, Kools-smoker.
* Finally, we only have one spot left for the Old-gold smoker (as per condition 6) and Zebra (as per your request). Since there's no more information about their preferences, let's place Old-gold smoker on the far right to avoid any conflicts, as he/she can't be next to Blue-lover or Horse owner (condition 14). Thus, the only remaining spot for Zebra is at position 5.

In summary, **Zebra:5**. Hope this helps!"	zebra:5
Zebra_2domain_replacements_2	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down into smaller parts and solve each part step by step. We will assign numbers to the people from left to right (1 being the person on the far left).

1. From statement 1, we know that the cranberry-eater likes red. Since there are only 5 colors, let's assign color preferences as follows: 1 - Red, 2 - Green, 3 - Ivory, 4 - Yellow, 5 - Blue (order may change later).

2. From statement 2, the potato-eater owns a dog, so we can assign the pet owner positions as follows: 1 - Potato & Dog, 6 -?, 11 -?, 16 -?, 21 -?

3. Now let's see if we can make any associations from statement 3, but since we don't know the hobby preferences yet, we can't do much here for now.

4. From statement 4, the person eating banana has a board-games hobby, so we can assign hobbies as follows: 2 - Collecting, 3 -?, 4 - Board-Games, 5 -?, 6 -?

5. From statement 5, the green-liker is to the right of the ivory-liker. So, our current color preferences have an issue (since we cannot assign red to be on the right of green), so let's swap the positions of Red (1) and Ivory (3). Now our assignments are as follows: 1 - Ivory, 2 - Green, 3 - Red, 4 - Yellow, 5 - Blue

6. Statement 6 tells us that the old-gold-smoker is the owner of snails. Since we don't have any open pet owners yet, let's place the Old Gold smoker for now: 16 - Old-Gold & Snails

7. From statement 7, the kools-smoker likes yellow. We know that Kools-smoker is not our current position 11 (as stated in point 2), so let's move Yellow to another open position (either 6 or 21). Since the Lucky Strike smoker will be assigned as a skydiving hobbyist, and we know that Yellow cannot be on the left of Blue (from statement 14), it is better to place Yellow (7) at position 21. Now our assignments are:
   1 - Ivory, 2 - Green, 3 - Red, 6 -?, 11 -?, 16 - Old-Gold & Snails, 21 - Kools & Yellow

8. Statement 8 tells us that the photography hobbyist is in the middle (position 4). Since our current position 4 has Board Games as a hobby, let's swap their positions: 2 - Collecting, 3 -?, 4 - Photography, 5 -?, 6 -?

9. From statement 9, we know that the tomato-eater is on the far left (position 1), which conflicts with our current assignments, so let's swap positions of Tomato and Cranberry eaters: 1 - Cranberry & Red, 2 - Collecting, 3 -?, 4 - Photography, 5 -?, 6 -?

10. Now let's check statements 10 and 11 for the Chesterfields smoker position. Since Chesterfields are not at positions 1 or 2 (as stated in points 9 and 10), we can place them at position 5: 5 - Chesterfields

11. Now that we know where Chesterfields are, let's see if there are any restrictions for the Kools smoker position based on statement 11. Since Horse is not at positions 2, 4, 5, or 6 (from our current assignments), and the Kools smoker cannot be at position 21, we can place the Kools smoker at position 11: 11 - Kools & Yellow

12. From statement 12, we know that the Lucky Strike smoker has a skydiving hobby. Since Skydiving hasn't been assigned yet, let's place Lucky Strike smoker in an open position: 6 - Lucky-Strike & Skydiving

13. From statement 13, we know that the tomato-eater is also a parliaments smoker (parliaments smoker was initially assigned to carrot eater). Now that the tomato-eater's position is known as position 1, we can reassign Carrot and Parisments: 2 -?, 3 -?, 4 - Photography, 5 - Chesterfields, 6 - Lucky-Strike & Skydiving, 11 - Kools & Yellow, 16 - Old-Gold & Snails, 21 -?

Now let's see if we can complete the remaining open positions based on the given statements:

- From statement 4, we know that the person eating banana has a board-games hobby. Since this is currently assigned to position 3 and cannot be swapped without affecting other assignments, we have a conflict here. However, since Board Games was initially assigned to position 2 but had to be swapped with Photography later, let's reassign Board Games to position 4: 1 - Cranberry & Red, 2 - Collecting, 3 - Photography, 4 - Board-Games, 5 - Chesterfields, 6 - Lucky-Strike & Skydiving, 11 - Kools & Yellow, 16 - Old-Gold & Snails

At this point, we have only one open position left (position 21). Since we have no restrictions for the last person based on given statements, let's assign them a hobby and pet:
- Since the last person is not mentioned in any of the previous statements, they can have any hobby or pet. Let's give them the remaining hobby (Woodworking) and pet (Zebra): 21 - Woodworking & Zebra

Now we have all positions filled with their respective colors, foods, cigars, hobbies, and pets:
1 - Cranberry & Red, Collecting & Dog
2 - Banana & Green, Photography
3 - ?, ?
4 - Board-Games
5 - Chesterfields
6 - Lucky-Strike & Skydiving
11 - Kools & Yellow, Horse
16 - Old-Gold & Snails, Fox
21 - Woodworking & Zebra

Since we couldn't find a definitive position for the last three assignments (3 - ?, ?, ?), I'll leave them as question marks. But we have successfully assigned positions for all other elements mentioned in the puzzle: **Cranberry:1, Collecting:1, Photography:2, Board-Games:4, Chesterfields:5, Lucky-Strike:6, Kools:11, Old-Gold:16, Tomato:1, Green:2, Red:1, Yellow:21, Ivory:3, Blue:5, Woodworking:21, Dog:1, Horse:11, Snails:16, Fox:16, Zebra:21**"	woodworking:1
Zebra_2domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, we need to create a system and solve it step-by-step. Let's assign numbers from 1 to 5 to each person and then find their corresponding details.

1. From rule 4 and 13, the person eating banana (#4) is also the one playing board-games, and he/she is also the parliaments-smoker (carrot eater). Let's assign #4 as the parliaments-smoker who likes yellow, keeps a horse, and plays board-games.

2. From rule 9, the person eating tomato (#1) is on the far left. Since #4 is already assigned, let's assume #1 as the old-gold smoker who likes red and owns a dog.

3. From rule 5, the person liking green (#2) is to the right of the person liking ivory (#5). So, #2 cannot be on the far left or the middle position.

4. From rule 10, the chesterfields smoker is either to the left or right of the owner of the fox. Since we have already assigned #1 and #4, let's assume #5 as the chesterfields-smoker (who keeps a zebra) for now.

5. From rule 7, the kools-smoker likes yellow. Since #4 is already assigned, let's assume #3 as the kools-smoker who likes blue and owns the snails.

6. From rule 12, the lucky-strike smoker is the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since we don't have anyone left to assign to this, let's move on to rule 14.

7. From rule 14, the tomato eater (#1) is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since we already know #1 and the only one left with a color is #5, let's assume that #5 likes blue for now.

8. With this assumption, we know that #2 cannot be on the far left (rule 9) nor in the middle (rule 14). So, #2 can only be either #3 or #4. But if #2 were to be #3, then it violates rule 7. Hence, #2 must be #4, meaning that #4 is the owner of the fox and plays photography.

9. Now, we have all positions except for #5 (chesterfields-smoker and zebra owner). Since #1 cannot be next to #5 due to rule 10, let's put #5 as the second from left. This means that #1 is on the far right.

10. With this arrangement, #5 is to the left of #1 (rule 14). So, the chesterfields-smoker keeps the zebra. Therefore, **zebra:2**.

This arrangement works without any contradictions."	zebra:5
