Einstein_orig_1	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From point 9 and 14, we know that the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house. Let's call the houses in order (Blue, Green, Red, White, Yellow). So, the Norwegian lives in either Green or Red. Since the Brit lives in the Red house (point 1), the Norwegian can't live in the Red house. Therefore, the Norwegian lives in the Green house.

2. From point 7 and 15, we know that the owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill and the owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water. Since the German smokes Prince (point 13), the owner of the Yellow house can't be German or British (since they drink Milk and Beer respectively). So, the owner of the Yellow house is either Dane, Swede, or Norwegian. But since the Norwegian lives in Green (point 1), the owner of the Yellow house must be one of Dane or Swede. However, since the Dane drinks Tea (point 3) and there's only one person who drinks Tea (the Dane), the owner of the Yellow house can't be Dane either. Therefore, the owner of the Yellow house is the Swede, and the Swede keeps Dogs as pets (point 2).

3. From point 5, we know that the Green house owner drinks Coffee. Since the Norwegian lives in the Green house (point 1), the Green house owner must be one of Brit, Dane, German, or Swede other than Norwegian. Since the Swede lives in Yellow (point 2) and the Dane drinks Tea (point 3), the Green house owner can only be Brit, German, or someone new. But since there are only 5 nationalities and we've assigned 4 of them already, there must be a mistake in the puzzle as it stands, because the Green house owner is unassignable based on the current information.

4. Based on the available information, we can't assign all the remaining properties to the owners, so there seems to be an inconsistency in the puzzle or some missing information. For example, Fish might live next to any of the houses since we don't know who smokes what or keeps which pets after the first 5 have been assigned.

In summary, the answer is indeterminable due to an inconsistency or incomplete information in the puzzle.

**Fish:Undetermined**"	Fish:4
Einstein_orig_2	" To solve this puzzle, let's methodically deduce the characteristics of each character based on the given clues. Here's my step-by-step solution:

1. First, we identify the house colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White) and the nationalities (Brit, Dane, German, Norwegian, Swede).
2. Next, let's identify the beverages (Beer, Coffee, Milk, Tea, Water), cigars (Bluemaster, Dunhill, Pall Mall, Prince, Blend) and pets (Cats, Birds, Dogs, Fish, Horses).
3. Now we can use the given clues to eliminate options:

   a. From clue 1, the Brit lives in Red house.
   b. From clue 9, the Norwegian lives in the first house (which is Blue or White because Green and Yellow are already assigned). Since the Norwegian cannot live in the Green house (clue 14), he must live in the White house.
   c. From clue 15, the Blend smoker's neighbor drinks Water. So neither Fish nor Horses can be the neighbor of the Blend smoker (as they don't drink water). Hence, the Blend smoker lives next to Cats or Birds (clue 10), which means he cannot live in the first house (Norwegian is next to Blue) and cannot live in the center house (center house drinks Milk). Thus, the only available positions for the Blend smoker are either the last house or the second-to-last house. Since the Green house is on the left of the White house (clue 4), and since the Green house owner drinks Coffee (clue 5), we can deduce that the last house must be either Green, Red, or Yellow. If it were Green, then the first house would have to be Blue. But the Norwegian lives in the first house, so this is impossible. If it were Red, the second house would need to be White. But since the center house drinks Milk (clue 8), the second house cannot be White. Therefore, the last house must be Yellow. So the Blend smoker lives in the Yellow house and his neighbor drinks Water.
   d. Now we know that the Green house is between Blue and White (clue 4). Since the first house is White, the Green house cannot be the second house, so it must be either the third or fifth house. If it were the fifth house, then the second house would need to be Red for the center house to drink Milk (clue 8). But since the owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill (clue 7), this means that the third house cannot be Yellow (as it must have a neighbor smoking Dunhill). Therefore, the Green house is the third house. This means the second house is Red and the fifth house is White.
   e. Since the German smokes Prince (clue 13), he cannot live in the center house (center house smokes Prince too) or next to the Blend smoker (since his neighbor drinks water). So the German can only live in the first, third, or fifth house. If he were in the third house, then the first house would need to be Red for the center house to drink Milk (clue 8), but we already know the first house is White (Norwegian lives there). Therefore, the German must live in the fifth house, and since the second house is Red, the fourth house must be Green. This also means that the owner of the Yellow house smokes Bluemaster (since his neighbor cannot drink water), so the owner of the Blue house drinks Beer (clue 12).
   f. Now we know that the center house drinks Milk (clue 8) and since it's not the German (as he lives in the fifth house), it must be either the Dane or the Swede. Since the Dane drinks Tea (clue 3), the center house cannot be the Dane. So, the center house is the Swede. This means that the owner of the second house smokes Pall Mall (clue 6) and rears Birds, and his neighbor drinks Water (clue 15).
   g. We now know the nationalities of all houses: Brit (Red), Norwegian (White), German (Yellow or Blue), Swede (Center), Dane (Tea). Since we already assigned house colors for all except Blue and Green, the only available options for the remaining two are Red and Yellow. Since the owner of the Green house drinks Coffee (clue 5) and the owner of the center house is the Swede (who doesn't drink coffee), the Blue house must be Green. This means the Brit lives in the first house, and since his neighbor cannot drink water (as it's a neighbor to the Blend smoker), he drinks Beer (clue 12).
   h. Now we know that the owner of the second house smokes Pall Mall, rears Birds, and drinks Water (the only remaining option). So the second house is Blue. Since its neighbor must smoke Dunhill, this means the fourth house is Yellow.

4. At this point, we've determined all characteristics for each character. The final step is to find out where **Fish** lives:
   a. Fish cannot live in the first house (as it has been assigned to the Brit).
   b. Fish cannot live in the second house (as it has been assigned to the Blue smoker who rears Birds and drinks Water).
   c. Fish cannot live in the third house (as it has been assigned to the Green house owner, who drinks Coffee).
   d. Fish cannot live in the center house (as it is the Swede who keeps Dogs).
   e. Fish can live in either the fourth or fifth house. Since the fourth house is Yellow and has a neighbor smoking Dunhill, Fish cannot live there. Therefore, Fish lives in the fifth house.

Final answer: **Fish:5**."	Fish:4
Einstein_orig_3	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step. We'll create a table to keep track of the information for each character based on the given clues:

| Color  | Nationality  | Beverage  | Cigar  | Pet     | Position (from left) |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------|---------|--------------------|
|       |             |          |       |         |                    |
| Red    | Brit        | Beer      | Bluemaster | Fish | 1 or 5              |
| Green  | (TBD)       | Coffee   | (TBD)  | Cats   | 2                   |
| Blue   | Norwegian   | (TBD)    | (TBD)  | (TBD)   | 3                   |
| White  | (TBD)       | Milk     | (TBD)  | (TBD)   | 4                   |
| Yellow| Dane        | Tea      | Dunhill | Horses | 5 or 1              |

First, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The Brit lives in a Red house, so we know the Norwegian doesn't live in the Red house (as per clause 9). Let's assign the Norwegian to the Blue house (position 3).
2. From clue 4, we know the Green house is on the left of the White house. Since the position of the Blue house (Norwegian) is known, we can now determine that the Green and White houses must be positioned 1 and 4 respectively.
3. Now we have four positions filled: Green (Swede with Cats), Blue (Norwegian), Red (Brit), White (TBD).
4. From clue 10, we know the Blend smoker lives next to the one who keeps Cats. Since we now know that the Swede keeps Cats and is in position 2, the Blend smoker must be in position 3 or 5. But since the Red house (Brit) already has a resident and the Norwegian is also known, the only remaining option for the Blend smoker would be in position 5.
5. From clue 6, we know the Pall Mall smoker rears Birds. Since there's only one position left for the Dane (clue 9), the only way to fit this information is if the Dane lives in the first house, and thus the Green house owner must be in the second house (Swede with Cats).
6. From clue 13, we know the German smokes Prince. Since there's no room left for the German among the remaining positions (clue 9), the only option is that the British resident, who lives in a Red house, must be the German. That means the remaining position 5 will be taken by the Dane with Tea and Birds.
7. Now we know all nationalities except for one: the owner of the White house (position 4). Since the Blend smoker can't live next to the Brit (as per clue 10), the only remaining option for the White house resident is the Norwegian, which contradicts our previous assumption that the Norwegian lives in the Blue house. However, since we know the Swede lives in the Green house and the Dane in the Yellow house, this leaves only one color left for the White house: White.
8. Finally, with all houses colored, nationalities assigned, and beverages filled (Milk to the center house resident), we can fill in the remaining information about cigars and pets. The final arrangement is as follows:

| Color  | Nationality  | Beverage  | Cigar  | Pet     | Position (from left) |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------|---------|--------------------|
| Green  | Swede       | Coffee   | Pall Mall | Cats   | 2                   |
| Blue   | Norwegian   | (TBD)    | (TBD)  | (TBD)   | 3                   |
| Red    | German      | Beer     | Bluemaster | Fish  | 5                   |
| White  | Dane        | Tea      | Dunhill  | Horses | 1                   |
| Yellow| Brit        | Milk     | Prince  | Birds  | 4                   |

Now, we can find the location of Fish: **Fish:5**. The final solution to this logic puzzle is as follows:
- Color of the Red house: Red
- Nationality living in the Red house: German (Brit in our solution)
- Beverage consumed by the German (Brit): Beer
- Cigar smoked by the German (Brit): Bluemaster
- Pet kept by the German (Brit): Fish
- Location of the Fish: **Fish:5**."	Fish:4
