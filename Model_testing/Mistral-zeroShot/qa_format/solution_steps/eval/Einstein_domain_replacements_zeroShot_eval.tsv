Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbike_1	motorbike	2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know trance fan drives the train and the train's driver isn't on the far left (due to point 9). Since all houses have a specific person, the train driver can only be in one of the remaining four positions. We can mark them as Train-1, Train-2, Train-3, or Train-4 from left to right.

2. The fan of reggae is in September, so we know Reggae = September. Since September isn't on the far left (due to point 9), Reggae can only be in one of the remaining four positions. We can mark them as Reggae-1, Reggae-2, Reggae-3, or Reggae-4 from left to right.

3. The fan of rock is the palace house (Palace = Rock). Since all houses have a specific person and the palace isn't on the far left (due to point 9), it can only be in one of the remaining four positions. We can mark them as Palace-1, Palace-2, Palace-3, or Palace-4 from left to right.

4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (Subway-L, Snowmobile-R). Since the train driver isn't on the far left (due to point 9) and we know that the subway can't be on the far left because it's before the snowmobile (point 4), the subway can only be in one of Train-2, Train-3 positions.

5. The subway is the wooden house (Subway = Wooden). Since all houses have a specific person and the subway isn't on the far left (due to points 4 and 9), it can only be in Subway-2 or Subway-3 position. If it were in Subway-2, then Train-1 would have to be the mechanic (because of point 7) which contradicts point 6 (the mechanic isn't the one with a May birthday). Therefore, Subway-3 and Train-1 are true.

6. Now we know that the person in position Train-1 is the mechanic (Mechanic = Train-1). Since the librarian is to the left or right of the person in June's position (June-Person), the librarian can only be in positions Train-2, Reggae-1, or Reggae-2.

7. The architect has a May birthday (Architect = May). Since we know that the mechanic is in position Train-1 and the librarian isn't in June's position, Architect can only be in positions Palace-1, Reggae-3, or Reggae-4.

8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (Gothic-Revival = Middle). Since we know the subway and the architect are to the left of it, Subway-3, Architect can only be either Palace-1 or Reggae-3. However, if Architect were in Palace-1, it would contradict point 4 since Train-2 (rock) would have to be on the far right which is impossible due to points 9 and 15. Therefore, Architect = Reggae-3.

9. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Folk = Motorbike's neighbor). Since we know that the architect is in position Reggae-3 and it contradicts point 14 if Folk were in Reggae-4, Folk can only be in positions Subway-2 or Train-2.

10. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (MotorbikeMaster = Ranch-Style). Since we know that the mechanic is in position Train-1 and the architect is in position Reggae-3, MotorbikeMaster can only be either Subway-2 or Train-2. However, if MotorbikeMaster were in Train-2, it would contradict point 1 because the fan of trance drives the train which isn't possible since Train-2 isn't a person (point 5). Therefore, MotorbikeMaster = Subway-2.

11. Now we know that Folk is in position Subway-2 and the motorbikemaster is in position Subway-3. Since all houses have a specific person and the motorbike master isn't on the far left (due to point 9), Folk must be the bartender (Folk = Bartender).

12. The fan of ambient is the bartender (Ambient = Bartender). Since we know that the architect is in position Reggae-3, Ambient can only be in positions Train-2 or Subway-4. However, if Ambient were in Train-2, it would contradict point 13 because there's no trance fan (point 1) and reggae fan (point 2). Therefore, Ambient = Subway-4.

13. The librarian is to the left or right of the futuristic house (Librarian = Futuristic Neighbor). Since we know that the mechanic is in position Train-1 and the bartender is in position Subway-2, the librarian can only be in positions Reggae-1, Reggae-4, or Wooden-2. However, if Librarian were in Wooden-2, it would contradict point 5 because the subway can't be there. Therefore, Librarian = Reggae-1.

14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Folk = Motorbike's neighbor). Since we know that the bartender is in position Subway-2 and the librarian is in position Reggae-1, Folk must be in position Train-2.

15. The quad-bike driver is the mechanic (Quad-Bike = Mechanic). Since all houses have a specific person and we know that the quad-bike driver isn't on the far left or right (due to points 9 and 15), it can only be in position Train-4.

16. The fan of ambient is on the far right (Ambient = Far-Right). Since we know that the mechanic is in position Train-4, Ambient can only be in positions Subway-4 or Wooden-2. However, if Ambient were in Wooden-2, it would contradict point 5 because the subway can't be there. Therefore, Ambient = Subway-4.

17. Now we know that Folk is in position Train-2 and the ambient fan is in position Subway-4. Since all houses have a specific person and the librarian isn't on the far left (due to point 6), June's person must be in positions Wooden or Reggae-1. However, if it were in Wooden, it would contradict point 5 because the subway can't be there. Therefore, June's person = Reggae-1.

18. The remaining person with a birthday in July (July Person) must be in positions Gothic-Revival or Wooden-2 since all houses have a specific person and no one can be on the far left or right (due to points 9 and 15). However, if it were in Wooden-2, it would contradict point 16 because the ambient fan is there. Therefore, July Person = Gothic-Revival.

19. The remaining person with a birthday in September (September Person) must be in positions Train-3 or Subway-3 since all houses have a specific person and no one can be on the far left or right (due to points 9 and 15). However, if it were in Train-3, it would contradict point 1 because the fan of trance drives the train which isn't possible since there's no train driver in that position. Therefore, September Person = Subway-3.

20. Since all houses have a specific person, the remaining person with a birthday in August (August Person) must be in position Wooden-1.

Now we can arrange the people according to their birthdays and houses:
- August: Wooden-1 (Train-3 is taken so it can't be there)
- July: Gothic-Revival (September Person)
- September: Subway-3 (Quad-Bike = Mechanic)
- Reggae-1: June (Reggae person)
- Train-2: Folk (Fan of folk)
- Subway-4: Ambient (Fan of ambient)
- Subway-2: Bartender (Fan of folk)
- Train-1: Mechanic (Quad-Bike driver)
- Subway-3: September Person (September)

Finally, we can arrange the houses according to their occupants:
- Wooden: August
- Gothic-Revival: July
- Train: September -> Folk (Fan of folk) -> June (Reggae person) -> Mechanic (Quad-Bike driver)
- Subway: Bartender (Fan of folk) -> Ambient (Fan of ambient) -> Mechanic (Quad-Bike driver)

And the fan of trance must be in position Train-3 since it's the only remaining house and person without a birthday, which also satisfies point 1."	motorbike:2		False	False

| (unknown) | Folk        | (unknown)   | Librarian      | July              | Left or Right of Mechanic|

Since the trance fan is the person driving the train, we know that Train = Trance. Now let's use this information to fill in more columns:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style | Job | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Motorbike | (unknown)  | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster | June              |                   |
| Subway    | (unknown)  | Wooden      | (unknown)        | May               | Left of Snowmobile |
| Train     | Trance     | (unknown)   | (unknown)        | (unknown)          | On the track       |
| Snowmobile | (unknown)  | Palace     | (unknown)        | September         | Right of Subway    |
| Quad-bike | (unknown)  | Gothic-revival  | Mechanic | (unknown)          |                   |

| (unknown) | Folk        | (unknown)   | Librarian      | July              | Left or Right of Mechanic|

From condition 4, we know that the subway is on the left of snowmobile. Therefore, Subway = May and Snowmobile = September are now known:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style | Job | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Motorbike | (unknown)  | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster | June              |                   |
| May       | (unknown)  | Wooden      | (unknown)        | May               | Left of September   |
| Train     | Trance     | (unknown)   | (unknown)        | (unknown)          | On the track       |

| (unknown) | Folk        | (unknown)   | Librarian      | July              | Left or Right of Mechanic|

Since the fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September, Reggae = September:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style | Job | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Motorbike | (unknown)  | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster | June              |                   |
| May       | (unknown)  | Wooden      | (unknown)        | May               | Left of September   |
| Train     | Trance     | (unknown)   | (unknown)        | (unknown)          | On the track       |
| September | Reggae     | Palace     | (unknown)        | September         | Right of May        |
| Quad-bike | (unknown)  | Gothic-revival  | Mechanic | (unknown)          |                   |
| (unknown) | Rock       | Futuristic  | Architect     | May               |                   |
| (unknown) | Ambient    | (unknown)   | Bartender      | (unknown)          |                   |
| (unknown) | Folk        | (unknown)   | Librarian      | July              | Left or Right of Mechanic|

Continuing with the conditions, since the fan of rock is the palace house, Rock = Palace. Now we can find the job of the person driving the train:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style | Job | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Motorbike | (unknown)  | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster | June              |                   |

| (unknown) | Ambient    | (unknown)   | Bartender      | (unknown)          |                   |
| (unknown) | Folk        | (unknown)   | Librarian      | July              | Left or Right of Mechanic|

Since the architect is the person whose birthday is in May, Architect = May:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style | Job | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Motorbike | (unknown)  | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster | June              |                   |
| May       | (unknown)  | Wooden      | (unknown)        | May               | Left of September   |
| Train     | Trance     | Palace     | Architect     | May               | On the track       |
| September | Reggae     | Palace     | (unknown)        | September         | Right of May        |

| (unknown) | Folk        | (unknown)   | Librarian      | July              | Left or Right of Mechanic|

Since the gothic-revival house cannot be a palace, Quad-bike = Gothic-revival:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style | Job | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Motorbike | (unknown)  | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster | June              |                   |
| May       | (unknown)  | Wooden      | (unknown)        | May               | Left of September   |
| Train     | Trance     | Palace     | Architect     | May               | On the track       |
| September | Reggae     | Palace     | (unknown)        | September         | Right of May        |
| Gothic-revival| (unknown)  | Gothic-revival  | Mechanic | (unknown)          |                   |
| (unknown) | Rock       | Futuristic  | Architect     | May               |                   |
| (unknown) | Ambient    | (unknown)   | Bartender      | (unknown)          |                   |
| (unknown) | Folk        | (unknown)   | Librarian      | July              | Left or Right of Gothic-revival|

Since the gothic-revival house cannot be on the left side, Librarian = July and Mechanic = Gothic-revival:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style | Job | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Motorbike | (unknown)  | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster | June              |                   |
| May       | (unknown)  | Wooden      | (unknown)        | May               | Left of September   |
| Train     | Trance     | Palace     | Architect     | May               | On the track       |
| September | Reggae     | Palace     | (unknown)        | September         | Right of May        |

| (unknown) | Ambient    | (unknown)   | Bartender      | July              | Right of Gothic-revival|

Now we can find the job of the person riding the motorbike:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style | Job | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Motorbike | (unknown)  | Ranch-style | Bartender   | June            |                   |
| May       | (unknown)  | Wooden      | (unknown)        | May               | Left of September   |
| Train     | Trance     | Palace     | Architect     | May               | On the track       |
| September | Reggae     | Palace     | (unknown)        | September         | Right of May        |

| (unknown) | Ambient    | (unknown)   | Bartender      | July              | Right of Gothic-revival|

Since the motorbike cannot be ridden by the architect, Motorbike = Bartender:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style | Job | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Bartender | (unknown)  | Ranch-style | Bartender   | June            |                   |

| (unknown) | Ambient    | (unknown)   | Bartender      | July              | Right of Gothic-revival|

Now we can find the music genre for the motorbike rider:

|-----------|------------|------------|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| Bartender | Rock       | Ranch-style | Bartender   | June            |                   |

| Train     | Trance     | Palace     | Architect     | May               | On the track       |
| September | Reggae     | Palace     | (unknown)        | September         | Right of May        |

| (unknown) | (unknown)  | (unknown)   | Bartender      | July              | Right of Gothic-revival|

Since the motorbike rider cannot have ambient music, the unknown music genre for the architect must be Ambient:

| (unknown) | (unknown)  | (unknown)   | Bartender      | July              | Right of Gothic-revival|

Now we can find the house style for the architect:

| Futuristic | Ambient    | Ranch-"	motorbike:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbike_3	motorbike	2	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's follow these steps:

1. Assign a number (1 to 5) to each person based on their birthday month. Since we know the birthdays are in five different months, assigning numbers sequentially will give us unique values for each person.

   - June -> 1
   - May -> 2
   - September -> 3
   - February -> 4
   - July -> 5

2. Assign a number (A to E) to each house based on the given house styles. Since there are five different houses, assigning letters sequentially will give us unique values for each house.

   - Ranch-style -> A
   - Wooden -> B
   - Gothic-revival -> C (Middle)
   - Palace -> D
   - Futuristic -> E

3. Based on the given clues:

   - Trance fan is driving the train, so trance fan = Train driver = 4 (Since train driver can't be a mechanic or librarian according to clue 7 and 10, and they already have numbers)
   - Reggae fan has birthday in September, so reggae fan = Person with birthday in September = 3
   - Rock is the palace house, so rock = Palace house = D
   - Subway driver is on the left of snowmobile driver. Since we don't know their exact positions yet, let's assume subway driver is number 1 or 2 and snowmobile driver is number 3 or 4 (we can swap them later if necessary). For now, let's assign subway driver as number 1 and snowmobile driver as number 4.
   - Subway driver is the wooden house, so subway driver = Wooden house = B
   - The architect is the person with birthday in May, so architect = Person with birthday in May = 2
   - Quad-bike driver is the mechanic (clue 7), but we don't know their exact position yet. Let's assign quad-bike driver as number 5 (mechanic), since it's the only remaining number for the people.

4. Now let's use other clues to place the remaining people:

   - Folk fan is on the left of motorbike, so folk fan must be 1 or 2, but not 5 (mechanic) or 3 (snowmobile driver). Let's assign folk fan as number 1 for now. This leaves us with June person as the folk fan since they are still available and neither can be on the far left.
   - Ambient fan is the bartender, so ambient fan = Bartender = ? (We will find this later using other clues)
   - Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (clue 8), we already know its position, but we don't know who lives there yet. Let's skip this for now.
   - The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, so since we know that June person is the folk fan, they must be driving the motorbike. So, Motorbike driver = Person with birthday in June = 1

5. Now let's find the remaining positions:

   - The librarian is on the left or right of the person with birthday in July (clue 11), but we don't know their exact position yet, so let's assign librarian as number 2 for now since it's the only available spot. However, this contradicts clue 10 that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (Already assigned as motorbike driver), so we need to swap them:
     - Swap librarian and July person positions: Librarian = Person with birthday in July = 5, July person = Librarian = 2
   - The fan of ambient is the bartender (clue 13), but we don't know their exact position yet. Let's assume bartender is number 3 for now. However, this contradicts clue 4 that the fan of rock is the palace house (D). If we assign rock to the person with birthday in May (architect) and reggae to the person with birthday in September (number 3), then ambient can only be assigned to the remaining person with birthday in February, but it contradicts clue 9 that the fan of folk is on the far left. So, we need to swap the positions of the February and May persons:
     - Swap February and May persons positions: Ambient fan = Person with birthday in May = 2, Rock fan = Person with birthday in February = 4
   - The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (clue 15), but we already know their position now. Since the librarian (number 2) can't be on the far right due to clue 9, let's place them on the left of futuristic house:
     - Place librarian (number 2) on the left of futuristic house
   - Now let's find a suitable position for the fan of ambient (bartender). Since the motorbike driver is already assigned and the librarian (birthday in July) is on their left, bartender can only be on the right side. However, we need to ensure that the remaining person with birthday in June (the folk fan) is on the far left as per clue 9. So, let's place bartender (ambient fan) in the middle:
     - Place bartender (ambient fan) in the middle of the lineup (position C)
   - Now we have only one remaining position for the person with birthday in June. They must be on the far left due to clue 9, and since they are not a mechanic, librarian, or architect, they can only be either the motorbike master or the fan of folk. Since the fan of folk is already assigned (number 1), let's assign this person as the motorbikemaster:
     - Place motorbikemaster (June person) on the far left (position A)

6. Now that we have placed all people, let's find their corresponding means of transport and jobs based on the given clues:

   - Motorbike driver = Person with birthday in June = 1 = Motorbikemaster (A)
   - Subway driver = Person with birthday in May = 2 = Architect (B)
   - Snowmobile driver = Person with birthday in February = 4 = Rock fan (D)
   - Quad-bike driver = Person with birthday in July = 5 = Librarian (2)
   - The remaining person with birthday in September = 3 is the reggae fan. Since there are only four means of transport left, this person must not have a vehicle:
     - Place reggae fan on position F (no vehicle)

7. Now let's find the corresponding houses based on their positions and people's jobs:

   - Motorbike master lives in the ranch-style house (clue 12), so motorbike master = Ranch-style house = A
   - Architect lives in the subway, so architect = Subway = B
   - Rock fan lives in the palace house (D), so palace house = Snowmobile driver = D
   - Librarian lives on position 2, but we don't know their corresponding house yet. Let's find it by looking for a suitable job for them:
     - Since the librarian can be on any side of the lineup (clue 15), they could potentially live in either of the remaining houses. However, if we consider that the fan of ambient is in the middle (position C), it would make more sense if the librarian lived closer to the motorbike master (on the right side). So, let's place the librarian in the futuristic house:
       - Librarian = Futuristic house = E
   - The remaining person with birthday in September is reggae fan and doesn't have a vehicle. Since there are only three houses left, this person must live in one of them:
     - Place reggae fan (no vehicle) on position G (futuristic house)

8. Now that we have placed all people and their corresponding jobs and means of transport, let's find the remaining house for the bartender (ambient fan):

   - The bartender lives in the middle of the lineup (position C), so we need to find a suitable house for them:
     - Since the motorbike master lives in the ranch-style house, the librarian lives in the futuristic house, and the reggae fan doesn't have a vehicle, it would make sense if the bartender lived in the remaining house (the gothic-revival house). So, let's place the bartender in the gothic-revival house:
       - Bartender = Gothic-revival house = position C

**Result:**

People with their corresponding means of transport and jobs are as follows:

1. Motorbikemaster (A) (Motorbike)
2. Architect (B) (Subway)
3. Reggae fan (F) (No vehicle)
4. Rock fan (D) (Snowmobile)
5. Librarian (2) (Quad-bike)
6. Bartender (C) (Gothic-revival house)
7. Reggae fan (G) (No vehicle)

Houses and their corresponding people are as follows:

A. Ranch-style house (Motorbikemaster)
B. Subway (Architect)
C. Gothic-revival house (Bartender)
D. Palace house (Rock fan)
E. Futuristic house (Librarian)
F. No vehicle (Reggae fan)
G. No vehicle (Reggae fan)"	motorbike:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbike_4	motorbike	2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down into smaller parts and solve each condition step by step.

1. Assign a number to each person based on their birth month (in the order given). So, June = 1, May = 2, September = 3, February = 4, July = 5.
2. Distribute music genres to people in such a way that each genre is assigned to one person. Since there are only 5 genres and 5 people, this can be done easily.

   | Person | Birthday | Music Genre | Transport | Job       | House      |
   |-------|---------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
   | A     | June    | Trance     | Train    | Motorbikemaster | Ranch-style |
   | B     | May     | Rock       | Subway   | Architect  | Palace     |
   | C     | September | Reggae    | Snowmobile| Mechanic  | Wooden     |
   | D     | February | Ambient   | Quad-bike| Bartender | Gothic-revival |
   | E     | July    | Folk       | Motorbike| Librarian  | Futuristic |

3. Now let's distribute the transports based on the given conditions.

   Since we already know the genre and birthday of each person, let's solve the transport condition step by step:

   4. The subway driver (B) is to the left of snowmobile driver (C). So B < C.
   5. The subway driver (B) lives in a wooden house (2nd condition). So B = 5-index(wooden) = 5-2 = 3 (since we know that C has index 5, and wood is the second condition from the end). This means our transport distribution so far is:

   | Person | Birthday | Music Genre | Transport | Job       | House      |
   |-------|---------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
   | A     | June    | Trance     | Train    | Motorbikemaster | Ranch-style |
   | B     | May     | Rock       | Subway   | Architect  | Wooden     |
   | C     | September | Reggae    | Snowmobile| Mechanic  |           |
   | D     | February | Ambient   | Quad-bike| Bartender | Gothic-revival |
   | E     | July    | Folk       | Motorbike| Librarian  | Futuristic |

   6. The architect (B) has a birthday in May (2nd condition). So B = 2 (since we know that A has index 1, and May is the second person from the beginning).

   Now we need to relocate the subway driver (B) to the correct place:

   | Person | Birthday | Music Genre | Transport | Job       | House      |
   |-------|---------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
   | A     | June    | Trance     | Train    | Motorbikemaster | Ranch-style |
   | B     | May     | Rock       | Subway   | Architect  | Wooden     |
   | C     | September | Reggae    | Snowmobile| Mechanic  |           |
   | D     | February | Ambient   | Quad-bike| Bartender | Gothic-revival |
   | E     | July    | Folk       | Motorbike| Librarian  | Futuristic |

   7. The mechanic (C) is the motorcycle driver (7th condition). So C = 5, and we know that C's transport is snowmobile. This means our transport distribution remains unchanged.

   Now we need to find out which houses are located where:

   8. The gothic-revival house (D) is in the middle (3rd condition). Since we know the position of C, D must be somewhere on the left or right of C. So, we can only assign D as the 1st or 4th person. But since folk is on the far left (14th condition), D cannot be the first person. So D = 4.

   | Person | Birthday | Music Genre | Transport | Job       | House      |
   |-------|---------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
   | A     | June    | Trance     | Train    | Motorbikemaster | Ranch-style |
   | B     | May     | Rock       | Subway   | Architect  | Wooden     |
   | C     | September | Reggae    | Snowmobile| Mechanic  |           |
   | D     | February | Ambient   | Quad-bike| Bartender | Gothic-revival |
   | E     | July    | Folk       | Motorbike| Librarian  | Futuristic |

   9. The fan of folk (D) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (A). Since D cannot be the first person, the only option is that A is on the far right and E is on the far left. So A = 1, and E = 5.

   | Person | Birthday | Music Genre | Transport | Job       | House      |
   |-------|---------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
   | A     | June    | Trance     | Train    | Motorbikemaster | Ranch-style |
   | B     | May     | Rock       | Subway   | Architect  | Wooden     |
   | C     | September | Reggae    | Snowmobile| Mechanic  |           |
   | D     | February | Ambient   | Quad-bike| Bartender | Gothic-revival |
   | E     | July    | Folk       | Motorbike| Librarian  | Futuristic |

   10. The librarian (E) is on the left or right of the futuristic house (5th condition). Since we know that E is on the far left, the futuristic house must be somewhere in the middle, between B and C. But since the gothic-revival house (D) is at position 4, the only option for the futuristic house is position 3. So the order becomes:

   | Person | Birthday | Music Genre | Transport | Job       | House      |
   |-------|---------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
   | A     | June    | Trance     | Train    | Motorbikemaster | Ranch-style |
   | B     | May     | Rock       | Subway   | Architect  | Wooden     |
   | C     | September | Reggae    | Snowmobile| Mechanic  | Gothic-revival |
   | D     | February | Ambient   | Quad-bike| Bartender | Futuristic  |
   | E     | July    | Folk       | Motorbike| Librarian  |           |

   11. The person who's birthday is July (E) is on the motorbike (7th condition). Since we already assigned E as the motorbike driver, no need to change anything.

   Now we only have one remaining condition:

   12. The librarian (E) is not at position 5 (since E is not at position 5). But since all other positions are occupied, this means there is a mistake in the problem statement or the conditions provided are insufficient to determine the correct order.

So we have found that the person who is driving the train and has trance music as their genre, works as a motorbikemaster and lives at the ranch-style house is June (Person A). However, due to an error in the problem statement or missing conditions, we cannot definitively assign the other four individuals."	motorbike:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbike_5	motorbike	2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step and assign each person/object a number based on their respective properties. I will use lowercase letters (a-e) for people and capital letters (A-E) for objects.

Firstly, we can determine the following:
1. Person A (trance fan) drives the train.
2. Person E (reggae fan) has a birthday in September.
3. Person C (rock fan) lives in the palace house.
4. The subway driver is Person B and is on the left of Person D (snowmobile driver).
5. Person B lives in the wooden house.
6. Person F (architect) has a birthday in May.
7. Person G (mechanic) drives the quad-bike.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, which means it's either D or E. As E is already assigned to someone, let's assume that D is the gothic-revival house.
9. Person A (trance fan) is on the far left. So, A = folk fan and K = librarian must be on the right of A (i.e., B, C, or E).
10. The motorbike driver must be either A, B, C, D, or E as they are the only ones left. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June, which means K is on the left of Person I (motorbike driver). So I can't be A, B, or C because they already have a neighbor. Let's assume I = D. This means E = A and J = K.
11. The person who's birthday is in July (H) must be on the left or right of the mechanic (G). Since G can't be on the far right due to point 9, let's assume H = B. This means F = I.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. As there are only two houses left for motorbikemaster and librarian (ranch-style and futuristic), let's assume L = librarian is in the futuristic house. So, I = motorbikemaster.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. This means J = L as they are neighbors according to point 13.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (I). But I already know that K is on the left of I, so let's assume N = folk fan is on the right of I (i.e., A). This means that H has no neighbor on the right, which contradicts point 11.

There seems to be a contradiction in the given information, and it makes solving the puzzle impossible. We need to revise some of the clues provided."	motorbike:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbike_6	motorbike	2	" To solve this puzzle, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the people based on their music preferences (from points 1-4) and assign them to variables (e.g., A for trance fan, R for reggae fan, etc.).

2. Assign jobs to the identified people based on points 6 and 7 (e.g., A is an architect, G is a mechanic).

3. Identify the house types from points 5 and 8-10 (e.g., S is subway driver in wooden house, M is the person driving the motorbike in ranch-style house).

4. Assign months to the remaining variables based on point 2 (J for June, M for May, F for February, etc.).

5. Place the people and houses according to the given conditions (points 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).

After solving, we can identify the motorbike user:

- The fan of trance is the person driving the train (A), so the train driver can't be M.
- The fan of rock is the palace house (R), and the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so the subway driver (S) and snowmobile driver (X) can't be R or G.
- The person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile (S<X).
- The fan of ambient is the bartender (Amb), and the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver (M) (Folk_L or Folk_R).
- The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, so the mechanic can't be L.
- The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, and the fan of rock can't be M.

From point 5, we know that S is in the middle (between X and M). However, since M is on the far left due to Folk_L or Folk_R, it means that both S and M have to occupy the two available slots before reaching the center. This isn't possible as S has already taken one slot, leaving no room for M (on the far left).

The puzzle seems contradictory because it forces M to be on the far left according to points 9, 14, and 15 but also places M in the middle position due to points 4 and 6. In such cases, it is essential to check for inconsistencies or errors in the given information. If the puzzle is correct, then it might be impossible to find a consistent arrangement based on the provided conditions."	motorbike:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbike_7	motorbike	2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train. Let's assign roles based on their house types (since we have a unique house for each person). So, train driver = gothic-revival (as it is in the middle).

2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September. Since there are no other given constraints regarding this information, let's just remember that fact.

3. We know the fan of rock lives in the palace house. Let's assign roles based on transport types (since we have a unique transport for each person). So, rock fan = motorbike (as there is no subway, train, snowmobile, or quad-bike left).

4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the motorbike driver is the rock fan and isn't a candidate for either role, let's assign these roles to remaining candidates. So, subway driver = quad-bike (as snowmobile has already been assigned) and snowmobile driver = mechanic.

5. The person driving the subway lives in the wooden house. Since we know the subway driver is the quad-bike, let's assign roles based on house types. So, subway driver = wooden (since gothic-revival and palace have already been assigned).

6. The architect has a birthday in May. Let's remember this fact for later use.

7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since we know the quad-bike driver is the wooden house, let's remember that fact for later use.

8. Now we have to assign the remaining roles based on the given information:
   - The fan of folk is on the far left and not next to the motorbike driver. So, since the mechanic (who drives the quad-bike) and the librarian are on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, and neither can be the motorbike driver, let's assign the fan of folk to the librarian.
   - Since the fan of folk is not next to the motorbike driver (librarian), the remaining candidate for the motorbike driver must be on the far right. Since the mechanic (who drives the quad-bike) cannot be the motorbike driver, and the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, the motorbike driver is the bartender.
   - The fan of ambient is the bartender. We don't have any remaining roles to assign based on this information.

Now let's assign the remaining houses based on jobs:
- Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike, he cannot live in the wooden house (as it was already assigned). So, mechanic = futuristic (since there are no other houses left).
- Since the architect has a birthday in May and we have assigned all other roles based on that information, let's remember this fact for later use.
- Since the librarian is the fan of folk and is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (motorbike driver) and the mechanic, and since the mechanic lives in the futuristic house, the only remaining house is palace. So, librarian = palace.

Finally, let's determine the birthdays:
- Since the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, we have already assigned that fact.
- Since the architect has a birthday in May and we have assigned all other roles based on that information, let's remember this fact for later use.
- Since the person driving the motorbike (bartender) is the fan of ambient, and since we know the bartender cannot live in the wooden house (as it was already assigned), the only remaining month for the bartender's birthday is june. So, bartender = June.
- Since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, and we have assigned all other roles based on that information, let's remember this fact for later use.
- Since the librarian is the person who's birthday is in july (since the motorbike driver is the bartender), we have already assigned that fact.

Now let's summarize the results:
1. motorbikemaster = ranch-style house
2. architect = gothic-revival house
3. rock fan = motorbike (role) and motorbike driver = bartender (since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house)
4. subway driver = quad-bike, snowmobile driver = mechanic
5. wooden house = subway, palace house = rock fan (role)
6. futuristic house = mechanic
7. librarian = palace, June = bartender, September = reggae fan, May = architect
8. folk fan = librarian, July = librarian
9. ambient fan = bartender (role), trance fan = gothic-revival (since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house)

Finally, let's determine where is **motorbike**:
**motorbike:2** (since the motorbike driver is the bartender, and the bartender's birthday is in June)"	motorbike:2	motorbike:2	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbike_8	motorbike	2	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a methodical approach to eliminate possibilities and find correlations. Here's my solution:

1. We know that trance is associated with the train, so let's assign ""train"" to Trance (T).
2. Reggae's fan has birthday in September, but we don't have any open transport options for this month yet. Let's mark it as a question mark (?). We can also mark its genre (Reggae, R) and birth month (September, S).
3. Rock is associated with the palace house, so let's assign ""palace"" to Rock (Rock_P).
4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since we don't know their positions yet, let's mark the subway as (?), and the snowmobile as X.
5. The subway is also the wooden house, so let's assign ""wooden"" to the subway (W).
6. The architect has birthday in May, so we have Rock_P for the palace, and now we can place the architect between the subway (W) and motorbike (M), because they cannot be on the same side as the librarian (Lib), who is related to the June birthday (J).
7. The quad-bike driver is the mechanic. Since we don't know any open positions for the mechanic yet, let's mark the quad-bike as (?). We can also assign ""mechanic"" to this person (Mec).
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it must be between the subway (W) and motorbike (M), and after architect (Arch). Since the librarian cannot be on the same side as the June birthday, the only option left for the gothic-revival house is to its right. Let's mark it as Gr_R.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since we know that the gothic-revival house (Gr_R) cannot be on the same side as June birthday, and the mechanic (Mec) is already positioned, the only open position on the left for folk (Folk_L) is before subway (W).
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since we know that Folk_L is on the left and Mec is on a known position, there are only two remaining positions for Lib: to the left or after Folk_L. But the architect (Arch) cannot be before Folk_L since folk is on the far left. So the librarian must be on its right, after Folk_L and Mec, meaning that June birthday is between Lib and Mec. Let's mark it as J (June).
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we know that July birthday must be after J (June), the only option for July (July_L) is between Mec and Arch.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, so let's assign ""ranch-style"" to Motorbike (M).
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender, so we have Ambient (Amb) for the bartender. Since we know that Folk_L is on the left, and July_L cannot be before J (June), the only open position for Amb (ambient) is after Gr_R.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we already positioned Folk_L to the left, it means that Motorbike (M) must be on the right of July_L and J. But since the snowmobile (X) is on the right of subway (W), which implies that there's no open position for motorbike (M) between them, so it can only be placed to the left of Gr_R, after July_L and J. Let's mark it as M:3.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we already know that Lib is on its right, there are only two remaining positions for Futuristic (Fut): to the right of Gr_R and before J or after July_L. But since Amb (ambient) must be after Gr_R, it means that Fut cannot be before J, so it must be after July_L. Let's mark it as Fut:5.

So here is our final solution with all the corresponding positions filled in:
- Trance: T
- Reggae: R, S, ?
- Rock: Rock_P
- Subway: W, ?
- Snowmobile: X,
- Motorbike: M:3
- Mechanic: Mec
- Architect: Arch
- Librarian: Lib
- June birthday: J
- July birthday: July_L
- Ambient: Amb, after Gr_R
- Folk: Folk_L, before M
- Gothic-revival house: Gr_R, after W and before M
- Futuristic house: Fut, after July_L and J"	motorbike:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbike_9	motorbike	2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign a number to each person based on their birthday month (June=1, May=2, September=3, February=4, July=5).

2. From point 1, we know the fan of trance is the person driving the train, which is not specified in terms of a number yet. The only transport left for trance is motorbike or quad-bike, but since the mechanic drives the quad-bike (point 7), the fan of trance can't be the mechanic and must be our train driver. So let's assign '16' to the fan of trance as it's not used yet.

3. The person driving the subway is in position 5 (point 5) and is the wooden house (point 5). Since gothic-revival, palace, futuristic, and ranch-style are already assigned to people based on their jobs or genre preferences, the only remaining option for 'wooden' is our subway driver. So let's assign '6' to the subway driver.

4. Now we have two people left without a number: the fan of reggae (person 3) and the motorbikemaster. Since the reggae fan's birthday is in September, we already know their number is 3. The only remaining option for the fan of reggae is the mechanic or librarian. However, since the librarian can't be on the left or right of the June person (point 10), the reggae fan must be the mechanic, so we assign '4' to the mechanic.

5. From point 9 and 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left and on the left or right of the motorbike driver. The only unassigned person on the left is the bartender (ambient fan), so let's assign '13' to the bartender. This means our fan of folk, who must be either the architect or librarian, can't be the librarian since they are already positioned to the left of the futuristic house (point 15). So let's assign '8' to the architect.

6. From point 10 and 11, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the June person (person 1) and on the left or right of the mechanic (person 4). Since there's only one remaining position on the left, the librarian must be at position 2, making the motorbikemaster our last unassigned person. Therefore, the motorbikemaster must be '12'.

7. From point 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we already assigned numbers to the wooden, futuristic houses, and one side is filled with '13' (bartender) on the left, '8' (architect) in the middle, and '4' (mechanic) on the right, the gothic-revival house must be on the other side. Since there are no more houses left unassigned, this means our motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house.

In conclusion:
1. Motorbike: 12 (ranch-style house)"	motorbike:2	motorbike:12	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbike_10	motorbike	2	" To solve this logic puzzle, we will assign numbers to each person based on their characteristics and then use the given clues to fill in the gaps.

Let's start by assigning a number to each of the five people:
1. Trance fan (driving train): T
2. Reggae fan (birthday in September): R
3. Rock fan: unknown yet, let's call it X
4. Subway driver: S
5. Birthday in May (architect): M
6. Quad-bike driver (mechanic): Q
7. Gothic-revival house (middle position): GR (let's assume the houses are numbered from left to right)
8. Folk fan (left or far left): F1 (we don't know yet if it's the same as F4)
9. Snowmobile driver: unknown yet, let's call it W
10. Motorbike driver: B
11. Birthday in July: J
12. Librarian (left or right of June's birthday): L
13. Ambient fan (bartender): A
14. Futuristic house: F (we don't know yet if it's the same as F1 or F4)

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the missing pieces:

1. T is driving the train -> T = 5
2. R's birthday is in September -> R = 3
3. X is the palace house (GR - 3) -> X = GR + 3
4. S is on the left of W -> W > S, but we don't know their positions yet
5. S is the wooden house (S = 4 or 5 because there are only two houses left)
6. M has a birthday in May -> M = 2
7. Q drives the quad-bike -> Q = 1
8. GR is in the middle -> GR = 3
9. F1 (folk fan) is on the far left or left of B -> F1 <= B
10. L is on the left or right of June's birthday -> L <= B or B + 1, but we don't know their positions yet
11. J is on the left or right of Q -> J >= 1 or J <= 2
12. T (motorbikemaster) is the ranch-style house -> 5 = 1, so T can be any of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6
13. A (ambient fan) is the bartender -> A = 6 because A is not T, R, X, Q, M, F1, L, J and there are only two jobs left
14. F4 (folk fan) is on the left or right of B -> F4 <= B or B + 1
15. L (librarian) is on the left or right of F -> L < F because F > GR

Now, we can deduce that F1 and F4 are the same person (Folk fan), and they must be either 2 or 3, but since T (motorbikemaster) should be a number other than 2 and 3, F4 cannot be 2. So, F4 = 3 and F1 is not assigned yet.

Let's assume that B = 4:
- This means that L is the bartender (A), so L = 6. Therefore, J must be on the left of Q because there are no more spaces to the right of Q.
- With J on the left of Q and L on the left of F, we can only place S on the far right since it's the only remaining position. So, S = 5 (wooden house).

Now, we know that W must be 1 or 4 because there are only two positions left for the snowmobile driver. However, placing W = 1 would mean that Q is in the middle, but since Q is driving the quad-bike, this contradicts clue 7. Therefore, W = 4.

Since W is on the right of S, and F is on the left of L (bartender), the only remaining position for B (motorbike driver) is 2. This means that T is in the ranch-style house (1). So, we now have all positions assigned except for R (Reggae fan).

Since T (Trance fan) is already placed, and X (Rock fan) is palace, neither of them can be reggae. Moreover, since F4 is folk and Q is quad-bike driver, they also cannot be reggae. This means that R must be either M (architect), L (librarian), or W (snowmobile). However, since there are already three assigned numbers, R must be one of the remaining numbers: S or B.

We know that both S and B have been left of someone else in the arrangement, but neither of them can be reggae because all other fans are already placed. Therefore, this arrangement is inconsistent with the given clues, making it impossible to find a valid solution."	motorbike:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_subway_1	subway	3	" This puzzle involves finding the positions and characteristics of the people (including their jobs, music preferences, birthdays, and houses) based on the given clues. Here's a step-by-step solution for this logic puzzle:

1. Identify the common elements between each group of 5 items (transport, music, house style, job, birth month). Assign each unique item a number from 1 to 5.

Transport: motorbike(1), subway(2), train(3), snowmobile(4), quad-bike(5)
Music: trance(1), rock(2), ambient(3), folk(4), reggae(5)
House: ranch-style(1), wooden(2), gothic-revival(3), palace(4), futuristic(5)
Job: motorbikemaster(1), mechanic(2), architect(3), bartender(4), librarian(5)
Birth month: june(1), may(2), september(3), february(4), july(5)

2. Apply the given clues to fill in the missing information and establish relationships between people/items (for example, ""the fan of trance is the person driving the train"" -> 1 = 3).

Now we know that:
- The maroon convertible (house 3) is occupied by the person who wrote the song (person 3). His age is less than 5 years.
- The ivory house (house 2) is occupied by the painter (person 2). Her age is more than 4 years.
- The palisander house (house 5) is not a neighbor of any other house, so it must be empty or occupied by someone whose age we don't know yet.
- The composer (person 5) lives in the house number 6 and his/her age is more than 1 year and less than or equal to 4 years. We also know that he/she is not a neighbor of houses 2, 3, or 5.
- The house number 4 contains the song (person 4) which has an age less than 5 years.

Now let's find out who lives in each house:

1. Since the composer (5) is not a neighbor of house 1 and his/her age is more than 1 year, it can only be the singer (1).
2. Similarly, since the painter (2) is not a neighbor of house 1 and her age is more than 4 years, it cannot be the singer (1), so it must be someone else. Since all other houses are already occupied, let's assume person 6 lives in house 1 (age unknown).
3. Now we can assign the painter to house 2 since it's her age fits and she is not a neighbor of any other house.
4. The maroon convertible (house 3) belongs to the songwriter (person 3), so he/she must be the singer (1).
5. Since the composer (5) lives in house 6, it leaves the palisander house (5) empty as there are no other options left for him/her.
6. Now we know that the song (person 4) has an age less than 5 years and is not a neighbor of any other house. Since all houses except 1 and 5 are already occupied, let's assume the song was written by person 6 (who lives in house 1, age unknown).
7. Now we can assign the song to house 4 as it fits the criteria.

So, the final arrangement of the people is:
- House 1: Person 6 (age unknown)
- House 2: Painter (Person 2, age > 4 years)
- House 3: Singer (Person 3, age < 5 years)
- House 4: Song (Person 4, age < 5 years)
- House 5: Empty
- House 6: Composer (Person 5, age > 1 and <= 4 years)"	subway:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_subway_2	subway	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae is born in September. Let's label the people based on their birthdays (R for September).

2. Now, from point 4 and 5, we can determine the order of two people: Subway (S) is to the left of Snowmobile (Sm), and S lives in a wooden house (W). So, let's place W with R as the current arrangement.

3. From point 7, the mechanic (M) drives the quad-bike (Q), so Q should be placed next to an empty position (as we haven't assigned any transport yet).

4. From point 12, the motorbikemaster (B) lives in a ranch-style house (Rc). Since Rc is not filled, it must be placed next to an empty position.

5. From point 10 and 15, we can infer that the librarian (L) will either be on the left or right of June (J), and L lives on the left or right of the futuristic house (F). We cannot determine their exact positions yet, but let's say L is to the left of J for simplicity.

6. From point 14, the fan of folk (Fo) is on the left or right of B, and we have already placed B next to an empty position. So, let's place Fo in that open space to the right of B (Rb).

7. Now, from point 6, we know the architect (A) is born in May (M). Since A hasn't been placed yet and there are no available May positions so far, A must be assigned a May birthday later in the arrangement.

8. From point 3, we have already placed Q next to an empty position. Now, since Q can only be driven by M (the mechanic), M should be placed next to Q. So, let's place M next to Q (QM).

9. From point 13, the fan of ambient (Amb) is the bartender (Bt). Since Bt hasn't been placed yet and there are no available positions for A, we must place Amb later in the arrangement.

10. Now, since Fo is on the right side of Rb, the only remaining open space to the left is for F (the futuristic house), which means that J (June) should be placed next to F.

11. From point 11, we know that July's birthday person (G) is on the left or right of M (mechanic). Since M is already placed, G must be placed next to an open position.

12. Finally, from point 1, the fan of trance is the person driving the train (T), and T prefers rock music. Since we already have R, F, J, and G assigned to other people, only the remaining positions are left for A, Amb, and L. The only option for A to be placed in May (M) is on the far right, so let's place A at M (AM).

13. Now we can fill in the remaining positions:
    - Since A is a gothic-revival house (Gr), Gr should be in the middle (as per point 8). So, Gr will replace F. This means that F will become a palace (Palace) and will be placed next to J on the far left side (JF).
    - Since L is on the left of J (per point 5), we can place L at an empty position on the far left before M (LJFMG). This means that Bt is the fan of ambient (Amb), which gives us the final arrangement: LJFMGAQM

14. Since T prefers rock music, there must be a rock-fan left in our list. Only A and L are left, but we've already placed A as an architect, so L is the remaining rock fan (LR). This means that the order of people is now: LJFMRGAQML

15. Now, let's assign transport to each person. We know that T drives the train, S drives the subway, Sm drives the snowmobile, and Q is driven by M. The only remaining person is B (the motorbikemaster), who lives in a ranch-style house. Since Rc was already assigned to B, B must drive the motorbike (B).

Now we have all assignments completed:
LJFMRGAQML
L: Bartender, Likes Rock, June, Subway
J: Librarian, Ambient, June, Palace
F: Mechanic, Reggae, February, Motorbike
M: Architect, Trance, May, Snowmobile
R: Motorbikemaster, Quad-bike
G: Unknown, Folk, July, Unassigned
A: Unknown, Unassigned, Unassigned

Since we don't know the birthday and jobs for G and A yet, we can only determine their positions:
G: Unassigned, Unknown, Unknown, Unknown
A: Unassigned, Unknown, Unknown, Unknown

So, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact location of the subway in our arrangement. However, we know that the subway (S) is driven by L and it is placed on the far left side of the arrangement (LJF...). Therefore, we can say that S is in one of the first three positions (from left to right):
subway: 1,2,3."	subway:4	subway:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_subway_3	subway	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down and try to find relationships between variables:

1. We know the fan of trance is driving the train (Transport[3]).
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (Birthday[3]).
3. The fan of rock is the palace house (House[4]).
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (Transport[1] < Transport[7]).
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house (House[2]).
6. The architect has a birthday in May (Birthday[2]).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (Transport[4] == Job[3]).
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (House[Num] = Gothic-Revival implies Num is 3 or 5).
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (Folk's position < Motorbike's position).
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (June's position <= Librarian's position <= June's position + 2).
11. The person who's birthday is in July's is on the left or right of the mechanic (Mechanic's position < July's position < Mechanic's position + 2).
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (House[0] == MotorbikeMaster).
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (Ambient == Job[5]).
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Folk's position <= Motorbike's position <= Folk's position + 2).
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Librarian's position <= Futuristic house's position <= Librarian's position + 2).

Now let's start with some known facts to assign variables:
- Since we know that Trance fan drives the train, we can assign Train = 3.
- The reggae fan has a birthday in September, so Birthday[3] = 'September'.
- We don't have enough information yet to determine the position of the Subway, but since it is on the left of the Snowmobile, and we know that the Train driver (which we now know is Trance) is not driving the Snowmobile, we can assume that neither MotorbikeMaster nor Subway is driving the Snowmobile.
- If Quad-Bike driver (Mechanic) is assigned to a position other than 4, then it will conflict with the condition that Folk is on the far left. So let's assign Quad-Bike = 4.
- The architect has a birthday in May, so Birthday[2] = 'May'.
- Since we know that Mechanic drives Quad-Bike and that both Motorbikemaster and Subway can't drive the Snowmobile, they must be driving either Motorbike or Train, which means MotorbikeMaster != 3. This also implies Subway != 3.
- With the information we have now, we can assign Gothic-Revival house to position 3 (since it is not Ranch-style and cannot be the Palace).
- Since Folk is on the far left, we can place it in position 1 or 9. But if we put it in position 1, it will conflict with the condition that Mechanic must be on the right of Folk (as Quad-Bike driver). So let's assign Folk to position 9.
- Since we know that Trance doesn't drive Snowmobile and MotorbikeMaster also can't drive the Snowmobile, they must be driving either Motorbike or Train, which means Train != MotorbikeMaster. This implies Subway is driving the Motorbike (Train != 1).
- Now we know that Subway drives Motorbike, it is not in position 3 (since Trance already takes it), and it is on the left of Snowmobile, which has not been assigned yet. So let's assign Subway to position 2.
- With this new arrangement, we can now place Snowmobile in position 6 since it must be on the right of Subway.
- Since MotorbikeMaster can't drive Train or Snowmobile and the rest are already assigned, we must assign it to the remaining position 5 (MotorbikeMaster = 5).
- With all positions filled except for Train, and knowing that it cannot be MotorbikeMaster, the only remaining option is to make the Train driver the Bartender. So let's assign Ambient to position 5 (Bartender).
- Now we can place the Librarian on the right of the Futuristic house since they must be in position 0 or 4, but placing it in position 0 would imply that neither MotorbikeMaster nor Subway could drive the Train, which conflicts with our previous arrangement. So let's assign Librarian to position 4 (position of Wooden house) and Futuristic house to position 0.

With all positions assigned, here is the final answer:
- Transport[1] = Motorbike (Subway)
- Transport[2] = Train (Motorbike)
- Transport[3] = Snowmobile (Unknown)
- Transport[4] = Quad-Bike (Mechanic)
- Transport[5] = None (Motorbikemaster)
- House[0] = Futuristic house
- House[1] = None (Folk)
- House[2] = Wooden house (Librarian)
- House[3] = Palace (Rock)
- House[4] = Gothic-Revival
- House[5] = Ranch-style (Motorbikemaster)
- Birthday[1] = June
- Birthday[2] = May (Architect)
- Birthday[3] = September (Reggae)
- Birthday[4] = None (Futuristic house or Librarian)
- Birthday[5] = July (Unknown)

Unfortunately, we were unable to find the exact position of the Snowmobile."	subway:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_subway_4	subway	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the common elements and unique properties of each category. Here we have five items for transport, music, houses, jobs, and birth months.
2. Use the given statements to deduce the relationships between these categories. For example, if statement 1 tells us that the fan of trance drives the train, then we can know that person is associated with the 'train' in the 'transport' category.
3. Once you have identified all the associations, use the remaining statements to fill out the missing information.

In this case, let's start by identifying the relationships:

- Trance = Train (1)
- Reggae = September (2)
- Rock = Palace (4)
- Subway is left of snowmobile (4)
- Subway is wooden house (5)
- May = Architect (6)
- Quad-bike = Mechanic (7)
- Gothic-revival middle (8)
- Folk = Left of motorbike (9, 14)
- Librarian adjacent to June or June itself (10, 15)
- July near mechanic (11)
- Motorbike associated with ranch-style (12)
- Ambient = Bartender (13)
- Folk is adjacent to motorbike (14)
- Librarian adjacent to futuristic house (15)

Now let's find the unknowns:

- Since the subway is left of the snowmobile, and we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, the person driving the subway cannot be the mechanic. The librarian also can't drive a vehicle since she is associated with a house (15). So, the driver of the subway must be either the motorbikemaster, architect, or bartender.
  - Given that the fan of folk (architect) and ambient (bartender) are on the left side, and the architect's birthday is in May, it means the subway driver must be the motorbikemaster.
- Since the architect's birthday is in May, the person with a birthday in July must be either the librarian or one of the vehicle drivers (motorbikemaster, bartender, mechanic). However, statement 12 tells us that the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house. We already know the architect lives there as well. Therefore, the person with a birthday in July cannot be the motorbikemaster or architect. So the librarian must have her birthday in July (to avoid having two people with birthdays in May).
- Now we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since both folk and ambient are already placed on the left, the only remaining option for the librarian to be on the left or right of someone is the motorbikemaster (since the mechanic and architect have been determined). So the librarian must be on the right side of the motorbikemaster.
- Since the subway driver was identified as the motorbikemaster, we know that he drives a vehicle other than the subway. As the architect and librarian are already placed, only two vehicles remain: the snowmobile and quad-bike. However, since the mechanic cannot drive the subway, he must be driving the quad-bike (as we found out earlier). So the remaining vehicle is the snowmobile.
- Since the folk (architect) and ambient (bartender) are already placed on the left side, only the reggae person (born in September) remains to be placed. As the motorbikemaster and librarian are already placed, only one house remains: the futuristic house.
- Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, we know that both the ranch-style (motorbike master and architect) and wooden houses (subway driver and mechanic) must be on either sides of the futuristic house. However, the librarian cannot live in the wooden house because the subway driver already lives there. So the librarian must live in the futuristic house, leaving the reggae person to live in the remaining wooden house.
- Since the fan of rock is the palace house, and we have already placed all the other houses, the only remaining option for the remaining transport and music genres is that the snowmobile driver is a fan of rock. So the order becomes: subway (left), motorbike (right of subway), folk (adjacent to motorbike on left), ambient (on right side of motorbike), reggae (snowmobile).

Finally, let's place the houses and jobs in the same order: ranch-style (architect), wooden (reggae/subway), gothic-revival (middle), futuristic (librarian), and palace (rock).

Now that we have placed everything in order, we can easily find the subway driver:
**subway: 1**."	subway:4	subway:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_subway_5	subway	3	" Let's solve this step by step:

1) From point 1, we know that the fan of trance drives the train. Since there are only five modes of transport and each person has a unique job, the person driving the train must be the train driver (let's call him T).

2) From point 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike (let's call him Q).

3) From point 4, we know that the subway driver (S) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (Sn). Since Q is on a quad-bike and not a snowmobile, Sn must be the snowmobile driver.

4) From point 5, we know that the wooden house (W) is the subway driver (S). However, since we already assigned S to Sn, this contradicts the information from point 3. There seems to be an inconsistency here, as the puzzle might not be solvable given these constraints.

Assuming there's a mistake in the problem, let's continue:

5) From points 10 and 15, we know that the librarian (L) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (J6) and on the left or right of the futuristic house (F). Since L isn't assigned yet, let's assign the futuristic house to F.

6) From points 12 and 13, we know that the motorbikemaster (M) is the ranch-style house (R) and the fan of ambient (A) is the bartender (B).

7) Since all unique jobs are already assigned and we have an inconsistency with point 4 and point 5, it's impossible to determine the exact position of S based on the given information.

8) From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of reggae (Rg) is in September (S9) and is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (M). Since Rg isn't assigned yet, let's assign S9 to Rg for now.

9) From points 6, 8, and 11, we can place M, Rg, and J6 in a row, with M on the left or right of Rg and J6 on the other side (since they are either L or R of each other). However, their exact positions aren't determined yet.

10) From points 3 and 9, since Sn is assigned to the snowmobile driver and M isn't driving a snowmobile, we know that S is not Sn. Therefore, S must be the subway driver.

Answers: motorbikemaster:Ranch-style house, subway:On the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (June or J6) depending on the inconsistency with point 4 and point 5. The rest of the positions can't be determined without additional information."	subway:4		False	False

From statement 7, we know the Mechanic drives the Quad-bike and is positioned to the right of the Subway (X+2). Therefore, position X can only be the Snowmobile.

With statements 5, 6, and 8, we know that the Train, Architect, and Gothic Revival house are in positions 4, 3, and 2 respectively. Since the Train is on the left of the Snowmobile (position 5), we can now confirm position 4 as the Train, and position 3 as the Gothic Revival house.

With statements 9 and 10, we know that the Motorbike is positioned at the extreme left (position 1). This implies position 2 to be the House for Rock music fans (Palace). Also, the Librarian is on the left or right of June's birthday person. As the Motorbike is already at position 1, we know that June's person and the Librarian should be in positions 2 and 3 or vice versa. If they are in positions 2 and 3 (Architect-Palace, Librarian), it contradicts statement 6 which says that the Architect is on May's birthday. So, let's assume June and Librarian are in positions 1 and 2 respectively (Motorbike, Ranch-style). Now, position 3 must be the Gothic Revival house and the person with February's birthday (statement 16) should be placed at position 4.

With statements 11, 15, and 16 we know that July's person is either to the left or right of the Mechanic (Quad-bike). Since the librarian is already on the left of June's birthday person (position 2), there are only three remaining positions for July's person: position 4, position 5 (Snowmobile), and position 6. However, placing July's person at position 5 contradicts statement 12 which says that the Ranch-style house is the Motorbike (position 1). So, let's place July's person at position 6 (Futuristic house). Now, we have no other options for positioning the Snowmobile.

With statements 13 and 14 we know that the Bartender is on the right of the Ambient music fan (position X+3) and the Folk music fan is on the left or right of the Motorbike driver (position 1). Since the only remaining position for the Snowmobile (position 5), it follows that the Folk music fan must be at position 4, and therefore the Bartender should be at position 6.

However, this arrangement contradicts statement 12 which says that the Motorbike driver is the Ranch-style house (position 1). If we swap the motorbike with the snowmobile, then the snowmobile becomes the position for May's birthday person (statement 6), leaving the Motorbike as the only remaining option for June's birthday. Thus, this arrangement works:

Since X is still unknown, we can't specify the position for the Subway yet. But at least we know that the subway is to the left of the Snowmobile (position X<X+1).

So, we have successfully placed all the items in their respective positions except for one: the Subway. We should now try different arrangements with the remaining empty position and see if they violate any other given statements. If not, then we can claim that the arrangement is valid, but if there's a violation, we should repeat this process by swapping different items until we find a valid arrangement for all the items."	subway:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_subway_7	subway	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down into smaller parts and use deductive reasoning to find out the position of each person/item. Let's first find the people based on their music preferences and birthdays.

1. Since the fan of trance is the person driving the train, we can assign the 'Trance' to Train and Train to the person with a birthday in June (as only one person has a birthday in June).
2. The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September, so we know Reggae belongs to the person in September.
3. Since Rock is the palace house, and there's no direct relation between music preferences and houses, let's proceed with other clues.
4. The subway is on the left of the snowmobile, and the Train (who drives a motorbike) is not on their left or right. So, Snowmobile should be placed on the far right. As Subway cannot be placed at position 1 due to clause 8, it must be in position 2.
5. Since the Train's (with June birthday) neighbor is the snowmobile (position 3), the subway driver (who has a different birthday than June) should have a birthday in May or July. However, since the person with a July birthday is on the left or right of the mechanic (which we haven't placed yet), the subway driver must be in February.
6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May. As they are not driving any vehicle, we can assign Architect to position 1.
7. From clue 7, the mechanic is the driver of the quad-bike. However, since the motorbikemaster (position 4) and librarian (position 5 or 6) cannot be on the left or right of the person with a June birthday (Train), the mechanic must be in position 3, which means the quad-bike driver is actually the fan of folk.
8. Clue 8 states that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it should go at position 4. As the mechanic is the fan of folk and is placed at position 3, the gothic-revival house (Folk) is on the left side of the mechanic. The only remaining house is futuristic, which must be placed on the right side of the architect. So, futuristic is assigned to position 6, and librarian to position 5 (on the right of the architect).
9. Since the fan of ambient is the bartender (clue 13), we can now assign Ambient to position 2 on the left side of the mechanic (position 3).
10. The motorbikemaster (Ranch-style) is placed at position 4, and the only remaining house is palace, which must be in position 5 as it's not on the left or right of the person with a June birthday (Train). So, Rock is assigned to position 5.
11. With all houses placed, we can now determine the jobs. Since the librarian and bartender are on the left side and right side of the architect, respectively, the remaining jobs are motorbikemaster and mechanic (as we already know the mechanic is the quad-bike driver). However, due to the positions, it can only be possible that the motorbikemaster is on the far left (position 1) and the mechanic is in position 3.
12. Since the motorbikemaster is on the far left (position 1), the Motorbike should be placed at position 1 as well.
13. As the mechanic is now known to be the driver of the quad-bike, we can place Quad-Bike in position 3.
14. From clue 14, the fan of folk (mechanic) should be on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (position 1). Since the mechanic is already placed, there's no way to fulfill this clause, which means it might not be correct. However, we can still place the Snowmobile and Subway based on our analysis so far.
15. From clue 15, the librarian (position 5) should be on the left or right of the futuristic house (position 6). As both the mechanic (position 3) and architect (position 1) are neighbors to their respective houses, the only possible position for the Subway is position 2.
16. Now we have all vehicles placed, so let's place their corresponding passengers: the fan of trance (Train driver) in position 1, reggae (September birthday) in position 3, and rock (position 5).
17. The only remaining positions are for the fan of ambient (Bartender) and folk (Mechanic), but as mentioned earlier, it seems there's an inconsistency with clue 14. To resolve this puzzle, we can either consider clue 14 not being accurate or rearranging some parts based on a different assumption. In this answer, I have followed the first approach and provided a solution that fulfills as many clues as possible while disregarding clue 14.

In summary, the subway is located at position 2 (Subway: 2) based on the analysis performed above. The final arrangement of people/items is as follows:

- Position 1: Architect (May birthday), Motorbike
- Position 2: Subway, Ambient (Bartender)
- Position 3: Mechanic (Folk, Quad-Bike driver), Reggae (September birthday)
- Position 4: Motorbikemaster (Ranch-style house), Snowmobile, Folk
- Position 5: Librarian (on the right of the architect), Futuristic House
- Position 6: Train (Trance fan)"	subway:4	subway:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_subway_8	subway	3	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a table to organize our information:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House | Job | Birthday Month | Position (Subway on left or right) |
|-----------|------------|------|-----|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Motorbike  | Trance     | Ranch | Master | June            | Left                         |
| Subway    | ?          | Wooden| Mechanic   | May             | Left or Right                |
| Train     | Trance     | Palace| N/A       | September       | Left of Snowmobile           |
| Snowmobile| N/A        | Gothic-Revival| N/A       | February        | Right of Subway              |
| Quad-bike  | N/A        | Futuristic | Librarian   | July             | N/A                         |
| Ambient   | N/A        | N/A     | Bartender  | N/A               | N/A                         |
| Rock      | N/A        | Palace| N/A       | Reggae is in September  | Right or Middle              |
| Folk       | N/A        | N/A     | N/A          | On the left of Motorbike    | Left or Right                |
| N/A       | Reggae     | N/A     | N/A          | May                | N/A                         |
| Folk      | N/A        | Gothic-Revival   | N/A          | July              | On the left or right of Motorbike|
| Librarian | N/A        | Futuristic| N/A       | N/A               | Left or Right of Subway     |

From points 4, 5 and 7 we know that the subway is to the left of the snowmobile and on the wooden house.

We also know that the mechanic is driving the quad-bike from point 7. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the mechanic (point 10, 11), the librarian can't be on the same side as the subway since the subway is to the left of the snowmobile and there is no room for another person.

So, the only possibility for the subway is on the right, which means the mechanic (quad-bike) must be on the left.

Now we can fill in the table:

| Transport | Music-Genre | House | Job | Birthday Month | Position (Subway on left or right) |
|-----------|------------|------|-----|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Motorbike  | Trance     | Ranch | Master | June            | Left                         |
| Subway    | Trance     | Wooden| Mechanic   | May             | Right                       |
| Train     | Trance     | Palace| N/A       | September       | Left of Snowmobile           |
| Snowmobile| N/A        | Gothic-Revival| N/A       | February        | Right of Subway              |
| Quad-bike  | N/A        | Futuristic | Librarian   | July             | Left                         |
| Ambient   | N/A        | N/A     | Bartender  | N/A               | N/A                         |
| Rock      | N/A        | Palace| N/A       | Reggae is in September  | Right or Middle              |
| Folk       | N/A        | N/A     | N/A          | On the left of Motorbike    | Left or Right                |
| N/A       | Reggae     | N/A     | N/A          | May                | N/A                         |
| Folk      | N/A        | Gothic-Revival   | N/A          | July              | On the left or right of Motorbike|
| Librarian | N/A        | Futuristic| N/A       | N/A               | Left                         |

Now we can find out the music genre of the subway:

- The only person driving a transport is either the fan of trance (train) or the subway. Since the train is on the left and the subway is on the right, they cannot be the same person. That means the subway's music genre must be different from trance.
- We know that reggae is in September. There are no more clues about the genre of the subway, so it could be any of the remaining genres. However, since we have already placed the fan of trance and rock as train and palace respectively, we know that there must be at least one genre left for the subway to have.
- As we don't have enough information to determine the exact genre of the subway, we can only conclude the following: **subway:[unknown music-genre]**"	subway:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_subway_9	subway	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by identifying the variables and their relationships. We have:

1. People (5) with their preferences (transport, music-genre, house, job, birthday month). Let A, B, C, D, E represent the individuals.
2. Transport (5 options): M (motorbike), S (subway), T (train), Q (quad-bike), SM (snowmobile)
3. Music-genres (5 options): T (trance), R (rock), A (ambient), F (folk), G (reggae)
4. Houses (5 options): R (ranch-style), W (wooden), GR (gothic-revival), P (palace), FU (futuristic)
5. Jobs (5 options): MM (motorbikemaster), MC (mechanic), AH (architect), B (bartender), L (librarian)
6. Birthday months (5 options): J (june), M (may), S (september), F (february), JU (july)

Now let's analyze the clues:

1. T is driving the train, so T cannot be on a vehicle other than T or S.
2. R has birthday in September, so R cannot have birthdays in any other month.
3. P is the fan of rock, so P must have one of the 5 jobs (and houses and transport options).
4. S is on the left of SM.
5. S is the wooden house.
6. A has birthday in May, so A cannot have birthdays in any other month.
7. QD is driving the quad-bike, so Q or D must be the mechanic. However, since the mechanic can't have a birthday in July (clue 11), Q cannot be the mechanic, so D is the mechanic.
8. GR is in the middle, so it cannot be on the left or right of N (who is on the far left). Hence, GR must be one of S, M, or T since they are the only options left.
9. F is on the left. So F must be on the left of at least 2 people. Since N is on the far left and cannot be F (clue 9), the only remaining options for F are R, P, A, SM, and MM. Considering F cannot be P due to clue 3, the rest of the F's positions will determine the other vehicles and jobs.
10. L is on the left or right of J (who has a birthday in June). Since L cannot be on the far left (clue 9), this leaves LM, MJ, or MS as possibilities for their order. Considering clues 2, 6, and 7 (R, A, and D have specific birthdays), we can rule out MS as a possibility.
11. JU is on the left or right of the mechanic, which we know is D. However, since L cannot be in the middle (clue 8) and L is on the left or right of J (clue 10), it means that J can't be on the far left or right either, so it must be in the middle. Now we have M-J-D as a possibility for their order.
12. MM is the ranch-style house, so MM cannot be S, T, SM, or GR. However, since all other houses are taken, MM can only be Q or FU.
13. A is the fan of ambient, so A cannot have a birthday in any of the already assigned months (J, M, S, F, JU). Since there's only one remaining month (February), it means that A must be F (ambient fan) and has a birthday in February.
14. F is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, which we know is M from clue 12. However, since L cannot be in the middle (clue 8), F must be on the far left (since L is on the left or right of JU), so F is on the same side as M and JU. Now we have M-J-D-F as a possibility for their order.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (clue 15). Since MM is the only remaining option for the futuristic house, it means that L can be either on the left or right of MM. However, since F cannot be in the middle (clue 8), L must be on the opposite side as F to leave room for other people. So, we have LMMJDFA as a possibility for their order.

At this point, we have exhausted all the given clues and can only make an educated guess based on the remaining possibilities:
LMMJDFA (librarian, motorbikemaster, june, mechanic, may, fan of rock, fan of ambient, reggae fan, subway driver, wooden house)

However, it is important to note that this puzzle has multiple solutions depending on the order of the remaining people and their jobs. For example: LDJMMFA (librarian, architect, june, motorbikemaster, mechanic, may, fan of rock, fan of ambient, reggae fan, subway driver, wooden house) is another valid solution since it follows all given clues and assumptions made to reach our tentative answer.

To answer the question where is **subway**, we can't definitively provide an exact position as there are multiple possible solutions. However, in the example I provided (LMMJDFA), the subway driver is D.

If you want me to find another solution and give you the position of the subway in that solution, feel free to let me know!"	subway:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_subway_10	subway	3	" This puzzle can be quite challenging, but let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the trance fan is on the train. Since we also know that the subway and train are different modes of transport (rule 1), the trance fan cannot be on the subway.

2. We know the reggae fan's birthday is in September, but we don't yet know who they are or which mode of transport they use.

3. The rock fan lives in the palace, but we don't yet know their mode of transport or anything else about them.

4. We know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (rules 4 and 5). But since we don't know who drives either vehicle yet, this information doesn't help us much at this point.

5-8. These clues don't give us any new information about the subway's location because they are related to other people or items, not the subway directly.

9. The fan of folk is on the far left (rule 9), but we don't yet know who they are or which mode of transport they use.

10-12. These clues tell us about some people and their houses, but they don't help us locate the subway because they don't mention the subway directly.

13-15. These clues give us information about some people and their jobs or preferences, but again, they don't help us locate the subway because they don't mention the subway directly.

Since we can't definitively determine the location of the subway with the current information, I'm afraid we can't provide an answer in the requested format. More clues or additional information would be needed to solve this puzzle completely."	subway:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_1	train	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train. Let's call this transport ""T"".

2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September. We don't have any direct connection with transport for this clue, so we will proceed to other clues.

3. The fan of rock is the palace house. This doesn't give us a direct link to transport either.

4-5. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile and it is the wooden house. Let's call these transports ""S"" and ""W"" respectively. So, S < W.

6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May. We don't have a direct link to transport for this clue yet.

7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Let's call this transport ""Q"".

8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. This doesn't give us a direct link to transport either.

9. The fan of folk is on the far left. We don't have any transport associated with this clue yet.

10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June.

11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we don't know their transport yet, this clue doesn't help us much.

12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. This doesn't give us a direct link to transport either.

13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. We don't have a direct link to transport for this clue yet.

14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we don't know their transport yet, this clue doesn't help us much.

15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house.

Now let's revisit our clues and try to find connections:
- From clue 4 and 5, we know S < W. Since there are only 5 transports, T can't be S because if it were, there would be no transport left for W. So, T cannot be the subway or snowmobile. Also, T cannot be Q because that would mean the mechanic (who drives Q) is on the left of the subway driver, which contradicts clue 10. This leaves us with motorbike (M), train (T), and quad-bike (Q) for T. But since T can't be Q, it must be M or T.
- From clue 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left. Since there are only 5 people, this means the person driving the motorbike (M) cannot be the fan of folk because he/she would be in the middle or far right if M is a transport other than train (T). So, T must be the train.
- Now we know that T = Train, so let's assign the remaining transports: M = Motorbike, Q = Quad-bike, S = Subway, W = Snowmobile.
- From clue 10 and 15, we can place the librarian on the left of the person who's birthday is in June (June-person) and on the right of the futuristic house. Since there are only 2 places left for the librarian (left and right), this means that the futuristic house must be on the far left, leaving the ranch-style house (which is the motorbikemaster) on the far right.
- From clue 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May. Since there are only 2 jobs left for May, this means the bartender cannot have a birthday in May. So, the bartender must be the fan of ambient.
- From clue 13, we now know that the bartender drives the motorbike (M). Since M is on the far right and folk is on the far left, this means the fan of folk must drive the subway (S), the mechanic must drive the quad-bike (Q), and the architect must drive the snowmobile (W).
- From clue 14, we know that the person driving the motorbike (Bartender) is on the left or right of the fan of folk (Subway driver). But since B is on the far right and F is on the far left, this means B must be on the right. This also tells us that the fan of ambient (Bartender) is on the right because the librarian is on the left.
- From clue 3, we know that the palace house is the fan of rock. Since there are only 2 houses left for rock (palace and futuristic), this means the futuristic house must be a different genre. The only option left for the futuristic house is trance because ambient, folk, and reggae have been assigned to their respective houses.
- Now we know that the futuristic house drives the train (T). But since T is already assigned to the train driver (Bartender), this means there's a mistake in the puzzle or it requires additional information not provided.

In conclusion, we can determine the transport for all people except the train. The correct answer should be ""train:?"" but due to the inconsistency in the puzzle, we cannot definitively assign a number to the train."	train:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_2	train	4	" To solve this puzzle, we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September. However, there's no information connecting the reggae fan to any specific means of transport yet. Let's move on to other points for now.

2. From point 4, we can deduce that the person driving the subway is located to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since both persons are not yet associated with a number (we don't know their positions), we cannot determine their exact order at this moment. Let's move on to other points for now.

3. From point 5, we know that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house. However, since we don't have enough information yet, we cannot connect the subway driver with the specific house number. Let's move on to other points for now.

4. From point 6, we learn that the architect has a birthday in May. This helps us identify one person among our 5 individuals, but it doesn't help us yet to link any means of transport or music genre with that person. Let's move on to other points for now.

5. From point 7, we can deduce that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. This helps us identify another individual, but we still don't have enough information yet to connect any means of transport or music genre with this person. Let's move on to other points for now.

6. From point 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since there are only 5 houses, and we already know the location of one (the ranch-style house), we can deduce that the gothic-revival house must be the third house from left or right. Let's move on to other points for now.

7. From point 9, we know that the fan of folk is located on the far left. Since the houses are arranged linearly, and we already know the location of one house (the ranch-style house), we can deduce that the first two houses must be the ranch-style house and the fan of folk's house.

8. Now, let's go back to point 6, where we identified the architect's birthday as in May. Since the first two houses are already filled (ranch-style and folk), the only remaining position for the architect would be the third house, which must therefore be a gothic-revival or a palace. However, since we know that the gothic-revival is in the middle, it means the architect's house must be a palace.

9. From point 10, we can deduce that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we already know the location of two people (the fan of folk and the architect), the only remaining position for the librarian would be to the left or right of the motorbike driver.

10. From point 11, we can deduce that the person who's birthday is in July lives on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we already know the location of two people (the fan of folk and the architect), this means that the futuristic house must be located next to either the motorbike driver or the librarian.

11. Now, let's go back to point 2, where we learned that the reggae fan has a birthday in September. Since we already know the location of four people (the ranch-style, folk, gothic-revival, and palace houses), the only remaining position for the reggae fan is in either the fourth or fifth house.

12. From point 12, we learn that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. This helps us identify one person among our 5 individuals, but it doesn't help us yet to link any means of transport or music genre with that person. Let's move on to other points for now.

13. From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender. This helps us identify another individual, but we still don't have enough information yet to connect any means of transport or music genre with this person. Let's move on to other points for now.

14. From point 14, we can deduce that the fan of folk is located on the left or right of the motorbike driver. Since we already know the location of two people (the ranch-style and gothic-revival houses), this means that the fan of folk cannot be in the first position. So, the fan of folk must be either the fourth or fifth house.

15. From point 15, we can deduce that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we already know the location of four people (the ranch-style, folk, gothic-revival, and palace houses), this means that the librarian cannot be in the fifth position. So, the librarian must be either the second or third house.

Now we have more constraints on the positions:
- The fan of folk can only be the fourth or fifth house.
- The librarian can only be the second or third house.

Since there are only two possible positions left for the reggae fan, and they both involve a position before the fan of folk (to respect point 14), it means that the reggae fan must be the fourth house. This leaves the fifth house for the librarian.

However, we still don't have enough information yet to connect any means of transport or music genre with the remaining individuals (the subway driver, the fan of ambient, and the mechanic). We need more clues or constraints to solve this puzzle completely.

As for the initial question ""Where is **train**? Give the answer in the format **train:Num**"", we cannot provide an answer at this point because we don't have enough information yet to connect the train with any specific position."	train:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_3	train	4	" Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train, so we can associate Trance with Train.

2. Now let's find out where Train is located. From point 4, we know that Subway is on the left of Snowmobile. Since the houses are in a row and there are no gaps between them, if Subway is a house, then Snowmobile must be next to it, and hence Train cannot be a house. So, Train is not a house.

3. From point 5, we know that the wooden house (House #5) is the subway. Since Subway is on the left of Snowmobile, House #5 is the second house from the left, and therefore the first house must be Snowmobile. So, Snowmobile:1, Subway:2, and Train is neither a house nor in any position yet.

4. From point 7, we know that Quad-bike is the mechanic, so Mechanic has been associated with Quad-bike.

5. Since the gothic-revival house (House #3) is in the middle and Subway (House #2) is on its left, House #1 must be Folk (Folk:1). So, the person driving the motorbike is on the far left.

6. Since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike, if it's on the right, then the librarian (who is on the left or right of the futuristic house) would have to be on the right as well, contradicting point 15. Therefore, the fan of folk must be on the left of the motorbike, and since the architect is in May, he cannot be the librarian (point 6), so the librarian is the person with a birthday in June. So, Librarian:3 or Librarian:4.

7. Now we know that the librarian is on the left of the futuristic house. Since Motorbike:1 and Folk:1 are on the far left, the futuristic house must be either House #2 (Subway) or House #3 (Gothic-revival), but Subway was already identified as a house (point 3). So, the futuristic house is Gothic-revival:3.

8. From point 15, we know that Librarian:3 or Librarian:4, and from point 7, we know that Gothic-revival:3. Since there are no gaps between houses, the librarian must be either House #4 (if Librarian:3) or House #5 (if Librarian:4). But since we already identified Subway as a house in point 3, the librarian cannot be House #2. Therefore, the librarian is House #5, and Train is not a house but must be somewhere to the right of House #5.

9. From point 10, we know that the librarian (House #5) is on the left or right of June. Since there are no gaps between houses, if Librarian:5 is on the right of June, then June must be House #4. But this would mean that July is on the right of Mechanic (Quad-bike), contradicting point 11. Therefore, the librarian is on the left of June, and June is not a house but must be somewhere to the left of House #5.

10. Now we can place the remaining people based on their jobs:
    - Motorbikemaster (Ranch-style) cannot be House #2 or #3 because of points 3 and 7, so it must be House #1. So, Motorbikemaster:1, June:0.
    - Rock (Palace) is not possible at this point as we already have identified all the houses except one. Let's assume that the remaining house is Rock:6 for now.
    - Ambient (Bartender) cannot be House #2 or #3 because of points 3 and 7, so it must be either House #4 or House #5. Since Librarian:5 and Motorbikemaster:1 are already placed, Ambient can only be House #4, and so Bartender:4.
    - Now we have identified all houses except one (Rock:6). Since Ambient is on the left of Folk (point 13), Ambient cannot be on the left of Rock if Rock:6 is the last house. Therefore, Rock cannot be House #6 and must be House #5. So, Rock:5, Reggae:2, and we need to find the person with a birthday in September.

11. Since Reggae (September) is in House #2 and July is on the left or right of Mechanic, if July is on the left of Mechanic, then July must be June (since there are no gaps between houses), contradicting point 9. Therefore, July is on the right of Mechanic, and we need to find where July is.

12. Since the fan of rock is in House #5 and July is on its right, if July were in House #6 (the last house), then June would have to be on the left of House #5, contradicting point 9. Therefore, July must be House #4, and since Ambient (Bartender) is in House #4, Mechanic cannot be in House #3 because it would mean that there are two houses between Mechanic and July (contradicting point 11), so Mechanic:2.

13. Now we have identified all the people except one (the birthday person for September). Since Motorbike is on the left of Folk (point 5) and Folk is on the left or right of Reggae (September), if Reggae were in House #2, then Folk would have to be on the right of Reggae (contradicting point 14). Therefore, Reggae cannot be in House #2. Since we already know that there are no gaps between houses and all houses except one have been identified, the remaining house must be House #6 (Rock:6), and September's birthday person is in this house.

So, the final placement is as follows:
- Motorbike:1
- Folk:1
- Librarian:5
- Train:not a house or position yet
- Subway:2
- Snowmobile:1
- Quad-bike:4 (Mechanic)
- Gothic-revival:3
- Bartender:4 (Ambient)
- Reggae:6 (September's birthday person)
- Rock:5 (July's birthday person)

To find the position of Train, we go back to point 1 and rearrange the information. Since the fan of trance is driving the train, if we know that Trance is associated with any house or position, we can determine where the train is. Since there are no gaps between houses, if we find that Trance is not in House #5 (Librarian), then Train cannot be House #6 (Rock) because there would have to be a gap between Librarian and Rock, contradicting the assumption of no gaps. Similarly, since Ambient (Bartender) is in House #4, if we find that Trance is not in House #4, then Train cannot be on the left of House #5 (Librarian), because there would have to be a gap between Bartender and Librarian, contradicting the assumption of no gaps. Therefore, Train must be in House #1 or House #2, but since we already know that Motorbike is in House #1 and Ambient is in House #4, the only remaining possibility for Train is House #2 (Subway).

Therefore, the final placement with Train's position is:
- Motorbike:1
- Folk:1
- Librarian:5
- Train:2 (Subway)
- Subway:2
- Snowmobile:1
- Quad-bike:4 (Mechanic)
- Gothic-revival:3
- Bartender:4 (Ambient)
- Reggae:6 (September's birthday person)
- Rock:5 (July's birthday person)"	train:3	train:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_4	train	4	" To solve this puzzle, we will systematically eliminate possibilities for each variable based on the given clues. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. We know trance fan drives the train (clue 1). Since there are only five modes of transport and five music genres, the trance fan cannot have another occupation or live in another house.
2. The reggae fan is born in September (clue 2), so we've identified one person with their job and birthday. However, since there are still four remaining options for each, they won't be directly related to the train's position yet.
3. We find that the rock genre corresponds to the palace house (clue 4). Again, this doesn't help us determine where the train is since the houses don't have any direct relation to transport or jobs.
4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (clue 5), but we don't know their identities yet.
5. The subway driver lives in a wooden house (clue 6), which doesn't provide us with any new information.
6. We learn that the architect is born in May (clue 7). This also doesn't give us much insight since we don't know their transport or musical preference.
7. The quad-bike driver is the mechanic (clue 8), but this again won't help us find the train.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (clue 9). This could potentially be helpful when we know more about positions, but for now, it doesn't help us locate the train.
9. We know that the fan of folk is on the far left (clue 10), but this doesn't give us any new information since we still don't have their transport or job.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person born in June (clue 11). This might be helpful if we know the identity of that person, but for now, it doesn't help us find the train.
11. We learn that the fan of ambient is the bartender (clue 13), but this still doesn't give us any information about the train.
12. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver (clue 14), but we don't know their identities yet. This also won't help us find the train.
13. We finally learn that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (clue 15). If we knew the identity of the librarian, this could potentially give us information about the train, but for now, it doesn't help us find the train directly.

At this point, we don't have enough information to definitively say where the train is located. We can only make educated guesses based on possible relationships and positions, but without more clues or specific identities, it remains impossible to pinpoint the train's exact position.

It would be helpful if you could provide more information to help solve this puzzle."	train:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_5	train	4	" Let's solve this step by step:

From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September. From points 5 and 6, we know that the person with a birthday in May is an architect and the house of the architect is wooden (point 12).

Since the train driver listens to trance (point 1) and the architect can't drive the train (because there are only 4 remaining transportation options), the fan of trance can't be the architect. So, let's assume the fan of trance is not in May. This leaves us with June as the remaining birthday month for the fan of trance.

From point 7, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since the mechanic can't be the fan of trance (because there are only 4 remaining music genres), the mechanic can't be in June either. So, let's assume the mechanic is not in June. This leaves us with February as the remaining birthday month for the mechanic.

From point 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left. Since the fan of folk can't be in May (because the architect is there) or June (because the mechanic is there), the fan of folk must be in February.

Since the fan of folk is on the far left and the fan of trance is in June, the fan of trance can't be on the far left either. This means that the train driver must be on the right side of the arrangement (since there are only 2 remaining positions: left or right).

From point 10, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since the mechanic can't be the librarian (because the mechanic is already placed), the librarian must be on the same side as the fan of trance (right side).

From point 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the fan of folk is in February and can't be on the far left, the fan of folk must be on the right side, which means the person driving the motorbike must be on the left side (since there are only 2 remaining positions: left or right).

From point 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. From point 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since the architect can't be in the middle (because the house of the architect is wooden), the subway driver must be on the left side and the snowmobile driver must be on the right side. This means that the subway driver must be the person driving the motorbike, but this contradicts our previous assumption (point 10).

There seems to be a contradiction in the given information. We can't find the exact position of the train without resolving this contradiction or making additional assumptions."	train:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_6	train	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step. I will use the given information to deduce and assign numbers to each person based on their transport, music-genre, house, job, and birthday month.

1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train. Let's assume Person 1 drives the train (T). Since there are only five means of transport, we know that other persons drive motorbike (M), subway (S), snowmobile (W), and quad-bike (Q).
2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September. Let's assume Person 5 has a birthday in September (Sept)
3. The fan of rock is the palace house. Since there are only five houses, we know that Person 4 lives in a palace (P).
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Let's assume Person S drives the subway and Person W drives the snowmobile. This means S < W.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house. We already know that Person 4 lives in a palace, so it must be the case that Person S lives in a wooden house (Wh).
6. The architect is the person who's birthday is in May. Let's assume Person 3 is an architect (A).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since we know that Person M drives the motorbike, and we have already assigned other transports to S, W, and P, it must be the case that Q=M. However, since the mechanic cannot also be a motorbikemaster (MM), we can conclude that Person 7 is the mechanic (Me).
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since there are five houses, and the wooden house is on the left, it means that the gothic-revival house is in position 3, so let's assume Person 2 lives in a gothic-revival house (Gr).
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since the mechanic and the gothic-revival house are already assigned, it means that Person 1 must be a fan of folk (Fo).
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since we know that Person 6 has a birthday in June (Jun), it means that either Person 1 (Librarian, Fo) or Person 5 (Sept) is on the left of Person 6. In this case, let's assume that the librarian is on the right of Person 6 (L).
11. The person who's birthday is in July's is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we already know that Person 7 is the mechanic, it means that either Person 2 (Gr) or Person 3 (A) is on the left of Person 7. However, since the architect must be on the right of the person who's birthday is in june (based on the previous statement), it must be the case that Person 8 (Jul) is on the left of Person 7 (Me).
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, and we have already assigned other transports to S, W, P, and Gr, it must be the case that M=T. However, since the fan of trance is already assigned to Person 1, this creates a contradiction (T cannot also be M). It seems there might be an error in the logic puzzle as the motorbikemaster cannot drive both the train and the motorbike at the same time.

In conclusion, the answers provided are correct except for the location of the train: we couldn't determine its position (train:X) due to the contradiction with the motorbikemaster's transport in items 12 and 13."	train:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_7	train	4	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train, but we don't have a number assigned to them yet. Let's call the person 'T' for trance.
2. The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September, but we don't have a number assigned to them yet. Let's call the person 'R'.
3. We know that the fan of rock is the palace house, but we don't have a number assigned to the palace house yet. Let's call the owner of the palace house 'P'.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we don't know who drives the snowmobile yet, let's assume that the subway driver is on the left. So, if T doesn't drive the subway (since he's a fan of trance, not listed among the transport options), then the subway must be driven by someone else, say S for Subway. Therefore, T can't be on the left, so he must be on the right.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house. Since we already placed T (who could potentially drive the subway) on the right, S (the subway driver) must be the wooden house. So, P can't be a wooden house.
6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May. Let's call the architect 'A'.
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since we already placed S (the subway driver) on the wooden house, the only remaining transport option for P (palace owner) is the quad-bike. So, P = Quad-bike.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we know that P (the palace) can't be a wooden house and P is driving the quad-bike, which isn't listed among the houses, the gothic-revival house must be a different person. Let's call the owner of the gothic-revival house 'G'.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since we already placed P (the palace) and G (the gothic-revival house), and neither are fans of folk, the only remaining person for this criteria is R (reggae). So, R = Folk.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since we already placed T (trance), S (subway), P (palace), G (gothic-revival house), and R (reggae/folk) and none of them have a birthday in June, there must be another person whose birthday is in June. Let's call that person 'J'. Since the librarian must be on the left or right of J, the only remaining spot for the librarian is to the right of J. So, Librarian = Right of June.
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we already placed T (trance), S (subway), P (palace), G (gothic-revival house), R (reggae/folk), J (June), and Librarian, and none of them have a birthday in July, there must be another person whose birthday is in July. Let's call that person 'B'. Since B is on the left or right of the mechanic, and we already placed T, S, P, G, R, J, and Librarian, the only remaining spot for B is to the left of the mechanic. So, Birthday in July = Left of Mechanic.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since we already placed P (the palace), G (gothic-revival house), R (reggae/folk), J (June), and Librarian, and none of them are the ranch-style house, the motorbikemaster must be the ranch-style house. So, Motorbikemaster = Ranch-style.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we already placed P (the palace), G (gothic-revival house), R (reggae/folk), J (June), Librarian, and B (Birthday in July), and none of them are fans of ambient, the only remaining person for this criteria is T. So, Ambient = Bartender.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we already placed P (the palace), G (gothic-revival house), R (reggae/folk), J (June), Librarian, B (Birthday in July), and T (trance/ambient), and none of them are driving a motorbike, the only remaining person for this criteria is S. So, Folk must be on the left or right of S.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we already placed T (trance/ambient), S (subway), P (palace), G (gothic-revival house), R (reggae/folk), J (June), B (Birthday in July), and A (architect), and none of them are the futuristic house, there must be another person whose house is futuristic. Let's call that person 'F'. Since Librarian is on the left or right of F, and we already placed T, S, P, G, R, J, B, and A, the only remaining spot for F is next to Librarian (on the opposite side from the person whose birthday is in June).

Now, let's arrange the people based on our conclusions:
- Futuristic house: F
- Left or right of F: Librarian
- On the opposite side of Librarian from June: A
- Right of A (June): J
- Left of J (Birthday in July): B
- Left of B (Mechanic): T
- Subway (Wooden house): S
- Far left: R (Reggae)
- Middle: G (Gothic-Revival house)
- Right of G: P (Palace/Quad-bike)

However, we don't have a definitive order for the people on the far left and in the middle. We know that R is on the far left, but since there are multiple people there, we can't determine their exact order yet. The same applies to G being in the middle. But we can assign the transport to each person:
- Train: T (since he drives a train)
- Motorbike: P (since he is the motorbikemaster)
- Subway: S
- Snowmobile: S's neighbor on the right (since the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver)
- Quad-bike: P (the palace owner, who we found out was driving a quad-bike earlier)

So, here's what we have so far:
- Train: T
- Motorbike: P
- Subway: S
- Snowmobile: S's neighbor on the right
- Quad-bike: P

And here are our remaining questions that require more information to solve:
1. Who is the other person on the far left with R (Reggae)?
2. Where does that other person live?
3. Is the other person driving a motorbike, snowmobile, or quad-bike?
4. In what order are the people on the far left?
5. In what order are the people in the middle?"	train:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_8	train	4	" Let's break this down step by step to find out where the train is located.

1. We know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train (point 1).
2. The person whose birthday is in September listens to reggae, not trance (point 2 and point 1 contradicts, so we exclude them from this analysis)
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, but the information about transport isn't helpful for our analysis yet (points 3 and following don't provide enough information to determine the train's location).
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (point 4). We'll find out later who they are, but for now, we can say that the train isn't either of them since the fan of trance must drive the train.
5. The person driving the subway lives in the wooden house (point 5), but it doesn't help us determine the location of the train yet.
6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May (point 6), but we don't know which profession drives the subway or snowmobile, so we can't find the train's location based on this information.
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (point 7). This tells us that neither the train nor the subway driver can be a mechanic or ride a quad-bike.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (point 8), but it doesn't provide any information about transport or music genres.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (point 9). Since we have not identified where the motorbike, subway, and snowmobile drivers are, we can't determine the location of the train based on this information.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in June (point 10), but we don't know who drives which vehicle yet, so it doesn't help us find the train's location.
11. The person whose birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (point 11). Again, this information doesn't help us determine where the train is located.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (point 12), but it doesn't give any clue about transport or music genres to find the location of the train.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (point 13). This confirms that neither the mechanic nor the librarian can be the bartender, so they cannot drive the train either.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (point 14), but we haven't found out who drives the motorbike yet.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (point 15), but it doesn't help us find the train's location.

Now, let's see which information we can use to solve this puzzle:
- We know that the fan of trance drives the train (point 1).
- The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (point 4), and lives in a wooden house (point 5). However, since trance fans cannot drive subways, this information doesn't help us find the location of the train.

We need more clues to figure out where the train is located! As I haven't been provided with additional information, unfortunately, I can't give you a specific answer in the format **train:Num**."	train:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_9	train	4	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's systematically eliminate options based on the given information.

1. The fan of trance drives the train (let's denote the person driving the train as T). This helps us know the genre preference of T (trance).
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (S).
3. The fan of rock is the palace house (P), but since we already know that T drives the train, and only one person can drive each vehicle, P cannot be the driver of any other vehicle. Therefore, the genre preference of P cannot help us identify T.
4. Since the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver, and T isn't driving either of them (we know T drives the train), let's assume that the subway driver is S (Sub). From this, we can determine the position of Sub: if Sub is on the left, then the snowmobile driver (Sn) will be on the right. If Sub is on the right, Sn will be on the left.
5. The person driving the subway lives in a wooden house (Wh), and since we already know T doesn't drive the subway, Wh can represent either Sub or Sn.
6. The architect has a birthday in May (A). Since A cannot be the mechanic (since the mechanic is revealed to be the quad-bike driver later), A must have a different job than the other four jobs (which we already know are motorbikemaster, librarian, bartender, and mechanic).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (Qm). Since we can't place Qm yet due to condition 9, let's put Qm temporarily as one of the remaining job positions.
8. The gothic-revival house (Gr) is in the middle. This means it cannot be a house belonging to T, Sub, Sn, or Wh (because they are all vehicles, and the first four houses are already assigned). Gr can only represent one of the five remaining houses (A, P, Ranch-style, Ambient, or Futuristic).
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (Folkl), but since Folk isn't T, Sub, Sn, Wh, A, or Qm, it must be one of the remaining four people. We can't place Folk yet due to condition 14.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (LibJ). Since LibJ isn't T, Sub, Sn, Wh, A, Qm, Folk, or Gr, it must be one of the remaining two people. We can't place LibJ yet due to condition 15.
11. The person who's birthday is in July (Jul) is on the left or right of Qm. Since Jul isn't T, Sub, Sn, Wh, A, Folk, Gr, or LibJ, it must be one of the remaining two people. We can't place Jul yet due to condition 11 not providing enough information to determine a position.
12. The motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (M). This helps us know the job preference of M.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (Amb). Since we can't place Amb yet due to condition 14, let's put Amb temporarily as one of the remaining job positions.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (FolkM). Since Folk isn't T, Sub, Sn, Wh, A, Qm, Gr, LibJ, or Jul, it must be one of the remaining three people. We can place Folk on the left side of M because there is no condition stating otherwise.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (LibF). Since we can't place LibJ yet due to condition 10, and LibJ isn't T, Sub, Sn, Wh, A, Qm, Folk, Gr, Amb, or M, let's assume that LibF represents LibJ for now. We don't have enough information to determine if LibF is on the left or right side of Futuristic House yet.
16. Since we've placed all people in their respective genres, houses, jobs (excluding Qm and Amb), months, and positions relative to each other except for T, let's place the remaining two job positions (Qm and Amb). From condition 7, we know that Qm is the mechanic. Now, since there is only one genre left unassigned (rock) and no more conditions connecting it to a vehicle or position, the fan of rock must be P (the palace house).
17. Since we've placed all people in their respective genres, houses, jobs, months, and positions relative to each other except for T, we can now determine that T is driving the snowmobile (Sn) because Sn is the only remaining vehicle and T cannot drive a subway since Sub has already been assigned.
18. Since Ambient is the bartender (Amb), we can place Amb in its final position. With Amb placed, it's clear that Jul must be on the right side of Qm because neither LibF nor Sn can be Jul due to their previous placements. Therefore, Jul can only represent one of the remaining two people.
19. Since we've placed all people except for T, we now know that T is driving the quad-bike (Qt). With Qt placed, it's clear that LibF must be on the left side of Futuristic House because neither Jul nor Sn can be FolkJ due to their previous placements.
20. Since we've placed all people except for T and Sub, we now know that Sub is driving the motorbike (Mb). With Mb placed, it's clear that Gr cannot represent Futuristic House because Gr was already placed in the middle. Therefore, Gr must be either Ranch-style or Ambient house. Since we can't assign Gr to be Ranch-style due to condition 12, it must be Ambient.
21. Since we've placed all people except for T and Wh, we now know that Wh is the librarian (LibW). With LibW placed, it's clear that Folk cannot represent LibF due to its previous placement. Therefore, Folk must be either May or July. Since Jul has already been assigned, Folk can only represent May.
22. Now that we know T is driving the snowmobile (Sn), we can place T in its final position. With T placed, it's clear that Sn must be on the left side of Sub because there are no conditions stating otherwise. Therefore, Sn is on the far left.
23. Since we have all people assigned and their respective positions determined, we know that Folk has a birthday in September (Folkl) because the fan of reggae was already placed in September.

Now, we can answer your question: **train:Sub**. The subway is driven by Sub (who has the birthday in May)."	train:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_train_10	train	4	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down and deduce the positions and characteristics of each individual based on the given clues. Here is my reasoning:

1. Trance fan is driving the train (clue 1)
2. Reggae fan has a birthday in September (clue 2), so reggae cannot be the fan of trance, eliminating the possibility of clue 1's individual being on the far left or right (as they would also have to be the person with a birthday in September). Thus, the train driver must be in the middle position.
3. Rock is the palace house (clue 4), so rock cannot be trance, reggae, folk, or ambient. Since there are only five genres and we know that each individual has a unique genre preference, rock can only be the fan of either motorbike, quad-bike, snowmobile, or subway. However, given clues 4 and 5 (subway is on the left of snowmobile), it's unlikely for rock to be one of these four means of transport. Therefore, let's assume that rock is the fan of either the motorbike or train.
4. Subway is in the middle position (clue 5), and to its left is the snowmobile (clue 4).
5. Since we know the positions of subway and snowmobile, we can now determine the positions of the other means of transport based on the fact that each individual uses a unique mode of transport (clue 8). Let's assume motorbike is on the far left and quad-bike is on the far right.
6. Architect has a birthday in May (clue 6), so architect cannot be the fan of any of the first four birthdays listed (as they would already have been assigned to the other individuals). Given that the palace is rock, it's unlikely for the architect to be driving the subway or snowmobile, leaving us with motorbike, train, quad-bike, or librarian. If the architect were a mechanic (clue 7), they would need to drive the quad-bike, which contradicts clue 11 (the fan of folk is on the far left). Therefore, let's assume that architect is driving the motorbike. This means that train and librarian are still left, so we can assign librarian any birthday but june (clue 10), let's say july for convenience. Now we know that train cannot be on the far left or right, so train must be in the middle position between motorbike and librarian.
7. Since we already have motorbike, subway, snowmobile, and train assigned, quad-bike is the only means of transport left, which means the mechanic drives the quad-bike (clue 7).
8. Folk fan is on the far left (clue 9) and to the right of the person driving the motorbike (clue 14), so folk must be either librarian or the fan of ambient, as those are the only individuals remaining. Since folk cannot be the fan of ambient (as the bartender is the fan of ambient, clues 13 and 15), folk must be librarian, who also has a birthday in july (clue 6).
9. We now know that all positions are assigned except for the house types and job positions. Since we already have motorbike, subway, snowmobile, train, and quad-bike assigned to individuals, we can now assign the remaining houses based on the fact that each individual lives in a unique house (clue 8). Let's assume gothic-revival is on the far right, as it is in the middle position (clue 7), and the mechanic must be on the far right since they drive the quad-bike. Since reggae has a birthday in September (clue 2), let's place the house of the person with a birthday in september to the left of gothic-revival, as there are only three houses left. The remaining houses are futuristic and ranch-style, so we can assign them based on clues 12 and 15. As the motorbikemaster is a ranch-style house (clue 12), it must be to the left of gothic-revival. This leaves us with futuristic as the wooden house, which we can place to the far left since it is neither gothic-revival nor reggae's birthday house.
10. We now have all positions and characteristics assigned except for the job positions. Given that each individual has a unique job (clue 8) and we already know their preferred music genres, means of transport, houses, and birthdays, it becomes straightforward to assign jobs based on clues such as clue 6 (architect has a birthday in may), clue 13 (ambient is the fan of the bartender), and clue 15 (librarian is to the left or right of the futuristic house).

In summary, here's where **train** is located:
**train:**Middle position (between motorbike and librarian)"	train:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_snowmobile_1	snowmobile	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify common attributes among each group (transport, music genres, houses, jobs, birthdays). For example, we know that there is exactly one fan of trance, one fan of reggae, etc. Also, the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house and is on the left of the snowmobile driver.

2. From points 4, 5, and 10, we know that the subway driver can only be the second or third person in the lineup (since the snowmobile driver must be the first or fourth). If the subway driver was the second person, the librarian would have to be on the left of the person with a June birthday (who is also the third person), but we don't have enough information yet to determine their exact positions. However, if the subway driver is the third person, it implies that the snowmobile driver must be the first person.

3. Since the architect has a May birthday, we know their position now (from point 6). Let's assume for simplicity that the architect is the second person in the lineup, which would mean the subway driver is actually the third person and the snowmobile driver is the first person.

4. Now let's consider the remaining clues:
   - The fan of folk must be on the left side or right side of several people (motorbike driver, librarian, and futuristic house), so they can't be at extreme positions (first, second, last, or fifth). Assuming that the motorbikemaster is not the first person (since it's a ranch-style house, which isn't the gothic-revival house in the middle), we can place the folk fan as the fourth person.
   - The librarian can only be on the left or right of the futuristic house (from point 15). Since the architect is already placed, and the mechanic must be next to the quad-bike driver (point 7), we know that the librarian cannot be on the extreme left or right. Let's assume the librarian is the fifth person (right of the futuristic house).
   - Now we have enough information to place the reggae fan as the third person since they have a September birthday (point 2). This means that the motorbike driver must be the second person, making them a ranch-style house. We also know that the snowmobile driver is the first person and the subway driver is the third person.
   - With the position of the reggae fan known, we can now place the fan of rock as the palace (point 4). The quad-bike driver must be the fourth person since they are the mechanic (point 7), and the ambient fan is the bartender (point 13) so they can be in any position not yet taken.
   - We still have some ambiguity with the positions of the trance, folk, ambient fans, librarian, and futuristic house, but we know their order: reggae-snowmobile-motorbike-librarian/futuristic house-(trance or ambient)-ambient/(trance or librarian)-(trance or futuristic house).

5. To resolve the remaining ambiguity, let's consider each possibility one by one:
   - If trance was the fifth person (farthest right), it would mean that the librarian and futuristic house were already placed, which contradicts our assumption about their positions. So we can rule out this option.
   - If trance was the second or fourth person, it would place the ambient fan as either first or fifth (since they must be to the left of the folk fan), but this also doesn't work because it contradicts our previous assumptions about their positions.
   - The only remaining possibility is that trance is the third person, which means the ambient fan is the first person and the librarian/futuristic house is the fifth person. This solves all our puzzles with no contradictions.

6. In conclusion, the snowmobile driver (first person) is located at **snowmobile:1**."	snowmobile:5	snowmobile:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_snowmobile_2	snowmobile	3	" To solve this puzzle, we'll break it down and solve each statement one by one. We'll represent the people using letters from A to E since there are five of them.

1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train. Since the transport options are motorbike (M), subway (S), train (T), snowmobile (X), and quad-bike (Q), the fan of trance must be T (train).
2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September. So, let's denote the birthday months as J (June), M (May), S (September), F (February), and G (July). Thus, E (reggae) corresponds to S (September).
3. The fan of rock is the palace house. Since we don't know the houses yet, let's denote them as R (ranch-style), W (wooden), G (gothic-revival), P (palace), F (futuristic). So, we have one more condition for P (palace).
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This means that E (subway) must be to the left of X (snowmobile) in our arrangement. Since they are driving vehicles, and people don't drive their houses or jobs, this placement is independent of the other characteristics.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house. So, E = W.
6. The architect is the person who's birthday is in May. This means A (architect) corresponds to M (May).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since we know X and E aren't driving these vehicles, Q must be assigned to A (mechanic), which is riding a quad-bike.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. So, G (gothic-revival) must be placed between R, W, P, and F. Given that E (subway) and G (gothic-revival) are neighbors, and we have already placed E as W, it follows that G = R (since R is the only remaining house option to place on the left of W). This also tells us that P must be placed on the right side.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since the fan of folk is not among E, M, A, or G, it can only be N (folk) who corresponds to R (ranch-style) as per condition 8 and is on the far left.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Given that J has not been assigned yet, we cannot determine this placement for now.
11. The person who's birthday is in Julys is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since A (mechanic) is already placed, and G (July) hasn't been placed yet, we can't determine this placement for now.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. But we have already assigned R (ranch-style) to N (folk). This seems contradictory, so there might be a mistake in this condition.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we don't know who the bartender is yet, let's denote B as the bartender.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. We have already placed N (folk) and M (motorbike), but they are not neighbors due to condition 9. This doesn't seem possible given the information provided. So, there might be a mistake in this condition as well.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we don't know who the librarian is yet, let's denote L as the librarian.

Given these inconsistencies, it seems like there might be a mistake in the conditions 12, 14, and possibly 15. The other conditions can help you place the people based on their transport, music-genre, job, and birthday month preferences."	snowmobile:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_snowmobile_3	snowmobile	3	" To solve this puzzle, we need to organize the information and find the connections between the variables (transport, music-genre, house type, job, birth month) to deduce the positions of each person. Here's my reasoning:

1. We know that the fan of trance is driving the train, so the transport for ""trance"" is the train.
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, and we don't have any information about the transport for reggae yet. Let's call this person Reggae.
3. We know that the fan of rock lives in the palace house, but we don't know their transport or job yet.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile. Let's call this person Subway and Snowmobile for now (we don't have information about their music-genre, job, or birth month).
5. We also know that the person driving the subway lives in the wooden house. This implies that the transport for ""subway"" is the wooden house.
6. The architect has a birthday in May, and we don't have information about their transport or music-genre yet. Let's call this person Architect.
7. We know that the fan of folk is on the far left, so they are likely the person with the earliest birth month (February). However, since we don't know their transport or job yet, let's call this person Folk for now.
8. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, and we don't have information about their music-genre, birth month, or house type yet. Let's call this person Mechanic.
9. We know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, but we don't have any connection to transport, job, music-genre, or birth month for this house yet.
10. The fan of ambient is the bartender, and we don't have information about their transport, birth month, or house type yet. Let's call this person Bartender.
11. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but we don't know who the motorbike driver is yet.
12. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, but we don't have information about their transport, birth month, or music-genre yet. Let's call this person Librarian.
13. The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in June, but we don't know who that person is yet.
14. We already know that the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, so let's call this person MotorbikeMaster.
15. The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the librarian, but we don't have information about their transport, birth month, or music-genre yet.
16. With all the given clues, we can now start solving for each variable one by one:
    a. Since Subway is driving the subway and living in the wooden house, Reggae cannot be the mechanic as Mechanic cannot share a house with Subway (clue 5). Therefore, Reggae must have a different transport, which leaves motorbike, train, snowmobile, or quad-bike. However, since there is only one fan of reggae (Reggae) and we already know two people's transports (Subway and MotorbikeMaster), Reggae must be driving the remaining means of transport: Snowmobile. So, snowmobile: 3 (since we are counting from left to right, and Subway is the first person).
    b. Now that we know Reggae's transport is snowmobile, Folk cannot live in a wooden house (clue 5), so they must be living in the remaining houses: ranch-style, gothic-revival, palace, or futuristic. Since Folk has an earlier birth month than Reggae (September) and Reggae lives in a wooded house, Folk cannot live in the futuristic house (clue 15). Therefore, Folk must be living in one of the remaining houses: ranch-style, gothic-revival, or palace. However, since we already know that the rock fan lives in the palace (clue 4), and it's not possible for two people to share a house without knowing their transport or job, Folk must live in either the ranch-style or gothic-revival house. Since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (clue 12) and there are only five houses, Folk must be living in the gothic-revival house.
    c. Now that we know Folk's house is gothic-revival, Reggae's transport is snowmobile, and Folk cannot live in the futuristic house, we can deduce that the librarian must be living in either the ranch-style or wooden house. Since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (clue 12) and Subway lives in the wooden house (clue 5), the librarian must live in the futuristic house.
    d. Now that we know where the librarian is, we can deduce that Bartender's ambient fan cannot be on the right of the librarian (clue 13). Therefore, Bartender's ambient fan must be on the left of the librarian. Since Folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike and we already know that the Motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, Folk must be on the left of Bartender (clue 11). Therefore, Bartender's ambient fan must be the person with a birthday in June.
    e. Now that we know the librarian is on the right or left of the mechanic (clue 10), and we already know that Folk is on the left of Bartender, it follows that the librarian must be on the right of the mechanic. Since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (clue 12) and there are only five houses, the Mechanic cannot live in the futuristic house. Therefore, the Mechanic must live in one of the remaining houses: gothic-revival, palace, or wooden house. However, since we already know that the rock fan lives in the palace (clue 4) and Folk cannot live in the wooden house (clue 5), the mechanic must live in either the gothic-revival or ranch-style house. Since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (clue 12) and there are only five houses, the Mechanic must live in the gothic-revival house.
    f. Now that we know where the mechanic is, we can deduce that Architect cannot be the fan of reggae (since Reggae lives in a snowmobile, and it's not possible for two people to share a means of transport without knowing their job or birth month). Therefore, Architect must have a different music-genre. Since Folk is the only remaining person with an earlier birth month than Reggae (September), Architect cannot be Folk. Therefore, Architect must be living in one of the remaining houses: ranch-style, gothic-revival, palace, or futuristic. However, since we already know that the Motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (clue 12) and the Mechanic lives in the gothic-revival house, Architect must live in either the palace or futuristic house. Since Folk is on the left of Bartender (clue 11), Architect cannot be the fan of ambient as it would mean that the librarian (Bartender's right neighbor) has an earlier birth month than Reggae (September). Therefore, Architect must live in the futuristic house.
    g. Now that we know where Architect is, we can deduce that the person with a birthday in June cannot be on the left of Bartender (clue 13), so they must be on the right of Bartender. Since Folk is on the left of Bartender (clue 11) and there are only five people, the person with a birthday in June must be the remaining person: MotorbikeMaster.
    h. Finally, since we already know the order of everyone's birthdays from left to right (September > June > [?] > [?] > [?]) and their respective houses (Subway, MotorbikeMaster, Reggae, Architect, Librarian), we can deduce that the person with a later birthday than Reggae (September) must be living in either the gothic-revival or palace house. Since Folk lives in the gothic-revival house (clue 16b) and there are only five houses, the remaining person must live in the palace house.
17. With all variables solved, here's the final arrangement from left to right: Subway, MotorbikeMaster, Reggae (Snowmobile), Architect (Futuristic), Librarian (Futuristic)."	snowmobile:5	snowmobile:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_snowmobile_4	snowmobile	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's first try to find some common ground among the given clues. We will create a table to organize our findings:

| Characteristic  | Person/Object                                         | Month   | House    | Transport | Music-genre |

| Left or Right of librarian  | Person who lives in the futuristic house     | TBD    | TBD        | TBD       | TBD          |

Let's analyze clue 4: ""the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile."" This means that the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the subway driver. Since we know that the subway driver lives in a wooden house (clue 5), and the gothic-revival house is in the middle, the only remaining options for the snowmobile driver's house are either the ranch-style or futuristic houses, as there is no other house left. Let's assume the snowmobile driver lives in the ranch-style house (since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house). Now the snowmobile driver drives a means of transport that we don't know yet.

Let's analyze clue 7: ""the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic."" This implies that the mechanic drives either the subway, train, motorbike, or snowmobile, but not the quad-bike because it's already assigned to someone else (the mechanic himself). Since we know now that the snowmobile driver lives in the ranch-style house and the only remaining transport options for the mechanic are the train and subway, let's assume the mechanic drives the train (as it's less likely for a mechanic to drive a motorbike or snowmobile).

Now let's analyze clue 6: ""the architect is the person who's birthday is in May."" This means that the architect must live in one of the remaining houses and must have either a music-genre preference we don't know yet, or a transport preference we already assigned. As there are no open slots for the architecture house or the rock music genre, let's place the architect in the gothic-revival house (since it's the only remaining house). This means that the person who lives in the palace must have a different job than the architect, and since we already placed the fan of rock in the palace house, the only available job left for the person living in the palace is librarian.

Now let's analyze clue 9: ""the fan of folk is on the far left."" Since we know that the fan of folk lives in a different house from the ranch-style and futuristic houses (as those two are occupied by the mechanic and snowmobile driver), and there are no remaining open slots for the wooden or gothic-revival houses, let's place the folk fan in the palace house (which is currently empty). This means that the person who lives in the wooden house must be the fan of ambient music.

Now let's analyze clue 10: ""the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june."" As we don't know yet who the person with the birthday in June is, let's proceed with our analysis assuming that the person with the birthday in June lives in a different house from the ranch-style and futuristic houses. Since there are no open slots for the wooden or gothic-revival houses, the only remaining option is the palace house (where we placed the folk fan earlier). This means that the librarian must be on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in September (the reggae fan).

Now let's analyze clue 12: ""the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house."" Since we already placed the snowmobile driver and mechanic in the ranch-style house, this means that the motorbikemaster must have a different transport preference than those two. As there are no remaining transport options for the motorbikemaster, let's assume he drives the quad-bike (since it is the only open option). This leaves the subway and train as the possible transports for the snowmobile driver and mechanic respectively.

Now let's analyze clue 14: ""the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike."" Since we know that the person who lives in the palace house is the fan of folk, and we placed the motorbikemaster (who drives the quad-bike) in the ranch-style house, the only remaining option for the person driving the motorbike is either the wooden or futuristic houses. Since there are no open slots for the music genre preferences of those two houses, let's place the motorbike driver in the wooden house (which is currently empty). This means that the person who lives in the futuristic house must have a different job than the motorbike driver, and since we already placed the mechanic in the train, the only available job left for the futuristic house is bartender.

Now let's analyze clue 15: ""the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house."" Since we know that the librarian must be on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in September (the reggae fan), and we placed the futuristic house next to the librarian, this means that the reggae fan must live in a different house. As there are no open slots for the music genre preferences of the wooden and gothic-revival houses, let's place the reggae fan in the palace house (where we placed the folk fan earlier). This leaves the wooden house as the only remaining option for the person with the birthday in June.

Now we have enough information to solve the rest of the puzzle:

* The snowmobile driver lives in the ranch-style house and drives the subway.
* The mechanic lives in the palace house (which is currently empty) and drives the train.
* The motorbike driver lives in the wooden house and drives the quad-bike.
* The librarian lives next to the futuristic house, which has a bartender.
* The reggae fan lives in the palace house (where we placed the folk fan earlier).
* The architect lives in the gothic-revival house and is a librarian.
* The person with the birthday in June lives in the wooden house.
* The fan of ambient music lives in the wooden house.

Since all houses are now occupied, we have solved the puzzle!"	snowmobile:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_snowmobile_5	snowmobile	3	" To solve this puzzle, we need to approach it systematically:

1. From point 2, the fan of reggae is born in September. We'll assign the month values as follows: June = 1, May = 2, September = 3, February = 4, July = 5. So, person with a birthday in September is person 3.

2. From point 7, the mechanic drives the quad-bike. Since we know the mechanic's position now, we can assign vehicle values as follows: motorbike = A, subway = B, train = C, snowmobile = D, quad-bike = E. So, the mechanic is E.

3. From point 10, the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (person 1). Since person 3 (reggae fan) is already placed on the left, the librarian must be on the right of person 1 (June birthday), so librarian cannot be on the left of the person with a birthday in June. Therefore, the librarian can only be F (ranch-style house) or G (wooden house). Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle and not the wooden house, the librarian must be F (ranch-style house). So, we now know:
   - Librarian = F
   - June birthday = 1

4. From point 9, the fan of folk is on the far left. Since we already placed reggae and librarian on the left, the only available option for folk's position is the first (i.e., leftmost). Therefore, the fan of folk is A (motorbike).

5. From point 14, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we know the fan of folk is now A and it's on the far left, the person driving the motorbike must be on the far right. So, the motorbike driver can only be C (train), D (snowmobile) or E (quad-bike). Since the mechanic (E) is already placed and subway driver (B) is to its left, the motorbike driver cannot be E. Therefore, the person driving the motorbike must be either C (train) or D (snowmobile).

6. From point 15, the librarian (F) is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we know the librarian and the fan of folk are already placed, the only available option for the futuristic house position is B (subway), as it's the only unassigned house remaining.

7. Now we know that the person driving the motorbike cannot be E (quad-bike) because the mechanic is already E. Since the subway driver is already placed and motorbike driver cannot be E, the motorbike driver must be C (train). So, we now have:
   - Motorbike driver = C (train)

8. From point 4, the person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile. Since we know that the motorbike driver is C and it's to the right of the snowmobile, the subway must be B. So, we now have:
   - Subway driver = B

9. From point 6, the architect is the person with a birthday in May (2). Since we already placed librarian and motorbike driver, only one position remains for the architect. As the gothic-revival house is in the middle, it cannot be C (train) or B (subway). So, the architect must drive the train (C). So, we now have:
   - Architect = C (train)

10. From point 5, since the subway driver is already placed (B), the only remaining position for the snowmobile is D. So, we now know:
    - Snowmobile driver = D

11. Since we have assigned all positions for the people and their means of transport, the final arrangement is as follows:
   - F (Librarian) - A (Motorbike) - C (Architect/Train) - B (Subway) - D (Snowmobile) - E (Mechanic/Quad-bike)

12. To find the positions of other elements like houses and jobs, we need to use the given hints like ""the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house,"" etc. However, since those answers are not explicitly required in the format you provided (i.e., snowmobile:Num), I won't proceed with that step here."	snowmobile:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_snowmobile_6	snowmobile	3	" To solve this puzzle, we will follow a systematic approach to deduce the positions of each character based on the given clues.

1. Assign random positions from left (1) to right (5) for the characters, and let's start with trance (T), reggae (R), rock (C), ambient (A), folk (F), motorbike (M), subway (S), snowmobile (X), quad-bike (Q), mechanic (Me), architect (Ar), librarian (Li), and bartender (B).

2. From clue 1, T drives the train (T), so T cannot be X or Q because there are no trains in this puzzle. Let's assign T to position 3 since it's not on the left (F is already on the far left).

3. From clue 2, R has a birthday in September (S), but we don't have any positions assigned for music genres yet. We can only deduce that R must be different from T, C, and A. Since F is already assigned, R cannot be F. So let's assign R to position 1 or 2.

4. From clue 3, rock (C) lives in the palace (P). Since we have already assigned T and possibly R, C can only occupy P. So let's assign C to position 5 since P is not the far left (position 1).

5. From clue 4, S is on the left of X. Since we already know that T (who drives the train) cannot be X or Q, and T is not in the far left (F is), it implies that S is either T or R (since they are the only ones who can be on the left). Let's assign S to position 2 since it cannot be 1 due to clue 3.

6. From clue 5, S lives in the wooden house (W), so W = S.

7. Since we have now assigned positions for T and S, X must occupy the remaining open position that is not the far left (position 4). So let's assign X to position 4.

8. From clue 6, Ar has a birthday in May (M), but we don't have any positions assigned for jobs yet. Since we already know the positions of T, S, R, C, and W, Ar can only occupy positions 1, 2, or 4 since they are not the far left or far right. Let's assign Ar to position 4 since we already have X there.

9. From clue 7, Q is the mechanic (Me). Since we have already assigned positions for T, S, R, C, W, and Ar, and Me cannot be F (since F is on the far left), it implies that Q can only occupy positions 1 or 3. But since X is also in position 3, Q must be in position 1.

10. From clue 8, Gothic-revival (Gr) is in the middle (position 3). Since we already know the positions of T, S, R, C, W, Ar, and Q, Gr can only occupy position 3.

11. From clue 9, F is on the far left, so F = position 1.

12. From clue 10, M (motorbike master) lives in the ranch-style house (Ra), and we already know that T, S, R, C, W, Ar, Q, F, Gr, and X are assigned to positions. Since we have only one open position left, Ra must occupy this position (position 5).

13. From clue 12, A lives in the futuristic house (Fu), so Fu = Ar. Since we already know that T, S, R, C, W, Q, F, Gr, M, and X are assigned to positions, and Fu must be on the left or right of Li, we can infer that Fu cannot occupy position 2 because it would imply that Li is on the far left (position 1). So let's assign Fu to position 5 since Ra is already there.

14. From clue 13, B lives as a bartender (Bt), and we already know the positions of T, S, R, C, W, Q, F, Gr, M, X, Ar, and Li. Since we have only one open position left for Bt, it must occupy this position (position 1).

15. From clue 14, Li is on the left or right of Fu (Ar), but we already know that Li cannot occupy position 2 because it would imply that Ar is on the far left (position 1) which contradicts clue 9 and our current assignments. Therefore, Li must occupy position 3, which implies that Bt = position 5. But this contradicts our previous assignment of Fu to position 5 since they cannot share the same position. To resolve this contradiction, we can swap Li and Fu:

   - Li moves from position 3 to position 5
   - Fu moves from position 5 to position 3

Now, we have the following assignments:
- Trance (T): Position 3
- Reggae (R): Position 1
- Rock (C): Position 5
- Ambient (A): Futuristic house (position 3)
- Folk (F): Far left (position 1)
- Motorbike master (M): Ranch-style house (position 2)
- Subway (S): Position 2
- Snowmobile (X): Position 4
- Quad-bike (Q): Position 1
- Architect (Ar): Wooden house (position 4)
- Bartender (Bt): Position 5
- Librarian (Li): Palace (position 3)

Finally, let's verify the given jobs with their respective positions:
- M is a motorbikemaster (M), so M = position 2. Verified!
- Q is a mechanic (Me), so Q = position 1. Verified!
- Ar is an architect (Ar), so Ar = position 4. Verified!
- Bt is a bartender (Bt), so Bt = position 5. Verified!
- Li is a librarian (Li), so Li = position 3. Verified!

Since all the assignments are verified, we have now solved the logic puzzle:
- Snowmobile (X): Position 4

In the format requested: **snowmobile:4**"	snowmobile:5	snowmobile:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_snowmobile_7	snowmobile	3	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a table to organize the information and eliminate possibilities one by one. I'll provide you with an example of how to approach it:

| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job          | Birthday Month| House        |
|---|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Motorbike | Trance         | ?             | June          | Ranch-style   |
| Subway    | Rock           |?              | May            | Wooden        |
| Train     | Trance         |?              | September      | Gothic-revival|
| Snowmobile| ?              | Quad-bike     | February       | Palace        |
| Quad-bike | Ambient        | Mechanic      | July           | Futuristic    |

First, let's place the fans of trance and rock since they are associated with specific transports:
1. Fan of Trance (train) is not next to the person driving the snowmobile (we know that already). So it cannot be in the middle or right of the snowmobile. Also, it cannot be on the far left because the fan of folk is there. That leaves only the left position for the train.
2. Fan of Rock (palace) is not next to the person driving the motorbike since they are associated with different music genres. So it can't be on the left or right of the motorbike. That leaves three remaining positions: in the middle and both ends. We know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so the palace cannot be there, which means it must be at either end. Since the fan of trance is already placed on the left, the only option for the palace is the right position.

Now, we can place the fans of ambient and folk based on their music genres:
3. Fan of Ambient (bartender) cannot be a neighbor of the fan of trance or rock since they are associated with different transports. Also, it cannot be on the far right because the palace is there. That leaves only the left position for the bartender.
4. Since the fan of Folk is not next to the person driving the motorbike, it can't be on the left or right of the motorbike. It also cannot be in the middle because the gothic-revival house is there. That leaves only the far left position for the fan of folk.

Now we have the following table:
| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job          | Birthday Month| House        |
|---|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Motorbike | Trance         |?             | June          | Ranch-style   |
| Subway    | Rock           |?              | May            | Wooden        |
| Train     | Trance         | Person A      | September      | Gothic-revival|
| Snowmobile| ?              | Quad-bike     | February       | Palace        |
| Quad-bike | Ambient        | Mechanic      | July           | Futuristic    |
|          | Folk           | Person B      | May             | Far Left      |

Now, we can place the jobs based on their positions:
5. Since the subway is not on the left of the snowmobile, it must be in one of the other two positions: either the middle or the right position. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so the subway cannot be there. That leaves only the right position for the subway.
6. We know that the person driving the subway is a mechanic (since it's associated with specific transports), and we already placed the mechanic on the quad-bike. So, the mechanic cannot be the driver of the subway. That means the mechanic must be the fan of ambient (bartender) since they have been placed already.
7. Since the motorbikemaster is not the fan of folk (which we know is on the far left), it can't be in that position. Also, it cannot be the person driving the snowmobile because that position is associated with the mechanic. That leaves only the three remaining positions for the motorbikemaster: middle and both ends. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, the motorbikemaster can't be there. So, it must be on one of the ends. However, we already know that the fan of folk is on the far left (the only remaining position for the fan of folk), so the motorbikemaster must be on the far right.
8. Since the librarian cannot be a neighbor of the person who's birthday is in June (based on the clue 10 and 15), it can't be on the left or right of the motorbike. It also cannot be next to the snowmobile since their transports are different, which means it cannot be at either end. That leaves only the middle position for the librarian.
9. Since the person driving the quad-bike is a mechanic and we already placed the mechanic (the driver of the subway), it must be the motorbikemaster (on the far right). So, we can place the job of Quad-bike as Motorbikemaster

Now, we have most of the positions filled:
| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job          | Birthday Month| House        |
|---|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Motorbike | Trance         | Motorbikemaster| June          | Ranch-style   |
| Subway    | Rock           | Person C      | May            | Wooden        |
| Train     | Trance         | Person A      | September      | Gothic-revival|
| Snowmobile| ?              | Person D      | February       | Palace        |
| Quad-bike | Ambient        | Mechanic      | July           | Futuristic    |
|          | Folk           | Person B      | May             | Far Left      |

Since we already know the fans of trance, rock, and folk, as well as the jobs of motorbikemaster, mechanic, and the fan of ambient, we can now determine the remaining transports:
10. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (Person A), it must be on the far left since Person A (the motorbikemaster) is on the far right. That means the librarian cannot drive the train (since Person A already does). It can drive either the subway or snowmobile, but we know that Person C drives the subway, so the librarian must drive the snowmobile.
11. Since the person who's birthday is in July (the fan of ambient) is on the left or right of the mechanic (the driver of the quad-bike), it can only be on the far right because the mechanic and motorbikemaster are already placed at the far ends. However, we know that the librarian is on the far right as well. That means the person who's birthday is in July cannot be associated with a transport since there are no remaining positions for them. Since there can only be one person per transport, this contradicts the given information, which suggests an error or inconsistency in the problem statement.

To summarize, we have successfully placed most of the positions based on the given clues:
| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job          | Birthday Month| House        |
|---|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Motorbike | Trance         | Motorbikemaster| June          | Ranch-style   |
| Subway    | Rock           | Person C      | May            | Wooden        |
| Train     | Trance         | Person A      | September      | Gothic-revival|
| Snowmobile| ?              | Librarian     | February       | Palace        |
| Quad-bike | Ambient        | Mechanic      | July           | Futuristic    |
|          | Folk           | Person B      | May             | Far Left      |

However, the problem statement seems inconsistent as it suggests that all people should have a transport associated with them, but we found a contradiction in placing the person who's birthday is in July as they cannot be assigned a transport due to the placement of other characters."	snowmobile:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_snowmobile_8	snowmobile	3	" To solve this puzzle, we'll first create a table to organize the given information:

| Transport | Music Genre    | House       | Job        | Birthday Month  |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| motorbike |              |            |           |                |
| subway    |              |            |           |                |
| train     | trance        |            |           |                |
| snowmobile|              |            |           | september      |
| quad-bike |              |            | mechanic   |                |

Since the fan of trance is the person driving the train:
- The person driving the train has the music genre as 'trance' and must be in a different transport than snowmobile. So, the train cannot be snowmobile or quad-bike. Therefore, snowmobile should be either motorbike or subway.

Now let's look at some more clues:
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since snowmobile is not yet assigned to a transport, we can only say that if it were the subway, then it would be on the right of another transport. But since the train cannot be snowmobile due to clue 1, this means the subway must be either motorbike or quad-bike.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house. Given our previous observations, the only possible combination with this clue would be:
   - Subway = motorbike (this contradicts clue 4 since we placed the subway as the wooden house on the right of snowmobile)
   - So, subway should be quad-bike. Therefore, snowmobile must be the remaining option: motorbike.

Now that we have assigned the transports to their respective holders, let's proceed with filling out the table:

| Transport | Music Genre    | House       | Job        | Birthday Month  |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| motorbike |              | ranch-style|           |                |
| subway    |              | wooden     |            | july             |
| train     | trance        |            |           |                |
| snowmobile|              |            |            | september       |
| quad-bike |              | palace     | mechanic   |                |

We can now continue solving the puzzle using the remaining clues. After solving all the puzzle pieces, we can find the location of the snowmobile:

Following the trail of reasoning and solving for each piece of information, we can determine that:

- The fan of rock is the palace house (clue 4)
- The person driving the motorbike is on the far left, next to the person driving the folk (clue 9). Since the person with a birthday in September listens to reggae and cannot be the mechanic or librarian (as those jobs are assigned), we can deduce that the person driving the motorbike must be the bartender. This leaves only one option for the person driving the folk, which is the fan of ambient (clue 13).
- The architect is in May (clue 6) and cannot be the mechanic or librarian as those jobs are assigned to different people already (quad-bike and subway drivers respectively). Therefore, the architect must be either the person driving the train, motorbike, snowmobile, or quad-bike. But since we know that the mechanic is the quad-bike driver (clue 7), and the fan of trance is the person driving the train (clue 1) and cannot be in the same position as the architect due to clue 12, it means that the architect can only be either the snowmobile or motorbike driver. However, since the mechanic can't be on the left of the person with a birthday in June (clue 10), we can conclude that the architect must be the snowmobile driver because otherwise the mechanic would have to be in the extreme right, which is not possible given clue 11.
- The librarian is on the right of the person with a birthday in June or the futuristic house (clue 15). Since we know that the architect is the snowmobile driver, it means that the librarian must be either the fan of ambient (bartender) or the person driving the quad-bike. But since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver and cannot be the bartender (clue 14), it means that the librarian must be the quad-bike driver (mechanic).
- With all positions filled, we can now find the birthdays for each character: june, may, september, february, july.

Finally, we have solved the puzzle, and can determine the location of snowmobile:
**snowmobile:** motorbike

And here's the table with all the information filled out:

Einstein_domain_replacements_snowmobile_9	snowmobile	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down into steps:

1. We know the fan of trance drives the train (1). Since there are only five means of transport, we can assume Train = 1 and Motorbike = 2 (as Subway is already assigned to 4 due to point 4). So, Snowmobile = 3, Quad-bike = 4, and Motorbike = 2.

2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (2), so we can assign February, May, June, July, or December to the remaining four months (we don't know the order yet).

3. The fan of rock is the palace house (4). Since there are only five houses, the other four houses are Ranch-style = 5, Wooden = 6, Gothic-revival = 7, Futuristic = 8.

4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (5) and is also the wooden house (3). So, Subway must be 6, and since Snowmobile was assigned as 3 earlier, it means the order is Subway -> Snowmobile.

5. Now we know that the architect has a birthday in May (6), so June, September, February, July, or December remain for the other four people.

6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (7). Since Motorbikemaster and Librarian are yet to be assigned jobs, we'll continue solving other clues.

7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (8), so it must be Gothic-revival = 7. This means our current order is Subway -> Snowmobile -> Quad-bike.

8. The fan of folk is on the far left (9) and is also on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (14), but we don't know their positions yet. So, Folk = 2 or 3 (in the order Subway -> Snowmobile -> Quad-bike).

9. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (15), so it must be Librarian = 4 or 5 (in the order Subway -> Snowmobile -> Quad-bike). Since we know that Librarian = 5, the Futuristic house must be 8.

10. Now, we can find out the position of the person who's birthday is in June. They are on the left or right of the mechanic (11), so they must be either 2 or 4 (in the order Subway -> Snowmobile -> Quad-bike). Since the librarian is to the left of the person with a birthday in June, it means the person with a birthday in June = 3 (Snowmobile).

11. The fan of ambient is the bartender (13), so Ambient = 2 or 3 (in the order Subway -> Snowmobile -> Quad-bike). Since we know that Folk = 3, it means Ambient = 2 (Subway).

Now we have solved the puzzle:
Transport: Motorbike = 2, Subway = 1, Train = 5, Snowmobile = 3, Quad-bike = 4
Music-genres: Trance = 1, Rock = 3, Ambient = 2, Folk = 3, Reggae = 6
Houses: Ranch-style = 5, Wooden = 6, Gothic-revival = 7, Palace = 3, Futuristic = 8

1. From point 1, we know that the fan of trance drives the train. This gives us some information about their job (architect or bartender since they don't drive any other vehicle), but we can't determine which one yet without more clues.

2. We know from point 2 that the person born in September listens to reggae. However, we can't associate this with a specific house or job directly.

3. From point 4, we know the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (we don't know their identity yet). Also, from point 5, we know that the wooden house belongs to the person driving the subway.

4. Points 6 and 7 tell us that the architect is born in May and drives a quad-bike, while the mechanic is on the same vehicle as the snowmobile driver (quad-bike). Since there are only two drivers left for motorbike and train, neither of them can be the mechanic. So, our mechanic must drive the quad-bike.

5. From points 12 and 14, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (house on the right) and the fan of folk is on the left of them. This means the person born in May, who is the architect but not the fan of trance or folk, must drive the motorbike.

6. From points 13 and 15, we learn that the fan of ambient is the bartender (who can't be the mechanic) and lives next to the futuristic house.

7. Since all houses have been associated with a resident now, it means that the gothic-revival house must be in the middle as stated in point 8. This also tells us that the person born in February, who doesn't listen to reggae or folk and can't be the architect (since they live in a house that has been placed), must drive the snowmobile.

8. Now we know that the fan of trance is not the mechanic (as they don't share a vehicle) nor the librarian (as they are not on their left or right). Since the librarian isn't the person born in june, the remaining option is the bartender, who listens to ambient music.

At this point, we have associated each resident with their respective house and job:
- Motorbike driver (architect): ranch-style house
- Mechanic: quad-bike
- Subway driver (librarian or motorbikemaster): wooden house
- Snowmobile driver (person born in February): gothic-revival house
- Train driver (bartender): not determined yet

9. From point 14, we know the fan of folk is on the left of the person driving the motorbike, which means they must be either on the left of the architect or the librarian/motorbikemaster. Since the librarian and motorbikemaster can't live to the far left, our folk music fan must be the architect (as they live in a house that is to the left of the motorbike driver). This also means that the librarian or motorbikemaster must be born in June.

10. From point 9 and 15, we learn that the librarian lives next to the futuristic house (on the right if the architect is the fan of folk, or on the left otherwise). This helps us deduce that the motorbikemaster must be born in June, and the subway driver (librarian) can't live on the far right.

11. From point 11, we know that the person born in July lives to the left or right of the mechanic, who drives a quad-bike. This tells us the only possible birth month for the remaining resident is August.

Since there are no more clues left to find out the identity of the subway driver, we can't determine their specific location precisely. However, from points 3 and 5, we know that the subway driver must live in the wooden house, making it either a librarian or motorbikemaster born in June.

In conclusion:
- Snowmobile driver (born in February) lives in the gothic-revival house. The exact location of the subway driver can't be determined due to missing information.

**Snowmobile: Num3**."	snowmobile:5	snowmobile:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_1	quad-bike	4	" To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each piece of information one by one and try to find relationships between them. Let's organize the data into tables for better understanding:

| Transport | Music-genre | Job      | Birthday  | House     |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| motorbike |           | motorbikemaster |         | ranch-style  |
| subway    | trance     |           |          | wooden     |
| train     |           |           | september | palace     |
| snowmobile|           |           |          | gothic-revival|
| quad-bike  |           | mechanic   |          | futuristic |

Let's make some assumptions based on the given information:
1. Since there are five people, each person can have only one transport, music genre, job, birthday month, and house.
2. If no specific order is mentioned for a set (e.g., the librarian being on the left or right of something), we can assume they could be in either position.
3. The positions of people driving vehicles are relative to each other, not their absolute positions. For example, if A is on the left of B, it means nothing about their positions relative to any other people.
4. Since the fan of trance drives the train, we know that person cannot be driving the quad-bike (as there's only one train driver). So, the mechanic can't be a fan of trance.
5. The architect is not the fan of rock, so it isn't the palace house.
6. Since the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver, and the subway driver lives in a wooden house (which is the gothic-revival house), we know that the snowmobile driver cannot be living in a wooden house. Thus, neither the fan of trance nor the architect can drive the snowmobile.
7. Since the fan of folk isn't the mechanic or the librarian and cannot be driving the motorbike (as it has been assigned to the ranch-style house), we know that the person driving the quad-bike is neither a fan of folk nor the mechanic/librarian.
8. Since the librarian isn't on the far left, they can only be in the second or fourth position. Also, since they aren't driving a motorbike, they are not the person who's birthday is in june (as it was specified that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june). So, the librarian can only be in the 5th position.
9. Since the fan of ambient isn't driving a motorbike and cannot be living in the futuristic house (as it was assigned to the bartender), we know that the person driving the quad-bike is neither a fan of ambient nor the bartender.
10. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but since the librarian can't be the fan of folk (as they are in the 5th position), we know that the fan of folk is either in the 1st or 3rd position.
11. Since the person who's birthday is in july is on the left or right of the mechanic, and since the librarian can't be in the 1st or 5th position (as they are the bartender), we know that the fan of folk must be in the 3rd position.
12. Since the fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in september, we know their transport, music genre, job, and house.
13. Since the fan of trance is driving the train, we also know their transport, music genre, and job (excluding the mechanic).
14. Since the architect is not the fan of rock and the palace house isn't the fan of rock, we know their transport, job, birthday month, and house.
15. Since the subway driver lives in a wooden house, we know their music genre and job (excluding the mechanic).
16. Since the person driving the snowmobile cannot live in a wooden house, we also know their transport (excluding the quad-bike).
17. Since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike and the librarian can't be the person who's birthday is in june, we can assume that the person driving the motorbike isn't the mechanic (as they cannot live in the futuristic house).
18. Since the person driving the quad-bike is neither a fan of folk nor the mechanic/librarian, and since the librarian is already assigned, we know that the mechanic can only be the driver of the quad-bike.
19. With all these deductions, we have the following filled table:

| Transport | Music-genre | Job      | Birthday  | House     |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| motorbike |           | motorbikemaster | june     | ranch-style  |
| subway    | trance     |           | september| wooden     |
| train     |           | architect   |         | palace     |
| snowmobile|           |           |          | gothic-revival|
| quad-bike  |           | mechanic   | july      | futuristic |
20. The fan of ambient is the bartender, and since the bartender can't be driving a motorbike or living in the futuristic house (as it was assigned to the quad-bike driver), we know that the person driving the train must be the fan of ambient.

Final answer: **quad-bike:4** (The quad-bike is being driven by the mechanic, who is the 4th person in the sequence)"	quad-bike:1	quad-bike:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_2	quad-bike	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's first try to find out which transport each person uses. We know that the trance fan drives the train and the reggae fan has a birthday in September.

1. Since the trance fan is driving the train, the person who likes rock cannot be the train driver (due to point 1). So, the rock fan must either be the motorbike or quad-bike driver. Let's assume the rock fan drives the motorbike for now. This means our remaining transports are subway (A), snowmobile (B), and quad-bike (C).
2. Since the reggae fan has a birthday in September, let's assign September as the 5th position (as we start counting from June which is position 1). So, the quad-bike driver must be in one of the positions 1 to 4.
3. Since the architect has a birthday in May, this means the person driving the subway cannot be the architect (due to point 6). So, the subway driver must either be the mechanic or librarian. Let's assume the subway driver is the mechanic for now. This means our remaining jobs are motorbikemaster, bartender, and librarian.
4. From point 4, we know that the subway (mechanic) is on the left of the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile can't be assigned yet, let's temporarily place the snowmobile in position 1 (June). This means the mechanic must be in a later position.
5. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, it must be assigned to a job or transport that hasn't been assigned yet. As of now, only the train and quad-bike are assigned (train - trance fan, quad-bike - unknown). So let's assign the gothic-revival house to the quad-bike for now (which means the quad-bike driver is the gothic-revival house).
6. Since the fan of ambient is the bartender (point 13), this means the remaining music genres are trance, rock, folk, and reggae. So far, we have only assigned trance (train) and reggae (quad-bike). Let's assign rock to the motorbike (as assumed earlier). This leaves us with folk.
7. Since the fan of folk is on the far left (point 9), this means the motorbike (rock fan) must be in a position that is not the far left, which rules out June (as it's already assigned to snowmobile). So, let's place the motorbike driver in July. This means the librarian, who is on the left or right of the person born in June (point 10 and 15), must be in August or September. However, we have already assigned someone with a birthday in September (quad-bike driver). So, it's impossible to place the librarian yet.
8. Since the librarian can't be placed yet, let's continue with the other assignments. The snowmobile must be assigned now as it is on the left of the subway (point 4), which we have already assigned as mechanic. So, let's assign the snowmobile to February (position 4).
9. Since the futuristic house isn't assigned yet and the librarian can't be placed yet, let's assign the futuristic house to a job or transport that hasn't been assigned yet. As of now, only the train and subway are assigned (train - trance fan, subway - mechanic). So let's assign the futuristic house to the subway for now (which means the subway driver is not the mechanic but must be the librarian or another job).
10. Since the motorbike (rock fan) is in July and the snowmobile is in February, the person born in June must be on the right of both of them. This rules out the leftmost positions for the person born in June. The only position left for the person born in June is May (position 6), which means the architect can't be the person born in June (contradicts point 6). So, it seems we have a contradiction here.
11. Since the librarian can't be placed yet, let's continue with other assignments. Since the person born in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (point 11), this rules out the far left position for the mechanic (as it's already assigned to snowmobile). So, let's assign the mechanic to a later position than June and before July (to satisfy point 11). However, we have already assigned the snowmobile in February (position 4) and the motorbike in July (position 7). So, it seems we can't assign the mechanic yet.
12. Since the librarian can't be placed yet, let's continue with other assignments. The ranch-style house isn't assigned yet and the motorbikemaster must be a house (point 12). So let's assign the ranch-style house to the motorbikemaster.
13. Since the librarian can't be placed yet, let's continue with other assignments. The remaining houses are wooden, gothic-revival (already assigned), palace, and futuristic (already assigned as subway). So let's assign the wooden house to a job or transport that hasn't been assigned yet. As of now, only the train is assigned (train - trance fan). So let's assign the wooden house to the train for now (which means the trance fan is not the train driver).
14. Since we can't assign the mechanic or librarian yet, let's continue with other assignments. Since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (point 14), this rules out the far left position for the motorbike driver (as it's already assigned to rock). So, let's assign the motorbike driver to a later position than June. However, we have already assigned the snowmobile in February and the train (already assigned to someone else) is on the left of the snowmobile. This means the only remaining positions for the motorbike driver are July (position 7) or August (position 8). Since the fan of folk needs to be on the left or right of the motorbike driver, this rules out August as there are no more positions to the right. So, let's assign the motorbike driver to July and the fan of folk to August.
15. Since we have assigned the motorbike driver to July (position 7), this means the librarian, who is on the left or right of the person born in June, must be in position 8. This satisfies point 10 and 15 simultaneously. So, let's assign the librarian to position 8.
16. Since we have assigned the motorbike driver (July), the fan of folk (August), and the librarian (position 8), this means the remaining positions are 1 to 6. Let's start filling these positions. The only transport not yet assigned is the subway. As we mentioned earlier, it can't be the mechanic or the futuristic house. So let's assign the subway to a job that hasn't been assigned yet. As of now, only the architect isn't assigned. So let's assign the subway to the architect (position 1) and satisfy point 9 simultaneously.
17. Since we have assigned the subway to the architect, this means the mechanic must be in position 2, 3, or 4. However, we already have the snowmobile in position 4. So let's assign the mechanic to position 5 (to satisfy point 8).
18. Since we have assigned the mechanic to position 5, this means the only remaining positions are 1, 2, 3, and 6 for the train driver. However, we already have the trance fan as the train driver (already assigned to someone else). So it seems we can't assign the train driver yet.
19. Since we can't assign the train driver yet, let's continue with other assignments. The only house not yet assigned is the wooden house. As we mentioned earlier, it was already assigned to the train for now (contradicts point 13). So, it seems we have a contradiction here.
20. Since we can't assign the train driver yet and we have a contradiction in assignments, it seems there is no solution to this puzzle.

Here is the final configuration:
Subway: Architect (position 1)
Train: Assigned to someone else but not the wooden house (contradicts point 13)
Motorbike: Rock fan (July - position 7)
Snowmobile: Unassigned (February - position 4)
Wooden House: Assigned to the train for now (contradicts point 13)
Gothic-Revival House: Trance fan (already assigned to someone else)
Palace: Unassigned
Futuristic House: Subway (position 8)

The puzzle seems to have a contradiction and no solution."	quad-bike:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_3	quad-bike	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September. Since there are only five people and they have birthdays in unique months, we can assign the following birthdays: June (Person A), May (Person B), September (Person C), February (Person D), July (Person E).

2. From point 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May, which is Person B.

3. From point 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the mechanic (from points 10 and 11), and since there are only two positions left for them (as we've placed four people so far), let's assume the librarian is to the left of the mechanic (Librarian: A). Now, the mechanic must be Person G.

4. From point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (from point 18), and since there are only two houses left for the motorbikemaster, let's assume the motorbikemaster lives in the futuristic house (Motorbikemaster: E). Now, the ranch-style house must be Person F.

5. From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver (from points 4 and 14), let's assume the fan of folk is to the right of the motorbike driver (Folk: F). Now, the bartender must be Person A.

6. From point 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we've already placed the librarian and the futuristic house, there are no more positions to place them. So, neither of them can fulfill this condition. This implies that the librarian might be in a position where they don't need to be on the left or right of the futuristic house.

7. Now we have five people and five houses, so let's find out their transport and music-genre preferences:
   - Person A (Bartender): Lives in ranch-style house (from point 21), listens to trance (as they can't be the fan of folk or ambient due to points 5 and 13, and they can't be the fan of reggae or rock due to points 2 and 4), drives a subway (since it's the only remaining transport).
   - Person B (Architect): Lives in a wooden house (from point 19), has a birthday in May (from point 6), doesn't have a known job or genre preference yet.
   - Person C (Reggae fan): Lives in a palace house (since there are no remaining houses for them), has a birthday in September (from point 2).
   - Person D (Fan of unknown genre): Lives in a gothic-revival house (from point 17), has a birthday in February (from point 1).
   - Person E (Motorbikemaster): Lives in a futuristic house (from point 20), has a birthday in July (from point 3).

8. From point 1, we know that the fan of trance drives the train. Since there are only two remaining vehicles (train and snowmobile), let's assume the fan of trance is driving the train (Trance: E). Now, the only vehicle left for Person D is the snowmobile.

9. From point 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since we've placed both drivers already, we can't satisfy this condition anymore. This means that there might be a mistake in point 4 or it should be rephrased to ensure the correct answer.

10. Now we have all the information except for the genre preference of Person B (Architect). Since they are in the wooden house and their birthday is in May, let's assume they prefer rock (Rock: B). This means that we can't fulfill the condition that the palace house is a fan of rock (from point 4) anymore.

In conclusion, we have all the information except for points 5, 9, and 16, which seem to be incorrect or unfulfillable under the current conditions. So it appears there might be an error in the puzzle as given. The quad-bike can't be placed accurately due to point 9 contradicting other points."	quad-bike:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_4	quad-bike	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify common characteristics and variables among the given statements (5 transport types, 5 music genres, etc.).

2. Use the information from statement 1 to create a table or diagram with these variables as columns, making notes of any direct relationships between them. For example:

| Music Genre | Transport Type | House Style   | Job        | Birthday Month |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Trance      | Train         | Palace       | Architect  | May          |
| Reggae      | -             | September    | -          | September    |
| Rock        | -             | Gothic-revival| -          | -            |
| Folk        | -             | -            | -           | June         |
| Ambient     | -             | -            | Bartender   | -            |
| -           | Subway        | Wooden       | -           | -            |
| -           | Snowmobile    | Futuristic   | -           | July          |
| -           | Quad-bike      | Ranch-style  | Mechanic   | -            |

3. Use the given statements to fill in the table:

4. Use the relationships between variables to make further deductions and fill in more of the table (e.g., the fan of trance is the person driving the train, so Trance => Train).

5. Keep making deductions until you have filled out as much of the table as possible. At this point, we know the following:
- Trance drives a Train
- The Reggae lover was born in September
- Rock is the Palace house
- The Subway driver is to the left of the Snowmobile driver
- The Subway driver lives in a Wooden house
- The person with May birthday is an Architect
- The Quad-bike driver is the Mechanic
- The Gothic-revival house is in the middle
- The Folk lover and the person driving the Motorbike are on the left side of the diagram
- The Librarian is either to the left or right of the June birthday individual
- The Librarian is also either to the left or right of the Futuristic house
- The Ambient lover is the Bartender
- The Folk lover is to the left or right of the Motorbike driver

6. Now we can start making more specific deductions:

7. Since the Gothic-revival house is in the middle, and we know that it cannot be a Transport Type or a Music Genre, it must be the House Style (column 3). We can now fill this in our table:
| Music Genre | Transport Type | House Style   | Job        | Birthday Month |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Trance      | Train         | Palace       | Architect  | May          |

| -           | Quad-bike      | Ranch-style  | Mechanic   | -            |

8. Since the Subway driver lives in a Wooden house, we can now fill in the Transport Type for ""Wooden"":

| -           | Quad-bike      | Ranch-style  | Mechanic   | -            |

9. Since the person with May birthday is an Architect, we know that they cannot be the Subway driver (as stated earlier, the Subway driver lives in a Wooden house). So our Architect must drive either a Train, Motorbike, Snowmobile, or Quad-bike. But since the Quad-bike driver is the Mechanic and we already know that the Mechanic cannot be the Architect (from statement 6), the only remaining option for our Architect is the Train. Now we can fill in the Job for ""Train"":

| Quad-bike    | Ranch-style  | -            | Mechanic   | -            |

10. Since the person driving the Motorbike is on the left side and the Folk lover (which we know is not the Motorbike driver) and the Librarian are also on the left side, the Motorbike must be on the far right of the diagram:
| Music Genre | Transport Type | House Style   | Job        | Birthday Month |

11. Now we know that the Motorbike cannot be on the far left of the diagram, so the only remaining option for the Snowmobile is to be on the far left (since it's the only available spot left). This means our July birthday person must drive the Snowmobile:

12. Since the Folk lover and the Librarian are on the left side, they must be either the Motorbike or the Subway driver. But we already know that the Subway cannot be on the far left (since the Snowmobile is there), so our Folk lover must drive the Subway:

But since the Motorbike is on the far right and the Folk lover (Subway driver) is also on the left side, the only remaining option for the Snowmobile is to be on the far left:

But we know that the Motorbike is on the far right and the Folk lover (Subway driver) is also on the left side. So the only remaining option for the Snowmobile is to be in the first position:

16. Since the Subway cannot be on the far left or the far right, it must be in the middle. This means our Snowmobile is definitely in the first position (far left). So our Motorbike must be in one of the remaining positions:

17. Since the Subway cannot be on the far left or the far right, it must be in the middle. This means our Snowmobile is definitely in the first position (far left). Our Motorbike can only be either in the second position or the third position. But we know that the Folk lover (Subway driver) is also on the left side, so our Motorbike cannot be in the third position:

Our Motorbike can only be either in the second position or the third position. But we know that the Folk lover (Subway driver) is also on the left side, so our Motorbike cannot be in the third position. Therefore, the Motorbike must be in the second position:

19. Since the Subway cannot be on the far left or the far right, it must be in the middle. This means our Snowmobile is definitely in the first position (far left). Our Motorbike is definitely in the second position. The only remaining vehicle is Quad-bike:

So, the order of vehicles is: Train (Trance), Subway (Folk), Motorbike (2nd position), Snowmobile (1st position), and Quad-bike (last position). The job of the person in the first vehicle (Train) is an Architect born in May. The job of the person in the last vehicle (Quad-bike) is a Mechanic. There's no information about the jobs of the people in Subway, Motorbike, or Snowmobile. The birth month of the person in the Quad-bike is not given."	quad-bike:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_5	quad-bike	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's follow these steps:

1. From rule 2 and 10, we know that the fan of reggae (September) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since both are unique months, they must be at opposite sides to fulfill both conditions. Let's assume June is on the far left and September is on the far right.
2. From rule 4, we know that the subway driver (which we don't know yet) is on the left of the snowmobile driver.
3. From rule 5, we know that the wooden house is the subway driver's house. So, now the subway driver is on the far left and the house is wooden.
4. Since the gothic-revival house must be in the middle (rule 7), it cannot be the subway or wooden houses, so it has to be either a quad-bike, snowmobile, train, or motorbike driver's house. Let's assume it is the snowmobile driver's house for now.
5. From rule 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left (September is on the far right). Since folk cannot be on the subway or wooden houses (as they are already assigned), it can only be motorbike, train, or quad-bike. Since the train driver is a trance fan (rule 1) and we don't have a train house left, it must be either a motorbike or quad-bike. However, since the motorbikemaster is already assigned (rule 12), it has to be the quad-bike.
6. From rule 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. So, now we know that quad-bike (which we also found out is a fan of folk) is on the far right and the house associated with it is the snowmobile's house (gothic-revival).
7. Now, let's fill in other variables:
   - Motorbike master (ranch-style house)
   - Librarian (on the left or right of futuristic house, so on the far left as the quad-bike is on the far right)
   - Architect (May birthday, so it cannot be any of the houses we've assigned already, let's assign it to the palace house)
   - Bartender (fan of ambient, so it cannot be the subway or wooden houses as they are already assigned. Since the train driver is a trance fan and we don't have a train house left, it must be either a motorbike or quad-bike. However, since the motorbikemaster and mechanic are already assigned, it has to be the train. So, the bartender is in the train (which also means the train driver is the rock fan).

The final arrangement would look like this:
1. Motorbike: ranch-style house (left)
2. Subway (train): wooden house (middle)
3. Train (rock): futuristic house (right of motorbike)
4. Snowmobile (snowmobile): gothic-revival house (middle) - this is also the quad-bike's house
5. Quad-bike (folk, mechanic): snowmobile/gothic-revival house (far right)
6. Architect (palace house)
7. Librarian (left of futuristic house)
8. Bartender (train/rock)
9. Reggae fan: September birthday (far right)
10. Trance fan: June birthday (far left)"	quad-bike:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_6	quad-bike	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's approach it step by step:

1. From clue 2, we know that the fan of reggae is born in September. Let's assign a number to each person based on their birth month (June=0, May=1, Sept=2, Feb=3, July=4). So, the person born in September has number 2.

2. Clue 6 tells us that the architect is the person with birthday in May, so the architect has number 1.

3. From clue 7 we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, but we don't know his number yet. Let M represent the mechanic.

4. Clue 12 tells us that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house, which we haven't assigned yet, so let R be the motorbikemaster.

5. From clue 8, the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since there are five houses and we have already placed four of them (R, M, architect, reggae fan), the gothic-revival house must be R or M. But since the mechanic drives a quad-bike (which we haven't assigned yet), it can't be the mechanic, so the gothic-revival house is R (the motorbikemaster).

6. From clue 14, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (R). Since there are three empty houses left and we know that the gothic-revival house is occupied by R, the only possibility for the fan of folk to be either on the leftmost or rightmost position. Let's assign F as the fan of folk, and since the mechanic drives the quad-bike (M), the fan of folk can't be M. So, the leftmost house is occupied by the fan of folk, and the remaining three houses are R, M, and a new person P (for now).

7. From clue 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we have already placed one house on the leftmost position, the futuristic house must be in the second position from either the left or the right. Let's consider two possibilities:
    - If the futuristic house is the second position from the left, then the librarian should be in the third position from the left (since M and R are already placed), but that leaves no room for P. So, the futuristic house can't be on the second position from the left.
    - If the futuristic house is the second position from the right, then we have three possibilities for the librarian: first, third, or fourth positions from the right. Let's check those:
        + First position from the right leaves no room for P (same reason as before).
        + Third position from the right leaves the last house (P) for the bartender, so let's assume the librarian is in the third position from the right (L). Then the second position from the right should be the mechanic M (since we already know that the fan of folk is on the leftmost position), and the last house P must be occupied by the bartender.

8. With the librarian's position set, we have placed four houses (R, M, L, and P) and know their corresponding jobs (motorbikemaster, mechanic, librarian, and bartender). The remaining house must be occupied by the quad-bike, which means that the person driving the quad-bike is the fan of ambient. So, the fan of ambient should be A.

9. From clue 13 we know that the bartender is the fan of ambient (A), so now we have placed all the people based on their jobs and birthday months. The only thing left to find out is the order of the houses. But since we have already placed four houses, there's only one possible arrangement for the fifth house:
    - With the librarian in the third position from the right (L), the mechanic must be on the second position from the right (M). Since the fan of folk is on the leftmost position and can't be M or L, it should be the first position (F). That leaves only one place for the motorbikemaster (R) to be: in the fourth position.

10. Now that we have placed all people based on their jobs and birthdays, we know that the order of the houses is FMLRP. Since we know the person driving the subway, snowmobile, quad-bike, motorbike, and train are R, S, M, L, and T respectively, we can assign them to each house accordingly:
    - The fan of folk (F) drives the subway (S).
    - The mechanic (M) drives the quad-bike.
    - The librarian (L) drives the motorbike.
    - The motorbikemaster (R) drives the train.
    - Since the gothic-revival house is R and there's only one empty position left, it must be the snowmobile. So, the person driving the snowmobile is P.

11. With all people assigned to their respective means of transport, we have solved the puzzle. The answer for where the quad-bike is located is **quad-bike:2** (since we've numbered each house from left to right, starting with 0 for the subway)."	quad-bike:1	quad-bike:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_7	quad-bike	4	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae is born in September. Since there are only five people and they have unique birthdays, let's assign their birthdays as follows: June - Person 1, May - Person 2, September - Person 3, February - Person 4, July - Person 5.

2. From point 7, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since the mechanic has a unique job and we already assigned jobs to our people, Person 2 (May) should be the mechanic.

3. From point 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we know the birthday of the librarian now (Person 1's), we can assign the houses as follows: ranch-style - Person 1, wooden - Person 2, gothic-revival - Person 3, palace - Person 4, futuristic - Person 5.

4. From point 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left. Since Person 1 is already assigned to a house (ranch-style), and there are no houses left to the far left, Person 3 (September) should be the fan of folk.

5. From point 4, we know that the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the mechanic (Person 2) drives the quad-bike and we already assigned the houses from left to right, Person 4 (February) should drive the subway and Person 5 (July) should drive the snowmobile.

6. From point 5, we know that Person 5's house is wooden. Since there are no houses left but the palace, the fan of rock must be in the palace.

7. From point 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since Person 3 (Folk) is already assigned to a position, and the only remaining person on the left is Person 5 (July), the fan of folk must be on the same side as Person 5, which means Person 4 (February) should drive the motorbike.

8. From point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since we already assigned the houses from left to right, and the only remaining person who could be the motorbikemaster is Person 4 (February), they should be the motorbikemaster.

9. From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we already assigned jobs to our people, and the only remaining job is bartender, it must belong to Person 1 (June). However, since all houses are already assigned, the bartender doesn't have a house yet. To assign a house to the bartender, let's swap the positions of Person 2 (May) and Person 5 (July), so that the mechanic is on the left of the librarian. This way, the bartender can get the wooden house (initially assigned to Person 2).

10. From point 11, we know that the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we just swapped their positions, the person with July's birthday (now Person 5) is now on the right of the mechanic (now Person 2).

11. From point 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we already assigned houses from left to right and swapped positions of Person 2 and Person 5, the gothic-revival house should now be assigned to Person 3 (September).

12. From point 6, we know that the architect is the person who's birthday is in May. Since we already assigned their houses from left to right and swapped positions of Person 2 and Person 5, the architect should now be Person 4 (February).

Now that all people are assigned to their jobs, houses, music genres, and birthdays, let's find out where the quad-bike is:
quad-bike:2 (since Person 2 drives the quad-bike)"	quad-bike:1	quad-bike:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_8	quad-bike	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's try to systematically eliminate possibilities based on the given information:

1. From point 2, we know that the person born in September listens to Reggae.
2. From points 5 and 6, we know that the Wooden house is the Subway driver and the person born in May is an Architect.
3. From point 7, we know that the Mechanic drives the Quad-bike.
4. Now let's consider point 12: since the Motorbikemaster lives in a Ranch-style house, neither the Subway (already known), Snowmobile, nor Quad-bike driver can be the Motorbikemaster. So, the Train driver must be the Motorbikemaster.
5. From point 8, we know that the Gothic-revival house is in the middle, which means it cannot be the Wooden (Subway) or the far left (Quad-bike, if Quad-bike was not the Mechanic). Therefore, the Train must be the Gothic-revival house.
6. From point 4 and considering points 5 and 7, we can deduce that the Snowmobile is on the right of Subway (which is known to be Wooden) and left of Quad-bike (the Mechanic).
7. Now, let's consider point 9: the person who listens to Folk is on the far left. Since we know where the Train (Motorbikemaster), Subway (Architect), Snowmobile, and Train (Trance) are positioned, and the Quad-bike (Mechanic) cannot be on the far left, the only position for Folk is on the right of Train.
8. From point 10, since we know that the Librarian is not on the left or right of the person born in June (who hasn't been placed yet), and we also know where Motorbikemaster (Train), Subway (Architect), Snowmobile, and Train (Trance) are positioned, the only possible position for June is between Snowmobile and Quad-bike.
9. From point 11, since we know that July is on the left or right of the Mechanic (Quad-bike), and we also know where Motorbikemaster (Train), Subway (Architect), Snowmobile, Train (Trance), June, and Folk are positioned, the only possible position for July is between Quad-bike (Mechanic) and the yet unknown position of the person born in February.
10. From point 14, since we know where Motorbikemaster (Train), Subway (Architect), Snowmobile, Train (Trance), June, Folk, July, and Mechanic (Quad-bike) are positioned, the only possible position for the person who listens to Ambient (Folk's neighbor) is on the left of Motorbike.
11. From point 15, since we know where Motorbikemaster (Train), Subway (Architect), Snowmobile, Train (Trance), June, Folk, July, Mechanic (Quad-bike), Ambient (Folk's neighbor), and the yet unknown positions of Train (Rock), Librarian, and Palace are positioned, we can only determine that the Librarian is on the left or right of the Futuristic house. But since we don't know the exact position of Librarian yet, we cannot determine the house type for Palace and Rock.
12. Since we were able to place all other people, their birthdays, and their houses except for Palace and Rock (and their related jobs), let's consider point 3: the fan of Rock is the Palace house. Now we know that the person born in May (Architect) cannot be Rock because the Architect is already placed. So, the person born in February must be Rock.
13. With all the information now available, we can place the remaining pieces:
    - Librarian: On the left or right of Futuristic house (we know it's not the far left since the person who listens to Folk is there). Let's assume the Librarian is on the right.
    - Palace: Since we know that Rock is the person born in February and Librarian is on the right, the only possible position for Palace is between Train (Trance) and Snowmobile.
    - Futuristic house: With all the positions filled up, the only remaining position for the Futuristic house is on the far left.
    - Train (Rock): Since we know that the person born in February (Rock) cannot be the Wooden house (Subway), and both Snowmobile and Palace are already occupied on their respective sides, the only possible position for Train (Rock) is between Subway (Architect) and Quad-bike (Mechanic).

Now we have placed everyone, their birthdays, jobs, and houses:
- Motorbikemaster (Train): Trance, June
- Architect (Subway): Rock, May
- Snowmobile: Ambient, September
- Quad-bike (Mechanic): Reggae, July
- Train (Rock): Folk, February
- Librarian: Palace, June or July (on the right)
- Palace: Futuristic, February or June/July (between Train and Snowmobile)
- Futuristic house: Wooden, January, February, May, August, October, or December (far left)

At this point, we still don't know the exact position of Librarian or the type of house for Palace. However, since we can't have two people born in June or July (Librarian and someone else), and we don't have enough information to pin down their houses, it seems impossible to provide a definitive answer for Quad-bike's position based on this puzzle."	quad-bike:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_9	quad-bike	4	" Let's break this down step by step:

From points 1 and 4, we know that the fan of trance (who drives the train) is neither on the left nor the driver of the subway because the subway driver is mentioned before the driver of the snowmobile. So, the subway driver can't be a fan of trance. Also, since there are only 5 different means of transport and the driver of each vehicle has a unique preference for music-genre, the driver of the subway must be a fan of either rock (point 4), folk (point 14), or reggae (point 7). But since the fan of reggae is in September (point 2) and the fan of rock is the palace house (point 4), the only remaining option for the subway driver is folk.

From points 6, 12, and 15, we know that the architect is born in May, lives in a ranch-style house, and is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since the motorbikemaster (lives in the ranch-style house) cannot be the librarian (point 10), the architect must be the librarian.

From points 2, 5, and 14, we know that the fan of reggae is born in September, lives in a wooden house, and is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the subway driver (who we've determined to be the fan of folk) cannot be on the left because the librarian (architect) is on the left or right of the June-born person (point 10), and since the quad-bike driver (mechanic, point 7) also can't be on the left because the mechanic is next to the quad-bike driver (point 7), the only remaining option for the reggae fan is the motorbike driver.

From points 1, 3, and 9, we know that the fan of trance drives the train, lives in a house other than the palace (because the palace is the rock fan), and is on the far left (because the folk fan is not on the far left). Since the subway driver (now known to be the folk fan) is not on the far left, the only remaining option for the train driver is the motorbike.

From points 4, 7, and 8, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver, the quad-bike driver is the mechanic (who we've determined to be on the right side because the mechanic can't be on the left due to point 11), and the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since the subway driver cannot be on the far left (because the motorbike driver is there), the only remaining option for the subway driver is on the right of the snowmobile, making the snowmobile driver the quad-bike driver.

Putting it all together:
- The subway driver (quad-bike) is on the right of the snowmobile. So, quad-bike: 2 (since the snowmobile is 1)."	quad-bike:1	quad-bike:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_quad-bike_10	quad-bike	4	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae (person C) has a birthday in September.
2. From points 4 and 5, we know that the person driving the subway (person A) is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile (person B). Also, person A lives in the wooden house (house A).
3. From point 6, we know that the architect (person E) has a birthday in May.
4. From points 7 and 10, we know that the mechanic (person G) is driving the quad-bike (vehicle D), and the librarian (person I) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (person F).
5. From points 8 and 9, we know that the gothic-revival house (house G) is in the middle, and the fan of folk (person H) is on the far left.
6. From points 12 and 13, we know that the motorbikemaster (person K) lives in the ranch-style house (house K), and the fan of ambient (person J) is the bartender.
7. From point 14, we know that the fan of folk (person H) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (person K). Since we already placed person H on the far left, person K must be to the right of person H.
8. From points 15 and 11, we know that the librarian (person I) is on the left or right of the futuristic house (house F), and the person who's birthday is in July (person J) is on the left or right of the mechanic (person G). Since we already placed persons H, K, and I, the only remaining place for person J is to the left of person G.
9. Now we have enough information to arrange the positions: [H, K, F, G, J]
10. Finally, we need to assign jobs, houses, vehicles, and music genres. Since we know all the positions, it's straightforward:
    - A (Subway): Rock (palace house)
    - B (Snowmobile): Ambient (bartender)
    - C (Train): Reggae (person in September)
    - D (Quad-bike): Mechanic (G)
    - E (Not assigned yet, as it's the architect and we know its position): May (since it's not any other known person's birthday month)
    - F (Futuristic house): June (as it must be on the left or right of person I)
    - G (Quad-bike): Mechanic (G)
    - I (Not assigned yet, as it's the librarian and we know its position): On the left or right of person F (June)
11. We are left with one more position to fill: E (architect). Since the architect has a birthday in May, it must be in house E (since all other houses are assigned). However, the only remaining month is February for that house. So, we have a contradiction. There seems to be an error or inconsistency in the given information, as it doesn't allow for a valid solution."	quad-bike:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_1	trance	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of trance can't be on the far left because the fan of folk is there. Since the months are unique, the fan of trance must be in another position (not June or September).

2. Since the architect is in May, the mechanic and librarian can't be in that month (point 6). Also, the librarian can't be on the left of the person who's birthday is in June (points 10 and 15), so the librarian must be in another position. The same applies to the mechanic; it can't be on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in July (point 11).

3. Since the fan of rock is the palace house, we know that the house positions correspond to the people. Let's fill the houses first: The ranch-style house (motorbikemaster) and futuristic house (librarian or mechanic, yet to be determined) are already known. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (point 8). So far, we have:
   - Ranch-style: motorbikemaster
   - Gothic-revival: middle position (unknown person)
   - Futuristic: librarian or mechanic

4. The fan of ambient is the bartender (point 13). Since the bartender isn't in a house we've identified yet, the bartender must be one of the remaining transport options (quad-bike, subway, snowmobile, or motorbike)

5. From point 7, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since the mechanic isn't in a house yet, the mechanic must be one of the remaining transport options (subway, train, or snowmobile).

6. Since the fan of folk can't be on the far left and can't be in September, it must be the subway driver (point 1) or the person driving the motorbike (since both are left of the fan of folk according to points 9 and 14). Given that the mechanic can't drive the quad-bike (point 7), it means that the mechanic drives either the subway or the train.

7. If the mechanic drove the subway (which is on the left of the snowmobile, point 4), then the snowmobile driver must be in a house since there's only one position left (the leftmost position). In this case, the snowmobile driver would be the person who's birthday is in July because the librarian can't be on the left or right of the mechanic (point 11), and the motorbikemaster can't drive the snowmobile (point 12). This would mean that the fan of folk is the subway driver, and the fan of trance is the train driver.

8. If the mechanic drove the train, then the train driver must be in a house since there's only one position left (the middle position). In this case, the train driver would be the person who's birthday is in February because the librarian can't be on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (point 10) and the snowmobile driver can't drive the quad-bike (point 7). This would mean that the fan of folk is the subway driver, and the fan of trance is the motorbike driver.

9. In either scenario, we found out where the fan of trance is: If the mechanic drove the train, then **trance:3** (the middle position is the train). If the mechanic drove the subway, then **trance:1** (since the train is to the right of the subway and the middle position is occupied by the fan of folk).

Answer: trance:1 or trance:3 depending on the mechanic's transport."	trance:3	trance:3	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_2	trance	4	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a combination of deductive reasoning and creating variables for each person. Let's assign a variable (A-E) for each person based on their birth month and job. For example, since the fan of trance is driving the train, let's say that A drives the train.

1. From 2, we know that the fan of reggae has birthday in September. Since there are only five months mentioned, let's assume that D has a birthday in September (D=September).
2. From 4 and 5, we can deduce that the person driving the subway is neither on the far left nor in the middle because those positions are already filled by variables 9 and G (from 14 and 8). So let's say B drives the subway (B=Subway).
3. From 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May. Since A is not an architect (from 2), let's assume E is the architect (E=Architect).
4. From 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. So let's say C drives the quad-bike (C=Quad-Bike).
5. From 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we already have a variable for the left and far-left positions, let's assume G is the gothic-revival house (G=Gothic-Revival).
6. From 9 and 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left. Since F (from 12) is already assigned to the ranch-style house, which is on the left, let's say F is the fan of folk (F=Folk).
7. From 10 and 15, we can deduce that the librarian is not in the middle because the gothic-revival house is in the middle (G=Gothic-Revival). So let's say H is the librarian.
8. Now we know that there are only two remaining variables (A and I) for the music genres and jobs. From 13, we can deduce that A cannot be the bartender because F is already the fan of folk. So let's say A is the fan of ambient (A=Ambient).
9. Finally, from 11, we can deduce that I must be on the left or right of C (mechanic) since both June and July are already assigned to variables B (Subway) and H (Librarian). Since I can't be on the far left due to F being on the far left, let's say I is the motorbikemaster (I=Motorbikemaster).
10. Since all positions are now assigned except for the house, let's say J is the wooden house (J=Wooden).

Now that we have all variables assigned, we can find out where **trance** is:

- From 1, we know that A drives the train. So A = Trance because trance is the music genre of the person driving the train.

So **Trance: A**."	trance:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_3	trance	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's first find the connections between variables based on given clues. Let's denote people by their music genres (Tr, Ro, A, Fo, Re) and transport by their corresponding numbers (Mb, Sb, T, Sm, Q).

From clues 1 to 4, we know that Tr is driving the train (T), which implies that Tr is neither on the left of Sm nor is Sm because Sm is on the left of T. So, Sm, Ro, A, Fo, and Re are arranged as follows: Sm, Ro, X, Fo, Re from left to right.

From clues 5 and 12, we know that the house of the mechanic (Sm) is wooden (W). Since we already know the arrangement of people, we can deduce that W represents either Ro or A. Since A is a house (H), it must be in the center according to clue 7. So, W should represent Ro and H should be T, Sb, Sm, Q, Mb in this order (from left to right).

Now we know that Tr is driving the train (T), which means Tr cannot be on the far left (clue 9) or the left of the person who's birthday is in june (clue 10). So, Tr can only be Q, Mb, Sb. Since T and Sm are already assigned, Tr cannot be Sb because it would violate clue 4 (subway on the left of snowmobile). So, Tr must be Mb or Q.

From clue 6, we know that A has a birthday in May. Since A is assigned as H (house), Mb and Re are yet to assign houses. However, since T (Tr) cannot be Sb, it follows that Mb is Sb. So now, our arrangement is: W (Ro), T (Tr), H (A), X (Fo), Sb (Mb), Sm, Q, Mb or Re from left to right.

From clue 11 and the fact that we already know Ro's position, we can conclude that Re cannot be next to July's birthday person because the mechanic is next to July's birthday person. So, Re must be on the far right (Mb or Q). However, since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (clue 15), it follows that Mb cannot be Re. So, Re is the quad-bike rider and Mb is the person with a birthday in July.

Now we have everything assigned except X (Fo). Since X must be on the left of Ro or the mechanic (Re or Mb) according to clue 9, it cannot be next to Q (since Q is Re) or on the far right (because of clue 14). So, X must be the motorbike rider, and therefore Fo is the motorbikemaster.

Now we have H (A), T (Tr), Sb (Mb), Sm, Q, Mb or Re, X from left to right. However, since Q is on the left of Mb according to clue 11, it follows that Q must be the librarian and Mb is the person with a birthday in July as we deduced earlier. So now our arrangement is: W (Ro), T (Tr), H (A), X (Fo), Sm, Q, Mb, Re from left to right.

From clue 14, we know that Re (folk) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Fo). However, since Fo is already assigned and Re cannot be next to July's birthday person, it follows that Fo and Re are adjacent, and therefore Fo cannot be Mb (since Q is already the librarian). So, Fo must be Sb.

Now we have W (Ro), T (Tr), H (A), X (Fo), Sm, Q, Mb, Re from left to right. From clue 13, we know that A (ambient) is the bartender. Since the bartender cannot be next to July's birthday person and Fo (folk) is already assigned on the far left, it follows that Mb must be the person with a birthday in june.

Now we have W (Ro), T (Tr), H (A), X (Fo), Sm, Q, Mb, Re from left to right. Since Re (reggae) is the person with a birthday in september, Q (librarian) must be on the far right.

From clue 5, we know that Sb (motorbike) is the palace house. However, since A (ambient) and Mb (june's birthday) are already assigned, it follows that Sb cannot be a ranch-style house (clue 12). So, Sb must be the futuristic house.

Now we have W (Ro), T (Tr), H (A), X (Fo), Sb, Q, Mb, Re from left to right. Since Sm (snowmobile) is on the left of T (train), it follows that Sm cannot be the gothic-revival house (clue 7). So, Sm must be either a wooden or ranch-style house.

Since we already know that W (Ro) and Sb (futuristic) are assigned, it follows that the remaining houses (T, H, Mb, Q, Re) should represent a wooden house, gothic-revival house, ranch-style house, palace house, and either a wooden or ranch-style house. However, since the gothic-revival house must be in the middle according to clue 7, it cannot be T (Tr) because we already know that Tr is driving the train. So, H (architect) should represent the gothic-revival house and Sm should represent the ranch-style house.

Now we have W (Ro), T (Tr), H (Gt), X (Fo), Sb, Q, Mb, Re from left to right. Since Q is on the far right and the librarian cannot be next to July's birthday person, it follows that Mb must be on the far left.

Now we have W (Ro), T (Tr), H (Gt), X (Fo), Sb, Mb, Q, Re from left to right. Since Sm is already assigned as a ranch-style house and the only remaining houses are T (Tr), H (Gt), and Q (librarian), it follows that T represents the subway because it is the last remaining transport option.

So now we have W (Ro), T (Subway), H (Gt), X (Fo), Sb, Mb, Q, Re from left to right. Since Gt (architect) cannot be next to July's birthday person and Mb is already assigned on the far left, it follows that Q must be the person with a birthday in july.

Finally, we have W (Ro), T (Subway), H (Gt), X (Fo), Sb, Mb, Q (july's birthday), Re from left to right. We have already assigned all people and houses except for Re (folk). Since Ro (reggae) is already assigned and Mb (june's birthday) cannot be next to July's birthday person, it follows that Re must be the only remaining option: the palace house.

So we have W (Ro), T (Subway), H (Gt), X (Fo), Sb (Palace House), Mb (june's birthday), Q (July's birthday), Re (Palace House) from left to right, where Ro represents reggae, Gt represents architecture, Fo represents folk, Sb represents motorcycle, Mb represents june's birthday, and Q represents july's birthday."	trance:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_4	trance	4	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a table to organize the information and gradually eliminate possibilities for each variable. Here's how it could be solved:

| Variables  | Possibilities | Assumptions |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Transport  | motorbike, subway, train, snowmobile, quad-bike | -            |
| Music     | trance, rock, ambient, folk, reggae          | -            |
| House     | ranch-style, wooden, gothic-revival, palace, futuristic  | -            |
| Job       | motorbikemaster, mechanic, architect, bartender, librarian      | -            |
| Birthday  | june, may, september, february, july         | -            |

We'll start by assigning the known values to their respective variables:

| Transport    | Music     | House   | Job        | Birthday   | Assumptions             |
|-------------|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| subway      | trance   | wooden | architect  | may       | 1, 6                     |
|            | reggae   | palace | librarian  | september | 2, 10, 15               |
| train       | rock     |         | mechanic   |            | 4 (subway on left), 7    |
| snowmobile  | ambient  | gothic-revival |           |            | 4 (subway on left of), 5 |
| quad-bike   | folk     | futuristic | bartender |            | 13, 14                   |

Now let's try to deduce the position of trance:

1. Trance is not a snowmobile (since it can't be on the right of the subway) and not a quad-bike (as it's not the mechanic). The only remaining option for transport is train.
2. Since trance isn't in july or september, it must be either June, May, or February. It can't be February since the gothic-revival house is in the middle and it shares a side with folk (which we know now is not September).
3. Trance can't be on the right of the person who's birthday is in june, because that would put it next to the librarian (since we know the mechanic and June are neighbors). The only remaining option for trance's birth month is May.
4. Now let's see where the train can be placed:
   - If train was on the far left, it would share a side with reggae (September) and ambient. But we know that neither of these are the mechanic or snowmobile driver, so this isn't possible.
   - If train was in the middle, it would share a side with rock and folk. Since both can't be September, this means that folk must be May (since trance is May) and rock must be June or February. But we know from point 3 that trance isn't on the right of the person who's birthday is in june, so it can't be June, leaving only February for rock. However, this would place folk on the far left, which contradicts the assumption that folk shares a side with trance (May).
   - Therefore, train must be on the far right. This means that reggae (September) is on the left of it, and ambient can't be at the far left because that would make it next to the snowmobile driver. The only remaining options for ambient are gothic-revival or futuristic houses. We know that folk shares a side with trance, which means there must be a house between them. So let's assume ambient is in the gothic-revival house:
      - This leaves only wooden and palace as possible locations for the snowmobile driver (since they have to be on the left of the subway). The mechanic can't be in the futuristic house because it shares a side with folk, which contradicts our assumption that ambient is in the gothic-revival house. So let's assume the mechanic is in the wooden house:
         - This leaves only the palace as the location for the snowmobile driver (and thus the rock fan). Since we know that rock is June or February, let's assume it's June:
            - Now we have enough information to place all the variables. Here's the final arrangement:
                - Transport: motorbike (not identified yet), subway, train (trance), snowmobile (rock), quad-bike (folk)
                - Music: trance, reggae (September), rock (June), ambient (in gothic-revival house), folk
                - House: ranch-style (motorbikemaster), wooden (mechanic), gothic-revival (ambient), palace (rock), futuristic
                - Job: motorbikemaster, architect (May), bartender (librarian or far left/right of June), librarian (neighbor of the mechanic and on the same side as June)
                - Birthday: june, may, september, february (not identified yet), july

To find out where trance is exactly, we can compare the assigned months with the given birthdays:
- Since reggae (September) is to the left of train (trance), and quad-bike (folk) is next to it, that means May must be on the right of September. Since librarian shares a side with June and is either next to or far from the mechanic, we know that May can't be on the far right, so it must be on the left of the subway driver (mechanic). The only remaining option for trance is July.

The answer is **trance:July**."	trance:3	trance:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_5	trance	4	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify common elements and relationships between different variables. For example, we know that each person has a unique transport, music genre, job, house type, and birthday month. Also, the subway driver is next to the snowmobile driver (left or right), and the gothic-revival house is in the middle.

2. Based on the given information, let's first determine the people's positions for each transport:
   - Since the fan of trance is driving the train, we know that Train occupies position 1 (since there are only 5 transports and they are arranged).
   - Since the architect is the person born in May, we know that Architect position is 3 (since people's birthdays are given in a linear order). As Architect is not driving any transport, it means Motorbike, Subway, Snowmobile, Quad-bike are already assigned to positions 2, 4, 5, and either 1 or 6.
   - Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 3), it implies that Ranch-style, Wooden, Palace, Futuristic houses occupy positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. However, we already know that Train and Architect are at positions 1 and 3 respectively. So, Motorbike is position 2, Subway (next to Snowmobile) is at position 4, and Quad-bike (as it's driven by the mechanic) will be at position 5 or 6.
   - Since the fan of rock is the palace house, we know that Palace occupies position 3. As we know that Architect is also position 3, this means that either Subway or Snowmobile is position 4 (since they must be neighbors), and Quad-bike is at position 5 or 6. However, since the fan of reggae is born in September, Reggae must be assigned to someone who's not driving a transport yet. So, Quad-bike cannot occupy position 4 or 6 (as it's driven by the mechanic). Therefore, Subway is at position 4, Snowmobile is at position 5, and Quad-bike is at position 6.
   - Now we know that the librarian is either left or right of the person born in June (position 2), so Librarian cannot occupy position 1 (Train) or position 3 (Architect). Since the fan of folk is on the far left, Folk must be at position 1 (Train), and the librarian is not the motorbike master (Ranch-style house), Librarian cannot occupy position 2 (Motorbike). So, Librarian is at position 4 (Subway) or position 5 (Snowmobile). Since the fan of ambient is the bartender, Ambient must be at position 5 (Snowmobile), and Librarian is at position 4 (Subway).
   - Now we have all transport positions assigned: Train (1), Motorbike (2), Subway (4), Snowmobile (5), Quad-bike (6).

3. We also know the music genres, jobs, houses, and birthdays for each person. By using the given relationships between these variables, we can determine the exact position of each person:
   - Since the fan of trance is driving the train, Trance's job must be Motorbikemaster (position 2). His house type (Ranch-style) is known, so Ranch-style occupies position 1. Trance's birthday month is June, but his position is on the left or right of the person born in July, so Trance cannot be at position 1 (since June is earlier than July). Therefore, Trance is at position 2. So, Trance: 2

4. With all the other variables assigned, we can check if each relationship still holds true. If it does, then our solution is correct!

So, **Trance: 2**"	trance:3	trance:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_6	trance	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the trance fan is the person driving the train. Let's assign numbers to represent their positions (with 1 being on the far left and increasing to the right). Since the subway is on the left of the snowmobile, we can place the train (trance fan) in the third position (since there are 4 means of transport, and the snowmobile occupies the second position).

2. The reggae fan has a birthday in September, so we'll place this person later in the order as we haven't placed anyone with that birthday yet.

3. We know the rock fan is the palace house. Since the house positions are not explicitly given, let's assume for now that each house is represented by the number corresponding to its position in the transport lineup (1 for ranch-style, 2 for wooden, 3 for gothic-revival, 4 for palace, and 5 for futuristic).

4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since we've placed the train already, the subway must be in position 1 or 2. However, since the subway cannot be in position 1 (as that would mean the snowmobile is on the far right, contradicting point 4), the subway must be in position 2. So, reggae has birthday in September and drives the subway.

5. The subway is the wooden house, so the wooden house corresponds to position 2. This means the ranch-style (motorbikemaster) must be in position 1.

6. The architect has a birthday in May, so they are placed at position 3 (since the mechanic and librarian haven't been assigned yet). This makes the gothic-revival house (architect) correspond to position 3.

7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since the snowmobile occupies the second position, the quad-bike must be in the fourth position. However, we already placed the train at that position (as trance fan). This means that the quad-bike and mechanic are on the same day (the only remaining option is July). But then we would need to rearrange the music genre assignments since rock was assigned to the palace house, which doesn't fit our new arrangement.

At this point, it seems there might be a contradiction in the puzzle. Let's double-check the given information:

1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train
2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September
3. The fan of rock is the palace house
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house
6. The architect is the person who's birthday is in May
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle
9. The fan of folk is on the far left
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june
11. The person who's birthday is in Julys is on the left or right of the mechanic
12. the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house
13. the fan of ambient is the bartender
14. the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike
15. the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house

Based on this analysis, it seems that there might be a contradiction in the puzzle as stated. If we make adjustments to ensure all conditions are met without contradictions, the solution may change. For now, let's mark **trance** as ""Unable to determine position based on the given information due to possible contradictions."""	trance:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_7	trance	4	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's create a table to organize the information and find correlations between different attributes.

| Attribute     | Transport | Music-genre | House         | Job          | Birthday Month |
|--------------|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Person 1     |           | trance     | ranch-style   | motorbikemaster    | June         |
| Person 2     | train     |            | wooden        | architect       | May           |
| Person 3     | subway    | rock       | gothic-revival| bartender       | (unknown)     |
| Person 4     | snowmobile| ambient    | palace        | librarian       | (unknown)     |
| Person 5     | quad-bike | reggae     | futuristic    | mechanic        | (unknown)     |

From the given clues:
1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train, so Person 2 has the attribute 'trance'.
2. The fan of rock is the palace house (Person 3), and since there are only 5 houses, we know that Person 2 (architect) cannot be in a palace, so Person 3 (bartender) must be the architect. Therefore, the fan of rock cannot be the fan of trance (Person 2), and since they have exclusive music-genres, Person 3 must have the genre 'rock'.
3. Person 4 is driving the subway (from clue 4), so it can't be Person 1, 2, or 5 because they already have transport attributes defined. If we assume Person 3 is the driver of the subway, then their house would be gothic-revival or wooden since there are only 2 unassigned houses left (clue 7). However, that contradicts clue 3 about Person 3 being a bartender, so Person 4 must be driving the subway.
4. Since we now know who's driving the subway and snowmobile, we can deduce their positions from clue 4: The subway driver (Person 4) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (Person 5).
5. Person 4 is in the wooden house (clue 5), which leaves the gothic-revival for Person 3 (bartender). Clue 7 says that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, so Person 5 must have the transport attribute 'quad-bike'.
6. Now we know the positions of the subway and snowmobile drivers, so we can determine the remaining transport driver positions (clues 6, 8, 9, and 10):
   a. The mechanic (Person 5) is in the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (clue 10), but we already know their position from clue 4. Since the positions are fixed, the person with the June birthday must be on the opposite side of Person 5.
   b. Clue 8 tells us that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it must be Person 3 (bartender).
   c. Now we know that the people with the July and June birthdays are on opposite sides of Person 5 (mechanic), so the person with the June birthday cannot be Person 1, leaving Person 2 as the only option for the June birthday. This also means Person 4 has the July birthday since they're the one driving the subway (clue 3).
   d. Clue 9 tells us that the fan of folk is on the far left, but we already know who's in the leftmost position: Person 1 (June birthday) and Person 2 (trance music-genre), so Person 1 can't be the fan of folk. Therefore, Person 5 (quad-bike driver) must have the folk music-genre since they are on the far left.
7. Clue 13 says the fan of ambient is the bartender (Person 3). Since there's only one open genre left for Person 4 and it's 'reggae', that leaves us with reggae as Person 4's music-genre.
8. Finally, we know who has each attribute except for Person 1's birthday month. Clue 12 tells us the motorbikemaster (Person 1) lives in a ranch-style house, which means it must be either Person 1 or 5. However, since Person 5 already has their attributes defined, Person 1 must have the remaining birthday month of February.

So, the final arrangement and answers are:

| Attribute     | Transport | Music-genre | House         | Job          | Birthday Month |
|--------------|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Person 1     | motorbike | trance    | ranch-style   | motorbikemaster    | February       |
| Person 2     | train     |            | wooden        | architect       | May            |
| Person 3     | subway    | rock       | gothic-revival| bartender       | (unknown)       |
| Person 4     | snowmobile| ambient    | palace        | librarian       | July            |
| Person 5     | quad-bike | folk       | futuristic    | mechanic        | reggae         |

And the trance fan is on **trance:2**."	trance:3	trance:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_8	trance	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by assigning variables to each person and their respective properties. I'll use capital letters for people (A-E) and numbers for their attributes (Transport, Music, Birthday, House, Job).

1. From clue 1, we know the fan of trance is driving the train, so Transport_Trance = Train.
2. Clue 2 tells us that the person who likes reggae has a birthday in September, so Birthday_Reggae = September.
3. Clue 4 says the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Let's assume Subway = A and Snowmobile = E, then A < E. (Since people are ordered from left to right)
4. Similarly, from clue 5, Subway = 5, which means House_Subway = Wooden (clue 5).
5. Clue 6 tells us the architect has a birthday in May, so Birthday_Architect = May. As the architect is not mentioned before position 5, Architect = C (since we already know A and E are taken by Subway and Snowmobile respectively).
6. From clue 7, the mechanic drives the quad-bike, so Mechanic = Quad-bike.
7. Clue 8 tells us the gothic-revival house is in the middle. As we have only 5 people, this means Gothic-Revival = 3 (C).
8. Since the fan of folk is on the far left (clue 9), Folk must be A or B, as A and B are the two possible leftmost positions. Let's assume Folk = A for now.
9. Clue 10 says the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, so we have two possibilities: June = A or June = B (since we know A and E are taken already). If June = A, then Librarian = C or D. However, this would place Folk and Librarian together which contradicts clue 8 as there are only 5 people. Therefore, June = B, so Librarian = A or E.
10. Clue 11 says the person with a birthday in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (Quad-bike). Since we already have Mechanic = Quad-bike and Librarian placement options (A or E), this clue doesn't help us much, but it means that neither A nor E can be June.
11. Clue 12 tells us the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, so MotorbikeMaster = Ranch-Style.
12. From clue 13, the fan of ambient is the bartender, so Ambient = Bartender.
13. Clue 14 says the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (MotorbikeMaster), but we don't know the position of MotorbikeMaster yet. However, if Folk were A (leftmost), this would contradict clue 8 as the gothic-revival house would not be in the middle. So Folk must be B or C (rightmost), and MotorbikeMaster must be A.
14. Clue 15 tells us the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, but we don't know the position of Futuristic yet either. Since Librarian cannot be leftmost due to clue 9 and it cannot be June (clue 10), Librarian must be D or E.
15. Clue 16 tells us that the fan of rock is the palace house, so Rock = Palace. However, this contradicts clue 4 since there's no way to place Palace between Subway and Snowmobile without violating other clues (like placing Gothic-Revival in the middle).

At this point, we have a contradiction which means that some of our assumptions might be incorrect. Let's revisit our assumption about Folk = A (leftmost) as it seems to lead us into contradictions. If instead Folk = B or C, then MotorbikeMaster is A and Librarian must be D or E. With these positions set, we have a consistent arrangement that satisfies all clues except clue 16 about Rock being the palace house.

Unfortunately, it seems there's an inconsistency in this puzzle, as I couldn't find an arrangement that fits all clues, including clue 16.

In terms of your final answer for **trance**, we have Transport_Trance = Train and A is the only remaining open position. So, **Trance:A**. But keep in mind that there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle."	trance:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_9	trance	4	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step and create a table to organize the information:

| Property | Person/Object | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transport | Motorbike | 1 |
| Transport | Subway | 2 |
| Transport | Train | 3 |
| Transport | Snowmobile | 4 |
| Transport | Quad-bike | 5 |
| Music-Genre | Trance | T |
| Music-Genre | Rock | R |
| Music-Genre | Ambient | A |
| Music-Genre | Folk | F |
| Music-Genre | Reggae | G |
| House Style  | Ranch-style | H1 |
| House Style  | Wooden      | H2 |

| House Style  | Palace    | H4 |
| House Style  | Futuristic | H5 |
| Job         | Motorbikemaster | J1 |
| Job         | Mechanic   | J2 |

| Birthday    | September  | B3 |
| Birthday    | February   | B4 |
| Birthday    | July       | B5 |

Now, let's use the given statements to fill in the table:
1. Since the train driver is a trance fan (T), we have Train = 3 and T = J3 (Architect).
2. The reggae fan's birthday is in September (B3), so we have G = B3. However, we don't know who this person is yet, but we now know their birthday month.
3. Since the fan of rock is the palace house (H4), we don't get any new information about the individuals here, but we do know that R = H4.
4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver: Subway < Snowmobile. We don't have enough information to determine their exact order yet, so let's write down what we know: Subway = 2 or 5, Snowmobile = 4.
5. The subway driver lives in the wooden house (H2), so H2 = 2 or 5.
6. The architect is born in May (B2), so J3 = B2.
7. The quad-bike driver is the mechanic, so 5 = J2.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so H3 = 3.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (1 or 5), so F can be either J1 or J5.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (B1), which means that B1 < J1 and B1 < J5, but we don't know their exact positions yet. So far, J1, J3, and J5 are known.
11. The person who's birthday is in July (B5) is on the left or right of the mechanic (J2), which means that B5 > J2 but we don't know their exact positions yet. So far, J2 is known.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (H1). We don't get any new information about the individuals here, but we do know that H1 = 1.
13. Since the fan of ambient is the bartender (J4), we have A = J4.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, which means that either F < 1 or F > 1 but we don't know their exact positions yet.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (H5). We don't get any new information about the individuals here, but we do know that H5 = 5 and J5 is one of the library options.

Now let's analyze the given information to determine each person's position:
- Since the quad-bike driver (J2) is next to the snowmobile driver, J2 < 4.
- Also, since the subway driver (2 or 5) lives in the wooden house (H2), we know that 2 and 5 cannot be the mechanic (J2). So H2 = 2. This means that 5 = Subway, which implies that 2 = Snowmobile.
- Since the subway driver is the wooden house (H2) and the snowmobile driver is to the left of them (2 < 4), we know that J2 (Mechanic) = 5 (Quad-bike).
- Since the architect (J3) is born in May (B2) and the motorbikemaster (H1) is on the left side, J1 (Motorbike) < H1. Also, since the fan of folk (F) is either to the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (J1 < F), we know that F = J5 or F > 5. Since there are only 5 people, and we already know that J2 is the mechanic (Quad-bike), F cannot be J5. Therefore, F > 5. This means that J1 must be the leftmost person, so J1 = 9.
- Since the librarian (J5) is on the left or right of the futuristic house (H5) and the motorbike driver (J1) is to the left of them (J1 < H5), we know that J5 > H5. This means that J5 = 5, so H5 = 1. This also implies that H2 = 3 (since H2 is the wooden house and 5 = Subway).
- Since the reggae fan's birthday is in September (B3), we know that G = B3. However, since there are only 5 people and we already know their positions, it's impossible for anyone to have a birthday in September. This means that our initial assumption about the given data must be incorrect, and one or more of the given statements may not be valid.

Unfortunately, I cannot determine the exact position of trance because there seems to be an inconsistency with the provided information. The given logic puzzle might contain errors, as there is no solution possible based on the presented facts."	trance:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_trance_10	trance	4	" To solve this puzzle, we need to use a systematic approach by combining the given clues and eliminating possibilities step by step. Here's how I solved it:

1. Determine the transport for each character (some information is redundant):
   - The fan of trance is driving the train
     => Train: trance
   - The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver
     => Subway: Person X, Snowmobile: Person Y
   - The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic
     => Quad-bike: Mechanic
   - The gothic-revival house is in the middle (1st house)
     => House 1: Gothic-revival

2. Determine the house for each character:
   - The fan of trance is driving the train, so they cannot live in the gothic-revival house (since it's in the middle)
     => Trance is not House 1
   - The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june and the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since ambient can't be trance (as trance is driving a train), it means that Bartender cannot live in House 1 or House 2 (left or right of June). This leaves only House 3, House 4, or House 5 for the librarian.
     => We know that Trance cannot live in House 1, so Trance can either live in House 2 or House 5.
   - The fan of folk is on the far left (House 1) and on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (which we don't know yet). Since Folk cannot be trance due to clause 1, it means that Motorbike is not House 2 or House 3.
     => Motorbike must be House 4 or House 5.
   - The architect is the person whose birthday is in May and the fan of rock is the palace house (which we know can't live in House 1). This means that the Architect cannot live in House 1 either.
     => We know that Motorbike is not House 2 or House 3, so Motorbike must be House 4 or House 5. Now, as there is only one house left for Motorbike (House 5), we know that Trance is in House 2 and Architect is in House 1.
   - Since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, it means that Librarian cannot live in House 1 (Architect) or House 5 (Trance). This leaves only Houses 2, 3, and 4 for the Librarian. However, as we already found Trance in House 2, Librarian cannot live there. So, Librarian is in either House 3 or House 4.
   - The fan of ambient is the bartender, so Ambient must be Bartender's house (as both cannot be trance due to clause 1). Since Folk lives on the left or right of Motorbike and Motorbike can't live in House 2 or House 3, it means that Motorbike is in House 4. As we found Trance in House 2, this leaves only House 5 for Motorbike. But since Librarian is not in House 2 (Trance) and there's no other house available for Librarian, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the given clues have an inconsistency, making it impossible to uniquely assign the characters to their houses.

Unfortunately, the puzzle has an inconsistency in its current form, so we cannot accurately determine where **trance** is located. However, if you can modify some of the clues without changing their essential information, it may become possible to solve the puzzle."	trance:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_1	rock	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a system of equations to represent each statement and then solve for the variables (persons and houses). Let's denote the persons as P1, P2, ..., P5 and their respective jobs, birthdays, music-genres, and transport modes as J1, B1, M1, T1, respectively. Similarly, let's denote the houses as H1, H2, ..., H5 with their respective styles as S1, S2, ..., S5.

1. From statement 1, we know that P1_M1 = ""trance"" and P3_T3 = ""train"".
2. Statement 2 tells us that P4_B4 = ""september"" and P4_M4 = ""reggae"".
3. In statement 4, P5_T5 is the ""palace"" house (S3).
4. From statement 5, we have T1 < T2 (subway is on the left of snowmobile).
5. Statement 6 tells us that P2_B2 = ""may"" and J2 = ""architect"".
6. From statement 7, we know that P5_T5 = ""quad-bike"" and J5 = ""mechanic"".
7. Statement 8 says that S2 is the middle house (S2 = gothic-revival).
8. In statement 9, P1 is located on the far left (P1 > P4).
9. From statements 10 and 15, we have J3 or J4 = ""librarian"" and P6_B6 = ""july"". Also, either S5 is on the left of P3 or S5 is on the right of P3 (P6_T6 can be either left or right of P3_T3).
10. In statement 11, either S4 or S5 is on the left of J5 (either P6_T6 is on the left of J5 or J5 is on the left of P6_T6).
11. Statement 12 gives us S1 = ""ranch-style"" and J1 = ""motorbikemaster"".
12. From statement 13, we have P3_J3 = ""ambient"" and J3 = ""bartender"".
13. Statement 14 tells us that either P1 is on the left of P2 or P1 is on the right of P2 (P1_T1 can be either left or right of P2_T2).
14. From statement 15, we know that either S5 is on the left of J3 or S5 is on the right of J3 (J3 is on the left or right of S5).

Now, let's use these equations to find out where ""rock"" is located:
- Statement 4 says P5_T5 = ""palace"" house (S3), so we can assume that T1 < T2 and T3 > T5.
- Since statement 9 tells us that P1 is on the far left, we know that P1 < P4 and T1 < T2.
- Statement 10 gives us S5 on the left or right of P3, so either T1 < T3 or T3 < T1.
- From statement 15, we have J3 on the left or right of S5, which means that T1 < T2 and T3 > T5 or T1 > T2 and T3 < T5. This implies that T1 ≠ T3 since they are both different than T2 and T5.
- Now let's assume that P1 has rock as its music genre (M1 = ""rock""). In this case, we know that M4 = ""reggae"" and M3 is something other than trance or ambient (since these two genres are already assigned to persons 1 and 3). Therefore, there are only three remaining options for M3: folk, rock, or any other genre. However, since the fan of rock is not on the far left according to statement 9, it can't be M3. So, let's assume that P2 has rock as its music genre (M2 = ""rock""). This leaves us with only one option for M1, which must be trance or ambient since they are the remaining two genres.
- Given that M1 is either trance or ambient, we have now assigned all five music genres to persons 1 through 5. Since P1 has already been assigned a genre, we know that P1 cannot be the fan of rock (M1 ≠ ""rock""). This means that M2 = ""rock"".
- With the assumption that M2 = ""rock"", it leaves only one option for M3, which must be folk since it is the remaining genre. From statement 14, we know that either P1 or P2 is on the left of P3. Since M3 is folk and not trance (P1_M1 = ""trance""), it means that P1 is on the right of P3. Therefore, T1 > T3, T2 > T5, and T5 < T4.
- Now we can find out the transport modes: T1 = motorbike (J1), T2 = subway, T3 = train, T4 = snowmobile, and T5 = quad-bike (J5). We can confirm that all five different means of transport are used.
- Next, let's find out the jobs: J1 = motorbikemaster, J2 = architect, J3 = bartender, J4 = librarian, and J5 = mechanic. We can confirm that all five different jobs are represented.
- Finally, we know that S1 = ""ranch-style"", S2 = ""gothic-revival"" (S2), S3 = ""palace"", S4 = futuristic (since it's not the ranch-style, gothic-revival, or palace), and S5 is on the left of J3. Since J3 = bartender, this means that S5 = wood (since there are no other houses to its right) or S5 = futuristic (if it's on the right of the librarian). However, since S4 was already assigned as ""futuristic"", we have a contradiction. This indicates that our initial assumption about M2 being rock was incorrect, and instead, it should be M1 = ""rock"".
- With the correct assumption that M1 = ""rock"", we now know that M2 is folk, M3 is ambient, M4 = ""reggae"", and M5 = ""trance"". This also gives us the remaining houses: S1 = ranch-style (J1), S2 = gothic-revival (since it's already assigned), S3 = palace (since it's already assigned), S4 = futuristic, and S5 is on the right of J3.
- Since we now know that S4 = futuristic, this means that P1 > P2, P3 > P4, and P5 > P2. This leaves us with only one possibility for the birthdays: B1 = ""june"", B2 = ""may"", B3 = ""september"" (from statement 2), B4 = ""february"" or ""december"", and B5 = ""october"" or ""november"".
- To find out which month belongs to each person, we can use their positions relative to the assigned houses:
	+ Since T1 > T3 and P1 > P3, it means that P1 is not in the house next to the palace (S3). Therefore, B5 = ""october"" or ""november"", but since there are no houses left to assign after S4, this means that B5 must be ""november"".
	+ Since T2 > T5 and P2 < P1, it means that P2 is not in the house next to the ranch-style (S1). Therefore, B1 = ""june"" or ""december"", but since there are no houses left to assign after S4, this means that B1 must be ""december"".
	+ Since T3 < T1 and P3 > P1, it means that P3 is not in the house next to the ranch-style (S1). Therefore, B3 = ""september"", since it's already assigned.
	+ This leaves us with only two remaining birthdays for persons 4 and 5: B4 = ""february"" or ""november"". Since P4 is on the left of J4 (librarian), this means that B4 = ""february"".
- Now we have all the required information to fill out the puzzle:
	+ Person 1 has rock as its music genre, and it rides a motorbike. It was born in December and lives in the ranch-style house (S1).
	+ Person 2 has trance as its music genre, and it rides a subway. It was born in June and lives in an unassigned house.
	+ Person 3 has reggae as its music genre, and it rides a train. It was born in September and lives in the palace house (S3).
	+ Person 4 has folk as its music genre, and it rides a snowmobile. It was born in February and lives in an unassigned house on the left of the librarian.
	+ Person 5 has ambient as its music genre, and it rides a quad-bike. It was born in November and lives in the futuristic house (S4)."	rock:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_2	rock	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, we can start by assigning each person a number from 1 to 5 (corresponding to the transport they use), and then deduce their characteristics. Let's break it down:

1. We know that trance is driving the train, so Train = 3 (assuming Transport 1 is motorbike, Transport 2 is subway, Transport 3 is train, etc.)

2. Reggae's birthday is in September, so Person 5's birthday is in September.

3. Rock is the palace house, so House 4 (assuming Houses are Ranch-style, Wooden, Gothic-revival, Palace, Futuristic) must be driving a rock genre vehicle, which means either Transport 2 or Transport 4 because all others are assigned. Since the subway is on the left of the snowmobile (Transport 1), and the palace can't be on the far left due to Folk being there, we can deduce that Rock drives the train (Transport 3).

Now we have:
- Transport 1: Motorbike
- Transport 2: Subway (Rock)
- Transport 3: Train (Trance)
- Transport 4: Snowmobile
- Transport 5: Quad-bike (Mechanic)

Continuing with the logic, we can find the rest of the characteristics:

1. Subway (Rock) is on the left of Snowmobile, so Train is on the right of Snowmobile.
2. Train is Wooden because the palace is driving a rock vehicle, and only two vehicles are left for the remaining houses.
3. Since Train can't be on the far left due to Folk being there, and it's already assigned as Transport 3 (Trance), we deduce that Snowmobile must be on the far right.
4. Quad-bike (Mechanic) is next to Snowmobile because the librarian can't be on the same side as June's birthday due to condition 10, and can't be on the other side of July's birthday due to condition 11. Also, since all other places are taken for Transport vehicles, Motorbike must be on the far left (next to Folk), which leaves only one place for Quad-bike: the rightmost position.
5. Gothic-revival house is in the middle because it's not Wooden or Train.
6. Librarian can't be on the same side as June, so the librarian must be on the left of July's birthday, and Futuristic house must be on the right.
7. Since only two houses are left (Palace and Futuristic), we can deduce that Palace is driving a rock vehicle (Transport 2) and Futuristic is next to July's birthday (since Librarian is on its left).
8. Ambient is a bartender because it's the only music genre left for this occupation, so either Transport 1 or Transport 4. Since Motorbike is already assigned, Ambient must be driving Snowmobile (Transport 4), which also means Folk can't be on the far left due to condition 9.
9. Folk is on the left of the person driving the motorbike because it's not on the far left and Quad-bike is already assigned as Transport 5 (Mechanic). The only option for Motorbike is the leftmost position, so Ranch-style house must be the motorbikemaster.
10. With all other conditions met, we can find the rest of the characteristics:
    - June's birthday is with Mechanic (as per condition 7) and on the right of Folk because it can't be in the middle or on the far left due to conditions 2 and 9. So, June is Transport 5.
    - May's birthday belongs to the architect because it's not assigned yet, and it must be on the left side due to condition 6 (which leaves only one place for Architect).
    - July's birthday is on the right of Mechanic as per condition 11, so it's Transport 1.

Finally, we have:
- Motorbike: 1 (Ranch-style house, Architect, June's birthday)
- Subway (Rock): 2 (Palace, Librarian, May's birthday)
- Train (Trance): 3 (Wooden house, Reggae, September's birthday)
- Snowmobile (Ambient): 4 (Snowmobile house, Folk, July's birthday)
- Quad-bike (Mechanic): 5 (Futuristic house, Rock, February's birthday)

So the answer is **rock:2**."	rock:2	rock:2	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_3	rock	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's organize the information into a table:

|    | Transport | Music-Genre | House      | Job           | Birthday Month |
|---|-----------|------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| 1  |           | trance     |            | motorbikemaster| june          |

From the given information, we can find out the positions of each character:

1. The fan of trance (motorbikemaster) is in June and drives the motorbike (June row). So, motorbike cannot be on the far left (since the folk fan is there) and cannot be on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (since librarian will be there). So, the motorbike can only be at position 3.
2. Since the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile, the snowmobile must be either at position 1 or 5, but not both because the gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 4). Let's assume that the snowmobile is at position 1. So, the subway will be at position 2 and the train will be at position 3 (since the fan of trance drives the train).
3. The architect is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (May row), but it can't be on the far left because the folk fan is there, so it must be on position 2. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle and the wooden house is the subway (position 2), the palace must be at position 1. The ranch-style house (architect's house) will be at position 5 as specified.
4. The fan of rock drives the train, so it's at the May row. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 4), and the palace is at position 1, so the ranch-style house (motorbikemaster) will be at position 3. This means that the librarian (May row) must be at position 2, since they're on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june.
5. The fan of folk is on the far left and on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike is already placed (at position 3), the fan of folk must be at position 1 (since they can't be at the extreme right because the librarian will be there). This means that the bartender (who drives the quad-bike, which is on the same side as the fan of ambient) will be at position 5.
6. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, and the palace is at position 1, so the futuristic house must be at position 4 (since it's not the wooden house). Since the mechanic is on the same side as the fan of ambient (bartender), they will be at position 5. This leaves the quad-bike driver at position 2.
7. The remaining empty slot for music genres must be reggae, and it can only be at the September row since the fans of trance, rock, folk, ambient, and the person driving the motorbike have already been placed. Since the snowmobile is on the left (position 1) and the subway is in the middle (position 3), the quad-bike will be on the right (position 5). This leaves September row's music genre as reggae, so the person driving the snowmobile (who's birthday is in september) likes rock.

Given that, **rock:1** (the person driving the train has a birthday in February and is a fan of rock.)"	rock:2	rock:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_4	rock	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, we will create a system to represent each person and their attributes. Let's number the people from 1 to 5. We can then assign each attribute to its corresponding number as follows:

1. Transport: Train (from clue 1)
2. Music-genre: Trance (already assigned), Rock, Ambient, Folk, Reggae (in order from clue 2 and 3)
3. House: Palace (from clue 4), Subway (from clue 5), Wooden (from clue 7), Snowmobile, Quad-bike (in order from clue 8)
4. Job: Motorbikemaster (from clue 12), Architect, Mechanic (from clue 13), Bartender, Librarian (in order from clue 6 and 15)
5. Birthday Month: June, May, September, February, July (in order from clue 14 and 10)

Now let's find out the remaining attributes for each person:

- Since the subway is in the middle (clue 8), its owner should be person 3. That means job 3 is Architect.
- Person 3 has a wooden house (clue 7), which makes it a mechanic.
- The snowmobile driver is on the right of the subway driver (clue 4). Since we already know that the subway driver is person 3, their right neighbor is person 5. Therefore, person 5 drives the snowmobile.
- Person 2's job is ambient and bartender (we found the other job already). So, person 2 is the Bartender.
- The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (clue 2), so their number must be either 1 or 5, since we know that person 3 is a mechanic. Let's assume it's person 1 for now. That makes person 5 the fan of reggae and person 5's birthday in September (clue 11 does not apply here because it involves left/right positions).
- Since the motorbike driver is on the left of the fan of folk, and we already know that person 2 is the bartender, person 2 can't be the fan of folk. Thus, person 4 must be the fan of folk.
- The librarian is on the right or left of the futuristic house (clue 15). Since we know that person 5 has a wooden house and person 3 has a subway house, it means the remaining houses are ranch-style, gothic-revival, and futuristic. If the librarian was on the left of the futuristic house, then person 4 (the fan of folk) would be between person 5 (reggae) and the futuristic house. However, there's no available space to place person 4 in that position. Therefore, the librarian must be on the right of the futuristic house, making it person 1 (motorbikemaster). That means person 1 is the Librarian.
- The fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver (clue 14). But since we know that person 2 is a bartender and can't be on the left or right of person 1, it means person 4 must be on the left of person 1. So, the final arrangement should look like this: Librarian(1)->Fan of Folk(4)->Motorbikemaster(1)
- Now let's check if there are any remaining inconsistencies: Since we know that the subway is driven by person 3 (Architect), and person 5 (Snowmobile) is on its right, it means the quad-bike driver must be on the left of the subway. But we already know that person 7 is the mechanic (quad-bike driver). Since person 3 can't have a house in position 7 because there are no houses left, it means person 7 should be the Architect and person 3 should be the Quad-bike driver. However, this contradicts clue 12 that states the ranch-style house is the motorbikemaster. Therefore, our assumption about the reggae fan being person 1 was incorrect. Let's assume it's person 5 instead: Reggae(5)->Fan of Ambient(3)->Bartender(2)->Rock(4)->Librarian(1)

Now we know that rock is in position 4. The final answer is **rock:4**."	rock:2	rock:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_5	rock	6	" Let's break this down step by step:

1. Assign each person a letter (A to E) and mark their transport, music-genre, job, birthday month, and house style as columns in a table.

2. Apply the given clues:
   - From clue 1, we know that the fan of trance drives the train, so let's assign 'train' to the row of the person who likes trance.
   - From clue 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, so let's assign 'September' to the row of the person who likes reggae.
   - Since clues 4 and 10 mention left and right positions, let's consider rows as consecutive left-to-right order. We can rearrange the table based on these clues when necessary.

3. Continue solving other clues in the table, adjusting the seating arrangement as needed:
   - From clue 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, so let's assign 'quad-bike' to the row of the mechanic. Since it is adjacent to the subway driver (clue 4), we can assign 'subway' to the row above.
   - From clue 5, we know that the wooden house belongs to the subway driver, so let's assign 'wooden' to the row of the subway driver.
   - From clue 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May, so let's assign 'May' to the row of the architect. Since it is adjacent to the motorbike driver (clue 10), we can assign 'motorbike' to the row above.
   - From clue 12, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house, so let's assign 'ranch-style' to the row of the motorbike driver.
   - From clue 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, so we can only place the librarian either above or below the futuristic house based on our previous assignments. Since the mechanic (who is the quad-bike driver) is also mentioned in clue 11 as being adjacent to the person with a July birthday, we can assume that the librarian is below the futuristic house. Let's assign 'librarian' to the row below 'futuristic house'.
   - From clue 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it must be between the ranch-style and the wooden houses. Since we placed the librarian under the futuristic house, there's only one spot left for 'gothic-revival'.
   - From clue 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but since we already placed the motorbike driver (row A) and the librarian below him, there's no more space for 'folk' on his left. So let's assign 'folk' to the row above the librarian, as he must be on the left of the motorbike driver according to clue 9.
   - From clue 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender, but since we have already placed all other people, the only spot left for 'ambient' and 'bartender' is the row above the gothic-revival house (row D).

4. Now that we have assigned each person a music-genre, job, transport, birthday month, and house style, let's find out where rock is:
   - From clue 3, we know that the fan of rock lives in the palace. Since we already placed all other people, 'rock' must be in row B (as the only remaining spot for the palace).

Hence, **rock:B**."	rock:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_6	rock	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, we'll assign a number to each person based on their characteristics and place them in a lineup. Then, using the given clues, we can deduce the location of rock (the person who lives in the palace).

Let's start by assigning numbers to each person based on their homes (as they are the only known initial group):
1. ranch-style house
2. wooden house
3. gothic-revival (middle) house
4. palace house
5. futuristic house

Now, let's fill in other characteristics to help find out their places:
1. trance fan is the person driving the train. Since we know that the train driver is the wooden house (#2), this person will have #3 for music-genre (trance).
2. reggae fan is the person whose birthday is in September, and since there are only 5 people, they'll be #4. Update the music-genre: #4 -> reggae
3. rock is the palace house. However, we don't know who lives there yet. So we update the job for this person: #1 (ranch-style house) -> architect (since it's May birthday as per clue 6). This doesn't affect the current position of rock (#4).
4. subway driver is on the left of snowmobile driver, and since the train driver (our current rock guess) is already placed, we know that the person driving the subway can't be #1 or #2. Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike (clue 7), they are either #3 or #5, leaving the subway driver to be #4. Update the transport for this person: #4 -> subway
5. gothic-revival house is in the middle as per clue 8, so we have already placed it correctly.
6. fan of folk is on the far left (clue 9) and isn't the subway driver (#4), so they must be #1 or #2. Since the mechanic isn't #1 (#7), the person in the ranch-style house (#1) is the fan of folk. Update the music-genre for this person: #1 -> folk
7. librarian is either on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in June (clue 10). Since we already know that the mechanic isn't the June person, he can't be the librarian. The only remaining option for the librarian is #3 as the gothic-revival house (middle) is not on either side of June's person. Update the job for this person: #3 -> librarian
8. Since the librarian isn't in the futuristic house, that leaves the only option for the futuristic house as #5. Update the house type for this person: #5 -> futuristichouse
9. Now we have placed all houses, but we still don't know who lives in the palace (#4). However, since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver and it's already determined that they are #1, the person driving the motorbike must be #2. Update the transport for this person: #2 -> motorbike
10. The remaining clues don't provide new information as all people have been assigned their characteristics except for rock (#4). As we can see, #4 is the palace house, so rock lives in the palace.

Answer: **rock:4**"	rock:2	rock:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_7	rock	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will systematically apply each clue one by one and try to find the relations between the different variables.

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train, so we assign ""Trance"" to the variable Train.
2. The fan of reggae is born in September, so we assign ""Reggae"" to the variable September.
3. We know that the fan of rock lives in the palace house, but we don't have any other information about the Palace yet. Let's keep it for now.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we don't have a Transport on the left side yet, let's assign ""Subway"" to the variable Left and ""Snowmobile"" to the variable Right.
5. The person driving the subway lives in the wooden house, so we assign ""Subway"" to the variable Wooden.
6. We know that the architect is born in May, so we assign ""Architect"" to the variable May.
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since we don't have a Transport on the mechanic yet, let's assign ""Quad-bike"" to the Mechanic.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so we can assign it as position 3 (since we are starting from the left) and mark it as Gothic-Revival.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left, so we assign ""Folk"" to the variable Position1 or Left, depending on our numbering system.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we don't know the position of June yet, let's mark it as a potential location for the Librarian.
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. If we place July to the right of Mechanic, it would conflict with our previous assumption that Folk is on the left (position 1) since it states that librarian is to the left or right of June and July. Therefore, we can assume that July is on the left of Mechanic. Let's mark July as Position4 or Left (the first available position after Mechanic).
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since we don't have a Transport assigned to a Ranch-Style house yet, let's assign ""Motorbike"" to the variable Ranch-Style.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we don't know who the Bartender is yet, let's mark it as a potential location for Ambient.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since Folk is already assigned to Position1 (Left) and Motorbike is not yet defined, we can't proceed with this clue. Let's revisit it later.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we don't know the position of Futuristic yet, let's mark it as a potential location for Librarian too.

Now, since we have assigned some values to our variables, we can try to find the relations between them:
- From clue 14, if Motorbike is the neighbor of Folk (position 1), Motorbike must be position 2 or 3. Since Motorbike is also the Ranch-Style house and all houses have been assigned except for Ranch-Style, we can deduce that ""Ranch-style"" and ""Motorbike"" are the same Transport. Now we know that the fan of trance drives the motorbike (since Trance = Motorbike).

At this point, we have a few variables still unassigned: Rock, Librarian, Ambient, and Futuristic House. We can try to use other clues to narrow down their possible values:
- Since all houses except for Ranch-style have been assigned, the remaining house (Futuristic) must be the last one on the right.
- From clue 14, we know that the neighbor of Folk (position 1) is Motorbike (position 2 or 3). If we place Rock between them, it would leave the librarian as the only remaining option for position 5, which doesn't seem possible since Librarian can be on either side of June. Instead, if we place Ambient between Folk and Motorbike, we have two options:
  - Place Librarian on the left side of June (position 4), with Rock on the right side of Librarian (position 5). This configuration would also fit clue 10 (the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june) and clue 15 (the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house), but it doesn't meet clue 14 since Ambient can't be the neighbor of Folk.
  - Place Rock on the left side of Librarian (position 3), with Futuristic House on the right side of Librarian (position 4). This configuration would fit clues 10, 15 and also clue 14 since Ambient can be the neighbor of Folk (on the right) and Rock is on the left.
- Since we have placed Rock, Librarian, Ambient, and Futuristic House, all remaining variables have been assigned their respective values.

The final answer is: **Rock: 3**

However, this solution is based on certain assumptions about the positions of Librarian, Ambient, and Futuristic house. There might be other possible solutions if those assumptions are incorrect."	rock:2	rock:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_8	rock	6	" To solve this puzzle, we need to set up a system and use logic to deduce the positions based on given clues. Let's first represent each person with a letter (A-E) according to their birthday month (June=A, May=B, Sept=C, Feb=D, July=E). Also, let's number the houses from left to right: 1(ranch), 2(wooden), 3(gothic-revival), 4(palace), and 5(futuristic).

1. We know that the trance fan is driving the train, so A, B, D, or E cannot be a driver (as they have different music genres from the options given for the drivers). Therefore, C drives the train.
2. The reggae fan is born in September, so we know that C is the person listening to Reggae.
3. Since the rock genre is the palace house, it can only be B (architect), as we already know C, D, and E have other jobs.
4. From clue 4, the subway driver is on the left of snowmobile driver. As motorbike, train, and quad-bike drivers are taken, the only option left for the subway driver is A (since B, D, and E can't be on the left). Therefore, A drives the subway, and C drives the snowmobile (as they are neighbors).
5. Clue 5 tells us that the subway driver lives in the wooden house, so A lives in the wooden house.
6. Clue 6 states that the architect's birthday is in May, confirming our assumption that B is the architect.
7. Clue 7 tells us that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, so E must be the mechanic (as they are the only person left).
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so 3(gothic-revival) must be between houses 1 and 4. Since 5 cannot be the middle house (clue 5), it means that 1, 2, 3, and 4 are arranged as ranch, wooden, gothic-revival, palace in some order. However, we know that the rock fan lives in the palace, so the arrangement must be ranch, wooden, gothic-revival, palace. Therefore, C cannot live in house 1 (as it leaves no room for B to live in house 2), so C must live in house 4 (palace).
9. The fan of folk is on the far left, but we already know that A lives in the wooden house, which contradicts clue 9. Let's rearrange the houses so that the folk fan can be on the far left. If we switch the positions of the ranch-style and futuristic houses, then the arrangement becomes palace (C), wooden (A), gothic-revival (3), ranch (1) and futuristic (5). With this new arrangement, A can be the folk fan (living in the wooden house, which is on the far left).
10. Clue 10 tells us that the librarian is either left or right of person A (June), but we don't know where A lives yet. Let's assume that A lives in house 2 for now. That would make B live in house 4, E in house 5, and D in house 1. In this arrangement, the only available position for the librarian is house 3 (gothic-revival), as houses 1 and 5 are already occupied by other people.
11. Clue 11 tells us that person E (mechanic) is on the left or right of person G (July). Since we know that A lives in the wooden house, it means that E cannot live in house 5 (as it leaves no room for G to live in house 2). Therefore, E must be in house 4, and G must be in house 3. However, this arrangement contradicts our assumption about A living in house 2. Let's switch houses so that A lives in house 3 instead. That would make B live in house 1, C in house 5, D in house 2, E in house 4, and G in house 5.
12. Clue 12 tells us that the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, confirming our assumption that A lives in house 3 (gothic-revival). That makes B live in house 1 (ranch), and C in house 5 (wooden).
13. Clue 13 tells us that the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we know that C lives in house 5, it means that A lives in house 2 (as there are only two remaining houses for B to live in). With this arrangement, B cannot be the fan of rock, as he should live in the palace house (clue 3), so A must be the bartender and fan of ambient.
14. Clue 14 tells us that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since A lives in house 2, it means that B lives in house 3 (as there are no other available positions for B). This arrangement contradicts our previous assumption that D lives in house 1, as we know now that B must live in house 3 and C in house 5.
15. Clue 15 tells us that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (house 5). If A lived in house 2, then D should be in house 4, making the only remaining position for the librarian house 3 (gothic-revival), which contradicts our assumption about the librarian living in house 1. Let's switch houses so that A lives in house 5 (wooden) instead. That would make B live in house 4 (palace), C in house 1 (ranch), D in house 2 (gothic-revival), E in house 3 (futuristic), and G in house 4 (librarian).

Now we have the correct arrangement of people according to their houses:
A: fan of ambient, bartender, lives in wooden house, May birthday (house 5)
B: fan of rock, architect, lives in palace house, May birthday (house 1)
C: fan of trance, motorbikemaster, lives in train, June birthday (house 4)
D: fan of folk, living in gothic-revival house, February birthday (house 2)
E: mechanic, fan of reggae, born in September (house 3)
G: librarian, born in July (house 4)

Therefore, the rock is in the palace house, so **rock:1**."	rock:2	rock:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_9	rock	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step. I will assign numbers to each person based on their positions from left to right (starting from 1 for the leftmost person).

Let's start with some initial assumptions:
1. Let A be the fan of ambient, R(rock), T(trance), F(folk), and G(reggae) represent the fans of their respective music genres.
2. M, S, Q, Sub, and Tr are used to denote motorbikemaster, mechanic, quad-bike driver, subway driver, and train driver respectively.
3. H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 represent the houses in their order from left to right.
4. J1, J2, J3, J4, and J5 are the people with birthdays in June, May, September, February, and July respectively.

From points 1 to 7, we can make some deductions:
- T is driving the train (point 1) => T = T
- G's birthday is in September (point 2) => J3 = G
- R is the palace house (point 4) => H3 = R
- Sub is on the left of snowmobile (point 4) => Sub < Q
- Sub is the wooden house (point 5) => H2 = Sub
- The person with a birthday in May is an architect (point 6) => J2 = A
- The quad-bike driver is the mechanic (point 7) => Q = M
- Gothic-revival house is in the middle (point 8) => H2 < G < H4
- Folk is on the far left (point 9) => H1 = F

Now let's analyze points 10 to 15:
- The librarian is on the left or right of J6 (point 10) => H1 <= L < H5 or H1 >= L > H5, where L represents the librarian.
- The fan of folk is on the left or right of M (point 14) => H1 <= F < Q or H1 >= F > Q, but we already know that H1 = F. So H1 = F and H2 = Sub are not possible because both are on the left side of M. Hence, H5 = F.
- The librarian is on the left or right of H5 (point 15) => L <= H5 or L > H5. But we just found that H5 = F, so L can't be to its left, meaning it should be on the right side of F.

Now let's see how these new insights help us with points 10-15:
- Since L (the librarian) is now known to be on the right side of F (the fan of folk), we can deduce that L > F, and H1 < L <= H5.
- The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (point 12) => H1 = M
- From point 3, we know R(rock) is a house, so it must be one of H1, H2, H3, H4, or H5. But since all other houses are already assigned and R is on the left of F, the only remaining option for R is H4.
- The fan of ambient is the bartender (point 13) => A = B
- The fan of folk is on the left or right of M (point 14) => H1 <= F < Q, but we already know that H1 = M, so H1 = M and H2 = Sub are not possible. Since H5 = F, it leaves us with H4 for the remaining houses.
- Now we can finally assign jobs to each person: J1 (M), J2 (A), J3 (G), J4 (R), and J5 (unknown). However, from points 7 and 11, we know that Q = M and the person with a birthday in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. But since J5 is the only remaining person, they must be the mechanic, making our initial assumption that J5 is the mechanic correct.

Now, after rearranging the information we have found:
- H1 = M (ranch-style house), H2 = Sub (wooden house), H3 = R (palace house), H4 = F (gothic-revival house), and H5 = G (futuristic house)
- J1 = M (motorbikemaster), J2 = A (architect), J3 = G (reggae fan), J4 = R (rock fan), and J5 = Q (mechanic/bartender). But since we know the birthday of J5, it's actually the mechanic.
- B(bartender) is the fan of ambient.

Now, to find the location of rock, we can see that the person driving the train is T(trance), and since R(rock) was found to be the house H4 (gothic-revival), it means that J4 = R(rock). Since T is the fan of trance and the train driver, we know that T cannot be on the left side of R. Therefore, R(rock) should be located at position 2 since there are only four people remaining: M, A, G, and R (in this order from left to right).

So the answer is **rock:2**."	rock:2	rock:2	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_rock_10	rock	6	" To solve this puzzle, we'll start by assigning each characteristic to a variable and then using the given clues to find the relationships between these variables. Here's how I would approach it:

Let's define:
1. T: Transport (e.g., motorbike)
2. M: Music genre (e.g., trance)
3. H: House type (e.g., ranch-style)
4. J: Job (e.g., mechanic)
5. B: Birthday month (e.g., may)

Now let's apply the clues to find their relationships:

1. T_train = M_trance
2. M_reggae = B_september
3. T_subway = H_palace
4. (T_subway, T_snowmobile)_order = (2, 1)
5. T_subway = H_wooden
6. J_architect = B_may
7. T_quad-bike = J_mechanic
8. H_gothic-revival = 3 (since it's in the middle)
9. T_motorbike _position1 = M_folk
10. Librarian position = [June, left] or [June, right]
11. B_july position = [Mechanic, left] or [Mechanic, right]
12. T_motorcycle = H_ranch-style
13. M_ambient = J_bartender
14. T_motorbike _position2 = M_folk
15. Librarian position = [Futuristic house, left] or [Futuristic house, right]

From the clues 9 and 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left, so it must be T_motorbike _position1. Since there are only 5 people, T_motorbike _position2 must be different from T_motorbike _position1 (i.e., T_motorbike _position2 = [T_snowmobile, T_subway, T_train, T_quad-bike] \ T_motorbike _position1). From the clue 10, we know that the librarian is either left or right of June. Since we know the position of folk (clue 9), and that T_motorbike _position2 and T_librarian are not T_motorbike _position1, the only option for T_librarian is on the right side of June. From clue 15, it must be on the left or right of the futuristic house. So let's assume that the futuristic house is T_train (since we know T_palace and H_wooden from clues 3 and 5). Since the librarian cannot be T_motorbike _position1, T_motorbike _position2 or T_librarian, they must be other transport options. Since T_snowmobile and T_quad-bike are already assigned, the only option left for T_subway is T_train. Now we know that T_subway = T_train, and from clue 4, T_snowmobile is on the right of T_train (so T_snowmobile = [T_motorbike, T_quad-bike]). Since T_train = T_subway and J_architect = B_may, T_mechanic must be T_motorbike or T_quad-bike. But since we already know that T_snowmobile = [T_motorbike, T_quad-bike], it cannot be T_quad-bike (because T_train and T_subway are already assigned). Thus, T_mechanic = T_motorbike. Now from clue 7, we know that the fan of rock must be either T_train or T_snowmobile. Since T_train is already assigned as T_subway (from our previous inference), it has to be T_snowmobile.

So **rock: Snowmobile** is the answer."	rock:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_1	ambient	7	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a systematical approach to eliminate possibilities one by one. Here's how you can find the position of ambient (the bartender):

1. From rule 12, we know that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, which means the bartender cannot be the motorbikemaster.

2. Since the fan of folk is on the far left and not the bartender, the fan of folk must be either the person driving the motorbike (rule 9) or the mechanic (rule 14). However, the mechanic (quad-bike driver) is adjacent to the motorbike driver according to rule 7. Therefore, the fan of folk cannot be the motorbikemaster, so it must be the mechanic.

3. From rule 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May. Since the librarian is not on the left or right of the person with a birthday in June (rule 10), and the fan of folk (mechanic) is already known to be next to the motorbike driver (who cannot be the bartender due to rule 1), there's only one available spot for the architect, which means the librarian must be on the other side of the person with a birthday in June.

4. From rules 5 and 11, we know that the subway driver (wooden house) is next to the snowmobile driver and also has a neighbor with a birthday in July. Since the mechanic already has a known neighbor (the motorbike driver), there's only one possible person left for the subway driver: the bartender. However, the bartender is also the fan of ambient (rule 13).

5. From rule 4, we know that the snowmobile driver is on the right of the subway driver (bartender). Since there are only two remaining houses left (gothic-revival and futuristic), the gothic-revival house must be in the middle according to rule 8. This means the futuristic house is next to the person with a birthday in June.

6. Now, since we've placed all but two of the people, there are only two remaining positions for the ambient fan (bartender). To find out where the bartender is, let's look at rule 14: the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we already placed the motorbike driver and we know that the fan of folk is the mechanic (who cannot be adjacent to the motorbike driver), it means the bartender must be on the other side of the motorbike driver.

Therefore, **ambient: 4**."	ambient:4	ambient:4	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_2	ambient	7	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign each person a temporary number from 1 to 5 (we'll assign them based on the order of their characteristics). Since we have more than one condition for some elements, we will need to make educated guesses and check our assumptions at the end.

2. Person 1: Trance fan, Train driver (according to clues 1 and 5). Since it is not specified where the train is positioned, let's assume person 1 is in position 1.
3. Person 2: Reggae fan, September birthday (clue 2). We'll place person 2 as number 2 for now.
4. Person 3: Rock fan, Palace house (clue 4). This gives us no information about their position or number yet.
5. Person 4: Subway driver (according to clues 4 and 5), located on the left of the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile is not assigned yet, let's assume person 4 is in position 2. This means that person 1 (Trance fan) must be in position 3 or 4, but since the librarian must be on their left or right (clue 10), we can only place them in position 3 or 5. Therefore, let's assume person 1 is in position 3 and person 2 is in position 2.
6. Person 5: Snowmobile driver, Wooden house (clues 4 and 5). Now, since the subway is already placed on the left side of the snowmobile, we know that the snowmobile driver must be on the right side of the subway, which means person 4 is in position 4.
7. Person 6: Architect, May birthday (clue 6), but not yet assigned a number.
8. Person 7: Quad-bike driver, Mechanic (clue 7). Since the mechanic must be next to the quad-bike driver (clue 11) and we have placed the quad-bike driver in position 4, let's assume person 5 is in position 2.
9. Since person 3 (Trance fan) was placed on the left of person 2, and person 2 is the Reggae fan, we know that person 1 (Fan of Ambient) must be on the far left (clue 9). So let's assume person 1 is in position 1.
10. The gothic-revival house must be in the middle (clue 8), so it can only be person 3, who is a Rock fan. Since we know that the librarian is on their left or right (clue 10) and there's no more room to the left of the gothic-revival house, let's place the librarian on the right side of person 3, which means person 6 must be in position 5.
11. Since we know the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (clue 15) and there's no more room to their left, it means that the futuristic house belongs to either person 4 or 5. However, since the architect cannot be the fan of Ambient (as we know the ambient fan is on the far left, and the architect can't occupy that position), the futuristic house must belong to person 4. So let's place person 4 in position 2 and the librarian in position 5.
12. Since we know the mechanic is next to the quad-bike driver (clue 11) and the librarian is on their left or right (clue 10), there's no more room for person 3 to be on the right side of the librarian. This means that person 3 must be on the left side of the librarian, which makes them the motorbikemaster (according to clue 12). So let's place person 3 in position 4 and the mechanic in position 5.
13. Since we know the ambient fan is on the far left (clue 9) and the motorbikemaster is their neighbor (clue 13), it means that the ambient fan must be in position 1. Now, since all positions are assigned, we can conclude:

**ambient:1**"	ambient:4	ambient:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_3	ambient	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step.

1. Assign a number to each person based on their birth month (June = 1, May = 2, September = 5, February = 3, July = 6).

2. From clues 1-4, we know that trance is the train driver, reggae is in September, and subway is next to snowmobile. Let's arrange them as follows:
   - Subway (Person 5) -> Snowmobile (??)
   - Train (Trance fan)

3. Clue 5 tells us that the subway person lives in a wooden house, so Wooden = Person 5. Now we know that Snowmobile is on the right of Person 5 (subway), so:
   - Snowmobile (??) -> Quad-bike (??)

4. Clue 6 states that the architect (Person 2) has a birthday in May, so we can place Architect next to Train and Quad-bike (as there's no space left between them). Now we know:
   - Train -> Architect
   - Subway (Person 5) -> Snowmobile (??) -> Quad-bike (Mechanic)

5. Clue 7 tells us that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, so now we have:
   - Subway (Person 5) -> Snowmobile (Person 4) -> Quad-bike (Person 4)

6. We know from clue 9 that the fan of folk is on the far left, but it can't be Person 1 (June), so Folk must be Person 3 or 5 (September). As there are no clues suggesting they should be placed together, we can place them separately for now.
   - Subway (Person 5) -> Snowmobile (Person 4) -> Quad-bike (Person 4) -> ??? -> Folk (Person 3 or 5)

7. From clue 10, the librarian is on the left or right of Person 1 (June), and from clue 15, the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Let's place Librarian next to June for now:
   - Subway (Person 5) -> Snowmobile (Person 4) -> Quad-bike (Person 4) -> June (Librarian) -> ??? -> Folk (Person 3 or 5)

8. Clue 11 tells us that the person with a birthday in July is on the left or right of Person 4 (Mechanic). Since we already placed Librarian next to June, the only remaining option for July is on the left side, so July goes between Mechanic and Folk:
   - Subway (Person 5) -> Snowmobile (Person 4) -> Quad-bike (Person 4) -> June (Librarian) -> July (???) -> Folk (Person 3 or 5)

9. Clue 12 tells us that the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, so Ranch-style = Person 1. As there are no clues placing Motorbike anywhere else yet, let's place it next to Person 1:
   - Subway (Person 5) -> Snowmobile (Person 4) -> Quad-bike (Person 4) -> June (Librarian) -> July (???) -> Folk (Person 3 or 5) -> Motorbike (Person 1)

10. Clue 13 tells us that the fan of ambient is the bartender, so Ambient = Bartender. Since we already placed Librarian and Motorbike on the left side, the only remaining option for Bartender is on the right side:
   - Subway (Person 5) -> Snowmobile (Person 4) -> Quad-bike (Person 4) -> June (Librarian) -> July (???) -> Folk (Person 3 or 5) -> Motorbike (Person 1) -> Bartender (Ambient)

11. From clue 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. As there are already 7 houses occupied, the only remaining option for Gothic-Revival is between Snowmobile and Quad-bike:
   - Subway (Person 5) -> Gothic-Revival (???) -> Snowmobile (Person 4) -> Quad-bike (Person 4) -> June (Librarian) -> July (???) -> Folk (Person 3 or 5) -> Motorbike (Person 1) -> Bartender (Ambient)

Now we have all the pieces in place. The only missing information is the exact position of Gothic-Revival and the identity of Person 3 or 5. As there are no further clues, it's impossible to determine the exact positions without making assumptions.

However, since we know that Folk is either Person 3 or 5, we can tell you the position of Ambient (Bartender) relative to Folk: **Ambient: On the right side of the person with a birthday in February (Folk)**. The exact number for Ambient depends on whether it's Person 3 or 5."	ambient:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_4	ambient	7	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down into steps and use a table to keep track of our findings:

| Month | Transport | Genre | Job  | House |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| June  |   A       |      |     |      Ranch-style  |
| May   |      | C    | 6   |      Gothic-revival (Middle) |
| September  |  F  | Reggae  |    |   Palace   |
| February  |   B   |       |   |     Futuristic   |
| July  |   I   |       |    |     Wooden      |

1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train (F isn't in any other transport column, so it must be the train)
2. The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September (confirmed with row 3)
3. The fan of rock is the palace house (C isn't in any other House column, so it must be Palace)
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (Since we don't know who yet, let's just assume that A or B will drive the Subway and either F or I will drive the Snowmobile. We'll fill in this info once we find their positions)
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house (confirmed with row 7 - since there is only one wooden house, it must be Subway)
6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May (confirmed with row 6)
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (Since we don't know who yet, let's just assume that A or B will drive the Quad-Bike and either F or I will be the Mechanic. We'll fill in this info once we find their jobs)
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (confirmed with row 5 - since there is only one gothic-revival house, it must be Subway)
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (Since we don't know who yet, let's just assume that A or B will be the fan of Folk. We'll fill in this info once we find their positions)
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (Since there is only one June, and we already know the Librarian's position relative to it, we don't need to consider this information again)
11. The person whose birthday is in Julys is on the left or right of the mechanic (Since we don't know who yet, let's just assume that A or B will be the fan of Reggae (September). We'll fill in this info once we find their positions)
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (confirmed with row 1)
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (Since we don't know who yet, let's just assume that A or B will be the fan of Ambient. We'll fill in this info once we find their positions)
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Since we don't know who yet, let's just assume that A or B will be the fan of Folk. We'll fill in this info once we find their positions)
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Since we already know the Librarian's position relative to June, let's just assume that A or B will be the Librarian. We'll fill in this info once we find their positions)

Now, let's try to assign the remaining variables using additional clues:
16. Since we know that A and B can't be the fan of Folk (since they are on the far left), they must be either the Trance or Ambient fans. Let's assume A is Ambient for now.
17. From clue 9, the fan of Folk must be on the far right, so the other fan of Folk is B.
18. Since we know that A can't be a Mechanic (since they are driving the Quad-Bike), and B already has a job assigned, F or I must be the mechanic. Let's assume I is the Mechanic for now.
19. From clue 10, the Librarian cannot be on the far right (since we already know that person is the fan of Folk), so they must be on the left. Thus, A is the Librarian since they are to the left of June.
20. From clue 11, if July is on the left of I (Mechanic), then it's B. Since B is the fan of Folk and we already know their position relative to June, July must be on the right side.
21. From clue 7, since we know that A or B can't be the mechanic (since they are driving the Quad-Bike), I must be the motorbikemaster. However, the motorbikemaster cannot be assigned to a transport already filled, so F must be the Motorbikemaster instead.
22. Now we know that F is driving the Motorbike, and they are not the fan of Trance (since that role is filled by someone else). Also, F isn't the Mechanic (since I has been assigned as such), so F must be the fan of Ambient since it's the remaining genre without an assigned person.
23. Lastly, we know that the architect is the person whose birthday is in May (row 6), and they aren't driving any transport yet, so they must drive the Subway (since no other transport has been filled by someone with a known birthday).

Now we have enough information to fill out our table:

| Month | Transport | Genre   | Job    | House  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| June  |   A       | Trance  |    Librarian | Ranch-style     |
| May   | Subway   |      C    | Architect  | Gothic-revival (Middle) |
| September  |  F  | Reggae   |     Mechanic  | Palace         |
| February  |   B   |       |   Bartender | Futuristic      |
| July  |   I   |       |    Motorbikemaster | Wooden      |

Now we know that Ambient is driving the Subway (F). So, **ambient:Middle**

Answer: ambient:Middle"	ambient:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_5	ambient	7	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the fan of trance drives the train. Since there are only four transport left (motorbike, subway, snowmobile, quad-bike), and the fan of trance can't drive the quad-bike (because the mechanic drives it, as stated in point 7), we can deduce that the fan of trance cannot be driving the motorbike or the subway. Therefore, the person driving the train is also driving the snowmobile.

2. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September. Since there are only four people left with birthdays (those who haven't been determined yet), and one of them already has a known genre preference, it must be that the remaining three people have birthdays in other months.

3. From point 4, we know that the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (train). Since the train is driving the snowmobile, the subway must be to its right.

4. From points 5 and 7, we know that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house, and the mechanic drives the quad-bike. Since the fan of reggae can't drive the quad-bike (because the mechanic drives it), the person driving the subway can't be the fan of reggae either. Therefore, the person with a birthday in September can't live in a wooden house.

5. From points 6 and 14, we know that the architect has a birthday in May and the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (architect). Since the architect can't drive the motorbike (because the fan of trance does), the person driving the motorbike must be to the left of the architect.

6. From points 12, 13, and 15, we know that the ranch-style house is the motorbikemaster, the bartender prefers ambient music, and the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since the architect can't live in the ranch-style house (because it is the motorbikemaster), the bartender must live in the ranch-style house, making him the fan of ambient.

7. Since we already know who drives the train, subway, and quad-bike, and all other transport have been assigned to people, the remaining person (the one with a birthday in july) is driving the motorbike.

8. Now that we know who the bartender (ambient fan) is, and where he lives, we can place the gothic-revival house in the middle, as stated in point 8.

9. Since we already know where the motorbikemaster (ranch-style), subway, quad-bike, librarian (left or right of futuristic), and ambient (bartender) live, the remaining person must live in the palace.

10. The last two positions are filled by the people with birthdays in june and february, respectively. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in june, they can't be the one with a birthday in june. Therefore, the person with a birthday in june is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in february.

11. Now that we know who has birthdays in june and february, we can place them according to their music preferences and job positions if necessary. However, since all other people have been placed, this information is not needed for solving the puzzle.

Since we found out that the bartender (ambient fan) lives in the ranch-style house, **ambient:1**."	ambient:4	ambient:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_6	ambient	7	" ambient:6 (The fan of ambient is the bartender, and since the bartender has a birthday in May (from clue 6), we can assign the number 6 to ambient)

Here's the full solution for all five variables:
- motorbike: ranch-style (clue 12)
- subway: wooden (clue 5)
- snowmobile: gothic-revival (since it's in the middle, from clue 7 and knowing that fan of folk is on the far left, so none of the houses on the left can be the snowmobile)
- quad-bike: mechanic (clue 7)
- trance: train (from clue 1)
- reggae: september (from clue 2)
- rock: palace (from clue 4, we know that the fan of rock cannot be on the far left or middle since folk is there and snowmobile is there. So it must be palace, which leaves only one option for the remaining houses.)
- train: june (since the fan of trance is driving the train and the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, so neither June nor July can be the driver of the train. Thus, the only remaining month for the driver of the train is June.)
- folk: far left (from clue 9)
- mechanic: left of snowmobile (from clues 4 and 7)
- librarian: right of July (from clue 10, we know that neither June nor July can be the librarian since the librarian is on the left or right of the mechanic. So it must be either in February or September.)
- bartender: May (since the bartender's birthday is in May, and from clue 13 we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender)
- futuristic house: right of librarian (from clue 15)

Now let's assign numbers to each variable:
- motorbike: 1
- subway: 2
- snowmobile: 3
- quad-bike: 4
- trance: 5
- reggae: 9
- rock: 7 (palace)
- train: 5 (June)
- folk: 2 (far left)
- mechanic: 4
- librarian: 8
- bartender: 6
- futuristic house: 10

Since ambient is already assigned the number 6, we don't need to reassign it. So our final solution is as follows:
ambient:6
motorbike:1
subway:2
snowmobile:3
quad-bike:4
trance:5
reggae:9
rock:7 (palace)
train:5 (June)
folk:2 (far left)
mechanic:4
librarian:8
bartender:6
futuristic house:10"	ambient:4	ambient:6	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_7	ambient	7	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train, so the Train can only be associated with one person (Train: Person 1).
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific position or house. (Reggae: Person X)
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, so Palace can only be associated with one job, which is Person 4 (Rock: Person 4).
4. We know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific position or house. (Subway: Person Y)
5. The subway driver lives in the wooden house, so Wooden can only be associated with one position, which is Person Y. (Wooden: Person Y)
6. We know that the architect has a birthday in May, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific position or house. (Architect: Person 6)
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, so Quad-bike can only be associated with one job, which is Person 5 (Quad-bike: Person 5).
8. We know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific job or birthday month. (Gothic-revival: House Z)
9. The person on the far left is the fan of folk, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific position or house. (Folk: Person F)
10. We know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific position or house. (Librarian: Person L or R)
11. We know that the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific position or house. (July: Person JL or R)
12. The motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, so Ranch-style can only be associated with one job, which is Person 3 (Motorbike: Person 3).
13. We know that the fan of ambient is the bartender, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific position or house. (Ambient: Person B)
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific position or house.
15. We know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, but we don't have enough information yet to assign this to a specific job or birthday month.

Now let's try to solve the remaining clues with what we already know:
- Since the subway driver (Person Y) lives in the wooden house, it means Person Y cannot be the motorbikemaster (since we know the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house), librarian (since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June), and architect (since the architect has a birthday in May). So, Person Y must be either the mechanic (Quad-bike: Person 5) or the fan of ambient (Ambient: Person B).
- Since the fan of rock (Person 4) lives in the palace house, it means Person 4 cannot be the motorbikemaster (since we know the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house), librarian (since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June), and architect (since the architect has a birthday in May). So, Person 4 must be either the mechanic (Quad-bike: Person 5) or the fan of ambient (Ambient: Person B).
- Since we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house and the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, it means the futuristic house cannot be associated with the librarian's position. So, the futuristic house can only be either the left or right of the mechanic (since we know the mechanic is Quad-bike: Person 5) or the fan of ambient (Ambient: Person B).

At this point, we have multiple possibilities for the positions and houses based on the information given. However, without more specific clues, it's impossible to uniquely determine the position and house for each person.

So, I can't give you a specific answer in the format **ambient:Num**, but I hope this helps clarify the relationships between the different pieces of information. You might need additional clues to solve this puzzle completely."	ambient:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_8	ambient	7	" To solve this puzzle, we will follow a systematic approach to eliminate possibilities and find the answers.

1. We know that trance fans drive the train, so let's assign ""train"" to that person.
2. The fan of reggae is born in September, but we don't have any transport associated with this information yet. Let's wait for more clues.
3. We know that rock is the palace house, but no individual is associated with it yet.
4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since we don't know their identities, we can't determine positions yet.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house, so let's assign ""subway"" to the wooden house.
6. The architect is born in May; since we don't have an associated job yet, we'll wait for more clues.
7. The fan of folk is on the far left, but we don't know who this person is yet.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so let's assign ""gothic-revival"" to this house position (center).
9. The mechanic drives the quad-bike, so let's assign ""quad-bike"" to the mechanic.
10. The fan of folk can be on either side of the person born in June, but we don't know their positions yet, so we can't determine this clue now.
11. The person born in July is next to or near the mechanic, but we don't have any specific placement for them yet.
12. The motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house, so let's assign ""motorbike"" to the ranch-style house.
13. We know that the fan of ambient is the bartender, but we don't have any associated house or job position yet.
14. The fan of folk can be on either side of the person driving the motorbike, but we still need more clues to determine this.
15. The librarian can be on either side of the futuristic house, but we don't have any associated job or transport for them yet.

At this point, let's analyze clue 3: ""The fan of rock is the palace house."" Since we already know that one person is associated with each house, and we can't place ""rock"" anywhere else, it must be the motorbikemaster since the motorbike is a ranch-style house (clue 12), and neither the train nor subway (clues 1 & 5) fits the palace description. Now we know that the fan of rock is driving the motorbike.

Let's now focus on clue 4: ""The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver."" Since we have already assigned the subway and wooden house to each other (clues 1 & 5), we can deduce that the person driving the snowmobile must be associated with the gothic-revival house, as it's in the middle (clue 8). In this case, the snowmobile driver is the librarian.

Now let's go back to clue 2: ""The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September."" Since we now know that the snowmobile driver is born in September, the fan of reggae must be driving another transport. The only available options are quad-bike (mechanic) and motorbike (motorbikemaster). Given that the mechanic has already been placed as the quad-bike driver (clue 9), the fan of reggae must be the motorbikemaster.

Now we have enough information to determine the position of the bartender, who is a fan of ambient music. Since folk fans are on either side of the motorbike driver (clue 14), and the mechanic/reggae fan is driving the motorbike, the bartender must be on the other side of the motorbikemaster. The only available positions for the bartender are left or right of the futuristic house (clue 15). If we assign the bartender to the right of the futuristic house, there is no place for the librarian on the left as per clue 15. So, the bartender must be on the left of the futuristic house, and the librarian is on the right.

Finally, we can determine the positions of the remaining people:
- motorbikemaster (reggae) - left of futuristic house
- subway (wooden house) - far left
- snowmobile (librarian) - center
- train (trance) - unknown position yet
- quad-bike (mechanic) - far right
- folk - between the motorbikemaster and the mechanic
- rock - between the subway and the snowmobile
- gothic-revival - center (already determined in clue 8)

Since we know that the architect is born in May, they must be one of the following individuals: rock, folk, or librarian. However, since rock and librarian are already identified, it must be the fan of folk. This position would leave only two remaining positions for the train and the mechanic, who can't both be in the same row as per clue 10. Given that we have already placed all other people, the last available position is for the train (trance) on the far left, which leaves the mechanic (quad-bike) on the far right.

Now we know all positions:
- motorbikemaster (reggae) - left of futuristic house
- subway (wooden house) - far left
- snowmobile (librarian) - center
- train (trance) - far left
- quad-bike (mechanic) - far right
- folk - between the motorbikemaster and the mechanic
- rock - between the subway and the snowmobile
- gothic-revival - center (already determined in clue 8)

And finally, we can determine where the ambient fan is: ""ambient: bartender"" which is on the left of the futuristic house."	ambient:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_9	ambient	7	" To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each clue and try to create relationships between the variables. Here's the solution breakdown:

1. The fan of trance drives the train, so Train = Trance
2. The fan of reggae is born in September, so Reggae = September
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, so Palace = Rock
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and the subway is the wooden house (clue 5). If we consider positions as follows: Subway-Left, Snowmobile-Right, then House = Wooden
5. The architect is born in May, so Architect = May
6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (clue 7), so Quad-bike = Mechanic
7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (clue 8), and we already know that House = Wooden, which must be the leftmost house since it's next to Subway-Left. So, Gothic-Revival = Middle position (which implies: Ranch-style = Far Left, Futuristic = Far Right)
8. The fan of folk is on the far left (clue 9), so Folk = Far Left (Ranch-style house)
9. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (clue 10). Since we know that the Architect is born in May, and the Gothic-Revival house is the middle position, which leaves the two far positions for June. Considering clues 9 and 13, the Librarian cannot be on the same side as Folk (Ranch-style), so Librarian = Far Right (Futuristic)
10. The fan of ambient is the bartender (clue 13). Since we know that the Ranch-style house is on the far left, and the Futuristic house is on the far right, it means the Wooden house must be in the middle. However, we already assigned the Middle position to the Gothic-Revival house; this creates a contradiction. To resolve this, we can consider that the Wooden house is the gothic-revival house instead (reversing our previous assumption), which means Ranch-style = Middle, Wooden = Far Right, and Futuristic = Far Left. With this new arrangement:
    - Ambient = Bartender, and Bartender = Middle position (Wooden house). So, Ambient:3."	ambient:4	ambient:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ambient_10	ambient	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's first categorize each variable according to their unique values:

1. Transport: {motorbike, subway, train, snowmobile, quad-bike}
2. Music-Genre: {trance, rock, ambient, folk, reggae}
3. House Style: {ranch-style, wooden, gothic-revival, palace, futuristic}
4. Job: {motorbikemaster, mechanic, architect, bartender, librarian}
5. Birthday Month: {june, may, september, february, july}

We can start by making some deductions based on the given clues:
1. From clue 1 and 4, we know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train, which implies that train = trance (since the people prefer 5 different music-genres).
2. Clue 2 tells us that the fan of reggae has a birthday in september; however, since each person has a unique birthday month, we can deduce that no other person shares this preference for music genre or birthday month. Thus, reggae = September.
3. From clue 4 and 5, we know that the subway driver is placed to the left of the snowmobile driver; let's label the people as A (subway), B (snowmobile) in terms of their placement from left to right. Now, since each person has a unique job, A cannot be the mechanic (clue 7). Therefore, the subway driver must have either a ranch-style house or a futuristic house (since mechanic and librarian are already assigned jobs), which implies that B must have the remaining houses. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (clue 8), it must be B's house, making B = gothic-revival. This also means A = wooden (since palace was already assigned in clue 4).
4. Now, since we know that each person has a unique job and that the architect has a birthday in may (clue 6), the architect must be driving either the motorbike or the quad-bike. Let's label the remaining two transport options as C (motorbike) and D (quad-bike). Since C cannot be the librarian (clue 10), it must have a birthday in june, making June = C. Furthermore, since both the motorbikemaster and the fan of ambient are not assigned yet (from our analysis above), we can deduce that either D or June is the motorbikemaster or the fan of ambient (since they share the job of motorbikemaster). However, since June has a unique birthday month, it must be the motorbikemaster. Thus, C = motorbike and D = quad-bike.
5. Since the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (clue 7), the mechanic must have a job other than motorbikemaster, librarian, or architect. So, the remaining options are bartender and bartender cannot be in the far left (clue 9). Thus, the mechanic is either the fan of trance (since it's not assigned yet) or the fan of ambient (since they share the same job with the librarian). However, since each person has a unique music genre preference, the mechanic cannot be the fan of trance. Therefore, the mechanic must be the fan of ambient.
6. Now that we know the mechanic is the fan of ambient, it means the librarian (since they share the same job) must also have the remaining genres: rock or folk. Since the palace is already assigned to someone with a different music genre preference (clue 4), the librarian cannot be the fan of rock. Thus, the librarian must be the fan of folk (since it's the only remaining genre).
7. From clue 14 and our analysis above, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (C), which means it can't be in the far left (clue 9). Thus, the librarian (fan of folk) must be on the right side of C.
8. From clue 15 and our analysis above, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (B), which means it can't be in the middle (clue 8). Since the remaining houses are ranch-style (C) and wooden (A), the librarian must be on the right side of C, which means the librarian is to the right of both C and the fan of folk.
9. Now that we know the position of the librarian, it means the only remaining position for the fan of rock is in the far left (clue 9). However, since each person has a unique job, the fan of rock cannot be the mechanic or architect, which leaves us with bartender as the only option. Thus, the palace = bartender.
10. Since we've now assigned all the houses and jobs, we can easily deduce that the fan of ambient is on the far right (since it hasn't been assigned yet). Now, since the fan of ambient shares a job with the mechanic, it must be the motorbikemaster (since the mechanic is already assigned to the quad-bike). Thus, ambient = motorbikemaster.

In summary, **ambient:C** (motorbike driver) is on the far right of our arrangement."	ambient:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_1	folk	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's organize the given information and try to deduce the positions and identities step by step.

1. From points 2, 4, 5, and 10, we can infer that the person with a birthday in September (reggae fan) is not driving the subway or snowmobile, so they must be riding the motorbike, quad-bike, or a vehicle yet to be determined.

2. The person driving the subway is neither the mechanic nor the architect due to points 7 and 6. They also can't be the fan of trance (point 1), rock (point 4), or ambient (point 13). So, they must be riding the train, quad-bike, or motorbike. Since the subway driver is the wooden house (point 5) and we know the mechanic rides the quad-bike (point 7), the subway driver can't be the mechanic. This leaves only two options: train or motorbike. However, since the person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile driver (point 4), and we know the motorbike driver is the ranch-style house (point 12), it's impossible for the subway driver to be the motorbike driver as well. Therefore, the subway driver must ride the train.

3. The person driving the snowmobile can't be on the far left due to point 9, so they are in one of the remaining positions. However, since the architect is not a snowmobile driver (point 6) and the snowmobile rider is neither the librarian nor the fan of folk (due to points 10 and 14), the only possible house for the snowmobile rider left is the gothic-revival house (point 8). This implies that the snowmobile driver must be in the middle position.

4. The motorbike driver can't be on the far right due to points 9 and 10, so they must be on the left side. Since the mechanic rides the quad-bike (point 7), the motorbikemaster cannot be the mechanic either. Therefore, the motorbikemaster is the motorbike driver.

5. The librarian can't be on the far left due to point 9 and they also can't be on the left of the person who's birthday is in june (point 10), so they must be on the right side or the last position. Since the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, which is on the left side, the librarian cannot be a house on the left side. This leaves us with two options: palace (rock fan) or futuristic. As the librarian can't ride the subway due to point 10, they must ride one of the remaining vehicles. However, since they are not the architect and not driving the snowmobile, the only vehicle left for the librarian is the quad-bike. This means that the rock fan (architect) cannot be the librarian, which implies that the palace is the futuristic house (as the only remaining option). So, the librarian rides the quad-bike and lives in the futuristic house.

6. Now we know the librarian's position, and since they can't be on the far left (point 9) or on the left of the person with a birthday in june (point 10), the person driving the motorbike must be the first person on the left side, making them the fan of folk.

7. Finally, we can see that there is only one position left for the fan of ambient: the second position to the right. Therefore, the bartender (ambient fan) is in the second position from the right.

8. With all positions filled, we have the following final arrangement:

   - First: folk (left side)
   - Second: ambient (bartender)
   - Third: motorbike (motorbikemaster/folk)
   - Fourth: snowmobile (gothic-revival house)
   - Fifth: subway (train fan)
   - Sixth: quad-bike (librarian)

9. Now, let's find the birthdays:

   - First: June
   - Second: May (architect)
   - Third: September (reggae fan)
   - Fourth: February
   - Fifth: July

10. To find folk's position in the format **folk:Num**, we need to identify which position ""folk"" occupies, and since they are the first person on the left side, their position is **1**.

So, the answer is **folk: 1**."	folk:1	folk:1	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_2	folk	1	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down by categorizing each piece of information and finding relationships between them.

1. We know the categories for transport, music-genres, houses, jobs, and birthdays.
2. We have 5 people in each category.
3. Some connections are made between these categories (e.g., person X drives vehicle Y, person Z has job role A).
4. By using the given information, we can make deductions to find out who fits into which category and their positions.

Let's start with the connections:
1. Trance fan drives the train
2. Reggae fan is born in September
3. Rock fan lives in the palace house
4. Subway driver is on the left of Snowmobile driver
5. Subway driver lives in the wooden house
6. Architect is born in May
7. Quad-bike driver is the mechanic
8. Gothic-revival house is in the middle
9. Folk fan is on the far left
10. Librarian is on the same side as the person born in June (left or right)
11. The person born in July is on the same side as the mechanic
12. Motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house
13. Ambient fan is the bartender
14. Folk fan is on the same side as the motorbike driver
15. Librarian is on the same side as the futuristic house

With these connections, we can make some deductions:
- Since the subway driver lives in the wooden house (#5) and the subway driver is to the left of the Snowmobile driver (#4), we know that the Snowmobile driver must be on the right. Let's call the people by their vehicle names (Snowmobile = Snow, Subway = Sub). So, Snow > Sub.
- Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (#8), it can only be house #3 or 4. However, since house #1 and #2 are ranch-style and futuristic, respectively, the gothic-revival must be house #4.
- The architect is born in May (#6), so they must be person #3 since the other people with birthdays in odd months have been placed.
- Since the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (#12) and we know that the gothic-revival house is house #4, the motorbikemaster can't be house #4 or 5. Therefore, the motorbikemaster must be house #1.
- Since the fan of rock lives in the palace house (#3), they can only be person #2 or 3 since the other people with music genres of trance and reggae have been placed. However, since we know that the architect is person #3, the fan of rock must be person #2.
- Since the librarian is on the same side as the person born in June (#10) and the motorbikemaster lives in house #1, the librarian can't be in position #1 or 2. Therefore, the librarian must be either position #5 or 6.
- Since the fan of ambient is the bartender (#13), they must be person #4 since we know that the architect and rock fan have been placed.
- The fan of folk is on the same side as the motorbike driver (#9) and can't be position #1 or 2 since the librarian and motorbikemaster are in those positions. Therefore, the fan of folk must be either position #3, 5, or 6.
- The person born in July (#11) can't be in position #6 since the librarian is already there, so the person born in July must be person #4 or 5. However, we know that the fan of folk can't be in position #5 because the librarian must be in an even position, so the person born in July (#11) must be the mechanic (person #7).
- Since the Snowmobile driver is on the right of the Subway driver (Snow > Sub), and we know that the quad-bike driver (mechanic) is to the left of the Snowmobile driver, the quad-bike driver (mechanic) must be in position #6.
- Since the fan of folk is on the same side as the motorbike driver (#9) and can't be in position #1 or 2 since the librarian and motorbikemaster are there, the fan of folk can only be in position #3, 5, or 6. Since we know that the mechanic is already in position #6, the fan of folk must be either position #3 or 5.
- However, since the person born in February (#14) can't be in position #6 because the mechanic is there, and the fan of folk can only be in positions #3 or 5, the person born in February must be the fan of folk. Since the person born in February is odd-numbered (position #3), the librarian must be in position #5.

Now that we have placed all people according to their characteristics, here's where each person is:
1. Motorbikemaster (June)
2. Rock fan (Palace house - February)
3. Folk fan (Wooden house - September)
4. Ambient fan (Bartender - Trance fan)
5. Librarian (Futuristic house - July)
6. Mechanic (Quad-bike driver - Reggae fan)
7. Person born in February (Snowmobile driver)
8. Gothic-revival house (House #4)
9. Subway driver (Living in the wooden house and left of Snowmobile driver)
10. Snowmobile driver (On the right of the Subway driver)

And finally, we can find the position of folk: Folk: 3"	folk:1	folk:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_3	folk	1	" To solve this puzzle, we'll create a table to keep track of the given information and try to find connections between them. Here's the table with my assumptions on the missing information marked as ""X"":

| transport | music-genre | house       | job          | birthday  |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| motorbike | trance     | ranch-style | motorbikemaster   | X         |
| subway    | X          | wooden      | X             | may       |
| train     | trance     | X           | X             | june      |
| snowmobile| X          | gothic-revival| X            | september|
| quad-bike  | X          | palace      | X             | february  |
| X         | reggae     | futuristic   | librarian    | july       |
| X         | rock       | X           | architect    | X         |
| X         | folk       | X            | mechanic     | X        |
| X         | ambient   | X            | bartender   | X         |

From point 4, we can deduce that the person driving the subway (trance) is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the snowmobile driver's birthday is in September and the reggae fan is also in September (point 2), the snowmobile driver must be X, and the subway driver must be trance.

From point 5, we know that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house. So, the wooden house must be on the left of the snowmobile. Since the leftmost position is filled by the fan of folk (point 9), and the snowmobile is not reggae, it means that the fan of folk cannot live in the wooden house; therefore, the wooden house must be either librarian or architect.

From point 6, we learn that the architect has a birthday in May, so the wooden house (architect) must be in position ""May"" (2nd column).

From points 8 and 15, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle and the librarian lives on one side of the futuristic house. Since we already placed the architect (wooden house) in position 2, the only remaining option for the gothic-revival house (palace) is in position 5. So, the palace house must be ""gothic-revival.""

Since we know the position of the wooden and palace houses, we can now place the fan of rock (point 4) as well. Since we already placed the architect and gothic-revival house, there are only two remaining options for the rock music fan: librarian or motorbikemaster. However, from point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, so it can't be the rock fan. Therefore, the librarian must be the fan of rock (rock:3).

From points 10 and 11, we learn that the librarian (rock) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (train driver), and the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. So, the train driver must be the person with a birthday in June. Since we already placed the rock fan as librarian, the only remaining option for the train driver is the motorbikemaster (trance).

From points 13 and 14, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender and is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we already placed the librarian, mechanic, and train driver, the only remaining option for the motorbike driver is the quad-bike. However, from point 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. So, there must be a mistake in either point 7 or 14, because they contradict each other.

Since we have identified all positions except for the fan of folk and a few inconsistencies, let's focus on finding the position of the fan of folk (folk). From points 9, 10, and 15, we learn that the fan of folk is on the far left and is either on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we already placed the motorbikemaster (train driver) as the person with a birthday in June, the only remaining option for the fan of folk is in position ""February"" (4th column). Therefore, the fan of folk is ""folk:1.""

Due to inconsistencies in points 7 and 14, I cannot identify where the mechanic or the quad-bike driver is. However, we now know the positions of all other people and their preferences."	folk:1	folk:1	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_4	folk	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step.

1. From point 2, we know that the person born in September is a fan of reggae. We'll assign their position as `September:X`.

2. Point 3 tells us that the fan of rock lives in the palace house. So, the palace house can be marked as `Rock:Palace`.

3. From point 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Let's assume the subway driver is `Subway:1` and the snowmobile driver is `Snowmobile:2`.

4. Point 5 confirms that the subway driver lives in a wooden house, so `Wooden:1`.

5. Now we know that point 6 tells us the architect is born in May, so let's mark it as `Architect:May`.

6. From point 7, we can deduce that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. Let's assign their position as `Quad-bike:3`. We also know from this point that the mechanic is near the motorbikemaster.

7. Point 8 tells us that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so let's mark it as `Gothic-revival:Middle`.

8. From points 9 and 10, we can deduce that the fan of folk must be either the left neighbor or right neighbor of both the person born in June (`June:X`) and the motorbike driver. Since the librarian is on one side of `June:X`, the motorbike driver must be on the opposite side. Let's assign the motorbike driver position as `Motorbike:4`.

9. Now we can deduce that the left neighbor of `June:X` and `Motorbike:4` is the fan of folk (`Folk:X1`), where X1 could be 2, 3, or 5. Since the mechanic (Quad-bike) is near the motorbikemaster (Ranch-style house), they cannot both be on the left side of `June:X`. So, `Folk:X1` must be on the same side as the mechanic.

10. From points 11 and 12, we know that the person born in July is either on the left or right of the mechanic. Since the fan of folk (`Folk:X1`) is on the same side as the mechanic, the person born in July cannot be on the same side. Therefore, `July:X3`, where X3 could be 2, 4, or 6.

11. Now we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender from point 13, so let's mark it as `Ambient:Bartender`.

12. Since the librarian cannot be on the same side as the motorbikemaster (from point 9), and they are not next to `June:X` (from points 10 and 15), the only remaining option is for the librarian to be in the futuristic house. So, let's mark it as `Librarian:Futuristic`.

13. Now we can fill in the remaining positions. Since the architect is born in May (point 6) and the librarian is not next to `June:X` (point 15), the motorbikemaster must be on the opposite side of `June:X`. Since the fan of folk (`Folk:X1`) is on the same side as the mechanic, the motorbikemaster can only be on the left side of `June:X`. So, let's mark it as `Motorbikemaster:LeftOfJune`.

14. Since the fan of folk (`Folk:X1`) is next to the motorbike driver (from point 9), and since the librarian cannot be on the same side as the motorbikemaster (from point 15), the only remaining option for the left or right neighbor of `Folk:X1` is the fan of ambient. So, let's mark it as `Folk:X1LeftOfAmbient`.

15. Now we can fill in the rest. Since the subway driver lives in a wooden house (point 5) and the mechanic drives the quad-bike (point 7), they cannot both be on the left side of the motorbikemaster (from point 9). So, let's place the snowmobile driver on the left as `Snowmobile:LeftOfMotorbikemaster`.

16. Since the subway driver is in a wooden house (point 5), and the mechanic drives the quad-bike (point 7), they cannot both be on the right side of the motorbikemaster (from point 9). So, let's place the train driver on the right as `Train:RightOfMotorbikemaster`.

17. Since the architect is born in May (point 6) and the librarian is not next to `June:X` (point 15), the only remaining option for the left or right neighbor of the architect is the quad-bike driver, who we already know is the mechanic. So, let's mark it as `Architect:LeftOfMechanic`.

18. Since the librarian is on the opposite side of the motorbikemaster (from point 15), and since the architect is not next to the quad-bike driver (who is the mechanic), the only remaining option for the left or right neighbor of the librarian is `June:X`. Since the fan of folk (`Folk:X1`) cannot be on the same side as the motorbikemaster (from point 9), the only remaining option is for `June:X` to be on the left of the librarian. So, let's mark it as `June:LeftOfLibrarian`.

Now we have filled in all positions except for `Folk:X1`, but since the fan of folk (`Folk:X1`) is next to the motorbike driver (from point 9), and we know that `June:X` must be on the left of the librarian, the only remaining options are `Folk:X1 = 3` or `Folk:X1 = 5`.

Since the fan of folk is not next to the subway driver (who lives in a wooden house), and since the mechanic drives the quad-bike, the only remaining option for `Folk:X1 = 3` would put the snowmobile driver on the right side of the motorbikemaster. However, this contradicts point 4, which states that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver.

Therefore, the correct answer is `Folk:5`. The final arrangement looks like this:
```markdown
 Subway:1 (Wooden) | Snowmobile:2                   | Train:3 (Ranch-style)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Motorbikemaster:LeftOfJune | Folk:5 (Ambient)      | Librarian:Futuristic

```"	folk:1	folk:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_5	folk	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by finding connections between different attributes.

1) From point 2 and 14, we know that the person who likes reggae (born in September) is on the left or right of the person who likes folk. Since folk is on the far left (point 9), reggae must be on the right side. Let's denote:
   - L for the left side and R for the right side

2) From point 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Also, from points 5 and 15, we know that the person in the wooden house (subway driver according to point 5) is on the left or right of the librarian. Since the librarian can't be on the far left (point 10), the librarian must be on the right side. So, subway -> L and snowmobile -> R.

3) From points 6 and 10, we know that the architect is the person whose birthday is in May and is either on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since folk is on the far left (point 9), architect can't be on the far left. Thus, architect must be on the right side (architect -> R).

4) From points 7 and 11, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, which means they are next to someone whose birthday is in July (point 11). Since the librarian can't be on the far left or right (points 9, 10, and 15), there must be another person on the far left. Therefore, the person born in February (point 3) should be on the far left, making the mechanic on the left side (mechanic -> L).

5) From points 8 and 14, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle and that folk is on one of its sides. Since the librarian can't be on the far left or right (points 9, 10, and 15), there must be another person on the far left or right, making the mechanic on the left side (point 4) and snowmobile on the right side (point 4). So the gothic-revival house is in the middle.

6) From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender. Also, since the librarian can't be on the far left or right (points 9, 10, and 15), there must be another person on the far left or right, making the mechanic on the left side (point 4) and snowmobile on the right side (point 4). Thus, the bartender should be in the wooden house (subway driver according to point 5), which means the ambient fan is on the left side.

7) Now we know that reggae (September) is on the right side (point 2), mechanic (left of July -> L), and snowmobile (right of mechanic -> R). We also know that folk must be on one of these two sides because they are on the left or right of both the person driving the motorbike (since folk likes folk) and the librarian. Given this information, folk should be on the right side (R), as reggae is already on the right side.

8) Finally, we can deduce the remaining attributes:
   - Motorbike -> L since it's not on the far left (point 9) and not in the middle (point 5). The only place left is on the left side.
   - Quad-bike (mechanic) -> L (point 7)
   - Train (trance fan) -> Palace house since it's rock (point 4) and the wooden house is taken (subway driver according to point 5).
   - Librarian can be on any side but the far left (points 9, 10, and 15), so librarian is in the futuristic house.

Now we have all the information:
- Transport: motorbike(L), subway(Wooden, L), train(Palace), snowmobile(R), quad-bike(L)
- Music-genres: trance(Train), rock(Palace), ambient(Bartender), folk(R), reggae(Reggae:R)
- Houses: ranch-style (Motorbikemaster), wooden (Bartender), gothic-revival (Middle), palace, futuristic (Librarian)
- Jobs: motorbikemaster (ranch-style), mechanic (quad-bike(L)), architect (R), bartender (ambient), librarian
- Birthdays: June, May, September (Reggae:R), February, July (mechanic's left)

To find the exact position of folk, we need to consider that it should be on the right side and that reggae is already on the right side. Since there is only one empty spot on the right side, **folk is in the futuristic house (R)**."	folk:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_6	folk	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down by finding the relationships between the given variables:

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train and the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Let's assume Train is Person 1, Subway is Person 2, and Snowmobile is Person 3. So, we have: Trance = Person 1

2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, but we don't know their transport or house yet.

3. The fan of rock is the palace house. We don't have any relationship with the transport or birthdays for this person.

4. Since Person 2 (Subway) is on the left of Person 3 (Snowmobile), and we can assume they are not at the far left or right, let's place them in the middle (Position 3). We don't have enough information about their music preference or house yet.

5. We know that Person 2 is the wooden house, but we already placed it in Position 3 with Subway. This creates a conflict as we need another person to fill Position 5 since there are only five positions. However, since we don't have enough information about their music preference or birthdate yet, let's leave this for now.

6. The architect has a birthday in May, and we know they aren't the motorbikemaster or librarian (as they are already assigned). However, as we don't know their transport or house preferences, we can't place them yet.

7. We know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, but we also know that Person 2 (Subway) is a mechanic (from Clue 7). This creates another conflict since there should only be one mechanic. Let's consider this an inconsistency in the puzzle as there can only be one mechanic.

8. The person driving the motorbike has a neighbor on the far left, and their neighbor is also the fan of folk (Clue 9 & 14). Since we don't have enough information about their transport or house preferences yet, let's leave this for now.

9. We know that the librarian is either on the left or right of the person who has a birthday in June (Clue 10 & 15), but as we haven't assigned any birthdays yet, we can't place them yet.

10. The fan of ambient is the bartender, but we don't have enough information about their transport or house preferences to place them yet.

11-13: As there are inconsistencies in Clues 6, 7, and 8, it is impossible to solve the puzzle completely based on the given clues. We should report that the puzzle has an inconsistency and cannot be solved as presented. However, if you want me to guess where folk could be, here's a possible arrangement without resolving all conflicts:

   - Train (Trance) -> Motorbike (Folk or other music preference) -> Subway (Unknown music preference) or Snowmobile (Unknown music preference) -> Quad-bike (Mechanic if the puzzle is consistent) -> Librarian or Bartender (If librarian's neighbor is June, otherwise bartender)

   - House: Ranch-style (Motorbikemaster), Wooden (Subway or Snowmobile), Gothic-revival (Middle), Palace (Rock), Futuristic (Librarian or Bartender). This arrangement leaves many unknowns, as we have not been able to resolve the conflicts in Clues 5, 6, and 7."	folk:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_7	folk	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's try to find out the positions one by one based on the given clues.

1. We know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train (let's call this Person T).
2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September (Person S).
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, but we don't yet know which person lives there. Let P be the position of the palace.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we don't know who these people are yet, let Subway be the position of the subway driver and Snowmobile be the position of the snowmobile driver. However, since Subway is to the left of Snowmobile, we can deduce that Snowmobile has a higher position number (Snowmobile > Subway).
5. The person driving the subway lives in the wooden house (Person W).
6. The architect is the person who's birthday is in May (Architect A), and since we know that they live in a specific house, let's assign a house number to them for now. We also know that the Architect is not Subway, Snowmobile, or S. So Architect A cannot be Gothic-revival (G), Ranch-style (R), Quad-bike (Q), Folk (F), or Librarian (L).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (Person M). We know that Mechanic M cannot be Architect A, Subway, Snowmobile, S, G, R, Q, L, or T.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it must be position 3 (G:3) since positions are arranged from left to right and there are 5 of them.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since the first position is taken by folk, it can only be F. However, we don't yet know if it's Person T or another person. Let's tentatively assign it as Folk (F:1) for now.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (Person J). Since F:1 is June, Librarian (L) must be either F:2 or F:4 since there are no positions to the right of F:1 and L cannot be Gothic-revival (G) as it was already assigned.
11. The person who's birthday is in July (Person JULY) is on the left or right of Mechanic M. If we place Librarian L to the right of June, then Person JULY can only be on the right side of M since there are no positions remaining on the left. However, this placement conflicts with clue 15, so let's try placing Librarian L to the left of June instead. In that case, Person JULY must be on the left of Mechanic M.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, but we don't yet know which person it is (Motorbikemaster MB). Since Motorbikemaster MB cannot be Gothic-revival (G), Ranch-style (R) is assigned to a remaining position.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (Person B). We know that Person B cannot be Architect A, Subway, Snowmobile, S, G, Q, F, or L.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since Folk (F) is already placed on the far left as position 1, and we know that Motorbikemaster MB cannot be Folk (as it's a different genre), the only option is for the fan of folk to be on the right of the person driving the motorbike. This means that Person T (Trance) must be in position 2, as the other options would place Person T before Position 1 (Folk).
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since Librarian (L) has already been placed on the left side of June and we know that the Futuristic house (House F) cannot be Ranch-style (as it was assigned to Motorbikemaster), the only option is for Librarian (L) to be on the right side of Futuristic House (F:5).
16. The remaining person driving the quad-bike, Mechanic M, can now be placed in position 4 since we know that there are 5 positions and all other people have been assigned a position except for Snowmobile and Subway. Since Snowmobile is on the left of Subway, Snowmobile (Snowmobile SW) must be in position 4 as well.
17. The last remaining person driving the subway is now placed in Position 5 since there are no other positions available. This person must be in the wooden house (Person W).
18. We have now assigned all people, houses, and jobs. The final arrangement looks like this:

    Folk:1 - Trance:2 - Mechanic:4 (Quad-bike) - Subway:5 (Wooden House) - Snowmobile:4 (Wooden House) - Architect:3 (Gothic-revival) - Librarian:2 - Bartender:6 - Motorbikemaster:7 (Ranch-style) - Futuristic House:5

As you can see, Person F is on the far left (Folk:1)."	folk:1	folk:1	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_8	folk	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by finding connections between the different aspects for each person. Here are my deductions:

1. Trance fan drives the train -> Train: Person 5
2. Reggae fan has a birthday in September -> September: Person 4
3. Rock is the palace house, but we don't know who it belongs to yet. Let's mark Palace as '?'.
4. Subway is on the left of snowmobile. Also, we know Subway's house is Wooden. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, it can only be between Snowmobile and Train, so let's mark Subway as Person 3 (left of Snowmobile).
5. Person driving the subway lives in a wooden house -> Wooden: Person 3
6. Architect has a birthday in May -> May: Person 6
7. Quad-bike driver is the mechanic -> Quad-bike: Person 1
8. We know the position of Subway, Train, and Snowmobile now (Subway left, Train middle, Snowmobile right). So, Quad-bike must be on the far left or in the middle. Since we've already placed the mechanic at the quad-bike, he can't be the one driving the subway. Thus, Mechanic: Person 1 (far left) and Person 3 is the snowmobile driver.
9. Gothic-revival house is in the middle -> Gothic-revival: Person 8
10. The fan of folk is on the far left (with the mechanic) -> Folk: Person 2 or Person 1 (since there are only two positions on the far left). However, since we already assigned the Mechanic to the Quad-bike, the only remaining position for folk is Person 2.

Now let's try to find the rest of the connections:

11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (we already placed the mechanic). Since we don't have any more available positions on the left, the person with a birthday in July must be on the far right. This limits our options for the other jobs, as only Bartender and Librarian are left to place on the far right.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house -> Motorbike: Person 7 (since there's no more available position for the ranch-style house). However, we haven't assigned any positions in the middle between Snowmobile and Train yet, so we can't place the motorbike master anywhere.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender -> Ambient: Person 9 (since there are only two available positions for Bartender). However, since we haven't placed any positions in the middle between Snowmobile and Train yet, we can't place the bartender anywhere either.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (we don't know who it is yet) -> We already know that Folk is Person 2, so Person 7 (Motorbike) must be to the left or right of Person 2. Since Person 2 is already placed on the far left, Motorbike can only be on the far right, but we've assigned July to the far right. However, since we have a connection between folk and motorbike, Person 7 (Motorbike) must be just before Person 2 (Folk).
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (we don't know where it is yet). Since Person 6 (Architect) is already placed in the middle, Futuristic can only be on either the far left or the far right. However, since we have a connection between folk and motorbike, Person 7 (Motorbike) must be just before Person 2 (Folk), which means Person 2 must be the second from the left. So, Futuristic can only be on the far right. Thus, the librarian is also on the far right (since there's no other option).

Now let's place the remaining jobs:
- Since we know that Folk and Motorbike are just before Person 2 and after Person 1, respectively, and Person 1 is the Mechanic, Person 7 (Motorbikemaster) must be between Person 6 (Architect) and Person 5 (Train driver). However, the train driver is a fan of Trance. Since Trance fans prefer Motorbike as a means of transport, the only remaining option for Train driver is Person 5 (middle). Thus, Architect is just before Motorbikemaster, so Architect: Person 6.
- Since the Futuristic house is on the far right, it can't be any of the first four houses (Ranch, Wooden, Gothic-revival, Palace), so Futuristic must belong to Person 10 (Bartender or Librarian). However, we know that Ambient is a fan of Bartending. Since Ambient fans prefer Trance as a music genre, the only remaining option for the person with a Futuristic house is Person 9 (Bartender).
- With all the other positions filled, Librarian is the only remaining position, which means Librarian: Person 10 (on the far right).

Now we have all the information needed to place the people in their respective positions based on their birthday months. Since there's no specific order within each month, it doesn't matter if we shuffle them around for now. For example, we can say:
- June: Person 2 (Folk) and Person 4 (Reggae)
- May: Person 6 (Architect)
- September: Person 4 (Reggae)
- February: Person 8 (Gothic-revival house)
- July: Person 10 (Librarian)

To find out the exact order of people within each month, we would need more information or additional clues. For now, we can conclude that Folk is on the second position in June. So, **Folk: 2**."	folk:1	folk:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_9	folk	1	" Let's solve this puzzle step by step:

1. From point 4, we know that the person driving the subway is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile (let's call them A and B respectively).
2. From point 5, we know that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house (house H).
3. From point 6, we know that the architect lives in May (person D). Since the architect is not A or B as they drive vehicles, D can't be on the far left (from point 9), so D must live on the right of the person driving the motorbike (let's call them C).
4. From point 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike (person E). Since the librarian is not E from point 10 and 11, the librarian can't be on the right of C or E. So, the librarian must live to the left of person A (let's call this person F).
5. From points 8 and 14, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle and the fan of folk lives near the motorbike. Since neither F nor C can be the fan of folk (from point 3), the fan of folk must live between A and F.
6. From point 15, we know that the librarian doesn't live in the futuristic house (let's call this G). So, G can't be C or F. Since G is not D from points 6 and 10, G must be A, B, or E. But since the fan of reggae lives in September, neither A nor B can be G (from point 2). Therefore, G must be E.
7. From point 11, we know that the person whose birthday is in July (person I) lives on the left or right of E (the mechanic). Since the librarian lives to the left of F and isn't E, I can't be F or D. Therefore, I must be A or B. But since the fan of reggae lives in September, neither A nor B can be I (from point 2). This leads us to a contradiction, which means our initial assumptions might not be correct.

Unfortunately, due to this contradiction, it's impossible to find a valid solution based on the given information."	folk:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_folk_10	folk	1	" To solve this puzzle, we'll work our way through the given clues and try to deduce the relationships between the variables. Here is a breakdown of the solution:

1. We know that the fan of trance is driving the train, so let T represent Train, F1 represent Trance, and P5 represent Person with birthday in May (since the person born in May has not been assigned any other attributes yet). Then we have the equation F1 = T.
2. The fan of reggae is born in September. Let R3 represent Reggae, B9 represent Birthday in September. We don't have any other information to link these variables with others at this point, so for now, we just note that R3 = B9.
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, which has not been linked to any person yet. Let R2 represent Rock, Px represent Person living in the Palace house. We know that R2 = Palace, but don't have enough information to link R2 with a specific birthday or transport method at this point.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Let S1 represent Subway, Sm1 represent Snowmobile, and Dx represent the driver of each vehicle. We can write S1 < Sm1 in terms of their positions.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house. Since we know that S1 = Wooden, we also have a new link between S1 and the Palace house (since they share the same house type).
6. The architect is the person born in May. Let A6 represent Architect, P5 represent Person with birthday in May. We can write A6 = P5, which means that A6 lives in the Wooden house (S1) since P5 drives the Subway (S1).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Let Q7 represent Quad-bike, M2 represent Mechanic. We don't have any other information to link these variables with others at this point, so for now, we just note that Q7 = M2.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we know the positions of the Subway (S1) and Snowmobile (Sm1), we can deduce that the Gothic-Revival house must be between them, i.e., S1 < G > Sm1.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. We don't have any other information to link this variable with others at this point, so for now, we just note that F4 = Person on the far left.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Let L6 represent Librarian, B6 represent Birthday in June. We know that the Subway driver (S1) and the Snowmobile driver (Sm1) are on opposite sides of the Gothic-Revival house (G), so one of them must be on the left and the other on the right. Since the librarian is on the same side as B6, we can write L6 > G or L6 < G.
11. The person who's birthday is in July's is on the left or right of the mechanic. We already know that the librarian (L6) must be on one side of the Gothic-Revival house (G), and since L6 is not next to M2, the only remaining option for the person with birthday in July (B7) is to be on the other side of G. This means B7 < M2.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Let MB1 represent Motorbike, R1 represent Ranch-style. We don't have any other information to link these variables with others at this point, so for now, we just note that MB1 = R1.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. Let A4 represent Ambient, Bx represent Bartender. We don't have any other information to link these variables with others at this point, so for now, we just note that A4 = Bx.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we know that F1 (Trance) cannot be on the same side as F4 (Folk), and F3 (Rock) is not on the same side as F4, the only remaining options for folk are to be on the left or right of S1 (Subway). However, since L6 (Librarian) must also be on the same side as S1, we can deduce that the position of F4 (Folk) cannot be on the same side as L6. Therefore, the only possible arrangement is for folk to be on the other side of L6.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we know the positions of S1 and Sm1 (on opposite sides of G), and that B7 (July) is between G and M2, the only remaining options for the position of the Futuristic house are to be on L6's side (F > L6).

Now let's rearrange the information:
- F1 = T
- R3 = B9
- R2 = Palace
- S1 < Sm1
- S1 = Wooden
- A6 = P5
- Q7 = M2
- G > S1 > Sm1 or Sm1 > G > S1
- F4 = Person on the far left
- L6 > G or L6 < G
- B7 < M2
- MB1 = R1
- A4 = Bx
- F4 is on the other side of L6
- F > L6
- F4, L6 < G or F4, L6 > G

Since F4 cannot be on the same side as L6 and we know that L6 is greater than G (L6 > G), the only possible arrangement for folk would be to be on the right of librarian (F > L6). With this information, we can construct a valid seating arrangement:

- Trance fan (F1) drives the Train
- Rock fan lives in the Palace house
- Reggae fan is born in September (B9)
- Subway driver (S1 = Wooden) is on the left of Snowmobile driver (Sm1)
- Architect (A6) drives the Subway and is born in May
- Mechanic (M2) rides the Quad-bike
- The gothic-revival house is in the middle (G)
- Folk fan (F4) is on the far left, but not next to Librarian or Trance fan. Since we know that L6 > G, the only possible arrangement for folk would be to be on the right of librarian (F > L6). The only remaining option for L6's position is to be on the left side of G (L6 < G).
- Ambient fan (A4) is the Bartender
- Folk fan (F4) is on the right side of Librarian (F > L6) and the left side of G (L6 < G), so F4 must be between S1 and Sm1, i.e., F4 = Sm2.
- The only remaining option for the position of the Futuristic house (Fut) is to be on the right side of L6 (Fut > L6).

The final arrangement would look like this:

- F1 - T - A4 - Bx - L6 - S1 - F4 - G - Sm1 - M2 - Fut

Where F1, S1, and Fut are on the left side of the arrangement, while A4, L6, and Sm1 are on the right."	folk:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_1	reggae	7	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and create combinations based on the given clues. Let's start by creating a table to represent the information:

| Transport | Music-genre | House       | Job          | Birthday Month |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
|           | trance    | ranch-style | motorbikemaster |                |
|           | rock      | wooden     | mechanic     |                |
|           | ambient   | gothic-revival | bartender   |                |
|           | folk      | palace     | architect    |                |
|           | reggae    | subway     | librarian    | september     |
| snowmobile|          | futuristic |             |                |
| quad-bike |          |            |             |                |

Using clues 1,2,4,5,6:
- Trance is the person driving the train (clue 1). Let's place ""train"" in the transport column.
- Reggae's birthday is in September (clue 2), so reggae is not the architect (born in May - clue 6) or the librarian (born in June, July, or February). We can exclude July for now (clue 11). Let's assume that reggae is born in February.
- The fan of rock is the palace house (clue 4), so place ""rock"" in the appropriate row.
- The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (clue 4). Since we know that trance rides the train, it means the reggae cannot ride the subway since the reggae was born in February and the librarian (born in September) will have to be placed before the mechanic (later part of the process).
- The person driving the subway is the wooden house (clue 5), so place ""subway"" next to ""wooden"".
- The architect is born in May (clue 6). Since we know that reggae cannot be an architect, reggae is not on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (clue 14). So let's place the ""architect"" row in the middle.
- Now, since the architect was placed in May and the mechanic is the quad-bike rider (clue 7), we can exclude July for reggae's birthday (clue 11).

Now let's solve the remaining clues:
- The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the fan of folk (clue 9). Let's assume that the ""motorbike"" is placed on the far right. So, the fan of folk must be on the far left. This means that ""folk"" can only be either ""trance"" or ""rock"". Since trance was already assigned, we have ""folk = rock"".
- The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (clue 12), so place ""motorbike"" next to ""ranch-style"". This means that ""rock"" must be on the far left, and since it's already assigned, ""trance"" must be the fan of folk.
- The gothic-revival house is in the middle (clue 8). Since we know that the architect is in the middle, the ""gothic-revival"" house can only be either ""ambient"" or ""reggae"". But ""gothic-revival"" cannot be ""ambient"" as it's a job, and bartender was already assigned (clue 13). So, ""gothic-revival"" = ""reggae"".
- The fan of ambient is the bartender (clue 13), so place ""ambient"" next to ""bartender"".
- Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (clue 10) and we know that July cannot be reggae's birthday (clue 11), there are only two possible months left for June's birth: May and February. Since February was assigned to reggae, the remaining option for June is the month of the person driving the motorbike (which has already been determined as trance). So let's place the ""librarian"" on the left or right of ""trance"".
- The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (clue 14), but we have already determined that the fan of folk = rock. Since we know that trance and reggae are on the opposite sides, placing the fan of rock next to ""trance"" will violate clue 9. So let's place the ""rock"" row on the left side and ""reggae"" on the right side.
- The remaining job is the bartender (clue 13), so place ""bartender"" on the left or right of ""librarian"". Since we have already placed ""reggae"" (which was assigned to the librarian) on the right side, let's place ""bartender"" on the left.
- Finally, since we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (clue 7), and the mechanic has already been placed on the left or right of the reggae, let's place the ""quad-bike"" on the left side.

So, here's our final table:

| Transport | Music-genre | House       | Job          | Birthday Month |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| motorbike | trance    | ranch-style | motorbikemaster| june           |
| subway   | gothic-revival | wooden     | librarian   | september      |
| train    | reggae    | palace     | mechanic     | february       |
| snowmobile|          | futuristic |             |                |
| quad-bike | ambient   |            | bartender   | may            |

And the answer is: **reggae:2**"	reggae:5	reggae:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_2	reggae	7	" Let's break it down and solve step by step:

From points 2, 11, and 15, we know that reggae is born in September, and the person with July birthday is to the left or right of the mechanic. Additionally, the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since there are only 5 positions (as everyone has a different job, house, transport, music genre, and birthday month), we can deduce that reggae must be in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5 because these are the remaining slots after placing other conditions.

Now let's analyze the rest of the information to determine where the reggae fan should be placed:

- From points 1 and 13, we know that the trance fan is driving the train and the ambient fan is the bartender. Since trance and ambient are different music genres, they cannot share a position (point 5), so neither of them can be in positions 1 or 4 (as the train and subway driver and the bartender must have different positions). This leaves positions 2 and 5 for reggae.

- From point 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it cannot be in position 1 or 5 (as those positions are occupied by houses already). Therefore, the possible houses for reggae are ranch-style (motorbikemaster), wooden (subway driver), and futuristic. But we know from point 2 that the fan of reggae is not born in May (since the architect is born in May), so reggae cannot be in the ranch-style house (as it was mentioned to be the motorbikemaster). This leaves positions 2 and 5 for the subway driver. However, since the reggae fan is born in September (point 2), we can't have both the reggae fan and the mechanic (who is on the left or right of July's birthday) in position 5 because that would mean that the mechanic is placed before the reggae fan, but according to point 11, July's birthday must be on the left or right of the mechanic. So, the only remaining option is for the reggae fan to be in position 2 (as the subway driver and the wooden house).

So, we found that **reggae:2**. The person who likes reggae drives the subway and lives in a wooden house."	reggae:5	reggae:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_3	reggae	7	" To solve this puzzle, we'll organize the given information into tables for each category (Transport, Music-Genre, House, Job, Birthday Month) and then use the relationships provided to find the position of reggae.

1. Transport | Music-Genre    | House      |   Job          | Birthday Month
-------------|--------------|------------|----------------|-------------------
 Motorbike  | Trance       | Ranch-style| Motorbikemaster| June
 Subway     | *Reggae*     | Wooden     |                | May (6th person)
 Train      | Trance       | Palace     | Architect      | September (9th person)
 Snowmobile | *Unknown*   | Gothic-revival| *Unknown*    | Febuary
 Quad-bike | Ambient     | Futuristic  | Librarian        | July

2. From the relationships provided:
   - The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in september (3rd row).

Since we have found where Reggae is, the answer is **Reggae: 3**."	reggae:5	reggae:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_4	reggae	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step and assign numbers to each person based on their characteristics.

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of reggae is the person with a birthday in September and is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver (let's call them Person 5) can only have birthdays in June, May, September, February, or July, let's assign birthdays first:
   - September: Reggae
   - June: MotorbikeMaster
   - May: Architect (Point 6)
   - February: Trance (Point 1)
   - July: [Undetermined yet]

2. Since the fan of reggae is the person with a birthday in September, we know that Reggae cannot be on the far left (as stated in point 9). So let's place them at position 3 (regarding our numbering system, with Person 1 being the first to the left).

3. From points 4 and 10, we have Subway and Snowmobile placed next to each other, with Subway on the left. Since Subway is driven by an undetermined person, let's assign them Person 4 for now:
   - Subway: Person 4 (left of Snowmobile)
   - Snowmobile: [Undetermined]

4. From points 5 and 15, we know that the Wooden house is driven by the subway, so let's assign Person 4 as the wooden house.

5. From point 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. Since the motorbikemaster (Person 5) has been placed already, and the librarian cannot be on the left or right of June (Point 10), the only available position for Mechanic (Quad-bike) is on the far right. Let's assign Person 6 to the mechanic:
   - Quad-bike: Person 6 (far right)

6. From points 8 and 12, we know that the Gothic-revival house is in the middle and the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house. Since we already placed MotorbikeMaster as Person 5 and Quad-bike as Person 6, the only remaining houses for Gothic-revival are either the first (Person 1) or the second (Person 2). Let's place Gothic-revival as Person 1:
   - House 1 (Gothic-revival): Person 1

7. From point 3, we know that Rock is the palace house. Since Person 5 and Person 6 are already placed, let's assign Palace to Person 2:
   - House 2 (Palace): Person 2 (Rock)

8. From points 13 and 14, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender and is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since Reggae is already placed to the left of the motorbike driver (Person 5), let's place Ambient next to Person 5:
   - Ambient: Person 7 (left of MotorbikeMaster)

9. From point 11, we know that the person with a birthday in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we have already placed the mechanic as Person 6, let's assign July to Person 8:
   - July: Person 8 (left or right of Mechanic)

10. Now we are left with only two positions for the person with a birthday in February (Trance). From points 1 and 4, we know that Trance cannot be on the far left (as stated in point 9) or next to Snowmobile (as stated in point 4). Therefore, the only available position for Trance is the last one:
   - Trance: Person 9 (far right)

So now we have all the people placed according to their characteristics:
1. Reggae:3
2. MotorbikeMaster:5
3. Architect:4
4. Subway:4
5. Wooden House:4
6. Mechanic:6
7. Gothic-revival:1
8. Palace:2
9. Ambient:7
10. Librarian:[Undetermined] (left or right of Person 8)
11. Trance:9
12. Quad-bike:6
13. Bartender:7
14. Snowmobile: [Undetermined]
15. Librarian: [Undetermined] (left or right of House 5)
16. Futuristic House:[Undetermined]

However, we still need to figure out the positions for Snowmobile, Librarian, and Futuristic house. Since there's no more information connecting them with other characteristics, we can't determine their exact positions based on the given information alone."	reggae:5	reggae:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_5	reggae	7	" To solve this puzzle, we need to systematically eliminate possibilities and assign values based on the given clues. Here's a breakdown:

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train (Transport 3). Let's denote Tr = Transport 3.
2. The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September (Birthday 4). Let's denote Reg = Birthday 4.
3. The fan of rock is the palace house (House 5). Let's denote Rock = House 5.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (Position Sub < Position Snow).
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house (Sub = Wooden).
6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May (Job 6). Let's denote Arch = Birthday 2.
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (Transport 5). Let's denote Quad = Transport 5.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (House 3). Let's denote Grv = House 3.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (Folk Left).
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (Librarian < Jun or > Jun).
11. The person whose birthday is in July (July) is on the left or right of the mechanic (Jul < Quad or Jul > Quad).
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (Master = Ranch).
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (Ambient = Job 4).
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Folk < Mbike or Folk > Mbike).
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Librarian < Fut or Lib > Fut).

Now let's find positions for some elements:
- Since the subway is to the left of the snowmobile, it means that Sub can only be Transport 1 or 2. However, we know the subway is also the wooden house, which is only possible if Sub = Wooden (Transport 5). This means Snowmobile must be Transport 4.
- Since Folk is on the far left and Quad (Mechanic) is to its right, it implies that Folk is Position 1 or 9. But since Folk is also on the left or right of Mbike, we know that it can't be Position 9 because the motorbike driver is at position 2 (we'll see this in a moment). Therefore, Folk = Position 1.
- Since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house and the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, we can deduce that the librarian is not at position 2 (the motorbike driver) or position 3 (gothic-revival house). So Librarian = Position 5 or Position 6.
- Since Arch (May) and Jun are neighbors, it implies that Arch cannot be Position 1 (Folk) or Position 9 (Reggae). Therefore, Arch = Position 2, which means Mbike (Position 2), Librarian > Mbike, so Librarian = Position 5. This also implies that Reggae = Position 4.
- Since Ambient is the bartender and we know Folk's position, it means that Ambient can only be Position 3 or Position 6 (not 8, because gothic-revival house is at position 8). However, since Reggae is to the left of Mbike (Position 4), we can deduce that Ambient = Position 6.
- Since the fan of rock is the palace house, it implies that the person driving the motorbike cannot be a fan of rock because the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house. So the motorbike driver is not Mbike (Position 2), which means that Reggae (Position 4) can't be on its left, so it must be to the right. Thus, Folk > Reggae and Folk > Mbike implies that Folk = Position 1 and Reggae = Position 4.
- Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (Position 3), we know that Train (Transport 3) can't be at this position because Trance fans drive trains, and we already assigned Tr = Transport 3. So Train must be Position 1 or Position 5. But since the subway (Sub = Wooden) is in between the motorbike driver (Position 2) and the snowmobile driver (Position 4), it means that Train can't be at position 5 because then there would be no room for Snowmobile (Position 4). So, Train = Position 1.
- Since Snowmobile (Position 4) is to the left of Quad (Transport 5), it implies that Train must be to its right. But we just found that Train = Transport 1 and the subway is on the left side of the snowmobile, which contradicts our previous conclusion. However, if we swap the positions of Train and Sub, it solves the puzzle:
   - Transport 1 = Train (Trance fan)
   - Transport 2 = Motorbike (Folk fan)
   - Transport 3 = Trance fan (Already assigned as Train)
   - Transport 4 = Snowmobile (Reggae fan, Position 4)
   - Transport 5 = Quad (Mechanic, Reggae fan)
   - Birthday 1 = Folk fan
   - Birthday 2 = Arch (May)
   - Birthday 3 = Gothic-revival house (Not an individual)
   - Birthday 4 = Reggae fan (September)
   - Birthday 5 = Librarian (July)
   - Position 1 = Folk fan
   - Position 2 = Motorbike driver (Folk fan)
   - Position 3 = Gothic-revival house (Not an individual)
   - Position 4 = Reggae fan (September)
   - Position 5 = Librarian (July)
   - Position 6 = Ambient fan (Bartender)

Therefore, **reggae: 4** is the correct answer."	reggae:5	reggae:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_6	reggae	7	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's start by making assumptions based on the given information. We can create a table to organize our findings:

| Transport | Music Genre  | Job           | Birthday Month | House Style | Position  |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Motorbike |            |              |               |            |          |
| Subway    | Trance      |              | June          | Wooden      | Left of Snowmobile |
| Train     | Trance      |              |               |            |           |
| Snowmobile|            | Mechanic     | September     | Gothic-revival (middle)  | Right of Subway |
| Quad-bike |            |             |              |            |            |

1. Since the fan of trance is the person driving the train, and we know the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile, the only remaining option for train is July (assuming we've covered all the other months already). Let's place it at position 3 since it follows the snowmobile.
2. The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September. Since subway is taken, let's assume quad-bike for now and put it in position 4.
3. The fan of rock is the palace house. We have no open positions for this transport yet, so we can't place it yet.
4. The person driving the subway is the wooden house. Since we've placed subway already, it means the wooden house must be the position 2.
5. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May. We don't have an open position for architect yet.
6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since we have placed quad-bike and identified the mechanic, we can now place them in position 4.
7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 5). Since we've placed the wooden house already, snowmobile must be at position 6.
8. The fan of folk is on the far left (position 1), but we don't have an open position for this yet.
9. The librarian is on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in June. Since June has been covered by subway and we know that the wooden house (subway) is on its left, it means that either motorbike (position 1) or train (position 3) should be the librarian.
10. The fan of ambient is the bartender. We don't have an open position for this yet.
11. The person whose birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since quad-bike (mechanic) is at position 4, we can place train (reggae or librarian) at position 5 and motorbike (ambient or bartender) at position 6 if reggae is not July.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. We have no open positions for this yet.
13. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (position 6). Since we don't have a position for folk yet, it means that either motorbike (ambient or bartender) or train (reggae or librarian) should be the fan of folk.
14. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. We don't have a position for the futuristic house yet.

At this point, we don't have enough information to place all elements in their positions. However, since reggae is one of the remaining open positions, let's analyze which months are still available for July:
- May (architect) is taken.
- June (subway - wooden house) is taken.
- September (reggae currently placed as quad-bike) is taken.
- February, January, March, April, October, November, and December are still available. We can't determine which one is July yet, so we will need more information to resolve the puzzle.

Answer: **Reggae: Undetermined**"	reggae:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_7	reggae	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person who likes trance drives the train (position 5).
2. The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September (we don't have a specific position for them yet).
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, but we don't know where it is placed.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (position 1 < position 2).
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house, so position 1 should be the driver of the subway (this means the driver of the snowmobile is at position 2).
6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May. Since we know that the librarian is on their left or right, we can assume that the mechanic, who's driving the quad-bike, is the person on the other side (position 3).
7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 4), so none of our known elements can be there. We know it's not the motorbikemaster or the librarian because they're on the left or right of someone else, and it's not a job or birthday month we have assigned yet.
8. The fan of folk is on the far left (position 9). Since we already have three people on the left, this can't be the case. Let's reconsider some assumptions:
    - Position 7 could be the motorbikemaster (ranch-style house) instead of position 12 as initially assumed. In this case, position 9 would be the fan of folk and position 4 could be the gothic-revival house, but then we don't have enough information to determine where the reggae fan fits in.
    - Position 7 could also be the bartender (fan of ambient) instead of position 13 as initially assumed. In this case, position 9 would be the mechanic driving the quad-bike and the gothic-revival house would still be in the middle (position 4). This arrangement allows us to place the reggae fan:
        - Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in June, that person must be in position 10 or 11. The only possible position for the June birthday person is position 10 (because the mechanic is already positioned at 7 and can't be the person with a June birthday).
        - Now we know that the librarian is on the left of the person in position 10, so they must be in position 8.
        - Since the motorbikemaster has been moved to position 7 (as a bartender), we can fill the positions as follows:
            - Position 1: subway driver (wooden house)
            - Position 2: snowmobile driver
            - Position 3: mechanic (quad-bike)
            - Position 4: gothic-revival house
            - Position 5: train driver (trance fan)
            - Position 6: unknown position for now
            - Position 7: bartender (ambient fan) or motorbikemaster (ranch-style house)
            - Position 8: librarian
            - Position 9: mechanic (folk fan)
            - Position 10: person with a June birthday
            - Position 11: either the motorbikemaster (if they're the ranch-style house) or an unknown position.
        - We still don't have enough information to determine the exact position of the reggae fan and the motorbikemaster, but we know that the reggae fan is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (position 10 or 11).

In summary, without more information, we can't definitively determine the exact position of the reggae fan. But we know it's either to the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (position 10 or 11), and that person is either a motorbikemaster (ranch-style house) or another unknown person. So, the answer would be **reggae:10 or reggae:11**."	reggae:5	reggae:11	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_8	reggae	7	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down into steps:

1. Assign variables to the people based on their jobs (J), transport (T), music-genres (M), houses (H), and birthdays (B). For example, we can say that J1 = librarian, T1 = motorbike, M1 = trance, H1 = ranch-style, B1 = June.

2. From the given clues, we can make some initial assumptions:
   - The fan of trance (M1) is driving the train (T3), so T3 = J1 or J3 as they are the only ones with trance as their favorite music.
   - The fan of reggae (M5) is the person whose birthday is in September (B4), so B4 = M5.
   - The fan of rock (M2) is the palace house (H4), so H4 = J2 or J4 as they are the only ones with rock as their favorite music.

3. Now, let's try to eliminate some options based on other clues:
   - From clue 10, the librarian (J5) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (B2). Since we know B2 = J3 or J6 from previous assumptions, we can deduce that either J5 is on the left of J3 or J6, and J5 cannot be on the left of both as there are only two sides. This means J5 must be on the right of J3 or J6.
   - From clue 14, the fan of folk (M4) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (T2). Since T2 = J3 or J6 from previous assumptions, we can deduce that either M4 is on the left or right of J3 or J6. As M4 cannot be on both sides of J3 and J6 due to the limited number of sides, M4 must be on the same side as one of them. Since M4 has already been assigned to a position based on clue 9 (far left), it means M4 is on the left of J3 or J6. This also means J5 cannot be on the left of J6 because M4 is on the left and they share a side, so J5 must be on the left of J3.
   - From clue 15, the librarian (J5) is on the left or right of the futuristic house (H5). Since we know H5 from previous assumptions (clue 12), and J5 has already been assigned to a position based on clue 10, it means H5 must be between J3 and J6.
   - From clue 4, the person driving the subway (T4) is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (T5). Since we know T5 from previous assumptions (clue 7), this means T4 must be J1 or J3 as they are the only ones left without assigned transport. As T4 cannot be J1 because T1 and T3 have already been assigned, it means T4 = J3.
   - From clue 6, the architect (J2) is the person whose birthday is in May (B2). Since we already know B2 = J3 or J6 from previous assumptions, it means J2 cannot be either of them and must be one of the remaining options (J1, J4, J5). But since the architect cannot be on the left of the mechanic (clue 11) and the mechanic is assigned to a quad-bike (T7), which we know from clue 7 that T7 = J2, it means J2 must be one of the remaining houses. However, the palace house (H4) has already been assigned, so the only option left for the architect is H1 (wooden house).
   - Now that we have H1, H2, and H5 assigned, the only remaining house is H3. Since H3 must be in the middle based on clue 8, it means H3 = T5 (snowmobile) because all other options for transport have already been assigned. This also means T4 (subway) is to the left of H3, which confirms that J3 drives the subway as we assumed earlier.
   - Finally, from clue 13, the fan of ambient (M3) is the bartender (J4). Since all other options for music-genres have already been assigned, it means M3 = J4.

After assigning all variables based on the given clues and making deductions where possible, we can see that:
   - Reggae (M5) is associated with the person whose birthday is in September (B4), so reggae:B4."	reggae:5	reggae:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_9	reggae	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step and deduce the positions based on the given clues.

1. Identify common elements among each group (transport, music genres, houses, jobs, birthdays). Since there are five in each category and we know 5 unique relationships within each category, we can assign one of these categories as a base to solve for the others. In this case, let's use the ""birthday"" category as our base:

   - June: X (we don't know who this is yet)
   - May: A (since the architect is in May)
   - September: R (since the reggae fan's birthday is in September, so reggae = R)
   - February: Z (unknown)
   - July: Y (unknown)

2. Now let's analyze the transport and music genre relationships:

   - Trance: T (we know the trance fan drives the train, and trains have only one driver, so T = Train)
   - Rock: C (the palace is the fan of rock, so Palace = C)
   - Ambient: B (the bartender is the fan of ambient, so Bartender = B)
   - Folk: F (we know that folk is on the far left and is either on the left or right of various people. We also know it's not R or T, as those are assigned already. Therefore, F cannot be on the right of the motorbike (M), subway (S), snowmobile (Sn), or quad-bike (Q). Let's analyze the options:
       - F is on the left of C (Palace) and can only be leftmost. This contradicts the clue that M, S, Sn, and Q are to the left of F. So F cannot be on the left of C.
       - F is on the left of T (Train), which also contradicts the fact that it's not the leftmost person. Since we already know R and T positions, there's no way for F to be on the left of both R and T simultaneously. Therefore, F cannot be on the left of T either.
       - Now let's consider placing F between T and R:
           * If T is leftmost, then F would be next to T and R, which means neither can be the mechanic or motorbikemaster (M). Since M is already assigned as a house type (Ranch-style), it cannot be F. So in this case, F must be the librarian. However, placing F between T and R violates the rule that F should be either on the left of these people or to their right.
       - Placing F to the right of both T and R results in a similar problem, as it also contradicts the requirement for F to be either on the left or right of T and R.
   - We now know that Folk cannot be placed between Trance and Reggae; instead, it must be on one side. Since Folk is not on the far left (already accounted for by reggae), it must be on the far right. However, placing F on the far right contradicts the clue that it's either on the left or right of M and J (the person who's birthday is in June).
   - Therefore, Folk cannot be placed. This implies an error in the puzzle, as we should have found a position for all categories. However, since the puzzle seems well-structured, let's continue assuming that the error lies with the Folk category and rearrange the other positions accordingly:
       - Since F is on the far left or right of M, J, and S, it means M and J must be to F's left. This implies that C cannot be the motorbikemaster (M), as C is already assigned as a house type. So the only option remaining for M is Quad-Bike (Q). Therefore, Q = Motorbikemaster.
       - With M now known, we can place F to its right: F is on the left or right of J (who has June birthday), so let's try placing it on the left of J for now. This results in a contradiction, as we know that the mechanic (Me) must be next to the quad-bike driver (M). If F was placed on the left of J, then Me cannot be next to M without violating the clue that S is to the left of Sn. Instead, let's try placing F to the right of J:
           * Now we know that F = Folk and F is to the right of J (June). This means that Me (Mechanic) must be between T and F (on the left of F). Since T (Trance) is assigned, this places Me on its right, which contradicts the clue that S is to the left of Sn. Therefore, we should place F to the left of J instead: F < J
       - With F in its correct position now, let's continue placing the remaining people based on their given relationships:
           * Since R (Reggae) is already assigned and we know that S is to the left of Sn, this means S must be on the left side of the line. This also implies that Me (Mechanic) cannot be next to S (Subway), as it should be between T and F. So let's place Sn next to R: Sn < R
           * Now we know that Sn is on the left side, which means that C (Palace) must be on the right side. This also implies that Me cannot be on the right side, so C must be the motorbikemaster (M). Therefore, M = Palace and Sn < R < Me
           * With S and Sn assigned, we now know that Q (Quad-Bike/Motorbikemaster) is to the left of both S and Sn. However, Q should also be on the same side as F, since they share a position relationship (F is either on the left or right of Q). Since we already have S and Sn assigned on the left side, this means that Q must be on the right side. This contradicts the fact that Q should be to the left of S and Sn. Therefore, there seems to be an error in the puzzle, as it is not possible to place everyone correctly based on the given clues.
3. However, let's continue assuming that the error lies with the Folk category and rearrange the other positions accordingly:
   - Since F (Folk) is to the left or right of M (Motorbikemaster), we know that M must be on the far left, so M = Motorbike. This also means that Me (Mechanic) should be next to M, but we already know S (Subway) and Sn (Snowmobile) are on the left side. So let's try placing S and Sn after M:
       - With M placed, this implies that R must be on the opposite side of the line. Since we already have S and Sn assigned to the left side, R must be on the right side. This also means that Me should be next to R (on its right). However, this contradicts the clue that S is to the left of Sn, as placing Me after R would mean that Me is on the right of both S and Sn. Therefore, there seems to be an error in the puzzle.
   - Let's try placing F between M and J: F < M < J
       - With F placed, this means that Me should be next to R (on its left) and S should be on the left side as well. So let's place S and Sn after Me: S < Sn
       - Now we know that R must be on the opposite side of the line, so it's either on the far right or between Q and C. Since Q (Quad-Bike) is already placed on the left side, this means R is on the far right. This also means that C must be on the far left. However, placing C on the far left contradicts the clue that it's either on the left or right of J, as J is already known to be on the opposite side of the line. Therefore, there seems to be an error in the puzzle.
4. Conclusion: The given puzzle seems to have an inconsistency or a missing piece, making it impossible to arrange everyone based on the provided relationships and constraints. It is recommended to review the clues and reconsider the positions of some people to create a solvable puzzle."	reggae:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_reggae_10	reggae	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify common elements among each group (transport, music, jobs, houses, and birthdays). We have 5 unique items in each group.
2. Use the given clues to eliminate possible combinations. For example, from clue 8 we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so we can eliminate it from the other positions for houses (palace, ranch-style, wooden, futuristic).
3. Look for any overlaps between groups. For instance, if we find out who's driving a certain vehicle or living in a specific house, we may be able to determine their music preference, job, and birthday as well.
4. Keep track of the solved variables and use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps.

After following these steps:

- From clue 12, we know the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. We already knew there was only one ranch-style house (clue 5), so now we can say that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house.
- Since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, he/she cannot be on the far left or the librarian (as per clue 9). Also, the librarian is to the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (clue 10), so we know that our motorbikemaster cannot be the person whose birthday is in june.
- Since the reggae fan has a birthday in september (clue 2) and we already placed the motorbikemaster, this means that the reggae fan cannot be the librarian (as per clue 10).
- From clue 4, we know the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike (clue 7), and the motorbikemaster (who lives in the ranch-style house) cannot be the person driving the subway (as per our previous deductions), this leaves only two options for the subway driver: architect or bartender. We can eliminate both of these because they cannot be on the left side (since the mechanic is there). This means that the snowmobile driver is actually the librarian, and the subway driver is the person whose birthday is in june.
- From clue 6 we know that the architect has a birthday in may. Since the motorbikemaster cannot be the architect (as per our previous deductions), this means that the architect must drive the train (since there's only one left). The genre of music preferred by architects is ambient (clue 13).
- From clue 5, we know that the subway driver lives in a wooden house. Now that we know who drives the subway, we can place the wooden house accordingly.
- From clue 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left. Since the motorbikemaster cannot be the person whose birthday is in june (as per our previous deductions) and the librarian is actually the snowmobile driver (as we discovered), this means that only one possibility remains for the person who has a birthday in june: he/she must be the fan of trance. This also implies that the fan of folk cannot be on the left or right of the mechanic or the person whose birthday is in july (as per clues 10 and 11). Since the only remaining options for the folk fan are the motorbike driver, architect, or bartender, we can eliminate them because none of these people have birthdays in June. This leaves us with a contradiction. We need to re-examine our assumptions based on the clues provided.

Unfortunately, there seems to be an inconsistency in the puzzle as it stands, which prevents us from determining the exact position of reggae (or any other variable). It's important to make sure that all clues are consistent and unambiguous when creating logic puzzles like this one."	reggae:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_1	ranch-style	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, we will assign each person a number and try to find their corresponding attributes. We will start by making some assumptions based on the given clues:

1. From clue 7, if the mechanic drives the quad-bike, then the person driving the motorbike cannot be the mechanic (since there are only 5 different means of transport). So, let's assume that the motorbikemaster drives the motorbike and is the ranch-style house.
2. Let's assign numbers to each person based on their birth month: June = 1, May = 2, September = 3, February = 4, July = 5. Since we know that the architect is the person with birthday in May (clue 6), he gets number 2.
3. From clue 8, the gothic-revival house is in the middle, which means it has to be between the first and the third houses in our arrangement (since there are only 5 people). So, let's assign numbers to the remaining houses: Wooden = 1, Gothic-revival = 3, Palace = 4, Futuristic = 5.
4. From clue 9, the fan of folk is on the far left. Since the first house (Wooden) already has someone in it, and we know that the architect is not a fan of folk (clue 13), the fan of folk must be the person with birthday in September (number 3).
5. From clue 10 and 15, the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (either 1 or 2) and also on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since the futuristic house is already assigned to number 5, the possible houses for the librarian are either 1 or 2 (Wooden or Ranch-style). If the librarian were the Wooden house, there would be no room for the person with birthday in June, so the librarian must be the Ranch-style house.
6. From clue 4, the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver, and we know that the quad-bike driver is the mechanic (clue 7). Since there are only two people left to choose from for the subway and snowmobile drivers, and they must be separated by one person (since there are only five houses), let's assign the subway driver to number 4 (Palace house) and the snowmobile driver to number 5 (Futuristic house).
7. From clue 11, the person with birthday in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (number 4). Since we already assigned the mechanic to number 5, the only possible positions for the person with birthday in July are 2 and 3. However, if they were at position 3, there would be no room for the librarian (Ranch-style house), so the person with birthday in July must be at position 2 (Wooden house).
8. From clue 14, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver, which implies that the motorbike driver cannot be the first house (since we already assigned the Wooden house to a person who's not a fan of folk), and also cannot be the last house (since there are only 5 people). So, let's assign the remaining houses to other people: Ambient = 4 (Palace), Rock = 5 (Futuristic).
9. From clue 12, the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, so we already know where it is.
10. Finally, from clue 3, the fan of rock is the palace, which implies that the person with birthday in May (number 2) must be the architect (since we already assigned other jobs to the remaining people).

Now we have all the information needed to determine the final arrangement of people:
- Motorbike driver: Ranch-style house, motorbikemaster
- Subway driver: Palace house, architect
- Snowmobile driver: Futuristic house
- Quad-bike driver: Wooden house, mechanic

So, in our final arrangement, the ranch-style house is on the far left. In the format you requested, **ranch-style:1**."	ranch-style:5	ranch-style:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_2	ranch-style	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and make logical deductions. Here's how I would approach it:

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train. Since there are only three vehicles left (subway, snowmobile, quad-bike), the remaining people can't be driving the train. Therefore, the motorbike master, mechanic, architect, bartender, and librarian aren't driving the train, leaving the fan of trance as the driver.

2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September. Since we know that the fan of trance is not a reggae fan, we can eliminate the person with a birthday in September from being any of motorbike master, mechanic, architect, bartender, and librarian.

3. The fan of rock lives in the palace house. We already know that the fan of trance is not a rock fan (because they drive the train), so we can eliminate the remaining four people from being the palace resident.

4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile and lives in the wooden house. Since we know that neither the fan of trance nor the fan of rock live in the wooden house, the only options for the driver of the subway are motorbike master, mechanic, architect, bartender, or librarian. However, since the driver of the subway can't be the fan of reggae (because that person has a birthday in September), we can eliminate the people with birthdays in June, May, February, and July from being the driver of the subway. This leaves us with only one possibility: the fan of ambient is driving the subway, living in the wooden house, and is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

5. The architect has a birthday in May. Since we already know that the person driving the subway can't be the architect (because they were previously identified as the fan of ambient), the architect must be one of the remaining five people.

6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. We already know that neither the fan of trance nor the fan of reggae are mechanics, so the mechanic can't be the driver of the subway or the train, leaving only the motorbike, snowmobile, and unknown vehicle options. Since we know that the fan of rock lives in the palace house and isn't driving any vehicles, the quad-bike must belong to either the motorbike master, bartender, librarian, or the person with a birthday in February. However, since the person driving the subway can't be the mechanic (because that person was previously identified as the fan of ambient), the quad-bike can't belong to the person with a birthday in February. This leaves us with only one possibility: the mechanic drives the quad-bike.

7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we know that the fan of rock lives in the palace house and isn't driving any vehicles, the gothic-revival house can't be the subway or train station. This leaves us with only three remaining houses: ranch-style, wooden, and futuristic. However, since we already identified the wooden house as the home of the person driving the subway and the fan of ambient, the gothic-revival house can't be the wooden house. Since the palace is a fixed location (the gothic-revival house isn't in the middle), the gothic-revival house can't be the palace either. This leaves us with only one possibility: the gothic-revival house is the ranch-style house.

8. The fan of folk is on the far left and on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we already know that the driver of the subway can't be a folk fan (because they were previously identified as the fan of ambient), the only remaining options for the driver of the motorbike are motorbike master, mechanic, architect, bartender, and librarian. However, since we already know that the mechanic is driving the quad-bike, the motorbike can't be driven by either the mechanic or the person with a birthday in February. This leaves us with only four possibilities for the driver of the motorbike: motorbike master, architect, bartender, and librarian. However, since we already know that the fan of folk can't be on the left of the person with a birthday in June (because the librarian is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in June), the remaining possible drivers for the motorbike are architect and bartender. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, the fan of folk must be on the left of the motorbike (as it's the only available position). This leaves us with only one possibility: the fan of folk is the architect, driving the motorbike and living in the futuristic house.

9. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june and on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we already know that the fan of folk is the architect and lives in the futuristic house, the librarian can't be on the left of the person with a birthday in June (because the architect is on the far left). This leaves us with only one possibility for the librarian's position: the librarian is on the right of the person with a birthday in June.

10. The fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we already know that the fan of folk is the architect and lives in the futuristic house, the bartender can't be the architect or living in the futuristic house. This leaves us with only one possibility for the bartender: the bartender is the fan of ambient and lives in the wooden house, driving the subway and being on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

11. The person with a birthday in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we already know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike and can't be the fan of reggae (because the reggae fan has a birthday in September), the only remaining people for the person with a birthday in July are motorbike master, architect, bartender, and librarian. However, since we already know that the librarian is on the right of the person with a birthday in June, the person with a birthday in July can't be the librarian. This leaves us with only three possibilities for the person with a birthday in July: motorbike master, architect, and bartender. Since we already know that the fan of ambient is the bartender, the person with a birthday in July can't be the bartender. This leaves us with only two possibilities for the person with a birthday in July: motorbike master and architect. However, since we already know that the motorbike master drives the motorbike and can't be on the far left (because the fan of folk is on the far left), the remaining possibility is that the person with a birthday in July is the architect.

12. The motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house. Since we already know that the fan of folk is the architect, driving the motorbike and living in the futuristic house, the only remaining option for the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. This leaves us with only one possibility: the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house.

13. The person with a birthday in June lives in the palace. Since we already know that the fan of folk is the architect and lives in the futuristic house, the gothic-revival house is the ranch-style house, and the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, the only remaining option for the person with a birthday in June is the palace. This leaves us with only one possibility: the person with a birthday in June lives in the palace.

With all these pieces of information combined, we have now solved the puzzle:
- The driver of the subway (fan of ambient) is the bartender and lives in the wooden house.
- The driver of the motorbike (motorbikemaster) lives in the ranch-style house.
- The fan of folk (architect) drives the motorbike and lives in the futuristic house.
- The person with a birthday in June lives in the palace.
- The gothic-revival house is the ranch-style house.

The puzzle can be visualized as follows:
- The wooden house has a subway station (with the fan of ambient, i.e., the bartender).
- The ranch-style house has a motorbike (with the motorbikemaster).
- The futuristic house has a motorbike (with the architect) and is next to the ranch-style house.
- The palace has a person with a birthday in June."	ranch-style:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_3	ranch-style	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a system of equations based on the given clues. Let's assign variables to each person and their respective attributes (X for transport, Y for music genre, Z for house style, W for job, V for birthday month).

1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train: X4 = 'train', Y1 = 'trance'
2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in september: V3 = 'september', Y4 = 'reggae'
3. The fan of rock is the palace house: Z3 = 'palace', Y2 = 'rock'
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile: X1 < X5
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house: Z1 = 'wooden'
6. The architect is the person who's birthday is in may: V2 = 'may', W3 = 'architect'
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic: X5 = 'quad-bike', W4 = 'mechanic'
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle: Z2 = 'gothic-revival', 3 < Z2 < 5
9. The fan of folk is on the far left: X9 = 'motorbike', Y3 = 'folk', X9 < X1, X9 < X5
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june: W1 or W5 = 'librarian', V1 < V6 or V4 < V6
11. The person who's birthday is in julys is on the left or right of the mechanic: V5 = 'july', X1, X3, X5, X7, X9 are neighbors of X6 (if we use a circular arrangement, then X6 is either X1, X3, X5, X7, or X9)
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house: Z4 = 'ranch-style', W1 = 'motorbikemaster'
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender: Y5 = 'ambient', W6 = 'bartender'
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike: X9, X1, X3, X5 are neighbors of X7 (if we use a circular arrangement, then X7 is either X9, X1, X3, X5)
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house: W1 or W5 = 'librarian', Z5 = 'futuristic'

With these equations, we can use logic to find the unique solutions for each variable. However, this puzzle involves a lot of variables and constraints, and finding the exact arrangement might be challenging without using a computer program or other tools to systematically eliminate possibilities.

Nonetheless, I have provided you with the solution for the ranch-style house: **ranch-style:1** since the motorbikemaster (W1) is assigned as the ranch-style house (Z4)."	ranch-style:5	ranch-style:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_4	ranch-style	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2, 3, and 6 we know that September's birthday person (reggae fan) cannot be the architect (May birthday) or the fan of rock (Palace house). So, the reggae fan must be either a transport user or have a job related to those remaining options. Since there is no other information linking reggae with June, May, September, February, or July birthdays, let's consider transport and jobs first.

   - The train driver (trance fan) cannot be the reggae fan because trance and reggae are different genres.
   - Since the subway driver is placed left of the snowmobile driver (point 4), the quad-bike driver (mechanic) must be on the right side, so our mechanic can't be the reggae fan. The only remaining possibility is that the librarian, who can be either left or right of June's birthday person (point 10 and 15), could be the reggae fan.
   - However, since the motorbikemaster (ranch-style house) cannot be the architect (point 6), it means that the ranch-style house can't be on the far left (point 9). This leaves us with only two possible positions for the librarian and thus the reggae fan: to the left or right of June's birthday person. To minimize conflicts, let's assume the librarian is the reggae fan for now.

2. Now that we have assigned reggae to the librarian (September), we can deduce that neither the subway driver nor the wooden house can be September because they are required to be on the left of the librarian (point 5 and 15). This implies that the subway driver must be February, and the wooden house must be July.

3. With the subway driver assigned (February), we know that the snowmobile driver cannot be February since it is stated that the subway driver is left of the snowmobile driver (point 4). So, the snowmobile driver can only be one of the remaining birthdays: May, June, September, or July. Since the reggae fan (September) already has a job, and both May and July are assigned, the snowmobile driver must be either June or February. However, since June is already assigned to the subway driver, it means that February must be the snowmobile driver.

4. Now that we have the snowmobile driver as February, we know that the quad-bike driver (mechanic) cannot be February, which leaves us with only one possibility: May. This also confirms our assumption earlier that the librarian is the reggae fan.

5. With the mechanic assigned as May, the motorbikemaster must be either June or July since they are the remaining birthdays. However, we already have a conflict since the subway driver (June) is placed on the left or right of the mechanic (point 10 and 11). This means that the motorbikemaster must be July, which confirms our assumption that July is on the left or right of the mechanic (point 11).

6. With the motorbikemaster assigned as July, we know that the fan of folk cannot be July because it is stated that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike master (point 14). This means that the fan of folk must be either June or May. Since May is already assigned, it means that the fan of folk is June.

7. With the fan of folk assigned as June, we know that the architect cannot be June because the architect has a May birthday (point 6). This means that the architect must be one of the remaining options: January, March, April, or August. However, since both trance and rock have already been assigned to transport users, ambient can't be associated with either January or March. This leaves us with only two possibilities for the architect: either ambient is April or architect is April.

8. Since ambient can't be April (point 7), it means that the architect must be April. This also confirms our assumption earlier that April is the architect.

9. With the architect assigned as April, we know that the remaining transport users are motorbike and train masters, and both trance and rock have already been assigned to transport users (point 1). This means that motorbikemaster must be trance and trainmaster must be rock.

10. Now that we have all the transport users assigned, we know that the remaining houses are ranch-style, gothic-revival, wooden, palace, and futuristic. Since both reggae (librarian) and folk (June) have already been placed, it means that trance (motorbikemaster) cannot be associated with ranch-style because June is on the left or right of motorbike master (point 14). This leaves us with only one possibility for the motorbikemaster: to the left of June.

11. With the motorbikemaster assigned as the left neighbor of June, we know that the remaining houses are ranch-style, gothic-revival, wooden, palace, and futuristic. Since all transport users have been assigned, it means that the remaining job is bartender (ambient fan). However, since both reggae (librarian) and folk (June) have already been placed, the bartender cannot be on the left or right of reggae or folk (point 13 and 14). This means that the bartender must be either to the left of trance (motorbikemaster), to the right of the person driving the motorbike, or after the futuristic house.

12. Since the bartender cannot be on the left or right of reggae or folk, it means that the bartender must be either to the left of trance (motorbikemaster) or after the futuristic house. However, since both May and July are assigned, we know that neither can be the bartender. This leaves us with only one possibility: the bartender is the last person on the right side.

13. With the bartender assigned as the last person on the right side, we know that the remaining house must be ranch-style because it cannot be on the far left (point 9). This means that the ranch-style house can only be the right neighbor of the bartender.

14. With the ranch-style house assigned as the right neighbor of the bartender, we know that the remaining houses are gothic-revival, wooden, palace, and futuristic. Since the librarian (reggae fan) is already on the left side, it means that the gothic-revival house must be in the middle because it cannot be on the far right or left sides (point 7). This leaves us with only one possibility for the order:

```
Left to Right: librarian (reggae fan), motorbikemaster (trance fan), gothic-revival house, bartender (ambient fan), ranch-style house
```

15. With the final arrangement of people and houses, we have all the necessary information to assign jobs and music preferences to each person:

* Librarian (Reggae fan): April
* Motorbikemaster (Trance fan): July
* Gothic-revival house: Architect
* Bartender (Ambient fan): August
* Ranch-style house: Trainmaster (Rock fan)

This leaves us with one remaining person and preference to assign:

* Palace: May (Rock fan)

So the final arrangement is:

```
Left to Right: librarian (Reggae fan, April), motorbikemaster (Trance fan, July), gothic-revival house (Architect), bartender (Ambient fan, August), ranch-style house (Trainmaster, Rock fan), palace (May, Rock fan)
```

And the final arrangement of music preferences is:

* Reggae
* Trance
* Architect
* Ambient
* Trainmaster
* May
* Rock"	ranch-style:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_5	ranch-style	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will assign each person a number from 1 to 5. We'll work through the clues and try to find consistent assignments for these numbers that satisfy all conditions.

1. Trance fan (Transport): Since the train driver is a trance fan, let's assume Person 1 drives the train (T).
2. Reggae fan (Birthday): Let's assign the birthday in September to Person 5 (S).
3. Rock fan (House): The house that represents rock is the palace (P), so Person 4 must be the one with this job or preference (R).
4. Subway driver position: Since T is on the left of S, we have T < S in terms of their numbers. Also, since P is to the right of S, we have R > S.
5. Subway house (House): The subway house is wooden (W), so let's assign Person 3 with this house (W).
6. May birthday: Since the architect has a may birthday (M), we have Person 2 = M.
7. Quad-bike driver and Mechanic: Since the quad-bike driver is the mechanic, we know that Person 1 (T) cannot be the mechanic, so let's assign Person 4 with this job (Q). This also means T ≠ Q.
8. Gothic-revival position: The gothic-revival house is in the middle, which means Person 5 must have this preference (Gr).
9. Folk fan position (Left): Since the fan of folk is on the far left (F), let's assign Person 1 with this preference (F) since we already know T = F and all remaining positions are filled. This also means F < Q.
10. Librarian and June birthday: The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, but since F is on the far left and we have assigned the June birthday to Person 5 (J), the librarian must be either S or W (L). Since L cannot be on the far left, L > F.
11. July birthday position: The person who's birthday is in july (G) is on the left or right of the mechanic (Q). But we know Q ≠ T and G must be on the same side as L since T < S. So let's place G to the right of Q.
12. Motorbikemaster house: The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (Rh), so Person 5 cannot have this preference, since J = Rh is already assigned. Since the remaining options for R are L and W, we know that R > F (since F is assigned) and R > Gr (since Gr is in the middle).
13. Ambient fan (Job): The fan of ambient is the bartender (A), so Person 4 cannot have this preference since Q is already assigned. So let's assign ambient to Person 3 (A). This also means A > F, A < Gr and A ≠ J.
14. Folk fan position: Since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, we have F < T since T = F. But T is to the right of Gr (T < Gr) so F cannot be to the right of Gr. Therefore, F must be on the left of Gr.
15. Librarian position: Since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, we know that L > F and L ≠ J since F is already assigned. Since there are only two remaining positions, L must be to the right of Gr (since T < Gr and F < Gr).

With these observations in mind, here's one possible solution:
- Transport: motorbike (1), subway (2), train (3), snowmobile (4), quad-bike (5)
- Music-genres: trance (1), rock (4), ambient (3), folk (1), reggae (5)
- House: ranch-style (1), wooden (3), gothic-revival (5), palace (4), futuristic (2)
- Jobs: motorbikemaster (1), mechanic (5), architect (2), bartender (3), librarian (2 or 4)
- Birthdays: june (5), may (2), september (1), february (not specified), july (4 or 5)
With this arrangement, we have ranch-style in position 1, which corresponds to the person who is the motorbikemaster. So the answer is **ranch-style:1**."	ranch-style:5	ranch-style:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_6	ranch-style	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we can connect the transport and music preferences:
    - Trance (train) -> May (architect)
    - Reggae (not used yet) -> September
    - Rock (palace)
    - Motorbike (unassigned)
    - Subway (left of snowmobile, wooden house)
    - Snowmobile (right of subway, unassigned)
    - Quad-bike (mechanic)
    - Ambient (bartender, unassigned)
    - Folk (far left, on the left or right of the motorbike, librarian's neighbor)
    - Unknown (ranch-style house)

2. Connect jobs and houses:
    - Motorbikemaster (ranch-style)
    - Architect (May birthday)
    - Unassigned (gothic-revival, middle)
    - Unassigned (palace, Rock)
    - Subway driver (unassigned)
    - Snowmobile driver (unassigned)
    - Quad-bike driver (mechanic)
    - Ambient fan (bartender, unassigned)
    - Folk fan (librarian's neighbor, on the left or right of motorbike)
    - Unknown (futuristic house)

3. Connect birthdays and positions:
    - June (unassigned)
    - May (architect)
    - September (reggae fan)
    - February (unassigned)
    - July (on the left or right of mechanic, subway neighbor)

4. Using the position relationships from points 1 and 3:
    - Since the folk fan is on the far left, it must be the neighbor of the motorbike driver who also has a birthday in either June or July. This means motorbike can't be September (reggae), and the librarian can't have a birthday in September. Let's assume that the motorbike driver has a birthday in July, so the librarian must have a birthday in June.
    - The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, but we already know the positions for all other houses except the futuristic one. Let's assume the librarian is on the left side of the futuristic house. This means the futuristic house must be between the motorbike and the gothic-revival (since it's in the middle).
    - Since the subway driver is to the left of the snowmobile driver, and the wooden house is the subway, this means the snowmobile can't be at the far right. It must be either on the left side of the futuristic house or between gothic-revival and palace.
    - The mechanic drives the quad-bike. Since there are no position relationships for the remaining houses, we have a cycle for assigning positions from left to right: Subway (wooden) -> Snowmobile (unassigned) -> Gothic-revival (unassigned) -> Palace (rock) -> Futuristic (librarian) -> Ranch-style (motorbikemaster)

5. Now we can place the remaining pieces of information:
    - The fan of ambient is the bartender, so it must be one of the remaining unassigned houses. However, since all other genres are assigned to houses with specific positions, the only possibility for the bartender is the gothic-revival house (as the middle house). This means the architect cannot have trance as their preferred genre.
    - The subway driver has a birthday in either February or July, but we already know that the subway driver (wooden house) is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the librarian has a birthday in June and is to the left of the futuristic house, and the ranch-style (motorbikemaster) is also on the left side of the futuristic house, there's no way to place the subway driver with February or July birthdays without violating position relationships. Therefore, the subway driver must have a birthday in May (architect).
    - Now we can assign the remaining jobs and houses:
        - Ambient fan (gothic-revival) -> architect
        - Reggae fan (September)
        - The only unassigned position is the far right, which can be assigned to either Snowmobile or Quad-bike. However, since the snowmobile cannot be on the far right due to its position relationship with the subway and gothic-revival houses, the quad-bike (mechanic) must be on the far right.
        - Now we can finally place the remaining house (snowmobile), which has no specific position relationships, between the palace and the futuristic house.

6. Finally, here's where everything is placed:
    - Motorbike: July
    - Subway: May
    - Snowmobile: Between Palace and Futuristic houses
    - Quad-bike: Far right
    - Trance fan (Architect)
    - Reggae fan (September)
    - Rock fan (Palace)
    - Librarian: June
    - Folk fan: Left or right of the motorbike
    - Ambient fan: Gothic-revival
    - Ranch-style: Motorbikemaster

7. Since we know the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house, here's the final answer: ranch-style: 4 (counting from left to right)"	ranch-style:5	ranch-style:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_7	ranch-style	6	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a combination of logical reasoning and deductive methods. Here's an organized solution process:

1. Let's denote each person as P1, P2...P5 (in birth month order), and each transport type as T1, T2...T5. We know they are in a row from left to right.

2. From point 11 and 15, we can deduce that P3 (July) is either on the far left or the far right. Since P9 (Folk fan) is on the far left, if P3 were on the far left, P4 (June's birthday person) would have to be on the extreme right (to meet the condition in point 10). But that contradicts point 2 as September's birthday person (Reggae fan) cannot be the first one since we know the folk fan is already on the far left. Therefore, P3 is on the far right.

3. From points 7 and 9, we can deduce that T5 (Quad-bike) is driven by mechanic and placed to the left of T1 (Motorbike). However, if the mechanic (T5 driver) were on the extreme left or far right, the conditions in points 2, 4, 10, and 15 would not be satisfied. Since the mechanic cannot be on the extreme left (due to point 9), he must be somewhere in the middle. This means T1 (Motorbike) is placed at either end of the row.

4. From points 2 and 4, we can deduce that there are two people between the train driver (Trance fan) and the snowmobile driver. Therefore, T3 (Subway) is not in the first or last position; instead, it must be between T1 and T5. Since T1 (Motorbike) cannot be in the middle due to point 3, T3 should be next to T1 on either the left or right side.

5. From points 6 and 8, we can deduce that architect is P2 (May's birthday person), and the Gothic-revival house is between two houses (since it's in the middle). Since there are only four other houses, the gothic-revival house must be next to the futuristic house, which implies the futuristic house cannot be at either end of the row.

6. From points 5 and 12, we can deduce that the ranch-style house (Motorbikemaster) is neither the gothic-revival nor the futuristic house (since the architect and the motorbikemaster are in different positions). Therefore, the ranch-style house must be one of T1, T2, or T4. Since the mechanic cannot drive a motorbike (due to point 7), the ranch-style house is neither T1 nor T5. Thus, the ranch-style house is T4 (Train).

The final arrangement would look like this:

1. Motorbike: T1 (Ranch-style)
2. Architect (May's birthday person)
3. July's birthday person (Mechanic driving Quad-bike, T5)
4. Train (Ranch-style)
5. Wooden house
6. Subway
7. Snowmobile
8. Gothic-revival
9. Folk fan (Reggae fan on the right)
10. Librarian (On the left of the person driving the motorbike, which is T4, making it either T2 or T3)
11. Futuristic house

So **ranch-style: 4**"	ranch-style:5	ranch-style:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_8	ranch-style	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, we can create a table to organize and analyze the information. Here's the completed table with the final answers (assuming there are only 5 people involved):

| Transport | Music-Genre | House Style  | Job           | Birthday Month | Position    |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Motorbike | Folk       | Ranch-style  | Motorbikemaster| June            | Left or Right|
| Subway    | Trance     | Wooden      |               | May            | Left         |
| Train     | Trance     | Palace      | Rock (palace)  |               | Middle       |
| Snowmobile|             | Gothic-revival|               | September (3)   | Right        |
| Quad-bike  | Ambient    | Futuristic  | Librarian      | July           | Right (12)   |

From the table, we can deduce that the ranch-style house is the Motorbikemaster's home. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the motorbikemaster, and the mechanic drives the quad-bike, which is on the right of the librarian, then the ranch-style house is on the left side:

ranch-style: Left"	ranch-style:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_9	ranch-style	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign a person to each transport and music genre, house style, job, and birthday month based on the given clues:

| Transport | Music Genre | House Style | Job       | Birthday Month  |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Motorbike | Trance     | Ranch-style| Motorbikemaster| June            |
| Subway    |            | Wooden      |           |                |
| Train     | Trance     | Gothic-revival|         | September       |
| Snowmobile|            | Palace     | Architect  | May             |
| Quad-bike |            | Futuristic  | Mechanic    | February        |

2. Use the additional clues to fill in the missing information:

* The fan of trance is the person driving the train, so Train = Motorbikemaster.
* The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in september, so Reggae = September.
* Since the fan of rock is the palace house and we have already assigned a job to the Palace house (Snowmobile), it must be that Rock = Snowmobile.
* The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, so Subway = (Position relative to) Motorbike.
* The person driving the subway is the wooden house, so Wooden = Subway.
* The architect is the person who's birthday is in may, so Architect = Snowmobile.
* The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, so Quad-bike = Mechanic.
* The gothic-revival house is in the middle, but since we haven't assigned any houses except for Ranch-style, Wooden, and Futuristic, it must be that Gothic-revival = Train.
* The fan of folk is on the far left, so Folk = (Position relative to) Motorbike or Subway. Since the person driving the subway is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and we know now that Subway = Wooden, the only remaining option for Folk is Motorbike.
* The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, but since June is already assigned to Motorbikemaster (Motorbike), it must be that Librarian = Wooden or Train. Since the position of the librarian relative to Motorbike or Subway was already filled by Folk, and we know now that Folk = Motorbike, the only remaining option for Librarian is Train.
* The fan of ambient is the bartender, so Ambient = Bartender.
* The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but since we know now that Folk = Motorbike, it must be that Folk = Left or Right of Train. However, this information doesn't help us place Train definitively as it is already placed based on other clues.
* The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, but since we have already assigned all the houses except for Futuristic and Ranch-style, it must be that Librarian = Futuristic or Ranch-style. Since we know now that Librarian = Train, this implies that Futuristic = Ranch-style.
* Finally, the position of the futuristic house (Ranch-style) relative to other houses:
  * It is on the left or right of the librarian (Train), so Ranch-style is either on the left or right of Train. Since we know that Train = Gothic-revival and there are no more positions left, it must be that Ranch-style = Left (or Right) of Gothic-revival.

3. Analyze the final positions based on their relative positions to other houses:
   - Wooden (Subway) is on the left of Motorbike (Folk).
   - Train (Gothic-revival) is on the far right, as it is the only remaining house position.
   - Futuristic (Ranch-style) is to the left or right of Train (Gothic-revival), but we don't know its exact position.
   - The positions for Snowmobile (Architect), Quad-bike (Mechanic), and Bartender (Ambient) are filled by their respective jobs, and we can't deduce more about their relative positions based on the clues provided.

In conclusion: We can determine that **ranch-style** is located on the left or right of the gothic-revival house (Train). However, the exact position cannot be determined with the information provided in this logic puzzle."	ranch-style:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_ranch-style_10	ranch-style	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of trance (train driver) cannot be born in September or be on the far left. Since there is only one position for the September-born person, let's assume the train driver is not him. Therefore, the trance fan must be born in June, May, February, or July. But since the librarian (June) cannot be the train driver and is on the left or right of the futuristic house (point 15), the only remaining month for the train driver is May.

2. From point 6, we know that the architect is born in May, so the architect cannot drive the train.

3. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (point 8) and there are five houses, it must be the fourth house from the left or right. The only remaining positions for the other four houses are at the far left and the second, third, and fifth positions. As the ranch-style house was mentioned later as the motorbikemaster's house (point 12), it cannot be the first house.

4. Let's assume the ranch-style house is the second house from the left, then the houses in order are: (1) futuristic, (2) ranch-style, (3) gothic-revival, (4) palace, (5) wooden, and (6) other (either snowmobile or subway).

5. In this arrangement, the mechanic (quad-bike driver from point 7) is on the right of the architect (point 6), so the mechanic cannot be in the fifth position since the only remaining house for the architect is the fourth house. Therefore, the ranch-style house must be the third house from the left.

**ranch-style:3**"	ranch-style:5	ranch-style:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_1	wooden	3	" To solve this logic puzzle, we will organize the information and find connections between different variables. Let's start by making a table to keep track of our findings:

| Variable | Value       | Connections           |
|----------|------------|-----------------------|
| Transport|            |                       |
| Music    |            |                       |
| House    |            |                       |
| Job      |            |                       |
| Birthday |            |                       |
| 1        |            | Trance is train's fan   |
| 2        | September  | Reggae is in Sept.      |
| 3        | Palace    | Rock is palace         |
| 4        | L < S      | Subway left of Snowmobile |
| 5        | Wooden    | Subway = wooden house   |
| 6        | May       | Architect's birthday  |
| 7        | Quad-bike | Quad-bike is mechanic   |
| 8        | Gothic-revival | Middle position      |
| 9        | Far left  | Folk is on far left    |
| 10       | L or R    | Librarian near June   |
| 11       | L or R    | July birth near Mechanic|
| 12       | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster      |
| 13       | Ambient   | Bartender is ambient  |
| 14       | L or R    | Folk near motorbike    |
| 15       | L or R    | Librarian near Futuristic|

From points 2 and 5, we know that the person with a birthday in September uses the wooden house (subway) as their transport.
The exact position of the subway is given by point 4: ""Subway left of Snowmobile"". Let's denote the positions starting from left as P1, P2, ... and assign them to the respective transports. So, we have Subway = P1, Snowmobile = P3 (as it's clear that the quad-bike is on the right of the snowmobile), Motorbike = P4, Train = P5 and Quad-bike (Mechanic) = P6.
Since the architect has a birthday in May and is the Palace house (point 3 and point 6), it must be at position P2 (as Gothic-revival is in the middle). From point 7, we know that the mechanic (Quad-bike) is on the right of Snowmobile (P3), which means Mechanic = P6.
From point 9, the fan of folk is on the far left (position P1 or P2), and from points 14 and 15, we can deduce that the fan of folk cannot be in position P1 because the librarian needs to be either on its left (P2) or right (P3). So, Folk = P2.
Now, let's look at point 10 which states that the librarian is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in June. Since Folk (P2) has already taken the leftmost position, it means that the Librarian must be in position P3 (right of Folk).
From point 11, we know that the person with a birthday in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (P6), but since the librarian (P3) and Folk (P2) have already taken two spots, it means that July's person must be in position P4.
Finally, from point 12 we know that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, which should have been assigned to a position by now; however, no position remains unused, so let's reconsider point 13 and see if it can be adjusted:
""The fan of ambient is the bartender."" - If the bartender was initially placed in P5 (Train), there would not be any free positions for the motorbikemaster. Instead, we can switch the positions of Train and Ambient, placing Train as the Bartender (P4) and Ambient as the Motorbikemaster (P5).
Now our table looks like:

| Variable | Value       | Connections           |
|----------|------------|-----------------------|
| Transport| Train      |                       |

| Job      | Mechanic  | Quad-bike             |
| Birthday | September | Reggae               |
| 1        |            | Trance is train's fan   |
| 2        | September  |                       |
| 3        | Palace    | Rock is palace         |
| 4        | L < S      | Subway left of Snowmobile|
| 5        | Wooden    | Subway                |
| 6        | May       | Architect's birthday  |
| 7        | Quad-bike |                       |
| 8        | Gothic-revival | Middle position      |
| 9        | Far left  | Folk is on far left    |
| 10       | L or R    | Librarian near June   |
| 11       | L or R    | July birth near Mechanic|
| 12       | Ranch-style| Motorbikemaster      |
| 13       | Ambient   | Bartender            |
| 14       | L or R    | Folk near motorbike    |
| 15       | L or R    | Librarian near Futuristic|

As we have assigned all the positions, it is clear that Wooden = P5 (since it's the Subway). So, our final answer in the requested format would be: **wooden:P5**."	wooden:4	wooden:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_2	wooden	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of reggae (September) is not on the far left (because the fan of folk is there). So, the person with September's birthday must be next to or in the middle (since there are only five people and three have been placed). Let's assume they are in the middle (position 3), so our person with a September birthday is the gothic-revival house (point 5).

2. Now that we know the position of the gothic-revival house, we can place the fan of rock (palace) as it cannot be on the far left or in the middle (because points 9 and 14 tell us that folk and the person driving the motorbike are on the far left). So, the palace must be either on the right side of the gothic-revival house or to the right of the third position (since there are only two remaining positions). Let's assume it is in the rightmost position (position 5).

3. Since the motorbikemaster is not the fan of rock (point 4), the motorbikemaster must be on the left side of the gothic-revival house or at position 1, because the palace is in position 5 and the far right is taken by the reggae fan. Let's assume the motorbikemaster is in position 1 (ranch-style house, point 12).

4. From points 4 and 6, we know that the subway driver (position 2) is to the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the motorbikemaster is on the left, and there are only two remaining positions, the subway driver must be in position 2, and the snowmobile driver is in position 4.

5. From point 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. As they cannot be in the far left or middle (because of points 9 and 14), they must be in position 4. However, this creates a problem because the architect is also supposed to be on the left side of June's birthday person (point 6). Since we already placed the motorbikemaster (who is not the architect) on the far left, the only remaining possibility for the architect is in position 1 (wooden house).

6. From points 8 and 15, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle and the futuristic house must be placed next to or on one of the two remaining positions (left or right of the librarian). However, since the architect is already placed on the left side, the only possible placement for the futuristic house is on the far right. But this creates a problem because there are no more people to place on the right side. To resolve this issue, we need to reconsider the position of the architect and move it from position 1 (wooden) to position 4 or 5 (since they must be on the left side). However, doing so would violate point 6 since the architect is now not to the left of June's birthday person.

In conclusion, this logic puzzle has an inconsistency that makes it impossible to accurately place all the elements according to the given rules and constraints. The wooden house's position cannot be determined as a result."	wooden:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_3	wooden	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of reggae (September) and the fan of folk are neighbors. Since there are only 5 people, they must be the first two or the last two in the arrangement. Let's assume the fan of reggae is the first one, which means the fan of folk is the second one.

2. From points 4 and 10, we know that the person driving the subway (who lives in a wooden house) is on the left of someone who's birthday is in June or is the mechanic. Since we already placed the fan of reggae (September), there are only 3 remaining people for the subway driver. Let's assume that the subway driver is the third one, which means the wooden house is also the third house.

3. From points 5 and 6, we know that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house (confirmed above) and the architect is the person who's birthday is in May. Since there are only 4 remaining positions for the architect, let's place the architect as the fourth one.

4. From point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. Since there are only 3 remaining positions (since we placed the wooden house, subway driver, and architect), the motorbikemaster must be the fifth and only remaining person. This means the ranch-style house is also the fifth house.

5. From points 7 and 11, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike and is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in July. Since there are only 2 remaining positions for the mechanic (since we placed the subway driver, architect, and motorbikemaster), the mechanic must be the second one, which means the quad-bike driver is the first one. This leaves the mechanic as the owner of a futuristic house.

6. From point 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (confirmed above). Since there are only 3 remaining positions for the librarian, let's place the librarian as the sixth person. This means the librarian lives in a ranch-style house (since all other houses are occupied).

7. From points 8 and 13, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle (since there are only 5 houses) and the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since there is only 1 remaining position for the gothic-revival house, it must be the fourth house. This means the gothic-revival house is a wooden house (since all other houses are occupied).

8. Finally, from point 3, we know that the fan of rock is the palace house. Since there is only 1 remaining position for the palace house (since we placed the wooden house as the third house), it must be the fifth house. This means the palace house is a ranch-style house (since all other houses are occupied).

With this information, we can now find the positions of each person:

1. The fan of reggae (September) lives in the first position (wooden house).
2. The fan of folk lives in the second position (ranch-style house - unknown job and music genre yet).
3. The subway driver (architect, wooden house) lives in the third position.
4. The motorbikemaster (ranch-style house) lives in the fifth position.
5. The palace house (fan of rock) is a ranch-style house living in the sixth position.
6. The quad-bike driver (mechanic, futuristic house) lives in the first position.
7. The librarian (ranch-style house) lives in the sixth position.
8. The fan of ambient is the bartender (gothic-revival house). Since there are only 3 remaining positions for the gothic-revival house, it must be the fourth house. This means the fan of ambient lives in the middle position (gothic-revival house).

Now let's find out the jobs and music genres:

1. Since the subway driver is the architect and lives in a wooden house (third position), we know that the fan of folk lives in the second position. From point 6, we know that the person who's birthday is in May is an architect. This means the fan of folk is the mechanic (since only 2 jobs remain: librarian and bartender). The music genre of the second person is unknown yet.

2. Since the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (fifth position), we know that the palace house (fan of rock) is the fifth person. From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender. This means the motorbikemaster's job is librarian and their music genre is unknown yet.

3. Since the quad-bike driver is the mechanic (first position), we know that the librarian is the sixth person. Since the fan of reggae lives in the first position, the job and music genre of the first person are unknown yet.

4. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (fourth position) and houses the bartender, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (sixth position). This means the fan of folk lives on the far left (second position), and the remaining person (first position) will be a librarian with an unknown music genre.

5. Finally, since there are only 2 jobs left (librarian and bartender), the first person must be a librarian, making their music genre trance (since the fan of trance is the subway driver - point 1). This completes our solution:

Answer: wooden:3"	wooden:4	wooden:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_4	wooden	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

From 1-3, we can assign the music genres to the houses (trance: train = house5, reggae: september = house4, rock: palace = house3). This leaves us with ambient, folk, and quad-bike for the remaining houses.

From 4, we know that subway is on the left of snowmobile, so house1 (subway) < house2 (snowmobile).

From 5, house1 (subway) is also the wooden house. Now we know that:
- Trance: house5
- Reggae: house4
- Rock: house3
- Wooden: house1

Now let's see what we can deduce from points 6-15:

From 6, the architect is in May. Since rock (architect) is already assigned to a house, this means that either ambient or folk must be the mechanic (who drives the quad-bike).

From 7, the mechanic (ambient or folk) drives the quad-bike, but we know from point 4 that the quad-bike driver is on the right of house5 (train), so ambient or folk can't be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5. This means they must be in house6 or house7, but since we already assigned houses for trance and reggae, house6 can only be folk, and house7 is now known to be ambient (mechanic).

From 8, the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we know the position of 4 out of 5 houses, gothic-revival must be house2 or house4. However, reggae (house4) and quad-bike (ambient/folk, which we know to be in house7) are already placed, so gothic-revival can't be house4. Therefore, it has to be house2.

From 9, the fan of folk is on the far left, but we already assigned folk to house6 (May). This contradicts point 9 since the person driving the motorbike (folk) should be on the far left, but house6 is in the middle now. However, we can deduce that the fan of folk must be on the same side as house6 (May), i.e., either house1 or house2.

From 10 and 15, we know that the librarian is either on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (house6) and the librarian is also on the left or right of the futuristic house (not yet assigned). If the librarian were on the same side as the motorbike driver, it would violate point 9. So, the librarian must be on the opposite side of the motorbike driver (which can only be house2 since house1 is occupied by the wooden house and house3 is the palace). Now we know that the futuristic house is on the left (house1), so it must be the motorbikemaster (ranch-style house, point 12).

From 11 and 14, the person who's birthday is in July is either on the left or right of the mechanic. Since the librarian is now known to be on the opposite side of the motorbike driver, the person who's birthday is in July must be on the same side as the mechanic (which can only be house2 since house1 and house3 are occupied). Therefore, we have:
- Ambient (mechanic) -> house7
- Folk (librarian) -> house1 or house2
- Futuristic (motorbike driver) -> house1

Now we only need to find out the birthday for houses 4 and 5. Since the reggae fan is in September, the remaining months are June, May, February, July, and January. From point 10 and 15, we know that the librarian (Folk) is on the left of the person who's birthday is in june (house6), so house4 must be either June or January. However, there can only be one January left, which means house4 is June. Now we have:
- Trance (train driver) -> house5

Since we already know the positions and assignments for all houses except house2, let's fill in the remaining details for house2:
- It cannot be the fan of rock since it's already assigned to a house (palace).
- It should be on the left or right of the motorbike driver (futuristic house), but we also know that the librarian (folk) is on the same side as house6 (May) and can't be on the same side as the motorbike driver due to point 9.
- It should be on the opposite side of the mechanic (ambient) since the person who's birthday is in July is on the same side as the mechanic.
- It cannot be on the far left since it violates point 9 and also can't be the gothic-revival house since that's already assigned to house2.
- The only remaining option for house2 is to have a birthday in February, which meets all other conditions.

Now we have all the information:
- Trance (train driver) -> house5
- Reggae (September) -> house4
- Rock (architect) -> house3
- Wooden (subway driver) -> house1
- Ambient (mechanic) -> house7
- Folk (librarian) -> house1
- Futuristic (motorbike driver) -> house1
- February (house2)

So, the answer is **wooden: 1**."	wooden:4	wooden:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_5	wooden	3	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a method called ""pairing"" and ""elimination"". First, let's pair up the given information that can help us identify more than one attribute for each person.

1. Trance fan (train driver) -> Train Driver = Person 1
2. Reggae fan (September birthday) -> Person 3
3. Rock fan (Palace house) -> Palace House = Person 5
4. Subway driver is on the left of snowmobile driver -> Subway Driver = Person 2, Snowmobile Driver = Person 4
5. Wooden house = Subway Driver = Person 2
6. May birthday (architect) -> Architect = Person 6
7. Quad-bike driver is mechanic -> Mechanic = Person 7, Quad-bike Driver = Person 8
8. Gothic-revival house is in the middle -> Middle position = Person 4
9. Far left (fan of folk) -> Leftmost position = Person 9 or Person 10
10. Librarian is on the left or right of June birthday person -> Left or Right of Person 10
11. July birthday person is on the left or right of mechanic -> Left or Right of Person 7
12. Motorbikemaster is ranch-style house -> Ranch-style house = Person 10
13. Ambient fan is bartender -> Bartender = Person 11, Ambient fan is Person 11 or Person 12 (since there's no more unassigned attributes)
14. Folk fan is on the left or right of motorbike driver -> Left or Right of Person 10
15. Librarian is on the left or right of futuristic house -> Left or Right of Person 12

Now let's eliminate possibilities based on the remaining information:
- Ambient fan can't be in position 4 (Gothic-revival house), as the Gothic-revival house is already assigned to Person 4. So, Ambient fan = Person 12
- Folk fan can't be in position 7 (mechanic), as it's already assigned to Person 7. Also, folk fan can't be on the right of motorbike driver (Person 10). So, Folk fan = Person 9
- Now we know that Position 10 is Motorbikemaster and Person 12 is Ambient fan, which means Position 11 must be the Folk fan. So, Position 11 = Folk fan (Person 11)
- Since there's only one unassigned position left, it must be the librarian. Librarian can only be on the left or right of the futuristic house. If it was on the left, then it would conflict with the previous eliminations since the only available positions would be 1 and 9 (both taken). So, Librarian = Person 12 (on the right of futuristic house)
- Finally, we can assign the remaining positions based on their jobs:
   - Position 1 (Trance fan) = MotorbikeMaster (Person 10)
   - Position 2 (Reggae fan) = Subway Driver (Wooden house) (Person 2)
   - Position 3 (Reggae fan, September birthday) = Person 3
   - Position 4 (Gothic-revival house) = Snowmobile Driver (Person 4)
   - Position 5 (Rock fan, Palace house) = Person 5
   - Position 6 (May birthday, Architect) = Architect (Person 6)
   - Position 7 (Mechanic, Quad-bike driver) = Mechanic (Person 7)
   - Position 8 (Quad-bike driver) = Person 8 (Librarian)
   - Position 9 (Folk fan, leftmost position) = Folk fan (Person 9)

So, the final positions are:
1. Motorbikemaster (Trance fan)
2. Subway Driver (Reggae fan, Wooden house)
3. Palace House (Rock fan)
4. Snowmobile Driver
5. Gothic-revival house (in the middle)
6. Architect (May birthday)
7. Mechanic (Quad-bike driver)
8. Librarian (July birthday, Futuristic house)
9. Folk fan (leftmost position)
10. Bartender (Ambient fan)

Finally, the answer for **wooden** is: **Wooden: 2**."	wooden:4	wooden:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_6	wooden	3	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's start by assigning variables to each person and their characteristics based on the given clues.

1. Trance fan (T): Motorbike (M), Train driver (Dt)
2. Reggae fan (R): Subway driver (Ds), September birthday (S3)
3. Rock fan (K): Palace house (P)
4. Snowmobile driver (Sm): Position to the right of Ds (Ds+1)
5. Quad-bike driver (Q): Mechanic (Mech)
6. Gothic-revival house (Gr): Middle position (Mid)
7. Subway left neighbor (L): Snowmobile (Sm)
8. House: Wooden (W), Palace (P), Ranch-style (Rs), Futuristic (Ft), Gothic-revival (Gr)
9. Position to the left of Ds and Mech: Folk fan (Fo)
10. Bartender (B): Ambient fan (Am)
11. June birthday (Ju): Left or right of Mech
12. July birthday (Gu): Left or right of Mechanic
13. Motorbike master (Mm): Ranch-style house (Rs)
14. Folk fan (Fo) left or right of M
15. Librarian (L): Left or right of Futuristic (Ft)

Now let's work on solving the puzzle:

From clues 7 and 12, we know that Quad-bike driver = Mechanic and Motorbikemaster = Ranch-style house.

Since Mm is not a subway or snowmobile driver (clue 1), Mm cannot be T, Ds, Sm, Dt, or Q. Since Mm can't be T because the Trance fan is Dt and can't be R or K as they are house types, Mm must be either Fo, Am, Mech (R, Gu, or Ju), L, or Ft. Since Mm is not a house type (clue 8) and Mm cannot be Reggae fan (S3) due to clue 2, Mm can only be Fo, Am, Mech (Gu or Ju), or L.

Given that Folk fan (Fo) must be on the far left (clue 9) and since there are no constraints forbidding it from being Mm (as long as Mm is not in the position to the left of Fo), let's assume that Mm = Fo. Now we know that Mm is the person with a Folk preference, living in the Ranch-style house, and born in either June or July.

Since the Motorbikemaster can't be a house (clue 8), Mm must have another job. The only remaining jobs are Librarian, Bartender, and Subway driver (Ds). Since neither the Librarian nor the Bartender can be on the left of June birthday (clue 10 and 15) and since Fo is already assumed to be Mm, it's not possible for Mm = Librarian or Bartender. Therefore, we can conclude that Mm must be the Subway driver (Ds).

Now let's use this information to solve other clues:

- Since Mm = Ds, Rock fan (K) is the Palace house (P).
- Since K = P and since there are no constraints forbidding it from being Mech, we can assume that Mech = Gu or Ju.
- Since Dt = T, T cannot be R, K, Q, Sm, L, B, Ft, or Gr. So, T must be Fo, Am, Mech (Gu or Ju), L, or W. But since we already assumed that Mm = Fo and Mech can't be a house type, T must be either Am, Gu, Ju, L, or W. Since T cannot be W as it is a house (clue 8), T = Am, Gu, Ju, or L.
- With Ds already assigned to Mm = Fo, the only remaining position for Sm is Ds + 2 since there are no other subway riders. Now we know that Snowmobile driver = Sm = Ds + 2.
- Since Sm = Ds+2 and Subway left neighbor (L) = Sm, L = Ds - 1 = Fo - 1. However, the position to the left of Folk fan (Fo) is occupied by the person with a preference for Trance or Ambient. Given that T is already assigned to Am, L cannot be T. So, let's reconsider our assumption that Mm = Ds and assume that Mm = Ju instead. In this case, L = Sm = Ds - 1, which means L = Fo - 1 again. Since the position to the left of Folk fan (Fo) is occupied by the person with a preference for Trance or Ambient, let's assume that T = Am and L = Fo - 1, who would have a preference for Rock.
- Now that we have assigned values for Mm, L, Ds, Sm, and T, we can proceed to assign other characteristics:
   - Reggae fan (R) is S3.
   - The Gothic-revival house (Gr) is Mid.
   - The Bartender (B) = Am.
   - Since Ambient fan (Am) is already assigned, the remaining job for Am must be Librarian or Bartender. Given that B is already assigned to Am, the Librarian is the only remaining option for Am. So, Am = Librarian.
   - The Quad-bike driver (Q) = Mech.
   - Since both Mm and Q are assigned, there's no other means of transport left for R or Ju. Given that there's no constraint preventing R or Ju from being a snowmobile driver, let's assume that R = Sm. So now we know that Reggae fan (R) is the Snowmobile driver.
   - Since Folk fan (Fo) and Rock fan (K) are already assigned to Mm and P respectively, the remaining job for Fo and K must be Mechanic or Motorbikemaster. Given that Mm = Fo, the only remaining option for Fo is Mechanic. So now we know that Folk fan (Fo) is a Mechanic.
   - With R = Sm already assigned, the Train driver (Dt) must be Ju as Dt can't be R, K, Q, Sm, L, B, Gr, or W (clue 1). So now we know that Trance fan (T) is the June birthday (Ju), who is also a Motorbikemaster.
   - Since T = Ju and since there are no constraints forbidding it from being Mech, we can assume that Mech = Gu or Ju. However, given our previous assumption that Mm = Ju, we now have a conflict because Mm cannot be Mech if Ju is assigned to Mech. To solve this issue, let's reconsider our previous assumption and instead assume that Dt = T and Mm = W. In this case, we know that W is not only the Motorbikemaster but also the June birthday (Ju).
   - With Dt = T and Ju already assigned to W, the only remaining option for Mech is Gu. So now we know that Mechanic (Mech) is the July birthday (Gu).
   - Since Mm = W, L = Fo - 1 = R, Gr is Mid, B = Am, Q = Mech, T = Ju, and all jobs are assigned, there's only one remaining characteristic: the location of the Gothic-revival house (Gr). Since it cannot be a means of transport or a job and since all houses have already been assigned, let's assign Gr as a location such as ""City A.""

Now we have a complete solution to our puzzle:

1. Motorbikemaster/June birthday (W): Gothic-revival house in City A.
2. Snowmobile driver/Reggae fan (R): July birthday (Gu).
3. Subway driver/Folk fan/Mechanic (Mm): June birthday (Ju).
4. Quad-bike driver/Mechanic (Q): July birthday (Gu).
5. Bartender/Ambient fan (B)/Librarian: July birthday (Gu).
6. Train driver/Trance fan (T): June birthday (Ju)."	wooden:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_7	wooden	3	" To solve this puzzle, we'll first try to find out which person represents each characteristic and then arrange them accordingly. Here's my approach:

1. From point 1, the fan of trance drives the train. So, Train = Trance. Let's denote Trance as T.
2. From point 7, the mechanic drives the quad-bike. So, Quad-bike = Mechanic. Let's denote Mechanic as M.
3. From point 12, the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house. So, Ranch-style = Motorbikemaster. Let's denote Motorbikemaster as BM.
4. From points 5 and 6, the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house and has a birthday in May. So, Subway = Wooden (since it must be on the left or right of June). Let's denote Wooden as W.
5. From point 11, the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we already know W has a birthday in July, W = Mechanic (M) follows. This contradicts our initial assumption about W being the subway. Let's consider W as a temporary placeholder for this step.
6. From point 13, the fan of ambient is the bartender. So, Bartender = Ambient. Let's denote Ambient as A.
7. From point 15, the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we don't have enough information yet, let's put this aside for now.
8. From points 4 and 9, the person driving the subway (currently W) is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and the fan of folk is on the far left. If W drives the subway, the only other options are Snowmobile and Motorbike for the leftmost position. Since the mechanic (M) already occupies one of these positions (Quad-bike), the motorbike driver must be the fan of folk. So, Motorbike = Folk. Let's denote Folk as F.
9. From points 2 and 14, the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, and the fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (F). Since we already know that F is on the far left, Reggae must be on the right of F.
10. From point 10, the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. We know from point 6 that this person (May) is also the architect. So, Architect = Librarian. Let's denote Librarian as Lib.
11. From points 3 and 10, the fan of rock lives in the palace house and is on the left or right of June (Architect). Since the architect is a librarian, they must be on the far left. The only remaining options for the palace house are Rock or Folk. However, we've already placed Folk, so Rock must live in the palace.
12. From point 8, the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since there are no more houses left to assign, the Gothic-Revival house is the one we temporarily placed as W (Subway). This means that the subway driver is a person with a birthday in either February or January.
13. From point 15, since we know the librarian's position now, the librarian must be on the opposite side of the futuristic house. Since they can't be in the middle (gothic-revival), the Futuristic house must be either to the left or right of Lib.
14. Now we have enough information to place all houses and people, so let me rearrange them:
    - Leftmost: F (Motorbike)
    - Second from the left: M (Quad-bike), A (Bartender)
    - Middle: W (Subway), Lib (Architect), BM (Ranch-style house)
    - Rightmost: T (Train), R (Reggae), G (Gothic-revival house), C (Caboose)
15. To find the last empty position, we look at point 15 again. Since Lib is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Futuristic), it means that R (Reggae) must be on the opposite side of Futuristic (Caboose). So, Caboose = Reggae.
    - New last position: C (Caboose)

Finally, the answer to your question is **wooden:2**."	wooden:4	wooden:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_8	wooden	3	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down into parts and solve each part step-by-step. We will assign numbers to each person based on their position from left to right. Since we don't know how many people there are yet, we will use variables (e.g., Person A, Person B, etc.)

From the given clues:
1. Trance fan drives the train, so Train = Person A
2. Reggae fan has a birthday in September, so September = Person D
3. Rock fan is the palace house, which is in the middle (Gothic-revival is the middle man since we don't know the number of people yet), so Palace = Person X
4. Subway driver is on the left of snowmobile driver, so Subway < Snowmobile
5. Subway is the wooden house, so Wooden = Subway
6. Architect has a birthday in May, but we don't have enough information to assign it yet.
7. Quad-bike driver is the mechanic, so Quad-bike = Mechanic
8. Gothic-revival house is in the middle (as mentioned earlier), so we know X = Gothic-revival
9. Folk fan is on the far left, so Person 1 = Folk
10. Librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, but we don't have enough information to assign it yet.
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic, but we still don't have enough information.
12. Motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, so Ranch-style = Motorbikemaster (we can't assign it a number yet)
13. Ambient fan is the bartender, but we still don't have enough information to place them.
14. Folk fan is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, so we know that either Person 1 (Folk) < Motorbikemaster or Motorbikemaster < Person 1 (Folk). Since Person 1 is on the far left, it implies that Motorbikemaster > Person 1.
15. Librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, but we still don't have enough information.

At this point, we can't find a unique solution for each variable based on the given clues. To get a complete answer, you would need additional hints or constraints to narrow down the possibilities. Once we have those, we can assign numbers and finally determine the position of Wooden (Subway/Person 5)."	wooden:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_9	wooden	3	" To solve this puzzle, we'll assign a number to each person according to their position from left to right. Let's start by finding some clues that help us determine positions:

1. From clue 4, the person driving the subway (S) is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (SM). Since there are only two people ahead of SM (1 and 2), S can be either 1 or 2. Let's assume S = 1 for now.

2. From clue 5, the subway driver (S) lives in a wooden house (W). We know that the gothic-revival house (GR) is in the middle (position 3), so W cannot be GR or any position to its right. Thus, W must be either 1 or 2.

3. From clue 6, the architect (A) has a birthday in May. Since we've placed S as person 1 and we know that A can't be at positions 4 or more due to only having 5 people, A can only be person 2. Now we have S = 1, W = 1, A = 2.

4. From clue 7, the mechanic (M) drives the quad-bike (Q). Since we know that W = 1 and A = 2, M must drive the snowmobile (SM), which implies M = 3.

5. From clue 10, the librarian (L) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (J). We know that W = 1 and A = 2, so neither can be J. This means L must be either 4 or 5, but since L cannot be 5 due to M being 3, L = 4.

6. From clue 8, the GR house is in the middle (position 3). Since we've placed W as position 1 and found that GR can't be 2 or more, GR must be 3.

7. From clue 9, the fan of folk (F) is on the far left. Since F cannot be 1 due to W = 1, F must be 2.

8. From clue 14, the F can be on either the left or right of M, who drives the motorbike (B). However, since we know that L lives between J and B, F can't be to the left of M. Thus, F is on the right side of M, which means M = 3 and F = 2.

9. From clue 15, the Librarian (L) is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Fu). Since we know that W lives at position 1, W cannot be Fu. Therefore, L must be to the left of Fu, which means L = 4 and Fu = 5.

Now we have placed all the people in their respective positions:
- S (Trance): 1
- W (Wooden house): 1
- A (Architect): 2
- M (Mechanic, driving SM): 3
- F (Folk): 4
- L (Librarian): 4
- B (Motorbike): 5
- J (June birthday): Not specified yet
- Q (Quad-bike): 3 (but was previously represented as SM)
- R (Reggae): 5 (not yet specified as a person, but we know the reggae fan has a birthday in September)
- T (Trance): 1 (already placed as S)
- A (Ambient): Not specified yet
- R (Rock): Not specified yet
- G (Gothic-revival house): 3
- F (Futuristic house): 5

Since we have only placed 6 people out of the 7 given, we still need to find jobs and birthdays for J and A. Let's start by looking at clue 13: The fan of ambient is the bartender (Bt). Since we know that W lives at position 1 and F = 4, Bt can only be person 5, which means Ambient = Rock must also be person 5.

Now we have placed all jobs and genres for all people:
- S (Trance): 1 (Driver)
- W (Wooden house): 1
- A (Architect): 2 (Job)
- M (Mechanic, driving SM): 3 (Driver, also snowmobile)
- F (Folk): 4 (Job)
- L (Librarian): 4
- Bt (Bartender, Ambient): 5 (Job)
- R (Rock): 5 (Job and genre)
- J (June birthday): Not specified yet

Now let's find the missing birthdays:
From clue 11, we know that the person who's birthday is in July (G) is on the left or right of M. Since A can't be G due to already having a defined birthday and since F can't be G for the same reason, G must be either 2 or 4. However, since G cannot be 2 due to W being placed at that position and G cannot be 5 due to Bt being at that position, G = 4.

Now we know that J must have a birthday in May (since A already has a defined birthday) because of clue 6. This means J = 2.

So, the final positions for birthdays are:
- June (J): 2
- May (A): 2
- September (R, Reggae): 5
- February (Not specified yet)
- July (G): 4

Now we know the position of the wooden house (W), which was previously assigned to person 1:
- Wooden: 1."	wooden:4	wooden:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_wooden_10	wooden	3	" Let's solve this step by step:

From point 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the gothic-revival house (5th house) is in the middle, and the subway is the wooden house (5th transport), the snowmobile must be to the right of the subway. Let's denote positions as follows:
1st position: motorbike, trance fan
2nd position: subway, trance fan (also birthday in June)
3rd position: snowmobile, unknown music genre and birthday
4th position: gothic-revival house (position 4 since it's in the middle), rock fan
5th position: palace, rock fan (since it's the palace)
6th position: quad-bike, unknown music genre
7th position: futuristic house, unknown music genre and birthday
8th position: bartender, ambient fan
9th position: librarian, unknown music genre, birthday in July or on the left of the mechanic
10th position: mechanic, quad-bike driver, and unknown music genre
11th position: motorbikemaster, ranch-style house, and folk fan (on the left of June's birthday)
12th position: folklore fan (right of motorbike), unknown music genre, unknown job, and birthday in February.
13th position: architect, May's birthday, and unknown music genre (since it's not rock or reggae).
14th position: folk fan (left or right of the motorbike), unknown music genre, unknown job, and September's birthday (reggae fan)

Since we know the positions of all houses but one (wooden), let's find the other houses first. The ranch-style house is the motorbikemaster (position 11). The mechanic drives the quad-bike (position 10). The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, so they cannot be the wooden house (position 5). So the wooden house must be in position 2, 6, 7, 9, or 12.

From point 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike, which means they cannot be in positions 9 (extreme left) or 12 (next to July's birthday). The only remaining options for the wooden house are positions 2, 6, and 7.

Since we know that the architect is not the fan of rock (position 4) or the fan of reggae (September), the only remaining option for the wooden house is position 6. So:
**wooden: 6**."	wooden:4	wooden:6	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_1	gothic-revival	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify common elements and find their unique combinations. For example, we know that there are 5 houses, 5 music genres, 5 jobs, and 5 birthdays. Let's name the people A to E and their respective properties P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 (for property 1 to 5).

2. From clue 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. Since there are only 5 means of transport and we've identified the mechanic, we can assign the remaining 4 means of transport to the other people: A (motorbike), B (subway), C (snowmobile), D (train).

3. From clue 12, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. Since we've already assigned the motorbike to someone, we can assign the ranch-style house to A.

4. Now let's analyze the houses based on clues 5 and 8. Clue 5 tells us that the subway driver lives in the wooden house. Since we've identified the subway driver as B, the wooden house is for B. Clue 8 tells us that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it must be between the wooden and futuristic houses (as there are only 5 houses).

5. Next, let's analyze the jobs based on clues 6, 10, and 11. Clue 6 tells us that the architect has a birthday in May, so P4 is assigned to A, C, D, or E (as we know B and A have specific houses). Clue 10 tells us that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since we've identified June with A, the librarian cannot be A. Now we can assign the remaining jobs: E (architect), C (bartender), B (librarian), D (mechanic), A (motorbikemaster).

6. Clue 14 tells us that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, which is A. Since we've already assigned all jobs and the only unassigned property for A is P2 (music genre), we can assign Folk to A.

7. Now let's analyze the birthdays based on clues 11, 14, and 15. Clue 11 tells us that the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (D). Since we know the mechanic's position from clue 7, the birthday of July can only be C (snowmobile). Now we have three remaining birthdays: June (A), September (R), and February (F) to assign. Clue 14 tells us that the fan of ambient is the bartender (C), so we can assign the remaining genres: Trance (D), Rock (E), Reggae (R).

8. Finally, let's find the remaining positions based on clues 4, 9, and 13. Clue 4 tells us that the subway driver (B) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (C). Since we know their positions, we can determine the position of the other people: Quad-bike (G), Train (F), Motorbike (A). Clue 9 tells us that the fan of folk (A) is on the far left, so E and D must be on the right. Clue 13 tells us that the fan of ambient (C) is the bartender, which we've already placed. Since there are only two remaining positions for E and D, their order can only be ED.

Now let's find out where gothic-revival is:
Given the arrangement A - B - C - D - E (as per our analysis), since gothic-revival is in the middle, it must be D. So the answer is **gothic-revival:3**."	gothic-revival:3	gothic-revival:3	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_2	gothic-revival	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2, 3, and 6, we know that the fan of reggae (September) is not a house, not a job, and not driving any vehicle. So, the fan of reggae cannot be in the gothic-revival house or have a birthday in September.

2. The fan of rock is the palace house (point 4). Since the fan of reggae isn't the palace, the fan of rock can't be in the reggae position either.

3. From points 9 and 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but not next to the mechanic (who drives the quad-bike). Since the fan of reggae isn't the leftmost person, the fan of folk can't be in the far left position. Therefore, the fan of folk must be on the right of the person driving the motorbike.

4. From points 10 and 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house and the person who's birthday is in June. Since the fan of reggae isn't the librarian, the librarian can't be in the September position (reggae). So, the librarian also can't be on the far left or right because that would put them next to the person with a birthday in July (point 11) or the mechanic (point 7), both of which are fans of reggae. Hence, the only possible position for the librarian is between the futuristic house and the person who's birthday is in June.

5. From points 1 and 6, we know that the trance fan drives the train and has a birthday in May (architect). So, the train driver must be the architect, which means the subway is driven by someone else.

6. Since the mechanic can't be in the September position (reggae) or the July position (point 11), the only remaining position for the mechanic is driving the quad-bike (point 7). That makes the motorbike driver the fan of ambient (point 13).

7. Now we know that the motorbike, train, and quad-bike drivers are the fans of ambient, trance, and folk respectively. The remaining transport options are snowmobile and subway. The only position left for the subway driver is the person driving the snowmobile (point 4).

8. With all vehicles and jobs assigned, we can now assign houses. Since the motorbike master is the ranch-style house (point 12), the palace must be rock (point 4) and the gothic-revival house should be in the middle (point 8), which leaves the wooden house for the remaining transport option, snowmobile.

9. Finally, we know that the fan of reggae is the person with a birthday in February.

Given this information, **gothic-revival:3**."	gothic-revival:3	gothic-revival:3	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_3	gothic-revival	1	" To solve this puzzle, we need to systematically analyze and deduce relationships between different variables. Here's the solution:

1. The fan of trance drives the train (let's label them as T).
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (R).
3. The fan of rock lives in the palace house (P).
4. The person driving the subway is to the left of the snowmobile driver (S1 and S2, S1 < S2). Also, the subway driver lives in a wooden house (W).
5. The architect has a birthday in May (A).
6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (Q and M, Q = M).
7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (G).
8. The fan of folk is on the far left (F).
9. The motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (B).
10. The librarian is either to the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (L, L ≠ J).
11. The person who's birthday is in July (J) is on the left or right of the mechanic (M).
12. The fan of ambient is the bartender (Amb).
13. The fan of folk is to the left or right of the motorbike driver (F ≠ M).
14. The librarian is either to the left or right of the futuristic house (L, L ≠ F).
15. The person who's birthday is in july (J) can't be T as trance fans have a different birthday.

Now let's create an initial layout:
```
 [B] [G] [x]
 [T] [W] [M]
 [L] [P] [F]
 [A] [x] [J]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [Amb] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
```
From 15, J can't be W or P as they are already occupied. Also, it can't be the motorbikemaster (B) because T (trance fan) and B (motorbikemaster) must have different birthdays. So J has to be in one of the remaining positions [x].

Let's place J:
```
 [B] [G] [J]
 [T] [W] [M]
 [L] [P] [F]
 [A] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [Amb] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
```
Now let's place F: since folk fans have a different birthday than J and T, it can't be L (as June is already occupied). So F must be on the far left:
```
 [B] [G] [J]
 [T] [W] [M]
 [L] [P] [F]
 [A] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [Amb] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
```
Now let's place Amb: Since ambient fans have a different birthday than T, F and J, it can't be L or A. So Amb must be on the right of T and F (Amb cannot be M since M is already occupied):
```
 [B] [G] [J]
 [T] [W] [M]
 [L] [P] [F]
 [A] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [Amb] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
```
Now let's place A: Since architects have a different birthday than F, J, and Amb, it can't be on the left of T (as A is already occupied). So A has to be on the right of T (A cannot be M since M is already occupied):
```
 [B] [G] [J]
 [T] [W] [M]
 [L] [P] [F]
 [A] [x] [Amb]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
```
Now let's place Amb again: Since ambient fans have a different birthday than J, T, A and F, it can only be on the right of B (Amb cannot be M since M is already occupied):
```
 [B] [G] [J]
 [T] [W] [M]
 [L] [P] [F]
 [A] [x] [Amb]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
```
Now let's place T: Since trance fans have a different birthday than J, A, Amb and F, it can only be on the left of B (T cannot be M since M is already occupied):
```
 [T] [G] [J]
 [B] [W] [M]
 [L] [P] [F]
 [A] [x] [Amb]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
```
Now let's place L: Since librarians have a different birthday than T, J, A and Amb, it can only be to the left of F or M. However, if L was to the left of M, then T would have no options for placement (as T cannot be M since M is already occupied), which contradicts our previous placement of T. So L must be to the left of F:
```
 [T] [G] [J]
 [B] [W] [M]
 [L] [P] [F]
 [A] [x] [Amb]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
 [x] [x] [x]
```
Now let's place the remaining people and houses:
16. Since L is to the left of F, the remaining position must be the mechanic (M).
17. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (G), the remaining house must be the futuristic house (Fut).
18. Now that we have all houses and people, we can deduce their relationships:
    - The subway driver is in the wooden house (W).
    - The snowmobile driver is next to the subway driver (S2 > S1), which places them between M and J (W, _ , M, J) or (M, W, _, J). Given that the mechanic is already on the leftmost position, it must be (M, W, S1, J) as placing S1 in the middle would leave no space for L to be to the left of F.
    - Since we know the relative positions of subway, snowmobile and mechanic drivers, this gives us the following configuration for L, P, F: (L, _, _ , F). Given that L is already on the leftmost position, it must be (_, L, _, F) as placing L in the middle would leave no space for P to be next to F.
    - The remaining person and house positions can be filled without conflict.

And here's our final configuration:

```
 [T] [G] [J]
 [B] [W] [S1]
 [L] [P] [M]
 [A] [x] [Fut]
 [Amb] [_] [_]
 [_] [_] [_]
 [_] [_] [_]
```

This configuration satisfies all given conditions, and we have successfully placed all people and houses."	gothic-revival:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_4	gothic-revival	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the person who likes Reggae (September) is not on the far left, so they are either in the middle or on the right. Since the fan of Folk is on the far left and cannot be next to the subway driver (reggae), the reggae person must be on the right.
2. From point 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike.
3. From points 4 and 5, we know that the subway driver is not the wooden house (given in point 5) and they are to the left of the snowmobile driver. The only available options for the subway driver now are motorbike, train, and quad-bike, but since the mechanic drives the quad-bike, the subway driver cannot be the mechanic. So, the subway driver must be either the motorbike or train. Since the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (point 12) and can't be the subway driver (given in point 4), the subway driver must be the train.
4. From point 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May. Since the architect isn't the fan of trance (point 1), they can only be wooden, gothic-revival, palace, or futuristic houses. As we have already determined the subway driver is the train and the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, the only remaining options for the architect are gothic-revival, palace, and futuristic.
5. From points 9, 10, 14, and 15, we know that the fan of Folk can't be on the far left (point 9) or to the left of the person who has a birthday in June (points 10 and 15). The only remaining option for the fan of folk is the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since they are not the quad-bike driver (point 7), the fan of folk must be the motorbike or train driver. However, as we have already determined that the train driver can't be the architect (point 4), the fan of folk must be the motorbike driver.
6. From points 11 and 13, we know that the person who has a birthday in July is either on the left or right of the mechanic and the bartender likes ambient music. Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike (point 7), the only remaining option for the bartender is the motorbike driver (as the train driver is the architect). So, the person with a birthday in July is on the left or right of the fan of folk (motorbike driver). As we have already determined that the fan of folk can't be to the left of the person who has a birthday in June, the person with a birthday in July must be on the right of the motorbike driver.
7. Now we know the positions of all transport users except for the snowmobile and quad-bike drivers. The only remaining option for the subway driver is the train since the motorbikemaster can't be the subway driver (point 4). This means that the snowmobile driver must be the mechanic (as the quad-bike driver was already determined to be the mechanic in point 7).
8. Since we know all transport users, we can now determine the houses based on points 2, 3, 6, 12, and 15: The fan of trance lives in the train (point 1), the rock is the palace (point 4), the architect has a birthday in May (point 6), the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (point 12), and the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (point 15).
9. To find the remaining house, gothic-revival, we need to look for an available option that isn't already assigned to any user based on points 3, 6, and 12: Since we know that the train driver is the fan of trance (point 1), the palace is the rock (point 4), and the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (point 12), the only remaining option for the gothic-revival house is the wooden house.

So, **gothic-revival:Not applicable** (since we determined that the gothic-revival cannot be a person, but it can still be a house)."	gothic-revival:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_5	gothic-revival	1	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign each person a variable (A, B, C, D, E) and each category a separate list (Transport, Music, House, Job, BirthdayMonth).

2. Apply the given information to create constraints:
   - Transport: Since there are 5 modes of transport and only one fan of trance drives the train, we know Train = {A}. The remaining transports have unique drivers as well (Motorbike, Subway, Snowmobile, Quad-bike). So, Motorbike = {B}, Subway = {C}, Snowmobile = {D}, Quad-bike = {E}.
   - Music: Similarly, since each person has a unique favorite genre, we can assign the genres to our people (Trance = A, Rock = C, Ambient = L, Folk = D, Reggae = E).
   - House: We know that the palace is a fan of rock, which is house C. We'll find out about the other houses as we go along.
   - Job: Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person with a June birthday and the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, we can't assign jobs to A, B, D, E yet. However, the architect is in May (C), so C is an architect.
   - BirthdayMonth: We now have four people with unique birthdays (June = B, May = C, September = E, July = L).

3. Solve constraints based on the given conditions:
   - Since the subway is to the left of the snowmobile, Subway < Snowmobile => C < D. The fan of rock is the palace (C), so it's not possible for C to be the mechanic or librarian since they can't be the palace. So, Mechanic = B and Librarian = A.
   - Since the person driving the motorbike isn't in January, March, April, or August, Motorbike = {A} (BirthdayMonth = B).
   - Since the fan of folk is on the far left and not in January, February, or December, Folk = A (BirthdayMonth = B) and the person driving the motorbike can't be the mechanic (since Librarian = A). So, Motorbikemaster = E.
   - Since the fan of ambient is the bartender, Ambient = L and Bartender = E.
   - Since the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, Quad-bike = B and Mechanic = B (already assigned).
   - Now we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since there's only one remaining option for the librarian (A) and A is already in June, Librarian must be to the right of FuturisticHouse => A > FuturisticHouse.
   - Since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, Folk = A and Motorbike = E => Folk < Motorbike (which we know isn't possible). However, since they are neighbors, they can be swapped. So let's swap A and E: A = {E}, Librarian = E, Folk = A, Motorbikemaster = B.
   - Now the only possible arrangement for the jobs is: Librarian (A), Bartender (L), Architect (C), Mechanic (B), Motorbikemaster (E).

4. Find the remaining houses:
   - Since the person driving the subway is the wooden house, Subway = C and House(C) = WoodenHouse.
   - Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, we know that GothicRevivalHouse = {G} and there are only two remaining houses (Futuristic and Palace). So, FuturisticHouse = F and PalaceHouse = P.
   - Since the librarian (A) is on the left or right of the futuristic house, A > F => Librarian can't be in the first position, so Librarian is the second person. So, House(A) = WoodenHouse and House(F) = FuturisticHouse.
   - Since there's only one remaining position for the palace (P), House(C) = Palace.
   - Since the motorbikemaster (B) is the ranch-style house, MotorbikeMaster = RanchStyleHouse and House(E) = RanchStyleHouse.
   - Finally, since there's only one position left for the gothic-revival house, House(G) = GothicRevivalHouse.

5. The final arrangement is:

Transport | Music | House  | Job                 | BirthdayMonth
---------|-------|--------|---------------------|--------------
Motorbike| Trance| RanchStyle | Motorbikemaster     | June
Subway   | Rock  | Wooden    | Architect           | May
Train   | Trance| Palace    | Bartender           | Librarian
Snowmobile| Ambient| Gothic-Revival| Mechanic          | September
Quad-bike| Folk   | Futuristic | Librarian           | July

6. The gothic-revival house is in the 4th position, so **gothic-revival: 4**."	gothic-revival:3	gothic-revival:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_6	gothic-revival	1	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down each piece of information and try to find relationships between them. Here's a summary of what we know:

1. Person A (Trance) drives the train.
2. Person E (Reggae) has a birthday in September.
3. Person C (Rock) lives in the palace house.
4. Subway driver is left of Snowmobile driver.
5. The subway driver lives in the wooden house.
6. Architect (May) is not the mechanic, bartender, librarian, or fan of trance.
7. Quad-bike driver is the mechanic.
8. Gothic-revival house is in the middle.
9. Person K (Folk) is on the far left.
10. Motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house.
11. Fan of Ambient (Bartender) has a job related to music genres.
12. The fan of Folk is either left or right of Person M (Motorbike).
13. Librarian is either left or right of the futuristic house.
14. The fan of Ambient is on the left or right of Person M (Motorbike).
15. The librarian is not Person E (Reggae) and not the fan of Folk (Person K).

Now let's start filling in the gaps:

1. Since the subway driver is left of the snowmobile driver, and we know the subway driver lives in the wooden house, the snowmobile driver must live in one of the remaining houses (not the gothic-revival or futuristic house because they are on the ends). Let's assume the snowmobile driver lives in the palace house.
2. Since the architect is not the mechanic, bartender, librarian, or fan of trance, and the mechanic drives the quad-bike, the mechanic cannot be the architect. Therefore, the architect is not the motorbikemaster (since the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house). The only remaining option for the architect is in the gothic-revival house because it's in the middle, and we know the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house.
3. Since Person K (Folk) is on the far left, there must be at least one person to their right. Since the librarian cannot be the fan of Folk or Reggae, she can't be on the extreme right. So the librarian can only be in one of the remaining houses (not the futuristic house because it is on the end).
4. Now we know that the architect lives in the gothic-revival house and the librarian cannot be on the extreme right, so the librarian must be on the left of the futuristic house. Since there's only one empty spot left on the left, the fan of Ambient (Bartender) must live in that spot.
5. Now we know the bartender lives to the left of the futuristic house, and the librarian is left or right of the futuristic house; thus, the librarian cannot be on the extreme left because there's only one empty spot left (and it's taken by the bartender). So, the librarian must be in the second position from the right.
6. Since the fan of Ambient is to the left or right of Person M (Motorbike), and we know the bartender is on the left, Person M must be in the extreme right position, which means Person M drives the motorbike.
7. Now that we know the positions of the Motorbike, Bartender, and Librarian, we can find the remaining two positions for Reggae (September Birthday) and Folk (June or July Birthday). Since the Reggae person is on the left of the folk person, the only possibility is that Person E (Reggae) lives in the second position from the left and Person K (Folk) lives in the extreme right.
8. Lastly, we know the architect lives in the gothic-revival house, so the gothic-revival house is located in the middle of the arrangement.

Answer: **gothic-revival:3**"	gothic-revival:3	gothic-revival:3	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_7	gothic-revival	1	" To solve this puzzle, we will start by establishing some relationships between the given conditions:

1. From point 4 and 10, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the librarian is either on their left or right (point 10), they can't be the snowmobile driver. Also, since the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (point 12) and the librarian must be on its left or right (point 15), neither of them can drive the subway or snowmobile. Therefore, the mechanic drives the quad-bike (point 7).

2. Since the fan of trance is the person driving the train (point 1) and the motorbikemaster can't be a vehicle driver (from the previous conclusion), the train driver must be the architect because they share the same job with the gothic-revival house (point 4).

3. From points 2, 6, and 14, we know that the fan of reggae is in September, the architect's birthday is in May, and the fan of folk must be on their left or right (point 14). This means the reggae fan can't be the folk fan because the reggae fan should be to the right of the folk fan (since the folk fan is in September and the reggae fan is after them). Therefore, the reggae fan must be the bartender.

4. Since the motorbikemaster is not a vehicle driver (from the previous conclusions) and the architect is the train driver, the motorbikemaster must be the librarian because they share the same job with the ranch-style house (point 12).

5. From points 3 and 9, we know that the fan of rock is the palace house (point 4) and the fan of folk must be on the far left (point 9). Since the folk fan can't be the reggae fan, the folk fan must be the subway driver or snowmobile driver. However, since both the quad-bike and train drivers are already determined, there is only one option left for the folk fan: they drive the motorbike.

6. Now we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, the architect is the train driver, the reggae fan is the bartender, the folk fan is the motorbike driver, and the motorbikemaster is the librarian. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (point 8) and we know where the other houses are, the gothic-revival house must be either the third or fourth house. But since the fan of ambient is the bartender (point 13), and the quad-bike driver must be on their left or right (because they are not the architect or librarian), the gothic-revival house can't be in the middle. Therefore, the gothic-revival house is the fourth house.

Answer: **gothic-revival:4**"	gothic-revival:3	gothic-revival:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_8	gothic-revival	1	" To solve this puzzle, we'll create a system to keep track of each characteristic and find patterns that help us assign the missing details. Let's categorize each person by their transport, music genre, job, house style, and birthday month. We will represent each category using letters (A-E for transportation, F-J for genres, K-O for jobs, P-T for houses, U-V for months).

Given information:
1. A1: Trance -> E5: Train
2. J3: Reggae -> U2: September
3. C3: Rock -> P3: Palace
4. Not provided (can't deduce any relationship)
5. C5: Subway -> P2: Wooden
6. K2: Architect -> U1: May
7. G1: Quad-bike -> O1: Mechanic
8. T1: Snowmobile -> Left of G1 (not provided, but known position)
9. F1: Folk -> Q1: Ranch-style (not provided, but known position)
10. Not provided
11. V1: July -> Near O1 (not provided, but known position)
12. Q1: Motorbike -> K3: Motorbikemaster
13. E4: Ambient -> L3: Bartender
14. Not provided
15. Not provided
16. L or R of U3: Librarian (from 10 and 15)
17. L or R of S2: Futuristic house (from 16)

With the given information, we can already deduce that T1: Snowmobile -> Gothic-revival house (since it's in the middle as stated in 8).

So, **Gothic-revival: 1** is the correct answer.

Now let's find other positions and relationships using the remaining constraints:
16. Since Librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (U4), we have:
   - If Futuristic house = S4, then Librarian = R3 or R4
   - If Futuristic house = S3, then Librarian = L2 or L3
   With our existing information, it's impossible for both possibilities to work. Let's try assuming S4 as the futuristic house:
   17. Since the futuristic house is on the right of the librarian (U4), that means P1: Ranch-style can only be L2 or L3. But, since the fan of folk is on the far left (Q1), it's not possible for Q1 to be L2 or L3. So, Futuristic house = S3.
   18. Since Librarian is on the left of U3 (June's birthday person), that means K4: Bartender can only be R2 or R3. However, since the fan of ambient is the bartender (L3), it's not possible for L3 to be R2 or R3 either. This leads us to a contradiction, and our assumption about Futuristic house = S3 doesn't hold true.
   At this point, we have reached a dead-end with our current approach. It seems that some of the given information is inconsistent or contains errors."	gothic-revival:3	gothic-revival:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_9	gothic-revival	1	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign each person/thing a letter from A to E (since we have 5 of each). Let's start with jobs since we know one person's job (the architect is B).
2. Since the fan of trance drives the train, the train driver is not B (6), so let's assume the train driver is D and the mechanic (G) drives the quad-bike. This means A is driving the motorbike, C is the bartender, and E is the librarian.
3. Since the fan of rock is the palace house (E), the people living in wooden (A) and subway (F) houses cannot be fans of rock, leaving only gothic-revival and futuristic as possibilities for C or F. We'll get back to this.
4. The fan of reggae is the person with a birthday in September (E), so we know E's month.
5. Since the architect is B, B cannot be on the left of the person who has a birthday in June (10), and the librarian (E) is on the left or right of the futuristic house (H) (15). This means A, C, or F cannot be on the left of B.
6. The fan of folk is on the far left (9), so A is the fan of folk.
7. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (8), it must be between C and F. However, we don't know their positions yet, so we can't place C or F for now. Let's try to find more information first.
8. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (4). Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike and A drives the motorbike, E must drive the snowmobile. This means F drives the subway, but we don't know their positions yet.
9. The fan of ambient is the bartender (C), so C cannot live in a wooden or gothic-revival house since those are already assigned to A and E, respectively. This leaves only futuristic for C or F. However, we still don't know their positions, so we can't place them yet.
10. The librarian (E) is on the left or right of the person who has a birthday in July (11), but we already placed E's month. This means A, C, or F cannot have a birthday in July.
11. Since the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (A), we can now place people and houses according to the remaining clues:
    - The person driving the motorbike (A) is not on the far left (9), so C or F must be on the far left. This means C drives the subway, and since E drives the snowmobile, F must drive the quad-bike.
    - Since the fan of folk (A) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, A cannot be on the far left, so A is between C and F, with C driving the subway and F driving the quad-bike. This leaves the snowmobile for E.
    - Since the librarian (E) is on the left or right of the person who has a birthday in July, E must be on the left of B (since A, C, and F cannot have a birthday in July).
    - The gothic-revival house (D) is in the middle between C and F. Since C drives the subway and F drives the quad-bike, D can only be between E (snowmobile) and B (train), with A (motorbike) on its left.
    - The fan of ambient is the bartender (C), so C lives in a futuristic house (H).
    - Since the librarian (E) is on the left of B, E must be the wooden house (B) since we already placed E's position.
    - Finally, since the motorbikemaster (A) is the ranch-style house, A lives at position 1. This means C drives the subway, F drives the quad-bike, E drives the snowmobile, and D drives the train.

Answer: gothic-revival:2"	gothic-revival:3	gothic-revival:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_gothic-revival_10	gothic-revival	1	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train. Since there are only 5 means of transport, we can assign them numbers from 1 to 5 (for simplicity, let's say Train = 3).
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, so Birthday[3] = September. Let's denote the corresponding transport number as Transport[3].
3. The fan of rock is the palace house. Since there are only 5 houses, we can assign them numbers from 1 to 5 (for simplicity, let's say Palace = 5).
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, so Subway < Snowmobile. Let's denote Subway as 1 and Snowmobile as 2.
5. The person driving the subway is also the wooden house, so Wooden = 1.
6. The architect has a birthday in May, so Birthday[1] = May and Architect = 1 (Wooden house).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, so Quad-bike = 4 and Mechanic = 4.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it must be either 2 or 4. Since we already assigned two numbers, let's assume Gothic-revival = 2 for now (Snowmobile).
9. The fan of folk is on the far left, which means it should have a smaller number than all other houses except for the one next to it (if it were on the extreme right, it would be larger). Since Architect (Wooden) is already assigned as 1 and Librarian has not been assigned yet, it means Folk must be 9 (extreme left).
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since Birthday[2] = June and Architect (Wooden) = 1, the Librarian cannot be on the same side as Wooden, so it must be on the opposite side. Let's say Librarian = 5 (Palace).
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we assigned Mechanic = 4 and Librarian = 5 (Palace), it means July must be either 1 (Subway) or 2 (Snowmobile). However, since Subway is already assigned, it should not be the case. Let's assume July = 2 (for now, we will adjust it later if necessary).
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since there are only 5 houses left and we have already assigned four, it must be Motorbikemaster = 4 (Quad-bike).
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we haven't assigned any job yet, let's assume Bartender = 3 (Train).
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since Motorbikemaster = 4 (Quad-bike) and Folk = 9 (extreme left), it means there should be another house on the far left. However, we already assigned all houses except for Gothic-revival and Futuristic. Let's adjust July = 1 (Subway) to make room for a new house: Motorbikemaster = 1 (Subway).
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since Librarian = 5 (Palace), it means Futuristic must be either 2 (Snowmobile) or 4 (Quad-bike). However, since we already assigned Snowmobile = 2, it should not be the case. Let's assume Futuristic = 4 (Quad-bike).

At this point, we have a complete assignment for all variables except for Gothic-revival and one of July or July's transport number:
- Transport: [Motorbike, Subway, Train, Snowmobile, Quad-bike]
- Music: [trance, rock, reggae, folk, ambient]
- House: [ranch-style, wooden, palace, gothic-revival, futuristic]
- Job: [motorbikemaster, mechanic, architect, bartender, librarian]
- Birthday: [june, may, september, february, july]

To find the missing Gothic-revival, we need to re-examine our assumptions. Since we assumed July = 2 (Snowmobile) but found that it doesn't fit with the current assignment, let's adjust it back to July = 1 (Subway). Now there is an available transport number for Gothic-revival.

So, we can assign Gothic-revival as Transport[4] since the only remaining transport is Motorbike, which we know is not suitable for gothic-revival due to the previous assumption (Motorbikemaster = 1). Therefore, Gothic-revival:4."	gothic-revival:3	gothic-revival:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_1	palace	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign each person a letter (A-E) based on their birthday month and try to match them with their other characteristics. We know that June is A, May is B, September is C, February is D, and July is E.

2. From point 4, we know that the Subway driver (let's say Person A) is on the left of Snowmobile (Person B). So, person C can't be either A or B because they are the fan of reggae, and since there are only five people, neither A nor B can have September as their birthday.

3. From point 7, we know that Person G is the Mechanic and drives Quad-bike. Since they can't be A (subway), B (snowmobile), C (reggae), or E (July birthday), they must be D (February) or F (unassigned). However, since F is unassigned, Person G must be D.

4. From points 8 and 15, we know that the Gothic-revival house (let's say House G) is in the middle and that the Librarian (Person G) is on the left or right of the Futuristic house (House F). Since Gothic-revival is already assigned to Person D, let's assign House F to H. Now, we know Person G must be on the left side of House F, so G must be Person E (since they are on the left or right of Mechanic).

5. From point 12, we know that the Motorbikemaster is the Ranch-style house (House A). Since both G and H are assigned now, let's assign House A to A.

6. From points 9 and 14, we know that the fan of Folk (Person K) is on the far left and is on the left or right of the person driving the Motorbike (A). Since A is already assigned, and since Person G (February birthday) can't be the fan of folk because they are on the left of House F, let's assign C (September) to K.

7. From point 13, we know that the fan of Ambient is the Bartender (Person B). Since all other houses are assigned now, let's assign Wooden house (House B) to B.

8. Now, we have only two unassigned people: Person F and Person I. From point 10, we know that the Librarian (Person G - E) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (A). Since we already assigned A to June, let's assign F to June. Finally, from point 11, we know that Person I (unassigned) is on the left or right of Mechanic (Person D - February). However, since we already placed them, and there are only two remaining positions, they must be next to each other. Let's assign I to May (since Person F is June), making it Person B (May).

9. Now, let's assign the remaining houses based on their associations with the people: Train driver (Trance) to House C, Rock fan (Palace) to House A, and Subway driver (unassigned) to House E.

10. At this point, we have assigned all five people to their respective houses, so the final arrangement is as follows:

- June: A (Motorbikemaster - Ranch-style house)
- May: B (Mechanic - Wooden house)
- September: C (Reggae fan - Train driver - Subway house)
- February: D (Fan of Folk, Motorcycle master's assistant - Gothic-revival house)
- July: E (Snowmobile driver - Palace house)

So the answer is **Palace:E**."	palace:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_2	palace	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a method called ""Elimination by Process of Elimination"". Let's break down each character based on the given clues:

1. Trance fan drives the train (We know that Train is one of the vehicles)
2. Reggae fan has a birthday in September (We don't have enough information to assign other birthdays yet, so we will come back to this)
3. Rock fan lives in the palace (We know that Palace is one of the houses)
4. Subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile (Let's assume Person A drives the subway and Person B drives the snowmobile. Now we have information about their positions)
5. The subway driver lives in a wooden house (Since we know that Person A drives the subway, this clue helps us confirm that Wooden is one of the houses)
6. Architect has a birthday in May (We know that May has already been assigned to someone with a job, so now we know that Architect cannot be any other person)
7. Quad-bike driver is the mechanic (This also means that Mechanic cannot have any other transport type)
8. Gothic-revival house is in the middle (Since there are 5 houses, this information helps us place one of them)
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (Now we know that either Folk or Motorbike (which hasn't been assigned yet) will be placed at position 1, and the other will be in the middle, given that the Gothic-revival house is in the middle.)
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (Since we know that June has already been assigned to someone with a job, this means that Librarian cannot be any other person)
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (We don't have enough information to assign other birthdays yet, so we will come back to this)
12. Motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (Since we know that Motorbike hasn't been assigned yet, this clue helps us confirm that Ranch-style is one of the houses)
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (This also means that Bartender cannot have any other music genre)
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Given our previous placement of Folk, this implies that either Motorbike or Reggae will be next to it.)
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Since we know that Librarian cannot be any other person, this means that Futuristic can only be in position 5 or 6)

Now let's rearrange our characters based on the clues:
- Reggae fan has a birthday in September (Reggae is already assigned, so we will assign September to it later.)
- The subway driver lives in a wooden house and is on the left of the snowmobile (A drives a Subway, and A < B)
- Architect has a birthday in May (Architect is already assigned, so May is filled.)
- Quad-bike driver is the mechanic (Mechanic is already assigned, so Q drives a Quad-bike.)
- Gothic-revival house is in the middle (So Gothic-revival must be House 3)
- The fan of folk is on the far left and is next to the motorbike driver (Folk will be Person 1, and Motorbike will be Person 2.)
- Librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (Since Mechanic is already placed with June, we know that Librarian must be on the same side of the line as Mechanic. However, it could either be Person 3, 4, 5, or 6 based on the position of Futuristic.)
- The motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (Motorbike is already assigned, so Motorbikemaster will drive a Ranch-style house. Given that it's not Person 1, this leaves Motorbike as Person 4 or 5.)
- The fan of ambient is the bartender (Ambient and Bartender are already assigned, so we don't need to worry about them anymore.)
- The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Given that Motorbike will be either Person 4 or 5, this means that Folk can only be next to it. So Person 3 must be Reggae, and we can assign July as its birthday.)
- The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Since Librarian cannot be any other person, this leaves us with two possible positions for Futuristic: either position 5 or 6. However, since Mechanic is already placed and needs to be on one side of June, we can deduce that the librarian must be in the opposite position of the mechanic. Given that Mechanic is in Position 4, this means Librarian must be in Position 3, leaving us with Futuristic in Position 5 or 6.)

At this point, we don't have enough information to definitively place all characters based on the given clues. However, by making reasonable assumptions and using the process of elimination, we have significantly narrowed down our possibilities. It would take additional information to fully solve this puzzle.

So, without a complete solution, **palace:Num** cannot be determined for certain."	palace:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_3	palace	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down and try to find out each person's characteristics step by step.

1. We know the fan of trance drives the train. Let's call this person T (Trance).
2. The fan of reggae is born in September.
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, so let's call this person P (Palace).
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Let's say S (Subway) is on the left, and W (Winter) is on the right.
5. The person driving the subway lives in the wooden house. So, S = W.
6. The architect is born in May, so we can call this person A (Architect).
7. The mechanic drives the quad-bike.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left, which should be the fan of trance (T), as the only one left.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since T already occupies that position, let's say L (Librarian) is on the right side.
11. The person born in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. However, since all positions are already taken, it seems there might be a contradiction here, so we can rule out any new information from this clue.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, so T (Trance) must be next to F (Folk). Since there's only one empty position left, that means F is on the far right, and T is in the middle.
15. Finally, since the librarian L is on the right side of the person who's birthday is in june (T), it means L must be next to F. Now we have: T-F-L.

Putting everything together, here are our 5 people and their characteristics:
- Trance (T) - fan of trance, drives the train, born in June, librarian or bartender
- Folk (F) - fan of folk, on the far right, born in September, bartender
- Wooden house (W) - subway driver, living in a wooden house
- Architect (A) - architect, born in May
- Mechanic (M) - mechanic, drives the quad-bike

With the information provided, we cannot identify the exact job or birthday for T, but we know it must be either librarian or bartender and June is one of the possible months. The order from left to right based on their houses is: W, A, T, F, M (subway - architect - trance/librarian/bartender - folk - mechanic). Since we can't determine the exact position for T, we can only say that the palace house P (person who likes rock music) is in one of these positions.

Answer: palace: undefined (since we cannot pinpoint its exact location based on this information)"	palace:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_4	palace	6	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train, so we can assign trance to Train.
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, but we don't have any variables assigned to September yet, so let's make reggae = September.
3. The fan of rock is the palace house. Let's assign Rock to Palace for now.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, but we don't have any variables assigned to them yet. So let's represent Subway as A and Snowmobile as B. Since A is on the left of B, we can write this relationship as: A < B
5. The person driving the subway lives in the wooden house, so we assign Wooden to Subway (A).
6. The architect has a birthday in May, so we assign Architect to May.
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since Mechanic hasn't been assigned yet, let's make Quad-bike = Mechanic for now.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we don't have any variables assigned to other houses, this information doesn't help us at the moment.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. We know that the person who loves folk hasn't been placed yet, so let's make Folk = Far-Left for now.
10. The librarian is either on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we don't have variables assigned to librarian and June's person yet, this doesn't help us at the moment.
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we don't have any variable assigned to July's person yet, this doesn't help us at the moment.
12. The motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house. Let's assign Ranch-style to MotorbikeMaster for now.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we don't have any variable assigned to Bartender yet, this doesn't help us at the moment.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we don't have variables assigned to Motorbike or Folk yet, this doesn't help us at the moment.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we don't have any variable assigned to Librarian or Futuristic house yet, this doesn't help us at the moment.

Now let's try to find a relationship that can help us assign more variables:

- From 4 and 5, we know that A (subway) < B (snowmobile). Since they are means of transport and there is only one person driving each, this implies that the driver of Subway (A) cannot be the same as the driver of Snowmobile (B).
- Since the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, we know that September isn't May or June. This means that the person who loves reggae can't have a birthday in May or June.
- From 10 and 15, we know that the librarian can't be on the left of the person who has a birthday in June if the person with June's birthday is on the far left (Folk). This means that the librarian must be on the right of the person who has a birthday in June.
- From 11, we know that July's person can't be on the left of Mechanic because Quad-bike (Mechanic) hasn't been placed yet. This means that July's person must be on the right of Mechanic.
- Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, we know that it can't be the ranch-style house (MotorbikeMaster), wooden house (Subway), or futuristic house (Librarian) because those houses have been placed on the left and right sides. This means that the gothic-revival house must be either Palace, Quad-bike, or Far-Left. However, we already assigned Palace to Rock, so it can't be Palace.

Now let's try to assign more variables using the remaining information:

- Since the fan of reggae has a birthday in September and it can't be May or June, it must be either February, July, or another month. However, from 11 we know that July's person must be on the right of Mechanic, which means that Reggae cannot be July. This leaves us with only February as an option for Reggae.
- From 9, since Folk is on the far left and it can't be May or June, it must be either January, February, or another month. However, from our previous reasoning we know that Reggae is February. This means that Folk cannot be February, so it must be either January, March, April, May, June, July, or another month.
- Since the librarian is on the right of the person who has a birthday in June, and since June can't be Far-Left (Folk), this means that Librarian must be on the left of Far-Left (Folk). This also means that Librarian cannot be July because we know from 11 that July's person is on the right of Mechanic. So, Librarian must be either January, February, March, April, May, or another month.

Unfortunately, we have reached a point where we don't have enough information to uniquely determine the positions and identities of all people based on the given clues. We would need additional information to solve this puzzle completely.

However, we can still give you the location of Palace: Palace cannot be the wooden house (Subway) or the futuristic house (Librarian), so it must be either the ranch-style house (MotorbikeMaster) or the gothic-revival house (which is in the middle). Since we already assigned Ranch-style to MotorbikeMaster, Palace must be Gothic-Revival. So, Palace:Gothic-Revival."	palace:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_5	palace	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2 and 10, we know that the fan of reggae (born in September) is not on the left of the person who's birthday is in June. So, the reggae fan must be either right of the June-born person or in a different row. Let's assume he's in a different row (Row 2) for now.

2. From points 6 and 15, we know that the architect (born in May) is not on the left of the futuristic house. So, the architect must be either right of the futuristic house or in a different row. Let's assume he's in a different row (Row 3) for now.

3. From points 4 and 5, we know that the person driving the subway is not the wooden house (since the subway driver is the wooden house according to point 5). This means the subway driver must be in a different row. Let's assume he's in Row 1 for now.

4. From points 9 and 14, we know that the fan of folk (on the far left) is not on the left of the person driving the motorbike. So, the folk fan must be either right of the motorbike driver or in a different row. Since the trance fan drives the train, which cannot be next to the motorbike according to point 1, the folk fan can't be in Row 1 (with the subway). Let's assume he's in Row 2 for now.

5. From points 8 and 14, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle of the rows. Since there are 6 people, this means the gothic-revival house cannot be in Row 1 or Row 3 (since there's only one person in each of those rows so far). So, let's assume it's in Row 2.

6. From points 7 and 12, we know that the quad-bike is driven by the mechanic. Since the subway driver can't be in Row 1 (where the mechanic would be according to point 7), the quad-bike must be in a different row. Let's assume it's in Row 3 for now.

7. Now let's analyze Row 2: It contains the fan of reggae, the architect, and the fan of folk (in that order). The only remaining transport, music-genre, job, or house left for this row is ambient (since trance is taken by the train driver, rock by the palace, and we assumed gothic-revival and futuristic are already in place). So let's assign bartender (who serves ambient music) to Row 2.

8. Now let's analyze Row 1: It contains the subway driver, the fan of trance (train driver), and a house. Since we assigned the subway to Row 1 in step 3, it means the train driver must be the wooden house, which is already taken. So the only remaining option for this row is the motorbike (since we assumed the mechanic and quad-bike are in different rows).

9. Now let's analyze Row 3: It contains the fan of rock (palace), the quad-bike (mechanic), and the librarian (who is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in July according to point 11). Since we assumed the mechanic is in this row, it means the July-born person must be next to the librarian. The only remaining birthday months are February and January, but since the reggae fan (September) is already assigned, the remaining people must have birthdays in different months from September, February, and July. So let's assign the librarian to this row (February). This leaves July for the person on the left or right of the mechanic, fulfilling condition 11.

10. Finally, since we assigned the bartender, librarian, motorbike master, and architect already, the remaining job must be the mechanic. So let's assign the mechanic to Row 3 (on the quad-bike), as we assumed in step 6. This leaves May for the June-born person according to condition 10, fulfilling it.

Now we have filled all rows:
Row 1: Motorbike(Motorbikemaster) - Subway(Wooden house) - Train(Trance fan)
Row 2: Bartender(Ambient fan) - Architect(May-born person) - Reggae fan (September-born person)
Row 3: Quad-bike(Mechanic) - Librarian(February-born person) - Palace(Rock fan)

To find the location of the palace, we look at Row 3 and see that the palace is the person with the job ""architect"" (since we know the architect is in Row 3). So **Palace:3**"	palace:2	palace:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_6	palace	6	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a combination of logic and deduction. Here's how I approached it:

1. First, let's find out who's driving which vehicle (this will help us determine their occupation and house type):
- From point 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Let's assign them positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Since the architect is in May and not the subway or snowmobile driver (from points 5 and 6), they must be driving the quad-bike (position 3, as the mechanic is the quad-bike driver from point 7).
- From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since the ambient fan can't be in position 2 or 3 (the bartender must be next to someone), and they are not the subway driver (as they wouldn't be rock fans), they must be driving the motorbike (position 4).
- From point 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left. Since they can't be in position 2 or 3 (the folklore fan must be before the mechanic and quad-bike driver), they are driving the train (position 5).
- Point 12 tells us that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, which leaves positions 6 and 8 for the snowmobile and train drivers. The only remaining option for the snowmobile driver is position 6 as the palace can't be in position 7 (from point 5, it's not a wooden house), and there are no other houses left.
- Point 15 tells us that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, but we already know the location of the motorbikemaster (ranch-style house), so the librarian must be the snowmobile driver in position 6, and the futuristic house should be position 10.

Now that we've placed everyone in their respective positions, let's find out their houses:
- From point 2, we know the reggae fan is born in September. Since the only available option is position 8 (gothic-revival house), it means that the palace must be in position 14, as there are no other options left for the gothic-revival house.
- From point 5, we know the palace is a wooden house, which contradicts our previous conclusion that it's the palace house (from point 4). However, since the only remaining option for the wooden house is position 12 (ranch-style house), this means that our initial placement of the motorbikemaster was incorrect. The correct answer would be: **palace:14**."	palace:2	palace:14	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_7	palace	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will use a systemic approach to find the relationships between the different variables and assign them accordingly.

1. Trance fan drives the train (we don't know positions yet)
2. Reggae fan is born in September (We don't know occupation or position either)
3. Rock is the palace house (House assignments are still unknown)
4. Subway driver is on the left of Snowmobile driver (Positions not known)
5. Subway driver is the wooden house (Houses assigned: 1-Subway, 2-Wooden)
6. Architect is born in May (We don't know occupation or position yet)
7. Quad-bike driver is the mechanic (Still unknown positions and occupation)
8. Gothic-revival house is in the middle (So far we have 1,2,3,X,4)
9. Folk fan is on the far left (We don't know who yet, but they will be to the left of motorbike driver)
10. Librarian is on the left or right of June birthday person (Still unknown positions and occupation)
11. July birthday person is on the left or right of mechanic (Still unknown occupation and position)
12. Motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (Houses assigned: 5-Motorbike, 4-Ranch, X,6,3)
13. Ambient fan is the bartender (We don't know who yet)
14. Folk fan is on the left or right of motorbike driver (Know that folk fan is to the far left, so they must be one of the two on the left of the motorbike driver)
15. Librarian is on the left or right of futuristic house (Still unknown occupation and position)

At this point, we have some information:
- We know that trance, rock, ambient, folk, reggae are assigned to occupations.
- We also know that each person has a different birthday month.
- Some of the houses are assigned (Subway, Wooden, Motorbike, Ranch) but not their respective occupants.
- The positions of most people are still unknown.

Let's solve this step by step:
- Since folk fan is on the far left and must be to the left of motorbike driver, we can assign the motorbike driver as the 4th person in the row. Let's place Folk as the first person (1). So now we have the 2nd position for Reggae or Trance, and the 3rd position for Rock, Ambient or Mechanic.
- Since reggae is born in September and we know that each month has a unique birthday, Reggae must be the 4th person (4). So now we have the 1st position for Trance.
- As Rock is the palace house, it means the palace owner is the rock fan (3). Now the row looks like this: 1-Folk, 2-Trance, 3-Rock, 4-Reggae.
- Now we know that Trance drives the train, so Trance must be in position 5 to be driving the subway since it's assigned as number 1. In this case, the wooden house is the Quad-bike driver (7). So our row now looks like: 1-Quad-bike(Mechanic), 2-Trance(Subway), 3-Rock(Palace), 4-Reggae(Birthday in September)
- We know that the Snowmobile driver must be to the right of Trance, as Trance is driving the subway and on the left of snowmobile. Since Gothic-revival is in the middle, we can assume that the snowmobile driver will take position 6 (Snowmobile).
- The librarian must be in a position adjacent to June birthday person or to the futuristic house (as the latter is unknown yet), so let's assign the librarian as the 7th person. If the Futuristic house has an unassigned birth month, then the librarian will take that spot.
- Now we have two open positions for the remaining two occupations: Ambient and Mechanic. Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike, it must be in one of the open spots. If we place the Mechanic (Quad-Bike driver) as the 8th person, then the Ambient fan would be the last person (9), so we now have: 1-Quad-bike(Mechanic), 2-Trance(Subway), 3-Rock(Palace), 4-Reggae(Birthday in September), 6-Snowmobile, 7-Librarian, 8-Mechanic, and 9-Ambient.
- Finally, since the Gothic-revival house is in the middle of the row, it must be between the positions 3 (Rock) and 5 (Trance). But we cannot place it directly between them because Rock occupies position 3 and Trance occupies position 5. If we place the Gothic-revival house before Rock, then Reggae has already taken the 4th position, leaving no space for it to be in the middle as required. Therefore, the only possible solution is to place Gothic-revival after Trance (in position 6), which means the Futuristic house will take the last spot with an unknown birth month.

In conclusion:
- The Palace is in the 3rd position (Palace: 3)"	palace:2	palace:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_8	palace	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's first assign letters to the people based on their transport (T for train, R for rock, etc.) and birth months (J for June, M for May, F for February, S for September, G for July). Then, we can try to place them according to the given conditions.

From condition 1: T is the fan of trance, so let's place T as Trance in the transport lineup. Since the fans of rock and ambient are not yet placed, we cannot determine their positions relative to T.

Condition 2 tells us that the fan of reggae (R) has a birthday in September, so let's place R as Reggae in the lineup. As we don't have information about other music genres yet, we can only make assumptions about their placement. For now, let's assume that the fan of rock is on the right side of R (R-x-Trance), and the fan of ambient (A) is on the left side (x-A-Trance).

Condition 4 tells us that the person driving the subway (S) is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (Sm). Since we already have R and Trance in the lineup, let's place S as Subway. This means Sm must be on the right side of both R and Trance.

Condition 5 tells us that the wooden house belongs to the subway driver. We already placed S as Subway, so the wooden house (W) is on our list of undetermined people. Let's place W as Wooden in the lineup, assuming it is between R and Trance, i.e., R-x-W-Trance.

Condition 6 tells us that the architect (A) has a birthday in May, so we can now place A as Architect in the lineup. From condition 10, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (J). Since J is not yet placed, let's assume for now that L (Librarian) is on the left side of W-Trance.

Condition 7 tells us that the mechanic (M) drives the quad-bike (Q), so we can place M as Mechanic in the lineup and Q at the end of the lineup, i.e., R-x-W-Trance-A-L-Q.

At this point, we have placed 7 people out of 9, and we still need to find the remaining houses (gothic-revival, palace, futuristic) and a job (bartender). Since condition 8 tells us that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, it must be between W and Trance. Condition 12 gives us some information about the motorbikemaster (Mt), so let's place Mt as Ranch-style at this point, i.e., R-x-(Gothic-revival)-Trance-A-L-Q-Mt.

Condition 13 tells us that the bartender (B) is a fan of ambient (A), but we already placed A in our lineup. So, we cannot determine B's position yet. However, from condition 14, we know that the fan of folk (Folk) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Mt). Since Folk isn't yet placed, we can assume that Folk is on the far left and Mt is next to it. This means that our lineup now looks like this: R-x-(Gothic-revival)-Trance-A-L-Q-Folk-Mt.

Finally, condition 15 tells us that the librarian (L) is on the left or right of the futuristic house (F). Since we already placed L to the left of W and F isn't yet placed, it must be to the right of Q-Folk-Mt. This means our final lineup looks like this: R-x-(Gothic-revival)-Trance-A-L-Q-Folk-Mt-F.

Now, let's determine where the palace (P) is placed according to condition 4, which tells us that it's a rock fan. Since we have already placed Trance and R in our lineup, P can only be Rock if it comes before or after Trance. In this case, since the librarian (L) is on the left side of Trance, there is no space for P between L and Trance. Therefore, P must be placed to the right of Trance, i.e., R-x-(P)-Trance.

After rearranging the lineup based on our findings:

1. Ranch-style house: motorbikemaster (Mt)
2. Gothic-revival house: unknown
3. Wooden house: subway driver (S)
4. Palace: rock fan (P)
5. Futuristic house: librarian (L) or bartender (B)
6. Quad-bike driver: mechanic (M)
7. Train driver: trance fan (T)
8. Left of train driver: reggae fan (R)
9. Ambient fan (A): unknown
10. Bartender (B) or librarian (L): futuristic house
11. Librarian (L) or bartender (B): on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June
12. Person who's birthday is in July: on the left or right of the mechanic (M)
13. Folk fan (Folk): on the far left
14. Person driving the motorbike (Mt): folk fan (Folk)
15. The fan of ambient (A) and the person who's birthday is in june (J) are still unknown

Unfortunately, we cannot determine the exact positions of some people based on the given information, but we can place the palace between R and Trance. So, the answer is **Palace: 2**."	palace:2	palace:2	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_9	palace	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's approach it step by step:

1. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September. Let's assign numbers to the people according to their birthdays: A (June), B (May), C (September - Reggae), D (February), E (July).

2. From point 7, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since the mechanic has a birthday in a different month than C (Reggae), the mechanic cannot be C, so the mechanic must be A, B, D, or E. If the mechanic were A, then who would drive the quad-bike? But point 12 says the ranch-style house is the motorbikemaster, which contradicts our assumption that A is the mechanic. So, the mechanic cannot be A. The same logic applies to B and E. Therefore, D must be the mechanic (Quad-bike).

3. From point 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May. Since the architect cannot be C, the architect cannot have a birthday in September. Since the architect cannot be D (Mechanic), the architect cannot have a birthday in July. So, the architect must be B (left open).

4. From points 5 and 12, we know that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house or is the motorbikemaster. Since the motorbikemaster cannot be C (Reggae), the motorbikemaster cannot live in a wooden house or have a birthday in September. So, the motorbikemaster must be A, B, or D. But point 4 says the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since we know that C (Reggae) drives the train and C has a birthday in September, and since C cannot live in a wooden house or have a birthday in July, C cannot be the subway driver. So, A or D must be the subway driver. But point 14 says the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, so if D were the subway driver, then the fan of folk would have to be B (Mechanic). However, this contradicts our assumption from step 2 that D is the mechanic. Therefore, A must be the subway driver (Wooden house or Ranch-style).

5. From points 10 and 15, we know that the librarian lives on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (A) and also on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since A cannot be the mechanic (Quad-bike), A cannot be the architect (not assigned yet). So, A must be either the bartender or the motorbikemaster (since these two are not assigned as the librarian). However, this contradicts our assumption from step 4 that A is the subway driver. Therefore, A cannot be the librarian.

6. From points 9 and 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left and is also on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since A cannot be the librarian (Far left contradicts with point 5), B (Architect) must be the fan of folk.

7. From points 1, 4, and 10, we know that the fan of trance drives the train (C), the person driving the subway is A or D, and the librarian lives on the left or right of A. Since B (Architect - Folk) has been assigned and cannot be the librarian (left or right of A), C (Reggae) must be the librarian (since the only remaining people are A and D).

8. From points 3, 6, and 13, we know that B (Architect - Folk) has a birthday in May, E has a birthday in July, and the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since A (Subway or unassigned) cannot be the mechanic or motorbikemaster, A must be either the bartender (Ambient) or the librarian (Reggae). However, this contradicts our assumption from step 7 that C (Librarian - Reggae) is the person driving the train. Therefore, A cannot be the bartender (Ambient). So, E (July) must be the bartender.

9. From points 11 and 8, we know that E (Bartender) is on the left or right of D (Mechanic - Quad-bike). Since D cannot live in a wooden house or have a birthday in July, D cannot be the subway driver (Wooden house contradicts with point 4 and July birthday contradicts with point 8). Therefore, A must be the subway driver.

10. Now we know that A is the subway driver, C is the librarian, B is the architect, E is the bartender, and D is the mechanic. From points 12, 15, and our previous deductions, we can assign the remaining houses and jobs:
   - Since A (Subway) cannot be the motorbikemaster (Ranch-style), A must be the librarian (Reggae). This means that the motorbikemaster is E (Bartender - Ambient). So, the ranch-style house is the futuristic house.
   - Since C (Librarian - Trance) cannot live in a wooden house or have a birthday in July, C cannot be the bartender. Therefore, C must be the motorbikemaster (Ranch-style). This means that the train driver is D (Mechanic - Quad-bike). So, the gothic-revival house is the palace.
   - Since B (Architect - Folk) cannot live in a wooden house or have a birthday in September, B cannot be the mechanic or librarian. Therefore, B must be the architect. This means that the wooden house is unassigned.

Therefore, the final arrangement is as follows:
- Transport: Motorbike (C - Librarian), Subway (A - Reggae), Train (D - Mechanic), Snowmobile (left open), Quad-bike (E - Bartender)
- Music Genres: Trance (C - Librarian), Rock (Palace), Ambient (E - Bartender), Folk (B - Architect), Reggae (A - Subway)
- Houses: Ranch-style (C - Librarian, Motorbike), Wooden (left open), Gothic-revival (Palace), Palace, Futuristic (E - Bartender, Quad-bike)
- Jobs: Architect (B - Folk), Mechanic (D - Quad-bike), Bartender (E - Ambient), Librarian (A - Reggae, Subway), Motorbikemaster (C - Trance, Ranch-style)
- Birthdays: June, May, September, February, July.

The answer to your question is **Palace:4**."	palace:2	palace:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_palace_10	palace	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine who the fan of trance, reggae, rock, folk, and ambient are. Since the fan of trance is driving the train (which is not a motorbike, subway, snowmobile, or quad-bike), they cannot be any of those. So, let's assume Trance = Person X.
2. The fan of reggae is born in September. However, we don't have any other information about their mode of transport or house yet, so we can't place them for now. Let's call Reggae = Person Y.
3. The fan of rock is the palace house. Since they are not Trance (Person X) or Reggae (Person Y), let's assume Rock = Person Z. However, we don't know their mode of transport yet.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile and is the wooden house. Since they cannot be Trance (Person X) or Reggae (Person Y), let's assume Subway = Person A. Also, since it's not a motorbike, train, or quad-bike, and we know it's not Rock (Person Z), Person A must be one of the remaining three means of transport: Snowmobile, Motorbike, or Quad-bike.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house. From step 4, we know Person A is the wooden house. Therefore, since the subway isn't a motorbike, train, snowmobile, or quad-bike, Person A must be driving the Quad-bike (because it remains as an unassigned means of transport). So, let's assume Snowmobile = Person B and Motorbike = Person C.
6. Since the architect is born in May, they cannot be any of the already assigned people. Let's assume Architect = Person D. We still don't know their mode of transport or house yet.
7. The mechanic is the person driving the quad-bike (which we assigned to Person C). So, let's assume Mechanic = Person C.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we know that the subway (Person A) and the palace (Person Z) are not in the middle, only two houses remain: ranch-style and futuristic. Let's place Gothic-revival = Ranch-style for now.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since we don't know their mode of transport yet, they could potentially be Person X (Trance), Person Y (Reggae), or Person A (Subway/Quad-bike). However, since Person A (Quad-bike) is already placed and cannot be on the far left, let's assume that either Trance (Person X) or Reggae (Person Y) is the fan of folk.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we know that Person D (Architect, born in May) and Person C (Mechanic, born in an unspecified month) are not adjacent to Person E (born in June), they cannot be the librarian. Therefore, the librarian must be one of Trance (Person X), Reggae (Person Y), or Subway/Quad-bike (Person A).
11. The person who's birthday is in Julys is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we know that Person C (Mechanic) is already placed, it means that either Trance (Person X), Reggae (Person Y), or Subway/Quad-bike (Person A) is born in July.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since we know the ranch-style house is Gothic-revival (which we placed in step 8), this statement is incorrect, and we need to reconsider our placement of the houses. Let's place Motorbikemaster = Ranch-style instead.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. We don't have any other information about their mode of transport or house yet, so let's call Ambient = Person E.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (which we just placed as Ranch-style). Since Folk could be either Trance (Person X) or Reggae (Person Y), it means that either Trance (Person X) or Reggae (Person Y) is on the same side as Person F (Ranch-style/Motorbikemaster).
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we know the futuristic house hasn't been placed yet, this statement doesn't help us place anyone. However, we do know that the librarian cannot be adjacent to Person E (born in July) because we assigned them to one side of Person F (Motorbikemaster/Ranch-style).

Now let's rearrange our assumptions based on steps 10 and 11:
- Since both Trance (Person X) and Reggae (Person Y) are potential candidates for the librarian, they must be born in July. So, let's assume Person X is born in July and Person Y is not.
- With this assumption, we know that neither Trance (Person X) nor Reggae (Person Y) can be adjacent to Person E (born in July). This means that Person E (Ambient = Person E) must be placed between Person A (Subway/Quad-bike) and Person Z (Rock = Person Z).
- Since we know the quad-bike is driven by Mechanic (Person C), it's not possible for Person C to be driving the subway. So, let's assume Person A drives the subway.
- Now we can place Snowmobile (Person B) on the right of Person E (Ambient = Person E) and Quad-bike (Mechanic = Person C) on their left.
- With this placement, we know that Person D (Architect = Person D) cannot be adjacent to Person F (Motorbikemaster/Ranch-style). Since they are both born in May, the only remaining positions for Person D are between Person A and Person B or between Person C and Person Z. Let's place Person D between Person A and Person B for now.
- With this arrangement, we can place Person F (Motorbikemaster/Ranch-style) on the far left and Person Y (Reggae = Person Y) as their right neighbor. This means that Person X (Trance) is born in July and must be placed on the other side of Person A.
- Since Person A drives the subway, the only remaining house for Person A to live in is the futuristic house. So, let's place Futuristic = Subway.
- Finally, we can place the palace (Person Z) as the gothic-revival house (Ranch-style). So, let's place Palace: 3 (since Ranch-style is the third house).

The final arrangement of houses and their residents would be:
1. Futuristic - Subway
2. Ranch-style - Motorbikemaster (Person F)
3. Palace - Rock (Person Z)
4. Quad-bike - Mechanic (Person C)
5. Snowmobile - Unknown
6. Ambient - Bartender (Person E)
7. Subway - Unknown
8. Reggae - Reggae (Person Y)
9. Trance - Trance (Person X)
10. Architect - Architect (Person D)"	palace:2	palace:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_1	futuristic	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of reggae (September) is not on the far left (Folk is there). So the reggae fan must be either in the middle or on the right side. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (point 8), and we don't have any information about the position of reggae compared to gothic-revival, let's focus on other points first.
2. From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since the bartender must be next to someone (as people are positioned left and right), the bartender can't be in the middle or on the far left (point 9). Therefore, the bartender must be on the right side.
3. From point 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we know that the bartender (ambient fan) is on the right side and the librarian can't be on the far left, the librarian must be to the left of the futuristic house.
4. From point 10, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (June-person). Since we now know that the librarian is left of the futuristic house and can't be on the far left, the June-person must be to the right of the futuristic house.
5. From point 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May. Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike (point 7) and we already placed the librarian and June-person, the architect can't be on the far left or right as those positions are occupied. Therefore, the architect must be in the middle.
6. From point 5, we know that the house of the subway driver is wooden (point 5). Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle and the futuristic house is left of June-person, the subway driver must be on the right side, next to the architect (as there's no more empty space on the left).
7. From point 4, we know that the subway driver is left of the snowmobile driver. Since the wooden house belongs to the subway driver, and the architect is in the middle, the snowmobile driver must be on the right side, next to the mechanic (as there's no more empty space on the left).
8. From point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. Since the subway driver and architect are on the right, the motorbikemaster must be on the left side.
9. Now let's see where the folk fan can go. As the librarian is left of futuristic, the June-person is right of futuristic, and we placed everyone else, the only remaining position for the folk fan is on the far left (point 9).
10. Finally, from point 3, we know that the fan of rock is the palace house. Since the motorbikemaster is on the left side, the palace house must be on the right side, next to the reggae fan (September-person).

With all positions determined, we can now find where the futuristic house is:
futuristic:2 (as it's between the librarian and June-person)"	futuristic:1	futuristic:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_2	futuristic	6	" To solve this puzzle, we can create a chart to organize the information and solve each statement logically. Here's an example solution:

| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job           | Birthday | House Style | Position (subway left/right) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| A         | Trance      | Motorbikemaster| June     | Ranch-style | B                        |
| B         | Rock        | Architect     | May      | Palace      | E (subway left)           |
| C         | Folk        | Librarian      | Not Specified  | Not Specified| D or F (left of June or right of June)   |
| D         | Ambient    | Bartender     | Not Specified | Futuristic | G                       |
| E         | Reggae      | Mechanic      | September | Wooden      | Subway, left of Snowmobile |
| F         | Quad-bike   | Unknown      | July      | Unknown     | Right of the mechanic |
| G         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Snowmobile | Middle                  |
| H         | Unknown    | Unknown       | February  | Train       | Right of subway          |
| I         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Quad-bike   | Left of the person driving the motorbike |
| J         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Gothic-revival | Middle                  |

Given that the fans of trance, reggae, rock, and ambient are assigned to their respective transport (train, subway, palace, and bartender), we can deduce that the fan of folk is on the far left. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June and also on the left or right of the futuristic house, it must be on the far left (to avoid overlapping with the folk position).

Now we know that C (Librarian) is on the far left, so position A, B, and D are on the remaining positions. Since the fan of rock is the palace house (B), and the person driving the subway is on its left (E), the motorbike master must be the one driving the quad-bike (I).

Now we have:

| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job           | Birthday | House Style | Position (subway left/right) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| A         | Trance      | Motorbikemaster| June     | Ranch-style | B                        |
| B         | Rock        | Architect     | May      | Palace      | E (subway left)           |
| C         | Folk        | Librarian      | Not Specified  | Not Specified| Far Left                |
| D         | Ambient    | Bartender     | Not Specified | Futuristic | G                       |
| E         | Reggae      | Mechanic      | September | Wooden      | Subway, left of Snowmobile |
| F         | Quad-bike   | Motorbikemaster  | Unknown  | Unknown     | Right of I             |
| G         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Snowmobile | Middle                  |
| H         | Unknown    | Unknown       | February  | Train       | Right of E              |
| I         | Unknown    | Motorbikemaster   | Unknown  | Quad-bike   | Left of A               |
| J         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Gothic-revival | Middle                  |

Since the person driving the quad-bike (I) is the motorbikemaster, and the librarian is on the far left (C), we can deduce that F's birthday is in July. Now we have:

| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job           | Birthday | House Style | Position (subway left/right) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| A         | Trance      | Motorbikemaster| June     | Ranch-style | B                        |
| B         | Rock        | Architect     | May      | Palace      | E (subway left)           |
| C         | Folk        | Librarian      | Not Specified  | Not Specified| Far Left                |
| D         | Ambient    | Bartender     | Not Specified | Futuristic | G                       |
| E         | Reggae      | Mechanic      | September | Wooden      | Subway, left of Snowmobile |
| F         | Quad-bike   | Motorbikemaster  | July      | Unknown     | Right of I             |
| G         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Snowmobile | Middle                  |
| H         | Unknown    | Unknown       | February  | Train       | Right of E              |
| I         | Unknown    | Motorbikemaster   | Unknown  | Quad-bike   | Left of A               |
| J         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Gothic-revival | Middle                  |

Given that the fan of ambient is the bartender (D), the person driving the motorbike must be on the left of the folk and also on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since the librarian is on the far left, the only option for the motorbike driver is to be on the right of the futuristic house.

Now we have:

| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job           | Birthday | House Style | Position (subway left/right) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| A         | Trance      | Motorbikemaster| June     | Ranch-style | B                        |
| B         | Rock        | Architect     | May      | Palace      | E (subway left)           |
| C         | Folk        | Librarian      | Not Specified  | Not Specified| Far Left                |
| D         | Ambient    | Bartender     | Not Specified | Futuristic | G                       |
| E         | Reggae      | Mechanic      | September | Wooden      | Subway, left of Snowmobile |
| F         | Quad-bike   | Motorbikemaster  | July      | Unknown     | Right of I             |
| G         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Snowmobile | Middle                  |
| H         | Unknown    | Unknown       | February  | Train       | Right of E              |
| I         | Unknown    | Motorbikemaster   | Unknown  | Quad-bike   | Left of A               |
| J         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Gothic-revival | Middle                  |

Since the only option left for the motorbike driver (A) is to be on the right of the futuristic house (G), and the position of the snowmobile (J) is in the middle, the futuristic house must be on the left. So we have:

| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job           | Birthday | House Style | Position (subway left/right) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| A         | Trance      | Motorbikemaster| June     | Ranch-style | B                        |
| B         | Rock        | Architect     | May      | Palace      | E (subway left)           |
| C         | Folk        | Librarian      | Not Specified  | Not Specified| Far Left                |
| D         | Ambient    | Bartender     | Not Specified | Futuristic | G (Left of J)            |
| E         | Reggae      | Mechanic      | September | Wooden      | Subway, left of Snowmobile |
| F         | Quad-bike   | Motorbikemaster  | July      | Unknown     | Right of I             |
| G         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Futuristic  | Left of J               |
| H         | Unknown    | Unknown       | February  | Train       | Right of E              |
| I         | Unknown    | Motorbikemaster   | Unknown  | Quad-bike   | Left of A               |
| J         | Unknown    | Unknown       | Unknown  | Snowmobile  | Middle                  |

Now we can see that the futuristic house (G) is to the left of the snowmobile (J). We don't have any more information about the positions of the other houses, but we know that the motorbike driver (A) is on the right of the futuristic house (G), and the librarian (C) is on the far left.

So, in conclusion, the correct order of the houses from left to right is:
1. Librarian's House (Far Left)
2. Snowmobile House
3. Futuristic House (Left of J)
4. Quad-bike House (Right of I and B)
5. Ranch-style House (B)
6. Palace House (E, left of 1, 2, 3, and 4)
7. Wooden House (Subway, left of Snowmobile)
8. Train House (Right of E)"	futuristic:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_3	futuristic	6	" This puzzle requires a systematic approach to solve it step by step. Here's how we can approach this:

1. The fan of trance drives the train, so the train driver listens to trance (T). We don't know their house type yet.
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (R-S).
3. The fan of rock is the palace house (R-P).
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (S-L). Since we don't know the order yet, let's assign them temporarily as S1 and S2 where S1 is the driver on the left. We also know that both live in wooden houses (S1:W, S2:W).
5. The person driving the subway lives in a gothic-revival house (G) since we know the subway driver lives in a wooden house already and there are only five options for houses left. So G is the gothic-revival house (G=S1 or S2).
6. The architect has a birthday in May (A-M).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (Q-M), so we know Q and M are the same person now. We don't know their music preference, job, house type, or birth month yet.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (G-M). Since we already have two houses assigned to G, it means one of them must be in the middle. Let's say S1 is the gothic-revival house (S1=G). Then S2 is not G, and S2 is on the right side of S1 (S2:R).
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (F-L), so they must be one of the remaining transport options that haven't been assigned yet.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (Lib-J). Since we don't know J yet, let's assume L=J for now. But since the mechanic (Q-M) is on the left or right of July (M-G), it means L can't be M because M would be on the left or right of L, and we assumed L=J which implies L is the birth month of June. So let's reconsider our assumption, and instead assume that Lib is somewhere else for now.
11. The person who's birthday is in july (M-G) is on the left or right of the mechanic (M-G-M). But we already know that L can't be M because M would be on the left or right of L, and we assumed L=J which implies L is the birth month of June. So let's reconsider our assumption again, and instead assume that M=J for now (the mechanic has a birthday in July).
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (B-R). But we don't know who the motorbikemaster is yet.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (A-B), so we know A and B are the same person now. We don't know their transport preference, job, house type, or birth month yet.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (F-L/R-M). But since the mechanic (Q-M) is on the left or right of July (M-G), it means F can't be Q or M because they would be on the left or right of each other. So let's reconsider our assumption that M=J. Instead, let's assume that F=J for now (the fan of folk has a birthday in February since there are only four remaining birth months).
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Lib-F). But we already know that Lib can't be M because M would be on the left or right of L, and we assumed Lib=J which implies L is the birth month of February. So let's reconsider our assumption again, and instead assume that Lib=G or Lib=B for now (the librarian lives in either the futuristic house or the ambient/bartender house).

At this point, we have a cycle where each new assumption leads to contradictions with previous assumptions. This puzzle seems to have inconsistencies and might not be solvable based on the given information. To solve it, some additional information is required to break the cycle and allow us to make consistent assumptions that lead to a solution.

As for the futuristic house, we don't know its location yet due to our inability to find a consistent solution with the current information provided.

**futuristic: Undetermined**"	futuristic:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_4	futuristic	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step. We will assign a number from 1 to 5 to each person based on their characteristics (transport, music-genre, job, birthday month, and house).

Let's start with the known facts:
1. Trance is the train driver, so let's assign 'Trance' to Person 3.
2. Reggae has a birthday in September, so let's assign 'Reggae' to Person 5.
3. Rock is the palace house, so we know that Person 4 lives in the Palace house.
4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver, and the subway driver is also the wooden house. Since the palace (Person 4) cannot be on the left as it's house number 3, let's assign 'Subway' to Person 1 and 'Snowmobile' to Person 2.
5. The architect has a birthday in May, so let's assign 'Architect' to Person 6.
6. The mechanic drives the quad-bike. Since we have already assigned numbers for the transport drivers, 'Mechanic' must be one of the remaining people (1,2,4 or 5). To minimize conflicts in other conditions, let's assume 'Mechanic' is Person 1.
7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it has a number between 3 and 5. However, since we already know who lives in houses 1, 2, 3, and 6, there are no available numbers for the gothic-revival house. To resolve this conflict, let's reconsider our assumption that the mechanic is Person 1. In that case, we would have 'Mechanic' as Person 5, which does not satisfy condition 8 (the gothic-revival house in the middle). So, instead, let's assign 'Mechanic' to Person 4.
8. The fan of folk is on the far left, so it must be one of the first three people (1,2,3), and since the gothic-revival house is not yet assigned, we can't say for sure which person lives in the house with the folk fan. So let's assign 'Folk' to Person 9 (for now).

Now let's move on to conditions that help us connect people with their houses and jobs:
9. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, so we know that either Person 1 or Person 2 lives in the Ranch-style house.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June, which means it can be one of Person 3 (Trance), Person 4 (Architect - if we assume June to be between May and July), or Person 5 (Reggae).
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic, but since we have not assigned anyone for July yet, let's temporarily assign 'July' to Person 3.
12. The fan of ambient is the bartender, which means it can be one of Person 1 (Subway), Person 2 (Snowmobile), or Person 4 (Architect).
13. The person driving the motorbike and the fan of folk are neighbors. Since we have not assigned a house for 'Folk' yet, let's consider a few possible combinations:
    - If Person 3 (Trance) is the motorbike driver, then 'Folk' cannot be Person 1,2 or 4, which means it must be Person 5. In this case, the mechanic and the fan of folk are neighbors, but we already assigned them as non-neighbors in condition 8.
    - If Person 2 (Snowmobile) is the motorbike driver, then 'Folk' can still be Person 5, and the fan of folk would also be a neighbor with the mechanic (which conflicts with our assumption from condition 8).
    - If Person 4 (Architect) is the motorbike driver, then 'Folk' could be either Person 1 or Person 2. In this case, the fan of folk and the mechanic are neighbors, which does not conflict with our assumption in condition 8 as long as the mechanic lives outside the first two houses (since the mechanic is already on the left side). So, let's assign 'Motorbike' to Person 4.

Now we have a consistent set of assignments that satisfies all given conditions:
- Motorbike (Person 4) is also the Architect
- Folk (Person 9) is to the right of the Architect and on the far left, which means Person 9 = 5 (Reggae). Since reggae has a birthday in September, we know that July's person cannot be Person 3. Therefore, 'July' must be assigned to Person 2 (Snowmobile).
- Ambient (Person 1) is the Bartender and lives in the wooden house (Subway).
- Mechanic (Person 4 - revised) is also a Snowmobile neighbor, so the mechanic cannot live on the left side. Therefore, 'June' must be assigned to Person 3 (Trance), making it impossible for 'February' to be Person 1 or 2 as they would be neighbors with June. Thus, we assign 'February' to Person 5 (Reggae).
- The librarian can live in any of the remaining houses and is either on the left side or right side of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we have already assigned 'June' and 'February', let's check the remaining months: May (Architect), July (Snowmobile), August, October, November, December. Considering that the librarian can't be a neighbor with January or February due to condition 10, we're left with assigning the librarian to the house of the remaining two people, either August or November. Since the gothic-revival house is still unassigned and needs to be in the middle (between August and November), let's assume the librarian is Person 8 (August). In this case, the futuristic house would be on the left side of the librarian, which means it has a number between 1 and 7. Since we already know that the first two houses are occupied by Subway and Snowmobile drivers, let's assign 'Futuristic' to Person 6 (May).

Now we have a full set of assignments that satisfies all given conditions:
- Person 1: Ambient (Bartender) - wooden house (Subway)
- Person 2: July (Snowmobile)
- Person 3: June (Trance)
- Person 4: Motorbike (Architect)
- Person 5: Reggae (February) and Librarian
- Person 6: May (Futuristic)

So, **futuristic: 6**."	futuristic:1	futuristic:6	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_5	futuristic	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign transport to each character based on their music genre preference (as some hints give away their preferred genres). For example, the fan of trance is driving the train, so the train driver is Trance. Similarly, we can assign Reggae to September, Rock to Palace, Subway to an unknown, Snowmobile to an unknown, Quad-bike to Mechanic, and Motorbike to Ranch-style (as it's known later).

2. Arrange the transport based on their order and proximity: From 14 & 9, we know Folk is on the far left, so place it first (Folk:1). From 4, we know Subway is to the left of Snowmobile, so arrange them next with Subway being Folk's neighbor. Now we have Folk -> Subway -> Unknown.

3. Fill in more based on available information. From 5 & 6, we know that the Wooden house (Subway) belongs to May, and the Architect is May. So arrange the Wooden house between Folk and Subway. Now we have Folk -> Wooden House (Architect) -> Subway.

4. From 7, we know the Quad-bike (Mechanic) is next to the Snowmobile. Since there's no specific order, place Mechanic after any of the known transport characters, i.e., either Folk->Wooden House(Architect)->Subway->Mechanic or Folk->Mechanic->Wooden House(Architect)->Subway.

5. From 10 & 11, we learn that June and Mechanic are neighbors (June can be any of the remaining unassigned characters), so place them next to Mechanic. If it was Folk->Mechanic->Wooden House(Architect)->Subway, then arrange it as Folk->Mechanic->June->Wooden House(Architect)->Subway. If it was Folk->Wooden House(Architect)->Subway->Mechanic, then arrange it as Folk->Wooden House(Architect)->Mechanic->June->Subway.

6. From 12 & 13, we know the Motorbike (Ranch-style house) is next to Ambient (Bartender). Since Ambient is known to be between Subway and Mechanic, place Bartender after Subway and before Mechanic in any arrangement.

7. Finally, from 15, we learn that Librarian is on the left or right of Futuristic. There are only two empty spaces left: one for June and one for Librarian. Since the puzzle states ""on the left or right,"" place Librarian after June (if it was placed before Subway in step 5). Now we have Folk->June->Mechanic->Librarian->Wooden House(Architect)->Subway->Bartender, and the last empty space is for Futuristic.

8. We don't have enough information to definitively place Futuristic in the arrangement, but we can identify its possible positions: either as the June character (if June was placed before Subway) or the Librarian character (if Librarian was placed after June). Depending on how you solved it, you will get either **Futuristic:1** (in case of placing June first and Futuristic as the last position) or **Futuristic:2** (in case of placing Librarian second and Futuristic as the first position).

So in conclusion, either **futuristic:1** or **futuristic:2**."	futuristic:1	futuristic:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_6	futuristic	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From point 2 and point 11, we know that the fan of reggae (September) cannot be next to the mechanic. So, the fan of reggae is on the opposite side of July (let's assume July is on position 5).

2. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (point 7), and we know that July is not in the middle, July cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 7. So, July must be either 2 or 4. Since the fan of reggae is on the opposite side of July (point 1), if July were position 5, then reggae would have to be position 1, which contradicts point 8 (the fan of rock is the palace house and there are only 3 houses left: ranch-style, wooden, futuristic). So, July must be position 4.

3. Now we know that the fan of reggae is on position 2, July is on position 4, and they are opposite each other. Since July can't be next to the mechanic (point 11), the mechanic cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5. The only remaining position for the mechanic is position 6.

4. Since the architect is the person with a birthday in May (point 6) and we know the mechanic's position, we can determine that the architect must be next to the mechanic (since they are not allowed to be on opposite sides of June - point 10). So, the architect is either position 3 or 5.

5. Since the fan of ambient is the bartender (point 13) and we know the positions of July, the mechanic, and the architect, the fan of ambient must be on an open position (not next to any of them). The only remaining positions for the bartender are 1, 2, or 4. However, if the bartender were in position 1 or 4, it would mean that the motorbikemaster (ranch-style house - point 12) would have to be on the far left (position 9), but that contradicts point 9 (the fan of folk is on the far left). So, the bartender must be in position 2.

6. Since the fan of folk is on the far left (point 9), and we know the positions of July, the mechanic, the architect, and the bartender, the only remaining position for the fan of folk is position 1.

7. Since the fan of rock is the palace house (point 4) and we know the positions of July, the mechanic, the architect, the bartender, and the fan of folk, the only remaining position for the palace house is position 3.

8. Now that we have the positions of all houses except for futuristic, we can find its position as follows: Since the fan of trance is the person driving the train (point 1) and we know the positions of July, the mechanic, the architect, the bartender, the fan of folk, and the palace house, there are only two remaining positions for the train: 4 or 5. However, if the train were in position 4, it would mean that the subway (which is on its left - point 4) would have to be in position 1, but that contradicts point 5 (the subway is the wooden house and there are only two houses left: ranch-style and futuristic). So, the train must be in position 5. Since the subway is on the left of the snowmobile (point 4), the snowmobile must be in position 1.

9. Now that we know the positions of July, the mechanic, the architect, the bartender, the fan of folk, the palace house, the train, and the snowmobile, the only remaining position for the motorbike is position 3 (since it can't be on the far left - point 9).

10. Since we know the positions of July, the mechanic, the architect, the bartender, the fan of folk, the palace house, the train, the snowmobile, and the motorbike, we can find the positions of librarian and quad-bike: Since the librarian is on the left or right of June (point 10), it means that either the quad-bike or the subway must be June. However, if June were the quad-bike, it would mean that the motorbikemaster (ranch-style house - point 12) would have to be on the far left (position 9), but that contradicts point 9 (the fan of folk is on the far left). So, June must be the subway. Since the librarian is on the opposite side of June (since the quad-bike is next to it), the librarian can only be in position 5.

11. Now that we know the positions of July, the mechanic, the architect, the bartender, the fan of folk, the palace house, the train, the snowmobile, the motorbike, June (subway), and the librarian, the only remaining position for the quad-bike is position 1.

So, the final answer is **futuristic:5**."	futuristic:1	futuristic:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_7	futuristic	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will create a system to represent each person and use the given clues to fill in their characteristics. Let's use a table for easier organization:

| Characteristic | Person 1 (P1) | Person 2 (P2) | Person 3 (P3) | Person 4 (P4) | Person 5 (P5) |
|---------------|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Transport    |            |             |              |              |              |
| Music        |            |             |              |              |              |
| House        |            |             |              |              |              |
| Job          |            |             |              |              |              |
| Birthday     |            |             |              |              |              |

Now, let's use the clues to fill in each characteristic for each person.

1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train: P3 = Train
2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September: P2 = Reggae, September
3. The fan of rock is the palace house: House (P4) = Palace, Rock
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile: Subway driver < Snowmobile driver
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house: P1 = Subway, Wooden
6. The architect is the person who's birthday is in May: Job (P6) = Architect, May
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic: Quad-bike driver = Mechanic (Given in clue 7)
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle: House (P3) = Gothic-Revival (Since it's in the middle, it cannot be P1 or P5, and by process of elimination, we find P3)
9. The fan of folk is on the far left: Folk must be either P1 or P2, since they are on the extreme left
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june: Librarian cannot be P2 (Reggae is in September), and if librarian was on the left of P3 (June), then it would violate rule 9, so we find librarian = P5
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic: Since the mechanic is P7 and July is P5, they must be neighbors
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house: House (P4) = Ranch-style, Motorbike (Since it's a unique job, we find it for P4 immediately)
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender: Ambient must be either P1 or P5 (since they are not yet assigned a characteristic), and since P1 cannot have ambient (as it is already assigned rock through house), we find P5 = Ambient, Bartender
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike: Since we know that Folk = P2, and Motorbike = P4, we find that they are neighbors
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house: Since Librarian = P5, we don't have enough information to definitively place Futuristic yet.

To find the location of Futuristic, let's analyze the remaining possibilities:
- Since Mechanic and July (P5) are neighbors, they cannot be adjacent to each other in the arrangement
  - If P1 = Subway is not Futuristic, then P2 (Reggae, September) must be Futuristic, as there are no other empty spots left for Futuristic. In this case, Subway and Mechanic will have a gap between them.
  - If P5 (Ambient, Bartender) is not Futuristic, then P1 = Subway would be Futuristic, with Mechanic adjacent to it on the right, and July being its left neighbor.
- Alternatively, if we assume that July (P5) is Futuristic:
  - In this case, neither Mechanic nor Subway can be Futuristic, as there are no empty spots left for them, which would violate the arrangement rules.

Analyzing both possibilities, it seems that P1 = Subway is Futuristic, with Mechanic adjacent to it on the right, and July being its left neighbor. So, **Futuristic:1**."	futuristic:1	futuristic:1	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_8	futuristic	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will organize the given information into a table:

| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job        | House     | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Motorbike |             | Motorbikemaster | Ranch-style | June          |                  |
| Subway    | Trance      |             | Wooden    |               | Left of snowmobile|
| Train     |             |             | Palace    | Rock          |                  |
| Snowmobile | Reggae      |             | Gothic-revival| September      | Right of subway   |
| Quad-bike | Folk        | Mechanic   | Futuristic|             |                  |
|           | Ambient    | Architect  |           | May            |                  |
|           | Rock       | Bartender  |           |               |                  |
|           | Trance     | Librarian  |           | July           |                  |

First, let's find out the positions of the people using transport:
- From points 4 and 5, we know that subway is on the left of snowmobile. Since the snowmobile rider has a birthday in September (reggae), the Subway rider must be on the right of Quad-bike (Futuristic house).
- From point 12, we know that the Motorbikemaster lives in a Ranch-style house. Since motorbikes are not driving any other vehicles, the Motorbikemaster cannot be next to the Subway or Snowmobile riders according to points 4 and 5. Thus, the Motorbikemaster must be on the leftmost position.
- From point 10, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (Trance). Since the motorbikemaster is already at the leftmost position and has a different job, the Librarian cannot be at the leftmost position. Thus, the Librarian must be on the right side of the Motorbikemaster.
- From point 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since the Motorbikemaster and Librarian have been placed already, it means that Futuristic house must be at the rightmost position.

Now we can complete our table:

| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job        | House     | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Motorbike |             | Motorbikemaster | Ranch-style | June          | Leftmost         |
| Subway    | Trance      |             | Wooden    |               | 2nd from the left |
| Train     |             |             | Palace    | Rock          | 3rd from the left   |
| Snowmobile| Reggae      |             | Gothic-revival| September      | 4th from the left   |
| Quad-bike | Folk        | Mechanic   | Futuristic|             | Rightmost        |
|           | Ambient    | Architect  |           | May            |                  |
|           | Rock       | Bartender  |           |               |                  |
|           | Trance     | Librarian  |           | July           | 2nd from the right |

Finally, let's assign jobs, houses, and music-genres to people:
1. Since the Motorbikemaster drives a motorbike (leftmost position) and lives in a Ranch-style house, the Motorbikemaster is Trance, Architect, and Ranch-style house.
2. The Subway rider (Trance genre) must be either Bartender or Librarian. Since the Librarian is on the right side of the person who's birthday is in June (Trance), the Subway rider cannot be a librarian, so the Subway rider is Bartender.
3. The Train rider has no other characteristics assigned yet, so it must be Rock. Since the Gothic-revival house must be in the middle and the Train rider prefers rock (Rock genre), the Train rider is Architect (Gothic-revival house).
4. The Snowmobile rider (Reggae) cannot be assigned as any other characteristics, so it remains unassigned until we find more information about its position.
5. The Quad-bike (Folk genre) is on the rightmost position and is a mechanic. Since there are no other mechanics left to assign, the Quad-bike rider is Mechanic.
6. The Librarian is on the right side of the Motorbikemaster and has July as their birthday. Since there are no other librarians left to assign, the Librarian is Trance and Librarian.
7. By process of elimination, the person who's birthday is in May (Architect) must have been assigned to the Ambient genre.
8. Finally, we have the Snowmobile rider (Reggae), which cannot be any other characteristics that have already been assigned. Since the Subway rider is on the left of the Snowmobile rider and the Quad-bike rider is on the rightmost position, the Snowmobile rider must be next to the Bartender (Subway rider). So the Snowmobile rider is Rock and Bartender.

Now we can complete our table:

| Transport | Music-Genre  | Job        | House     | Birthday Month | Current Position |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Motorbike | Trance      | Architect  | Ranch-style | June          | Leftmost         |
| Subway    | Trance      | Bartender  | Wooden    |               | 2nd from the left |
| Train     | Rock        | Architect  | Palace    | Rock          | 3rd from the left   |
| Snowmobile| Reggae      | Rock       | Gothic-revival| September      | 4th from the left   |
| Quad-bike | Folk        | Mechanic   | Futuristic|             | Rightmost        |
|           | Ambient    | Librarian  |           | May            | 2nd from the right |

Now we know where the futuristic house is: **futuristic:Rightmost**"	futuristic:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_9	futuristic	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that trance fans drive trains, so the person driving the train (T) must be a fan of trance.
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (S), but we don't yet know who this is.
3. The fan of rock lives in the palace house (P).
4. The subway driver (Sub) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (Sn). So, if we arrange them in a row, Sub will be the first or second person. Since the palace house (P) is the third house and the fan of rock lives there, the subway driver can't be the first, so they must be the second one (Sub = 2nd position). The snowmobile driver, therefore, should be in the first position (Sn = 1st position).
5. The subway driver lives in the wooden house (Wh), which means the mechanic (M) cannot live there (since M drives the quad-bike and we know who the subway driver is now). So, the mechanic can only be the motorbikemaster (B), librarian (L), architect (A), or fan of folk (F). Since F is on the far left, B cannot be F either. So, the quad-bike driver (Q) should be the mechanic (M = Q), and this also means that the motorbike driver (Mb) must be the librarian (L).
6. The architect has a birthday in May (A), which tells us who they are. Let's assume their position is X, so we have A=X now.
7. Since F is on the left or right of Mb, and since we know that Mb is L, F must be either to the left (F1) or to the right (F2) of L. If F were on the left of L, it would mean that A must be in the middle (since Gothic-revival house is the middle house), which contradicts our previous knowledge about A's position (A=X). So, F must be on the right of L (F2).
8. Since Gothic-revival house is in the middle, it means that P can't be in the first three positions because there are only two houses left before the middle. Also, since A=X and we know who lives in the first three positions now, the only possibility for P is the last position (P = 5th position).
9. Now we have five people with defined jobs, so the remaining house must be the futuristic house (Fh). Since L (Mb) and F2 are already positioned, the only available positions for Fh are between them or on their sides. However, since there is no more room on the right, Fh must be to the left of L (Fh = 3rd position).
10. Now we know that Fh is the third house and A=X, so the librarian (L) can only be in the fourth or fifth position. Since the person who's birthday is in june (J) must be on one of L's sides, and we already have two houses on L's right side (P and Fh), J can only be on L's left side (L = 4th position).
11. Now we know that J is the fourth person, so the remaining people are Sn, Wh, Q, and F. Since Q=M, we already know their positions. And since the only available positions for F are between M and Wh or on their sides, F must be between M and Wh (F = 1st position). This leaves the second position for Wh (Sn = 2nd position), and the fifth position for S (July birthday) because they can't be on L's left side now.
12. Since we have assigned all the people, the final arrangement is as follows: 1-F, 2-Sub, 3-Fh, 4-L, and 5-S.
13. Now, to find out where futuristic house (Fh) is, we just need to remember that it's the third position in the arrangement, so **futuristic:3**."	futuristic:1	futuristic:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_futuristic_10	futuristic	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a table to organize the information and deduce the position of each person/item. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Let's assign numbers to each position from left (position 1) to right (position 5). We have five empty slots (A, B, C, D, E).
2. From the clues we know that the trance fan drives the train. Since trains are not among motorbikes, snowmobiles, or quad-bikes, the train driver must be in position A, C, or E because they are the only ones left (A being on the left since the subway is on its left). However, since the trance fan can't also be the fan of rock as per clue 4, the train driver should be in position C.

3. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September. Since we know now that C is not a reggae fan, it must be one of A, B, or E. But, since the reggae fan can't also be the fan of rock as per clue 4 and since the reggae fan can't also be the architect (as the architect has a birthday in May), the reggae fan is either A or E. As we'll see later, E must be the person with a February birthday, so the reggae fan is in position A.

4. The fan of rock lives in the palace house. Since it can't be in positions A, C (as those are taken by the train driver and the reggae fan), it should be in position B or D. However, since the rock fan can't also be the fan of ambient as per clue 13, the palace house must be in position E (which contradicts our earlier conclusion that E is the train). This error suggests a mistake in the clue regarding the house types.

5. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since we know now that C is the train driver and A is not the subway driver (because it's the reggae fan), the subway must be either B or D. As C is to the left of A, the subway should also be to its left. So, let's place the subway in position B. This means that the snowmobile is in position D.

6. The wooden house (subway) is in position B. Since the subway driver can't also be a fan of trance or rock as per clues 1 and 4, it can only be either a mechanic or a bartender. However, since the mechanic drives the quad-bike according to clue 7, the wooden house must be the bartender.

7. The architect has a birthday in May. Since we know now that B is the subway and C is the train (both of which are not architects), the architect can only be in position A or D. However, since the architect can't also be a fan of trance or rock as per clues 1 and 4, it should be the remaining option: A. This means that the person with a May birthday is an architect.

8. The gothic-revival house (which we know to be in error) is in the middle. Since there are only five options left (A, B, C, D, and E), this clue suggests that all houses must have the same type: ranch-style, wooden, gothic-revival, palace, futuristic.

9. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since we know now that A is the architect, the only remaining option for the folk fan is D (as E is taken by the train driver).

10. The librarian is to the left or right of the person with a June birthday. Since we know that A is the architect (with a May birthday) and D is the folk fan (which can't be in position A because it would violate clue 9), the only remaining option for the librarian is E, as there's no one else on its left.

11. The person with a July birthday is to the left or right of the mechanic. Since we know that B is the subway driver (a mechanic can't be a train driver due to clue 6), the only remaining option for the person with a July birthday is C, as there are no other positions left.

12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since we know that A is an architect and E is the train driver (both of which can't be motorbikemasters), the only remaining option for the motorbikemaster is B, as there are no other houses left.

13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we know that A is an architect, B is a subway driver (which can't be a bartender due to clue 6), C is a motorbikemaster, D is the folk fan, and E is the train driver, the only remaining option for the ambient fan is position D.

14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we know that B is the subway driver (which can't be a folk fan due to clue 9), C is the motorbikemaster, and E is the train driver, the only remaining option for the folk fan is D, as there are no other positions left on its right.

15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we know that A is an architect, B is a subway driver, C is a motorbikemaster, D is the folk fan (which can't be the librarian due to clue 9), E is the train driver, and there are no other houses left, this clue doesn't provide any new information. However, we know from clues that the librarian must be in position A or E because it's to the left or right of a June birthday person (which we know is C). This leaves us with two possibilities:

   - The librarian is in position A (to the left of the motorbike driver), and the futuristic house is in position D (on the right of the snowmobile driver).
   - The librarian is in position E (to the right of the train driver), and the futuristic house is in position C (between the mechanic and the motorbike driver).

Given that there seems to be an error in the clue regarding house types, it's hard to definitively determine the correct answer without revising the clues related to house types. However, I'll provide two possible answers based on the current information:

- futuristic:D (librarian is A and the librarian is to the left of the June birthday person)
- futuristic:C (librarian is E and the librarian is to the right of the June birthday person)"	futuristic:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_1	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step. Here's the solution:

1. Identify relationships between variables:
    - Transport, music-genres, houses, jobs, and birthdays are connected (5 each).
    - We know some direct connections like fan of trance drives the train and fan of reggae has a birthday in September.
    - Some elements share indirect connections, such as the architect is born in May, or the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house.

2. Assign temporary variables (letters) to each unique category:
    - T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 for transport (motorbike, subway, train, snowmobile, quad-bike)
    - M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 for music-genres (trance, rock, ambient, folk, reggae)
    - H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 for houses (ranch-style, wooden, gothic-revival, palace, futuristic)
    - J1, J2, J3, J4, J5 for jobs (motorbikemaster, mechanic, architect, bartender, librarian)
    - B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 for birthdays (june, may, september, february, july)

3. Use the given information to make assumptions:
    - Let's assume that T1 = motorbike, since it is not mentioned elsewhere in the puzzle.

4. Solve for other variables by using indirect connections and assuming logical order (left-right, top-bottom):
    4.1. From point 4 we know that subway and snowmobile are next to each other (T2 and T4). Since T2 is not motorbike, it must be subway or train (as T1 is already assigned). The only remaining transport for T2 is subway (since the train fan likes trance).
    4.2. Now that we know T2 = subway, we can see that T4 = snowmobile (since it's not motorbike and it is next to subway).
    4.3. From point 6 we learn that architect = J3, and since there's no other given information about the order of jobs, let's assign J1 as mechanic since the motorbikemaster can be assumed to be in a higher position (ranch-style house).
    4.4. From point 7 we learn that quad-bike = T5 and it is the mechanic (J2), so the only remaining transport for T3 is train, making M1 its fan.
    4.5. From point 9 we know that folk fan = J4 or J5 (left of the motorbike driver) and it's not J5 (since J5 is assigned to July's birthday). So, let's assign J4 as folk fan for now.
    4.6. From points 12 and 13 we know that ranch-style house = J1 and ambient fan = J3.
    4.7. Since the librarian is on the left or right of June's birthday (June's partner, J5), it can only be J1 or J2. However, since J1 is already assigned as the ranch-style house, it must be J2.
    4.8. From point 14 we learn that folk fan (J4) is on the left or right of motorbike driver (J1), but since J1 has been assigned to a different category (ranch-style house), let's move J4 to the right of the person driving the motorbike.
    4.9. From point 15 we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, but since the other jobs have been assigned, only H5 remains for the librarian (left of H5).

Now let's assign the remaining variables based on their relationships with already assigned ones:

    4.10. Since T3 = train and we know that it is next to the subway (T2), T3 must be left of T2, making M1 its fan.
    4.11. From point 8 we learn that gothic-revival house = H3 and since the only remaining houses are H2, H4, and H5, let's assign H2 as wooden house (left of H3) and H4 as palace house (right of H3).
    4.12. From point 11 we know that July's birthday is next to the mechanic (J2), so it can only be B2 or B5. Since J2 has been assigned, let's assume B2 = July's birthday. This makes B5 = February's birthday and B4 = September's birthday since M4 = reggae and we already know that M5 = folk.
    4.13. Now that we have all the remaining birthdays, it's easy to assign them: J5 = B1 (June's birthday) and J6 = B3 (May's birthday).
    4.14. Since H2 is left of H3, and we know that H5 = futuristic house, let's place H1 as the ranch-style house (left of H2), H4 as the palace (right of H3), and H5 as the futuristic house (rightmost).
    4.16. Since the librarian is on the left of H5, it means J2 = librarian. This leaves J1 as the motorbikemaster (ranch-style house).

So finally: **motorbikemaster:J1**"	motorbikemaster:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_2	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a combination of deduction and creating variables to represent the unknowns. Let's denote each variable as follows:
- T (Trance): music genre preference (1 if fan, 0 otherwise)
- R (Reggae), A (Rock), F (Folk), G (Gothic-revival), P (Palace), M (May), S (Subway), Q (Quad-bike), B (Birthday month), L (Librarian), Aa (Architect), Mm (Motorbikemaster) as the corresponding variables for their respective attributes.

We'll start by assuming that all houses are numbered from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let's break down each piece of information step by step:

From points 1-8:
- We know the positions and houses for subway (S), snowmobile (Sn), motorbike (M), librarian (L), mechanic (Me), architect (Ar), reggae (R) and may birthday (M). We also have some information about their preferences and jobs.
- From point 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike if Me = Q, but since the position of the mechanic is known already, there's no need to solve it further. So, let's use Q = Me for convenience.
- From points 9 and 14, we can deduce that F and M are on the leftmost and second positions (F:1, M:2) because Folk is on the far left and the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike.
- From point 10, since L is on the left or right of B, we can assume that if B = June, then L can only be in position 4 or 5 (L:4 or L:5). If B was any other month, then L could also be in position 1.
- From point 12, since Mm is the ranch-style house, we know Mm cannot be the wooden house, which leaves only positions 2, 3, and 4 as possibilities for the wooden house (P:x).
- From points 2 and 15, we have the information that R = B[September], L is on the left or right of F (or any other house with a July birthday), and the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Now we can make some additional deductions:
    - If L is in position 4, then P cannot be in positions 3 or 4 because the architect is in May (M = Ar) and the mechanic is driving the quad-bike (Me = Q). Therefore, P must be in position 1. However, this would make the reggae fan's birthday in July, which contradicts point 2. So L cannot be in position 4.
    - If L is in position 5, then P can only be in position 3 or 4. But, as explained above, the architect and mechanic are already assigned positions. Therefore, P must be in position 1 again, which makes reggae's birthday in July, contradicting point 2.
    - Thus, L must be in position 2 (L:2). This means that Mm cannot be in positions 4 or 5 because the librarian is on its left. Therefore, Mm can only be in position 3 (Mm:3). Since the wooden house is not in positions 4 and 5, it must be in position 1 (P:1) as we deduced earlier.
    - Now that we know L and Mm's positions, we also know the reggae fan's birthday must be in September (B[September] = R), because reggae is not on the far left (F:1). Thus, B[September] can only be in position 2.
    - Since L is in position 2 and the mechanic is driving the quad-bike (Me = Q), the librarian cannot be the mechanic. Therefore, L cannot be the person with a July birthday (L ≠ B[July]).
    - This leaves only one possibility for the July birthday: it must be in position 4 (B[July] = 4). Since Mm is not in positions 4 or 5, and we already know L is in position 2, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 3 (M:3).
    - With Mm's position known, we can now find the architect's position. Since Ar = M and the gothic-revival house is in the middle (G:3), the architect must be in position 1 (Ar:1).
    - Now that we know Ar and G's positions, we know that rock (Rock) cannot be either one since the palace (P:1) is not a gothic-revival house. Therefore, Rock must be in positions 4 or 5. But position 5 is already assigned to L, so Rock can only be in position 4.
    - With Rock's position known, we can now find the ambient fan (Ambient). Since A = Ambient is not on the far left, it must be in positions 2, 3 or 4. But we already know F and M in those positions, so Ambient must be in position 1. Therefore, B[May] = Ar:1
    - We now have assigned all attributes except for the person driving the snowmobile (Sn). Since Sn is not the wooden house (P), it cannot be in positions 1 or 3 because P and M are already known. Also, since Sn is not on the far left (F) and not a reggae fan (R), it cannot be in position 2. Therefore, Sn must be in position 4.
    - Since we have now assigned all attributes except for the subway driver, it must be the person driving the snowmobile (S:4).

Finally, we can summarize the results as follows:
- T:0 (not a fan of trance)
- R:B[September] = 2
- A:Ar = B[May] = 1
- F:F = 1
- G:G = 3
- M:M = 3
- P:P = 1
- Q:Me (assigned earlier) = 7
- L:L = 2
- Aa:Ar = 1
- Mm:M = 3
- Ambient:A = 1
- Folk:F = 1
- Rock:Rock = 4
- Subway:S = 4
- Snowmobile:Sn = 4

With all the attributes assigned, we can now find the position of the motorbikemaster: Mm = 3."	motorbikemaster:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_3	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify shared attributes between clues:
   - We have 5 people (Transport, Music-genres, Houses, Jobs, Birthdays) and each person has one attribute from each category.

2. Use the given information to assign attributes:
   - From clue 1, we know that the fan of trance is driving the train. Since there's only one transport option left for the trance fan (motorbike), the motorbike must be driven by someone else. So let's assume motorbike -> Person A.
   - From clue 2, we know that the person with a birthday in September is a reggae fan. Since there's only one music-genre left for this person (ambient), let's assign ambient to Person E.

3. Make assumptions based on possible relationships:
   - Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike (from clue 7) and we don't know where the trance fan or the reggae fan is, we can assume that Person A and Person E are not the mechanic. This means the other three people can be the mechanic. So let's try assigning the mechanic to one of them: Mechanic -> Person B, C, or D.
   - From clue 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the gothic-revival house (Person F) is in the middle, it must be driving either the subway or the snowmobile. Let's try assigning these transports to Person F first: Subway -> Person F, Snowmobile -> Person I. If this doesn't work, we can swap them and try again.
   - From clue 5, we know that the wooden house is driving the subway. Since we already assigned the subway to Person F, this means Person G must be in a wooden house.
   - From clue 10, we know that the librarian (Person J) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we don't have enough information yet to determine this, let's keep it as an open question for now.

4. Use deductive reasoning and remaining clues to fill in the blanks:
   - From clue 6, we know that the architect (Person H) has a birthday in May. Since the reggae fan is Person E and the trance fan is Person A, they can't be the architect. This means there are only two remaining people who could be the architect (Persons B, C, or D). But since the mechanic can't be the architect (from step 3), this leaves us with only one possibility: Architect -> Person B.
   - From clue 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since the wooden house is already assigned (Person G), and since there are no other house types left for the mechanic, it must be the case that the mechanic is driving the snowmobile. So let's swap the transports of Persons F and I: Snowmobile -> Person I, Subway -> Person F.
   - From clue 12, we know that the motorbikemaster (Person K) lives in a ranch-style house. Since there are no other house types left for the librarian or the bartender, it must be the case that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. So let's assign this to Person K: Motorbikemaster -> Person K.
   - From clue 13, we know that the fan of ambient (Person E) is the bartender. Since there are no other music-genres left for the librarian or the architect, it must be the case that the librarian is the fan of rock (Person H).
   - From clue 14, we know that the fan of folk (Person A) is on the far left or the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the mechanic (Person B) is driving a quad-bike and not a motorbike, this means Person A must be on the far left. So let's assign the folk genre to the far left position: Folk -> Leftmost Person A.
   - From clue 15, we know that the librarian (Person J) is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we already assigned the ranch-style house to the motorbikemaster (Person K), this means the only remaining position for the librarian is between the gothic-revival and futuristic houses (Persons F, G, I). Since the mechanic can't be the librarian (from step 3), and since we already assigned the reggae fan to Person E, this leaves us with only one possibility: Librarian -> Person G.
   - From clue 9, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the fan of folk (Person A). Since we already assigned the motorbike to Person K and the folk genre to Person A, this means the only remaining position for the motorbikemaster is between Persons E and F (the reggae fan and the subway driver). So let's assign the motorbike to Person K: Motorbike -> Person K.

Now that we have filled in all the attributes, let's summarize the results:

1. Trance: Person A (Motorbike)
2. Reggae: Person E (Ambient)
3. Rock: Person H (Librarian)
4. Folk: Person A (Leftmost)
5. Ambient: Person E (Bartender)
6. Architect: Person B (Mechanic)
7. Mechanic: Person I (Snowmobile)
8. Subway: Person F (Wooden House)
9. Motorbikemaster: Person K (Ranch-style house)
10. Bartender: Person E (Ambient)
11. Librarian: Person G (Palace house)
12. Snowmobile: Person I (Mechanic)
13. Gothic-revival: Person F (Subway)
14. Palace: Person H (Architect)
15. Wooden: Person G (Librarian)
16. Ranch-style: Person K (Motorbikemaster)
17. Futuristic: Person I (Snowmobile)

Finally, let's present the answer in the required format:

**motorbikemaster:K**"	motorbikemaster:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_4	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train. Let's assign roles to people based on their music preferences: T (trance), R (rock), A (ambient), F (folk), and G (reggae).

2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, so we have the first assignment: G = September

3. The fan of rock is the palace house, which gives us: R = Palace

4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile and is the wooden house. Since the fan of rock (R) is already assigned to the palace, the only option for the wooden house is the subway driver. Also, since the subway driver cannot be F (because F=folk is still unassigned), the subway driver must be either T or A: Subway = T or A

5. Now we have a gap in our information because we don't know where the fan of trance (T) is placed. Since T drives the train, the train can't be on the far left (because the fan of folk, who is on the far left, is still unassigned). The only remaining position for the train is next to the subway or the snowmobile (since the gothic-revival house is in the middle and the librarian must be on the left or right of the person with a birthday in June and the futuristic house). So, let's assume Train = A or T for now.

6. The fan of folk is on the far left (as we know from point 9), so we have: F = Left

7. The architect has a birthday in May, so Architect = May

8. Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike and the fan of ambient is the bartender (point 13), we have Quad-bike = Mechanic and Bartender = Ambient

9. The person driving the motorbike has a birthday in June or July (because the librarian is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in June, and the fan of ambient, who is the bartender, is already assigned to a specific month). So let's assume Motorbike = June or Motorbike = July

10. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so Gothic-revival = Middle

11. Since we don't have enough information yet to determine the positions of the people with birthdays in February and July, we can't find the position of the librarian or the person driving the motorbike. However, since we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, if we assume that the fan of ambient (Bartender) is on the far left, then the librarian must be on the right of the futuristic house. But this contradicts our earlier assumption that the person with a birthday in July could be on the left or right of the mechanic, as there's no available space for them to be placed if the librarian is on the right of the futuristic house.

12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (point 12), but we haven't assigned any role to the ranch-style house yet, so let's assume Motorbike = June and Ranch-style = Librarian or Mechanic for now.

In conclusion, we cannot definitively determine the position of the motorbikemaster based on the given information. There might be a contradiction in the puzzle that prevents a correct solution from being found."	motorbikemaster:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_5	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a method called elimination and deduction. Let's go through each step:

1. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae is born in September, so this person cannot be the motorbikemaster since their birthday month is already taken (point 12).

2. Since the motorbikemaster can't be the fan of reggae, he must be one of the remaining four music genres: trance, rock, ambient, or folk. Let's assign these genres to the other transport options: Train = Trance, Subway = Ambient, Snowmobile = Rock, Quad-bike = Folk (we can change this later if needed).

3. From point 4 and 6, we know that the person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile driver and the architect (birthday in May) is not the person driving the subway or the snowmobile. So, the train driver (Trance fan) must be either on the left or right of the snowmobile driver (Rock fan).

4. From point 5, we know that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house, but since the architect can't live in a wooden house, the wooden house can't belong to the Train driver. Therefore, the Wooden house is either a ranch-style, gothic-revival, palace, or futuristic house.

5. From point 7 and 10, we know that the mechanic drives the Quad-bike (Folk fan) and is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since the Train driver can't be on the far left (point 9), the Mechanic must be on the far left, which means the person who's birthday is in June should be the Quad-bike driver. Therefore, the Train driver is Trance, the Quad-bike driver is the fan of Reggae (September). So now we know Rock is one of the remaining jobs and lives in a house other than wooden.

6. From point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. Since the Train driver can't live in a ranch-style house (point 12), the motorbikemaster must be either the Subway driver (Ambient fan) or Snowmobile driver (Rock fan).

7. From point 13, we know that the bartender is the fan of Ambient since it's not assigned to any other transport option yet and the person driving the motorbike is the fan of Folk according to point 14.

8. Since the Mechanic (Rock fan) can't live in a gothic-revival house (point 7), the Gothic-revival house must belong to the architect, librarian or person driving the motorbike. But we know that the architect cannot live in a gothic-revival house (point 6), so it must be either the person driving the motorbike or the librarian.

9. From point 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. But since the Motorbikemaster lives in a Ranch-style house (point 12) and can't live on the far left due to the mechanic, the Librarian must be on the far left. So the person driving the motorbike should be the librarian or futuristic house. However, since the person driving the motorbike is not a fan of Ambient (point 7), it can't be the Librarian. Therefore, the Motorbikemaster lives in the Futuristic house.

10. Now we know that the motorbikemaster is the futuristic house and since he cannot live on the far left due to the mechanic (point 7), the librarian must be the person who's birthday is in june. So the Snowmobile driver (Rock fan) is the architect, the Subway driver (Ambient fan) is the bartender, and the Quad-bike driver (Reggae fan) is the person with a birthday in September. The remaining jobs are mechanic and librarian. Since the Motorbikemaster lives in the Futuristic house (point 9), the Quad-bike driver must be the mechanic, so the librarian is the remaining job which is on the left or right of the futuristic house.

So the final answer is **motorbikemaster:Futuristic house**."	motorbikemaster:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_6	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this puzzle, we can create a table to organize the given information and make it easier to find relationships between variables. Here's the table:

| Transport  | Music-genre  | House    | Job       | Birthday  | Position (transport) |
|------------|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| Motorbike  | Trance       | Ranch   | Motorbikemaster | June    | N/A                      |
| Subway     | N/A          | Wooden   | N/A        | May      | On left of Snowmobile   |
| Train      | Trance       | N/A      | N/A        | N/A      | N/A                      |
| Snowmobile | N/A          | Palace   | N/A        | September| Right of Subway         |
| Quad-bike  | N/A          | Gothic-revival| Mechanic| N/A       | N/A                      |
| N/A       | Rock         | Palace   | N/A        | N/A      | N/A                      |
| N/A       | Ambient      | N/A      | Bartender  | N/A      | N/A                      |
| N/A       | Folk          | N/A      | N/A        | September| Left or right of Motorbike|
| N/A       | Reggae       | N/A      | N/A        | July     | On left or right of Mechanic|
| N/A       | N/A          | Futuristic| Librarian  | June    | Left or right of futuristic house   |

From the table, we can find out that the Motorbikemaster is the Ranch-style house, so let's see where it is placed in the sequence:

1. The Subway is on the left of Snowmobile, and since Train is driven by someone who likes Trance (the fan of trance), which we already know is the person driving the train, and there are no other transports to their left, the Motorbikemaster must be on the right side of Train.
2. The Gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it can't be the Ranch-style house (Motorbikemaster).
3. The only position left for the Motorbikemaster (Ranch-style house) is on the far right side of the sequence.

So the final answer is **motorbikemaster:4** (since it's the 4th transport in the sequence from left to right, and we start counting with 1)."	motorbikemaster:5	motorbikemaster:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_7	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this puzzle, we'll first create a table to organize the information:

| Transport     | Music-genre | House       | Job          | Birthday  | Position (from left) |
|--------------|------------|------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|
| Motorbike    |            | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster| June     |                  9 |
| Subway       |            | Wooden      |               | May      |                  10|
| Train        | Trance     | Palace     | Rock         | September|                  5|
| Snowmobile   |            | Gothic-revival|              | July     |                  3 |
| Quad-bike    |            | Futuristic  | Librarian     | February |                  12|

Now let's find the missing information:

* The fan of rock is the palace house (4), so the person with the job that corresponds to rock, which is an architect, must be in position 6 (from left).
* The architect is the person who's birthday is in may, so the person driving the subway can't be the architect since they should be on position 5 or 10 (given in condition 6 and 10)
* Therefore, the person driving the subway must be the fan of trance.
* The person driving the subway is the wooden house (5), so we now know that the fan of trance drives the subway, and the job corresponding to trance is a passenger who commutes via subway.
* Since the architect can't be on position 5 or 10, they must be on the right side of the person driving the subway (position 6), meaning the mechanic should be on the left side of the person with birthday in May (position 4). Thus, the motorbike driver is a mechanic (7).
* Now we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike and is next to the librarian. The fan of folk is on the far left (9), so there are only two possibilities for the position of the librarian: 1 or 2. Since the librarian can't be on the right of the person with birthday in June (given condition 10), they must be on the left, meaning the librarian is in position 2. Thus, the fan of folk drives the motorbike (9).
* The fan of ambient is the bartender (13), so we know that the person with the job corresponding to ambient must be somewhere in positions 1 - 8. Given the constraints for the librarian and the mechanic, it's impossible for the bartender to be on position 2, 3, or 6-9. Thus, the bartender is in position 1 (leftmost).
* The gothic-revival house must be in the middle (8), so we know that the person living in a gothic-revival house can't be the architect, motorbikemaster, mechanic or librarian. Since we already placed these four people in positions 4, 6, 2, and 5 respectively, the only possibility left for the gothic-revival house is position 8.
* The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person driving the subway (4), so the snowmobile driver can't be the architect or motorbikemaster since we placed them in positions 4, 6, and 5 respectively. It's also impossible for the snowmobile driver to be the mechanic because their position should be 7. The only possibility left is that the person driving the snowmobile is the fan of reggae (3).
* Since the fan of rock can't be in positions 5, 10 and the fan of trance can't be in position 6, the only possibility for the fan of rock to drive a vehicle is on the far right (position 11), so the person driving the train is the fan of rock (4).
* Now we know that the fan of reggae drives the snowmobile and lives in the gothic-revival house, which leaves us with only one possibility for the position of the fan of folk (9): the motorbikemaster. Thus, **motorbikemaster: 9**."	motorbikemaster:5	motorbikemaster:9	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_8	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this puzzle, we can create a table to organize our information and gradually eliminate possibilities until we can determine the positions. I'll denote the people with letters A-E and the houses with F-J.

|     | Transport  | Music  | House | Job  | Birthday |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A   | motorbike | trance | ranch  | motorbikemaster | June  |
| B   | subway    |         |        |                | May   |
| C   | snowmobile |       | palace  | architect  | September |
| D   | train     | rock   | gothic-revival  |            | February  |
| E   | quad-bike | ambient| futuristic | librarian    | July      |

We know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train (D), so D = ""train"". Then, we can deduce that A cannot be the driver of the subway since the subway driver should be on the left of the snowmobile driver. So A ≠ ""subway"".

From 4, we know that the subway is not on the left of the snowmobile (since A != ""subway""), so B = ""snowmobile"". From 5, the subway is the wooden house, so B = ""wooden"". Now we have two possibilities for the positions: B(snowmobile) - D(train), or D(train) - B(snowmobile).

Since the fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September (E), E = ""reggae"" and position E has a birthday in September. Thus, we know that D(train) cannot be in September because there can only be one person with that birthday. So B(snowmobile) - D(train).

From 6, the architect is the person who's birthday is in May (C), so C = ""architect"" and position C has a birthday in May.

Now we have three possibilities for the positions:
1. A(motorbike)- B(snowmobile) - C(architect) - D(train) - E(reggae)
2. A(motorbike)- D(train) - B(snowmobile) - C(architect) - E(reggae)
3. B(snowmobile) - A(motorbike) - C(architect) - D(train) - E(reggae)

From 7, the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (E). So we know that E = ""quad-bike"". Therefore, position A cannot be the mechanic, so A ≠ ""quad-bike"".

From 12, the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since A(motorbike) is in a different house from B(snowmobile), and B = ""wooden"", then A = ""ranch-style"" (the only remaining house for A).

Now we are left with two possibilities for the positions:
1. A(ranch)- B(snowmobile) - C(architect) - D(train) - E(reggae)
2. B(snowmobile) - A(ranch) - C(architect) - D(train) - E(reggae)

From 14, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (A). Since position K for the motorbike driver is taken by A, we can only have L or M on the left side of A. But from 9, the person on the far left is the fan of folk (K), which contradicts our previous statement that the fan of folk could be on the left of the motorbike driver. So, it must mean that L or M is the fan of folk instead, but this would put the fan of folk in a position where they cannot be the mechanic (E) and it also violates the positioning of the people based on their preferred music-genres.

Since we reached a contradiction, there might be an error or inconsistency in the puzzle, so I can't definitively determine the location of the motorbikemaster. You should check if there are any errors or unintended contradictions in the given conditions to find the correct solution."	motorbikemaster:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_9	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down by finding connections between variables.

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of trance (train driver) is not the person with a birthday in September nor on the far left. This means the train driver cannot be in house 5 (february), 9 (july) or 1 (september). Since there's no information about the rightmost position, we can't rule out any other houses at this point.

2. From points 6 and 10, we know that the architect (who has a birthday in May) is not on the left of the person with a birthday in June. This means the architect cannot be in house 5 (february), 4 (may), or 3 (june).

3. From points 7 and 11, we know that the mechanic (quad-bike driver) is not on the left of the person with a birthday in July. This means the quad-bike driver cannot be in house 6 (june), 5 (february), or 4 (may).

4. From points 8 and 15, we know that the gothic-revival house is not in the middle nor on the left or right of the futuristic house. This means the gothic-revival house cannot be in house 2 (ranch-style), 3 (june), or 4 (may).

5. From points 12 and 9, we know that the ranch-style house is not on the far left. This means the ranch-style house cannot be in house 4 (may) or 9 (september).

6. From points 3, 4, and 5, we can conclude that house 2 (ranch-style) must be either a trance fan, rock fan, ambient fan, folk fan, or reggae fan. Since the fan of rock is the palace house, it cannot be the ranch-style house. The fan of reggae is the person with a birthday in September, so the ranch-style house cannot be that person either. This leaves us with trance, ambient, folk, and folk as possibilities for the ranch-style house. Since there's no information about who can't be the fan of ambient, we can't rule out house 2 at this point.

7. From points 13 and 14, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender and not on the far left. This means the bartender cannot be in house 9 (september) or 1 (january). Since there's no information about who can't be the bartender, we can't rule out any other houses at this point.

8. From points 2 and 4, since the fan of trance is not the person with a birthday in September nor on the far left, and the fan of reggae is the person with a birthday in September, it follows that the train driver (trance fan) cannot be on the left of the snowmobile driver (snowmobile driver can't be in september). This means the train driver cannot be in house 1 (january), 3 (june), or 5 (february).

9. From points 2, 4, and 8, since the fan of trance is not the person with a birthday in September nor on the far left nor on the left of the snowmobile driver, it follows that the train driver cannot be in house 7 (august), 6 (june), or 5 (february).

10. Since we have narrowed down the possible houses for each character except for the ranch-style house and the bartender, let's assume that the ranch-style house is a fan of folk for now, so it must be in house 9 (september). With this assumption, the bartender cannot be in house 9 either. The only remaining houses for the bartender are house 2 (ranch-style), which we can't rule out yet, and house 10 (march).

11. Since we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver, and since the ranch-style house (fan of folk) cannot be in house 9 (september), it follows that the motorbike driver must be in one of the houses 1 to 8.

12. Since we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, and since the fan of trance (train driver) cannot be in house 7 (august), it follows that the futuristic house must be either house 1, 2, or 3.

13. Since we know that the person driving the motorbike is not on the far left and is not the fan of folk, the only remaining houses for the motorbikemaster are houses 2 (ranch-style), 3 (june), 4 (may), or 5 (february). However, since we assumed that the ranch-style house is a fan of folk and can't be in house 9 (september), it follows that the motorbikemaster cannot be in house 2 (ranch-style) either.

14. Since we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, and since the only remaining houses for the futuristic house are houses 3 (june) and 5 (february), it follows that the librarian must be in one of the other houses.

15. Since we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender, and since the bartender cannot be in house 9 (september) nor house 2 (ranch-style), it follows that the only remaining houses for the bartender are house 10 (march) and one of the houses 1 to 8. However, since we assumed that the ranch-style house is a fan of folk and can't be in house 9 (september), it follows that the bartender cannot be in house 2 (ranch-style) either.

At this point, we have narrowed down the possible houses for each character significantly but are unable to make definitive conclusions without more information or assumptions. For example, if we assume that the motorbike driver is the person with a birthday in July (house 6), then we can deduce the rest of the positions. However, this assumption requires knowledge that isn't given in the puzzle. Therefore, without additional information or making assumptions, it is not possible to determine the exact position of each character.

Motorbikemaster: Unable to determine with current information."	motorbikemaster:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_motorbikemaster_10	motorbikemaster	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Assign variables to each person and their corresponding characteristics:
   - A (Trance, Train)
   - B (Reggae, September, Subway, Wooden House, ?)
   - C (Rock, Palace House, ?)
   - D (Ambient, Bartender, ?)
   - E (Folk, Left of Motorbike, Quad-Bike, May, ?)
   - F (Librarian, Left or right of June, Left or Right of Futuristic house, ?)
   - G (Motorbike, Ranch-style House, ?)

2. Based on the given information, we can start to find the positions and characteristics of each person:
   4. B is driving the subway, so B=Subway. Since D is left of Motorbike (G), G must be right of D, so D<G. C cannot be G because C is Palace House, not Ranch-style. So let's assume G = Motorbikemaster for now (we will revisit this later).
   5. From 4, B is on the left of snowmobile, which means there should be another person between B and snowmobile. Let's call that person H (Snowmobile, ?, ?, ?, ?). Since E has Folk music preference and is on the left of Motorbike, it follows that E<G. We also know that E is not B because E was born in September, and B was born in May or June or July or February.
   6. From 6, E is the person with a birthday in May. So E=May. But wait! We just established that E is on the left of Motorbike (G), which means E can't be G (Motorbikemaster) because we have already assigned G as having a May birthday. This contradicts our assumption, so let's reassign G to another character, say K (Motorbike, Ranch-style House, ?).
   7. From 7, the mechanic drives the quad-bike, so E=Quad-Bike. But we already assigned E as having a May birthday, which is inconsistent with being the Mechanic since Mechanics have birthdays in different months. Let's reassign E to another character, say L (Mechanic, Quad-Bike).
   8. Since H has Snowmobile and is not B, it means that H is born in a month other than May or September. The remaining possibilities are February, June, or July. So H=February if there's no one else with the same birth month.
   9. From 10 and 15, we know F and G must be adjacent since the Librarian is on the left or right of both of them. As G (K) is Ranch-style House, the only possible position for F is between K and G.
   Now we have:
   - B (Subway, Wooden House, Reggae, September)
   - C (Palace House, Rock, ?)
   - D (Left of Motorbike, Ambient, Bartender, ?)
   - E (May or June or July, Quad-Bike, Mechanic, Folk)
   - F (Librarian, Left or right of June, ?)
   - G (Motorbikemaster, Ranch-style House, ?)
   - H (Snowmobile, February, ?, ?)
   10. From 14, D is on the left of Motorbike (K), so E cannot be D since E drives Quad-Bike and Motorbikes have different driving positions. So let's reassign D to another character, say I (Ambient, Bartender).
   11. From 11, L is on the left or right of the person with a July birthday. Since there is only one possible position for F (Librarian), it follows that L cannot be F because F has already been assigned to have a July birthday. This contradicts our assumption, so let's reassign F to another character, say J (Librarian).
   12. From 13, I is the fan of Ambient music. Since I is not E (Mechanic), it means I must be a different person. I cannot be C since C is Palace House and there's already a house assigned to each character. So let's reassign C to another character, say H (Snowmobile, ?).
   13. From 9, D (I) is on the left of Motorbike (K), so E cannot be D since we know that E drives Quad-Bike and Motorbikes have different driving positions. This contradicts our assumption, so let's reassign D to another character, say J (Librarian).
   14. Since there are only 5 houses, and G is Ranch-style House, the remaining possibilities for H's house are gothic-revival or futuristic. Since F (J) is a Librarian and is on the left of June, it means that K (Motorbikemaster) must be right of June. As G is Ranch-style House, the only remaining possibility for H's house is gothic-revival. So we have:
   - B (Subway, Wooden House, Reggae, September)
   - C (gothic-Revival House, Rock, ?)
   - D (Left of Motorbike, Ambient, Bartender, ?)
   - E (May or June or July, Quad-Bike, Mechanic, Folk)
   - F (Librarian, Left or right of June)
   - G (Motorbikemaster, Ranch-style House, ?)
   - H (Snowmobile, gothic-Revival House, ?)
   15. From 8, the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since K (Motorbikemaster) is right of June, it means that F must be to the left of K. As there's only one possible position for F (Librarian), it follows that G (K) must be on the far right since F and K are adjacent. So we have:
   - B (Subway, Wooden House, Reggae, September)
   - C (gothic-Revival House, Rock, ?)
   - D (Left of Motorbike, Ambient, Bartender, ?)
   - E (May or June or July, Quad-Bike, Mechanic, Folk)
   - F (Librarian, Left of K)
   - G (Motorbikemaster, Ranch-style House, Far right)
   16. From 3, C is the Palace House. Since there's only one possible position for C (gothic-revival house), it means that B must be on the far left and H must be on the far right. As E is not H due to their different driving positions, it follows that D cannot be E since we know that E drives Quad-Bike and Motorbikes have different driving positions. So let's reassign D to another character, say I (Ambient, Bartender).
   Finally, we have:
   - B (Subway, Wooden House, Reggae, September)
   - C (Palace House, Rock, ?)
   - D (Left of B)
   - E (May or June or July, Quad-Bike, Mechanic, Folk)
   - F (Librarian, Left of K)
   - G (Motorbikemaster, Ranch-style House, Far right)
   - H (Snowmobile, gothic-Revival House, Far left)
   Now we can easily solve the rest of the problem:
   - Since there are only 5 houses and B is on the far left, it means that I must be on the second position (left of C). So I becomes the owner of the Wooden house.
   - Since H is on the far right and G is Ranch-style House, it follows that D must be on the third position since there's only one remaining position for a house. So D becomes the owner of the gothic-Revival house.
   - Finally, C becomes the owner of the Palace house, and E drives the Quad-Bike.

The solution is:
- B (Subway, Wooden House, Reggae, September): I (Ambient, Bartender)
- C (Palace House, Rock, ?): C (Snowmobile, ?)
- D (Left of B): H (Snowmobile, gothic-Revival House, Far left)
- E (May or June or July, Quad-Bike, Mechanic, Folk): E (Quad-Bike, Mechanic, Folk)
- F (Librarian, Left of K): J (Librarian, Left of K)
- G (Motorbikemaster, Ranch-style House, Far right): K (Motorbikemaster, Ranch-style House, Far right)"	motorbikemaster:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_1	mechanic	5	" Let's solve this step-by-step:

From points 8 and 5, we know that the gothic-revival house (which represents the architect) is in the middle, and the person driving the subway (which represents the wooden house) is at position 5. So the architect is at position 3 and the mechanic is not 5 (because he's not the one driving the subway).

From point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since it's not the fifth house (as explained above), it must be either the first or the second house. Let's assume for now that the motorbikemaster is the first house.

From point 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver is at position 1 and the fans of trance (train driver), rock (palace), and ambient (bartender) are already assigned, the only option left for the fan of folk is to be at position 2 or 4. However, if the fan of folk was at position 2, it would violate point 9 (the fan of folk should be on the far left, but in this case, the fan of rock would be on the far left). So the fan of folk must be at position 4.

Now we know that the person driving the motorbike is at position 1 and the fan of folk is at position 4. Since the fans of trance (train driver), rock (palace), ambient (bartender), and reggae (September birthday) are already assigned, only the fans of quad-bike (mechanic) and librarian are left to be placed.

From point 17, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since the June birthday is not yet assigned and the only possible places for the June birthday are positions 2 (if the motorbike driver is the first house) or position 6 (if the motorbike driver is the second house), we can't place the librarian yet.

From point 18, we know that the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we don't know where the mechanic is, we also can't place the July birthday yet.

Since we can't determine the positions for the librarian and the July birthday without more information, I can't provide a definitive answer for where the mechanic is. However, if we assume that the motorbike driver is the first house (which places the fan of folk at position 4), then we can try to find the possible positions for the mechanic by placing the librarian on the left or right of the June birthday and the July birthday on the left or right of the mechanic. This would give us multiple possibilities, but without more information, I can't narrow it down further."	mechanic:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_2	mechanic	5	" To solve this puzzle, let's first identify the characteristics we have for each person/thing:

1. Transport: motorbike, subway, train, snowmobile, quad-bike
2. Music-genres: trance, rock, ambient, folk, reggae
3. House: ranch-style, wooden, gothic-revival, palace, futuristic
4. Jobs: motorbikemaster, mechanic, architect, bartender, librarian
5. Birthdays: June, May, September, February, July

From the given information, we can deduce some relationships between these characteristics:

1. The fan of trance uses the train (1)
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (4)
3. The fan of rock lives in the palace (5)
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile driver, and also lives in the wooden house (6-7)
5. The architect has a birthday in May (8)
6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (9)
7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (10)
8. The fan of folk is either on the far left or on the left or right of the motorbike driver (11-12)
9. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June or the futuristic house (13-14)
10. The fan of ambient is the bartender (15)

Now let's use these relationships to solve for each characteristic one by one:

- For transport, we can see that the quad-bike driver is the mechanic and the subway driver lives in the wooden house. By process of elimination, the motorbike drives a motorbike, the snowmobile rides a snowmobile, and since the train is taken by the trance fan, the last one (train) must be the person driving the train.
- For music-genres, we already know who the fans are for reggae, rock, and ambient. Since the fan of folk can either be on the far left or next to the motorbike driver, we don't have enough information to determine their exact position yet. However, since the librarian must be on the same side as one of these two people (either the person with a birthday in June or the futuristic house), we can conclude that neither the person with a birthday in June nor the futuristic house can be the fan of folk. So, it means that the remaining person with a birthday in February must be the fan of folk.
- For houses, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, and now we also know that neither the person with a birthday in June nor the futuristic house can be the fan of folk. Therefore, the ranch-style house (which is the motorbikemaster) must be on one side, and the remaining houses will be placed accordingly.
- For jobs, we already found who the mechanic is. Since the librarian must be on the same side as either the person with a birthday in June or the futuristic house, and since we know that the fan of folk can't be on the same side as the person with a birthday in June or the futuristic house, it means the librarian is on the same side as the person with a birthday in July. The rest of the jobs will be placed accordingly.
- For birthdays, we already know them all except for the exact positioning. Since we know that the librarian must be on the left or right of the person with a birthday in July, we can start by placing the person with a birthday in July somewhere and then arrange the rest based on their relationships.

Finally, here's the final arrangement:

1. Transport: motorbike(mechanic), subway(wooden house), train(trance fan), snowmobile, quad-bike(motorbikemaster)
2. Music-genres: trance, reggae(September), rock(palace), folk(February), ambient(bartender)
3. House: ranch-style(motorbikemaster), wooden(subway), gothic-revival(middle), palace(rock fan), futuristic(?)
4. Jobs: motorbikemaster, mechanic, architect, bartender(ambient fan), librarian(left or right of July birthday)
5. Birthdays: June, May(architect), September(reggae fan), February(folk fan), July(librarian's neighbor)

Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to determine the exact positioning of all people, but with this arrangement, you can continue solving by using the remaining clues and identifying who is next to whom."	mechanic:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_3	mechanic	5	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a table to organize the information and then work our way through the clues. Here's the table I set up:

| Transport | Music-genre | House  | Job       | Birthday Month | Position (from left) |
|-----------|------------|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
|           | trance     |       | motorbikemaster|june             |                    |
| subway    |            | wooden |            |                 | 1st (left)          |
| snowmobile |            | gothic-revival  |             |               | 2nd (middle)      |
|           | reggae     | palace   |            | september       | 3rd               |
| train     | trance     |        | architect  | may             |                    |
| quad-bike |            | futuristic | mechanic         |                 |                    |
|           | rock       |          | bartender    | july            |                    |
|           | folk       |          | librarian     | february        |                    |

Let's go through the clues:
1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train, so we know that the train driver prefers trance and is an architect (since the architect has a birthday in May).
2. The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September, which means the snowmobile driver must prefer Rock since they are on the left of the subway driver (who prefers Trance).
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, so we know that the architect lives in a palace.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, which means the subway driver prefers either Ambient or Folk (since we already know the genre preferences for Trance and Rock). The subway driver also lives in a wooden house.
5. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, it must be occupied by either the fan of folk (who can be on the left or right) or the librarian (also can be on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in June). Given that we don't have enough information to determine the exact position for the fan of Folk yet, let's assume the gothic-revival house is occupied by the librarian.
6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May, so we know this person is not on the far left (since the fan of Folk must be on the far left if the gothic-revival house is the librarian).
7. The quad-bike driver is the mechanic, which means the mechanic prefers either Ambient or Reggae (since we already know the genre preferences for Trance, Rock, and Folk). We also know that the mechanic lives in a futuristic house.
8. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the gothic-revival house (librarian) can't be the fan of Folk, it means the fan of Folk must be either on the far left (if the mechanic prefers Reggae) or one position to the right of the mechanic if the mechanic prefers Ambient.
9. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, which we already know houses the mechanic. Given that the fan of Folk can't be the gothic-revival house (librarian), the only remaining option for the librarian is to be on the far right if the fan of Folk prefers Ambient or one position to the left if the fan of Folk prefers Reggae.
10. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, which means the mechanic (since they drive a quad-bike) can't be the motorbikemaster and can't live in a ranch-style house.
11. The subway driver lives in a wooden house (we know this from clue 4), so the person whose birthday is in July can't be the subway driver since they must be either the mechanic or librarian, and both are on the right of the subway driver.
12. Given all the previous observations, we find that the mechanic can only prefer Ambient music (to be next to the fan of Folk) and live in a futuristic house (since the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house). With this information, the only possible arrangement for the table is as follows:

| Transport | Music-genre | House  | Job       | Birthday Month | Position (from left) |
|-----------|------------|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
|           | trance     | ranch-style   | motorbikemaster|june             | 1st                |
| subway    | ambient    | wooden | architect  | may             | 2nd                |
| snowmobile| rock       | gothic-revival  |            | september        | 3rd               |
| train     | trance     | palace   |            |                 | 4th                |
| quad-bike | ambient    | futuristic | mechanic         | july              | 5th (far right)    |
|           | folk       |          | bartender    | february        |                    |

With this arrangement, the librarian is on the far left since the fan of Folk can't be the gothic-revival house (librarian), and we know the librarian can only live in a house to the left of the futuristic house (mechanic).

So, **mechanic: 5** (far right position)."	mechanic:1	mechanic:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_4	mechanic	5	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down into steps. We will start by assigning temporary names to each unknown variable (transport, music-genre, house, job) and then gradually reveal their actual values based on the given clues.

Let's denote the 5 people as A, B, C, D, E and their corresponding attributes as follows:
- Transport (T): motorbike, subway, train, snowmobile, quad-bike
- Music-genre (M): trance, rock, ambient, folk, reggae
- House (H): ranch-style, wooden, gothic-revival, palace, futuristic
- Job (J): motorbikemaster, mechanic, architect, bartender, librarian
- Birthday Month (BM): june, may, september, february, july

Let's begin with the clues:

1. A_M = trance, and A_T = train
2. B_M = reggae, B_BM = september
3. C_M = rock, C_H = palace
4. D_T < E_T (The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile)
5. D_H = wooden
6. E_BM = may
7. F_T = quad-bike, and F_J = mechanic (Letter F represents the unknown person who drives the quad-bike since we know that the mechanic is among them.)
8. G_H = gothic-revival, and G_T < H_T (The gothic-revival house is in the middle and not the first or last)
9. H_M = folk, H_T > A_T (The fan of folk is on the far left, so the person driving the motorbike should be to the right of them.)
10. I_BM = june, and I_J = librarian or neighbor of I (Letter I represents the unknown person whose birthday is in June since we know that the librarian has this attribute.)
11. K_BM = july, and K is either left or right of F (Since K's birthday is in July, they should be on the same row as F, so K must be to the left or right of the mechanic.)
12. L_H = ranch-style, and L_J = motorbikemaster
13. M_M = ambient, and M_J = bartender
14. N_M = folk, and N_T > A_T (The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike.)
15. O_H = futuristic, and I_JO (The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house)

Now let's proceed with solving the puzzle step by step using these clues:

Step 1: Since the fan of trance drives a train and we know that it is not the first or last position, A cannot be the motorbike or quad-bike driver. It must be either subway or snowmobile. Let's assume A_T = subway for now.

Step 2: Now let's find the fan of folk. We know that they are on the far left and not in the first position (as the motorbike is already assigned to L). So, N must be either snowmobile or quad-bike. Since the mechanic drives a quad-bike, N cannot be a quad-bike, so N = snowmobile.

Step 3: With the fan of folk now found, we know that H_T > A_T. Since A is driving a subway, H cannot be a subway. So, H_T < E_T (as D_T < E_T). It also means that H cannot be in the last position since the futuristic house is not the last one.

Step 4: Let's assign the remaining two transport options to the unknown people: T = motorbike and Y = snowmobile. We still don't know who drives each of them.

Step 5: Now let's find the person whose birthday is in July (K). Since K_BM = july and they should be either left or right of F, we can deduce that E_BM cannot be july since it's already assigned to may. So, K_T must be different from both A_T and D_T. It also means that K_T != T (since A_T = subway and D_T is already determined). Thus, K_T = motorbike.

Step 6: Now we know that the librarian has a birthday in June (I_BM = june), so I_J must be librarian. Since I is not a neighbor of F (mechanic) and O_H = futuristic, the only possible position for the librarian is on the left side of the futuristic house. It also means that L cannot be the first position since L_H = ranch-style, which leaves us with I in the second position.

Step 7: With the librarian assigned, we can deduce that the motorbikemaster is now in the third position (since L_J = motorbikemaster and I_J = librarian). It also means that L_T = motorbike.

Step 8: Now let's find the person driving the snowmobile (Y). Since the snowmobile is not the first position, D cannot drive it. So, Y can be either A, E, or G. However, since A and E have their music-genres assigned, it must be either Y = G_T or Y = K_T (since we already know that K drives a motorbike).

Step 9: Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (G_H), Y cannot be G_T, so Y = K_T.

Step 10: Now we have all transport options assigned, and it's time to assign jobs based on their houses. Since L_H = ranch-style, L_J = motorbikemaster, J is already assigned to A, E, G (mechanic), I, and K (librarian) except architect. It also means that the architect must be either B or H.

Step 11: We know that C_M = rock and C_H = palace, so it leaves us with B_J = architect since J is already assigned to A, E, G (mechanic), I, and K (librarian) except motorbikemaster, bartender, and librarian.

Step 12: With the architect assigned, we can deduce that H_J = architect since it's the only remaining job for H. It also means that B_M = rock.

Step 13: Now let's find the person driving the quad-bike (F). Since F_J = mechanic and we already know who the librarian, motorbikemaster, architect are, it must be either D or Y (E). However, since we have already assigned Y, it means that F = D_T.

Step 14: Now with all transport options and jobs assigned, it's time to find music-genres for the remaining people based on their houses. Since B_J = architect, B_M must be either trance or jazz since trance is already assigned to A. Let's assume B_M = jazz. It also means that E_M = pop since it's the only remaining music-genre for E.

Step 15: With the last two music-genres assigned, we have completed solving the puzzle. Here's the final solution:

A_T = subway, A_M = trance
B_J = architect, B_M = jazz
C_T = palace, C_M = rock
D_T = quad-bike, D_M = pop
E_T = motorbike, E_M = pop
F_T = snowmobile, F_M = trance (not specified)
G_T = motorbike, G_M = jazz (not specified)
I_T = none, I_J = librarian

Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_5	mechanic	5	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train, but we don't have any information about their position yet. So we can't place them yet.
2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September. Since we don't know the exact order yet, we can't place this person either.
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, but since houses don't drive or have birthdays, we can't place this information yet.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. We don't know who these people are yet, so we can't place them.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house, but since houses don't drive, we can't place this information yet.
6. The architect is the person who's birthday is in May. We don't know who this is yet, so we can't place them.
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since we don't know where the quad-bike driver is placed, we can't place the mechanic yet.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. We don't have enough information to place this house yet.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since we don't know who the fan of folk is, we can't place them yet.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. We don't have enough information to place either the librarian or the June-born person yet.
11. The person who's birthday is in July's is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we don't know where the mechanic is, we can't place the July-born person yet.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Again, since houses don't have jobs, we can't place this information yet.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. We don't know who the bartender is, so we can't place them yet.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we don't know the fan of folk and the motorbike driver, we can't place this information yet.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Again, since we don't have enough information to place either the librarian or the futuristic house, we can't solve this yet.

Since we can't place any of the people based on the given clues, it's impossible to determine where the mechanic is without more information.

**Final answer: Can't be determined with the given information.**"	mechanic:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_6	mechanic	5	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign each transport (T), music-genre (M), job (J), house (H), and month of birth (B) to a person (P): P1, P2, ..., P5.

2. From statements 1 - 4, we can deduce that T3 = train, M3 = reggae, H5 = subway, H2 = wooden. We also know the relative positions of P4 (subway) and P5 (snowmobile).

3. From statement 6, P2 = architect has birthday in May. Since we already know that H5 is wooden, it must be the architect's house. So, P2 = (architect: House2).

4. Now, from statements 7 - 8, we can deduce that T1 = motorbike, J1 = mechanic, and H1 = quad-bike. Since Gothic-revival is in the middle, H3 must be gothic-revival. So, P3 = (gothic-revival: House3).

5. From statements 9 - 10, we can deduce that M1 = folk and P4 = motorbike. Since P4 is on the left of the person driving the motorbike (which is P1), P4 < P1.

6. Now, from statement 11, the person with birthday in July must be on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we already know that P5 = mechanic and P7 = July's birthday, P7 < P5.

7. From statements 12 - 13, we can deduce that M5 = ambient and J5 = bartender. Since motorbikemaster is a ranch-style house (H4), it must be P4. So, P4 = (motorbikemaster: House4).

8. From statement 14, we know that P1 (folk) is on the left or right of P4 (motorbike). Since P4 < P1 and P4 is already placed on the left, P1 must be on the right of P4.

9. Finally, from statement 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (H5). Since P2 (architect) is in the wooden house and P5 (mechanic) is already placed, there are only two houses left for the librarian. If the librarian were on the left side, it would contradict statement 9 that the fan of folk is on the far left. Therefore, the librarian must be on the right of H5 (futuristic house), and since the mechanic is already placed on the left, the librarian must be P3. So, P3 = (librarian: House1).

10. Now we know the positions of all people except for P5 (mechanic) and P5's transport and job are known. Since T2 is not taken yet, Mechanic drives the snowmobile (T2). However, without more information about the relative positioning of the remaining people, we cannot determine Mechanic's exact position.

Therefore, the answer to your question **mechanic: Undetermined** due to insufficient information about the positions of the other people."	mechanic:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_7	mechanic	5	"1. Let's assign numbers to each transport: Motorbike = 1, Subway = 2, Train = 3, Snowmobile = 4, Quad-bike = 5
    (Note: The order of the people is from left to right)

    From point 7, we know that the person driving the quad-bike (5) is the mechanic.

    So **mechanic: 5**

    Now let's solve other positions based on given points. I will not list each step as it becomes too lengthy and may not be easily readable, but you can follow the logic with the given statements.

    Here is the final arrangement of people based on our solving steps:

    - Mechanic (Quad-bike, 5)
    - Bartender (Ambient)
    - Architect (Palace)
    - Librarian (Ranch-style, left of June or Futuristic house)
    - Motorbikemaster (Motorbike, on the right of Librarian or July)
    - Subway (Wooden house, left of Snowmobile)
    - Person driving the snowmobile (Snowmobile, far right)
    - Reggae fan (September birthday, Rock)
    - Folk fan (Left of Motorbike, on the right of June or Futuristic house)
    - Trance fan (Train)
    - July birthday (Left or right of Mechanic)
    - Futuristic house (Right of Librarian or February)
    - June birthday (On the left of someone with a birthday in July or leftmost position)"	mechanic:1	mechanic:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_8	mechanic	5	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify relationships between variables:
   - Transport and music-genre: 1 trance = train, 1 reggae = sept birthday, 1 rock = palace, etc.
   - House and job: 1 ranch-style = motorbikemaster, 1 gothic-revival = middle position, 1 futuristic = unknown position, etc.
   - Birthday month: 1 june, 1 may, 1 september, 1 february, 1 july are given positions (unknown for now).
   - Position on the line: 1 left of subway is snowmobile, 1 wooden house = subway, 1 gothic-revival = middle, 1 fan of folk = far left or left/right of motorbike, etc.
   - Additional relationships: librarian is left/right of june, july or mechanic; motorbike master is ranch-style house, ambient = bartender, folk = left/right motorbike, etc.

2. Assign initial positions (tentative):
   - Since the fan of reggae has a sept birthday, we can assign it to person 5 and place it in the position for sept birthday (unknown).
   - From points 4 and 5, we know that subway is the wooden house. So, we can assign person 3 to the subway and place it between snowmobile and gothic-revival.
   - From point 7, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. We will assign it to person 4 but won't place it yet as we need more information.

3. Build on initial assignments:
   - Since motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (person 2), and person 1 drives a transport that is not motorbike, quad-bike or snowmobile, person 1 can't be the mechanic, so let's assign it to ambient music. Now we know that person 1 drives trance (not train) as point 1 suggests.
   - Since the fan of folk is on the far left or left/right of motorbike, and we already have two people assigned, there must be another person (3) with folk music. So let's assign it to person 2 and place it on the far left since trance and reggae are already placed.
   - Since gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 3), and we already have three people assigned, there must be another two people with jobs of architect or librarian. So let's assign architect to person 5 and place it in the palace house (4).
   - Now we can place the librarian on the left or right of the june birthday (1), considering that motorbikemaster, folk fan, and mechanic are already placed. Let's place the librarian on the right side for now.

4. Eliminate possible positions for the quad-bike driver:
   - Since the left of june is occupied by the librarian (6), the motorbikemaster, folk fan, and architect are to its right. However, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike and cannot be in position 3 as it's gothic-revival house. So, the only remaining possibility is position 4.

5. Finalize positions:
   - We have already assigned and placed all people except for person 4 (mechanic) and person 1 with unknown jobs and music preferences.
   - Since quad-bike driver (mechanic) must be in position 4, the only transport option left is snowmobile. But it's not possible to determine its exact position as we don't know who drives it yet.
   - To place person 1, we notice that trance cannot drive train since someone else already has that preference (point 1). So, person 1 must be driving the motorbike and prefer ambient music as suggested in our tentative assignments. Now we can finalize the positions of all people except for motorbike driver and librarian.

6. Conclusion:
   - Final positions (in order): 4-quad-bike, 1-ambient, 2-folk, 3-subway, 5-architect, 6-librarian (right of june), 7-reggae, 8-gothic-revival, 9-trance
   - It's impossible to determine the position of motorbike driver and the exact position of snowmobile due to insufficient information."	mechanic:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_9	mechanic	5	" To solve this logic puzzle, we'll use a combination of deduction and backtracking. Let's assign numbers to each person based on their birthday month.
1. June = 1, May = 2, September = 3, February = 4, July = 5.

From the clues, we can start by placing people in their houses and vehicles:

1. We know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train (point 1). The train driver cannot be on the left side because the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (points 4 & 5). So, the train driver is the middle vehicle (3rd place in the order), and since the gothic-revival house (4th house) is in the middle (point 8), the train driver must be living in the wooden house (1st house). Therefore, the fan of trance is the person with birthday in May (2nd number).
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (3rd number). But we already placed the train driver in the wooden house. So, reggae cannot be the driver of the train and must belong to one of the other vehicles. Since the quad-bike is driven by the mechanic (point 7), the reggae fan cannot be the mechanic.
3. The fan of rock lives in the palace house (4th house). But we already placed the train driver in the wooden house. So, rock cannot be the driver of the train and must belong to one of the other vehicles. Since the quad-bike is driven by the mechanic and the reggae fan cannot be the mechanic, the only vehicle left for rock is the snowmobile.
4. The person driving the subway lives in a wooden house (1st house). So, the subway driver has a birthday in June or May (1st or 2nd number). Since the train driver has a birthday in May and the fan of trance is the train driver, the subway driver cannot be the fan of trance. The only option left for the subway driver is the fan of rock (3rd number), so the person with birthday in June must be driving the motorbike or the snowmobile.
5. Since we placed the fans of reggae and rock, there's only one genre left for the July person. The July person cannot drive the train, subway, quad-bike or snowmobile as they were all assigned. So, the July person must be driving the motorbike.
6. The architect has a birthday in May (2nd number). Since we know that the fan of trance is also the May person (and cannot be the architect), the only job left for the May person is the bartender (point 13).
7. Now, let's analyze the remaining vehicle drivers: The motorbike driver has a birthday in either June or July (1st or 5th number) and cannot be the architect (6th point), so the motorbike driver must be the mechanic (7th point).
8. Since we know that the motorbike driver is the mechanic, the only remaining vehicle left for the February person is the subway. So, the snowmobile driver has a birthday in either September or February (3rd or 4th number) and cannot be the architect (6th point), so the snowmobile driver must be the fan of folk (14th point).
9. Since we know that the snowmobile driver is the fan of folk, the only remaining vehicle left for the June person is the quad-bike. So, the librarian has a birthday in either July or February (5th or 4th number) and cannot be on the far left (9th point), so the librarian must be on the right of the person who's birthday is in june (10th point).
10. Since we know that the quad-bike driver is the mechanic, the only job left for the July person is the librarian. So, the July person cannot be on the far left (11th point), so the July person must be on the right of the mechanic.
11. The futuristic house (5th house) is on the far right (since the gothic-revival house is in the middle and the ranch-style house is on the far left). Since we know that the librarian is on the right of the June person, the only remaining house for the February person is the futuristic house.
12. We already placed the train driver (May), so the fan of trance cannot be the motorbikemaster (12th point). Since the motorbike and snowmobile drivers are taken, the only vehicle left for the motorbikemaster is the quad-bike. So, the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (2nd house).
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (6th point), so the fan of folk must be on the far left (9th point). Since we know that the snowmobile driver is the fan of folk, the only remaining job for the September person is the mechanic (7th point).
14. Since we already placed the fan of reggae, trance, rock, and ambient, the only genre left for the January or December person is folk. But since the July person is already assigned as the librarian, there are no more available jobs left. So, we cannot place the February or October person in the remaining house.

At this point, we have placed all people in their houses and vehicles, but there is a contradiction regarding the job assignments for the February and October persons. Since there's an inconsistency in our current arrangement, it means that our assumptions about the positions of some people are incorrect, and we need to revise them.

To solve this puzzle, let's reconsider the positions of the June person (motorbike driver) and the librarian (July person). Instead of having the July person on the right of the mechanic, let's move them so that the librarian is on the far left. This allows us to place the February person as the snowmobile driver and the October person as the architect, making it possible for the other people to have their respective jobs as well.

With these adjustments, we can now place everyone in their correct positions:
- The fan of trance (May) is driving the train
- The fan of reggae (September) is driving the snowmobile
- The fan of rock (June) is driving the motorbike
- The quad-bike driver (Mechanic, July) is on the far left
- The librarian (February) is on the far left
- The architect (May) is in the palace house
- The bartender (Ambient fan, October) is in the futuristic house

By revising our initial assumptions, we were able to find a solution that meets all the given conditions. So the mechanic is on the far left (**mechanic:1**)."	mechanic:1	mechanic:1	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_mechanic_10	mechanic	5	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of reggae (September) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the fan of trance (Train) is in position 1 (as Train is before Subway in alphabetical order), and the fan of rock (Palace) is in position 3, the only possible positions for the reggae fan are either position 2 or 4. But since the mechanic (which we'll find later) is the person driving the quad-bike (Q), and according to point 7, the mechanic is next to the motorbike driver, so the reggae fan cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the reggae fan must be in position 2.

2. Now we know that the reggae fan is in position 2, so the person in position 1 (Train) must be a fan of trance.

3. From point 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle, so the houses are arranged as follows: Motorbike -> Quad-bike -> Subway/Snowmobile -> Train/Motorbike -> Wooden House -> Gothic-Revival House -> Palace

4. From points 4 and 5, we know that the subway driver (Subway is S) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (Snowmobile is SM). Therefore, the arrangement of transport is: Motorbike -> Quad-bike -> Subway -> Snowmobile -> Train/Motorbike

5. From point 6, we know that the architect is in position 3 (Palace), so the job arrangement is: Bartender -> Mechanic -> Architect -> Librarian or June Person -> Motorbikemaster

6. From points 10 and 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, which must be the last house (as it's alphabetical order). Therefore, the job arrangement becomes: Bartender -> Mechanic -> Architect -> Librarian -> Motorbikemaster

7. From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender, so the music genre arrangement is: Trance -> Rock/Reggae (we don't know yet) -> Ambient -> Folk -> Reggae or Trance (we don't know yet)

8. From point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, which must be the first house (as it's alphabetical order). Therefore, the music genre arrangement becomes: MotorbikeMaster's genre -> Rock/Reggae (we don't know yet) -> Ambient -> Folk -> Reggae or Trance

9. From point 11 and the fact that we already know the librarian is on the left or right of the mechanic, we know that the person with a birthday in July must be either the left neighbor or right neighbor of the mechanic. But since the mechanic (which we'll find later) is next to the motorbike driver, the only possible position for the July person is as the far right person.

10. Now we know that the July person is on the far right, so the left neighbor of the July person must be the mechanic. But since the motorbike driver and mechanic are neighbors, the mechanic (Q) must be the second from the last person. Therefore, the music genre arrangement becomes: MotorbikeMaster's genre -> Rock/Reggae (Rock is in position 3, so Reggae must be in position 2) -> Ambient -> Folk -> Q (Quad-bike, which means Mechanic)

11. Finally, we know that the music genre arrangement is: Trance -> Reggae (position 2) -> Ambient (position 3) -> Folk (position 4) -> Quad-bike (position 5). Since trance and ambient are before reggae in alphabetical order, and folk and quad-bike are after reggae in alphabetical order, the final arrangement of people is: Trance Fan (MotorbikeMaster) -> Reggae Fan (September Person) -> Ambient Fan (Bartender) -> Folk Fan (Far Left Person) -> Mechanic

Therefore, **mechanic: 5**."	mechanic:1	mechanic:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_1	architect	8	" Let's break this down step by step and assign numbers to each person based on their respective conditions:

1. Assign '1' to Trance (since it's first alphabetically) and '5' to Reggae, as September is the 9th month.
2. Since Rock comes before Ambient in alphabetical order, assign '2' to Rock. This also means that '4' will be assigned to Ambient and '3' to Folk (as there are only four music-genres).

Now let's create a transport system based on the given conditions:

1. Subway is always '0', so assign the remaining transports to numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 in any order as we don't have enough conditions yet to specify their positions. Let's say Motorbike = 2, Train = 3, Snowmobile = 4, Quad-bike = 5.

Now let's place the people based on the given conditions:

1. Place the person who prefers Trance (Train) in position 3 as it's a number not yet assigned to any transport. This leaves us with Motorbike, Subway, Snowmobile, and Quad-bike for the remaining positions.
2. Since the person driving the Subway is on the left of the person driving the Snowmobile, we can place Subway in position 1 (leftmost) and Snowmobile in position 2 (next to the left). This leaves us with Motorbike and Quad-bike for the remaining positions.
3. Now we know that Motorbike is the ranch-style house, so it should be placed somewhere other than positions 1, 2 or 3 (as those are already assigned to Subway, Snowmobile, and Train). Let's place Motorbike in position 4 (next to the right of Snowmobile). This leaves us with Quad-bike for the last transport position.
4. Since the Quad-bike is being driven by the mechanic, and the mechanic must be placed next to someone who has a birthday in June or July, we can only place the Quad-bike at positions 2, 3, or 5 (since those are the remaining positions). Let's try placing Quad-bike in position 5.
5. Now we know that if the Quad-bike is at position 5, the mechanic must be on its left, and since librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (June is the 6th month), the only remaining option for the mechanic is position 4.
6. With the mechanic at position 4, the only option for the person with a June birthday (June is the 6th month) is position 2 (on the left of the Quad-bike).
7. Now we know that the fan of Folk music is on the far left, and there are already three people assigned positions to the left of the Quad-bike. Therefore, the only remaining option for the person with a birthday in February (as it's the 2nd month) is position 1. This leaves us with position 3 for the person who prefers Ambient music.
8. Since the architect has a birthday in May, we can place them at position 6. However, there are no remaining positions to place the architect according to our current arrangement. We made an error in placing the Quad-bike at position 5, and it should have been placed at position 4 instead.

Correcting the mistake:
With the mechanic at position 4, the only option for the person with a June birthday (June is the 6th month) is position 2. Now, since the Quad-bike is at position 4 (next to the June-born person), we can place the librarian at position 5 (as they are on the left or right of the person with a June birthday).

Now let's try placing the remaining people:
Since the fan of Rock is the palace house, and the only remaining positions for houses are positions 1, 3, and 6, we can only place the palace at position 1. This leaves us with positions 3 and 6 for the remaining houses (as each house needs to have a different job).
Since the fan of Ambient is the bartender, it should be placed somewhere other than position 3 or 6 as both are already assigned jobs. Let's place the bartender in position 5 (on the right of the librarian), making the house at position 3 a futuristic house. This leaves us with the last house (position 6) to be either gothic-revival or ranch-style.
Since the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, we can place it at position 6 (as that's the only remaining option for houses).
Finally, since the gothic-revival house needs to be in the middle, and there are no more conditions related to houses, we cannot determine its exact position. However, we know that it should be placed between positions 1 and 3 (as those are the only two occupied house positions).

With all positions assigned, we can now find the architect:
As the gothic-revival house is in the middle, it's impossible for the architect to be at position 2 or 3 (as those are the only two remaining positions between gothic-revival and the palace). Therefore, the only remaining option for the architect is position 6.

Final answer: **architect:6**"	architect:3	architect:6	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_2	architect	8	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign a unique number to each month (e.g., June = 1, May = 2, etc.). We now have a list of birthdays: [1, 2, 5, 8, 4].

2. We know that the fan of trance is driving the train, so let's assign transport modes based on the remaining options (motorbike, subway, snowmobile, quad-bike, and we'll temporarily leave the last one unassigned).

3. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, so this person is [5]. Now, since the fan of trance is driving the train, the remaining three transport modes are subway (let's assign 2), snowmobile (let's assign 4), and motorbike (which leaves the last one unassigned but will be assigned later).

4. The fan of rock is the palace house, so this person is [3]. At this point, we only have two transport modes left: subway (2) and snowmobile (4).

5. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (4). Since the subway driver is already assigned to [2], this means the snowmobile driver is on the right side ([1]). Now we have all transport modes assigned: motorbike, subway, train, snowmobile, and quad-bike.

6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, so this person is [7].

7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, which means there are 3 houses before it and 3 after it. Since we know the positions of the palace ([3]) and futuristic (will be assigned later), the remaining available houses are ranch-style, wooden, and the gothic-revival itself. Given that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, the wooden house must be either [2] or [6]. However, since the mechanic already has a position ([7]), if we assign the wooden house to [2], it would leave no available positions for ambient and folk fans. So, let's assume the wooden house is [6]. This means the remaining houses are ranch-style ([12]), gothic-revival ([8]), and futuristic (let's assign 9).

8. The fan of folk is on the far left, so this person is [9] because all other available positions have already been assigned.

9. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, but we don't know the position of the person with a birthday in June yet ([1]). Since the only remaining positions for the librarian are [2] and [8], let's assign the librarian to [8] because it leaves more options available for other assignments.

10. The fan of ambient is the bartender, so this person is [13]. Now we know that the remaining positions are [2], [6], [7], and [9]. Since the mechanic already has a position ([7]), if we assign any of these remaining positions to an available job (motorbikemaster, architect, or bartender), it would violate one of the conditions. Therefore, let's reassign the wooden house from [6] to another position because it doesn't have specific requirements like the other houses.

11. The person who's birthday is in July ([4]) is on the left or right of the mechanic ([7]). Since there are only two positions left ([2] and [8]), the person with a birthday in July cannot be on the left, so this person must be on the right side of the mechanic. This means the wooden house cannot be [6], but it also cannot be [9] because that would place the fan of folk ([9]) too close to the motorbike driver ([12]), violating condition 14. So, let's assign the wooden house to [2].

12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house ([12]). Now we only have three available positions left: [6], [7], and [8]. Since all other positions have been assigned, we can easily determine that the architect must be on position [6] because it's the only remaining job for the wooden house.

The final answer is **architect: 6**."	architect:3	architect:6	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_3	architect	8	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a table to represent each person and their characteristics:

|   | Transport    | Music-genre    | House          | Job           | Birthday Month  |
|---|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 |             | Trance        |               | Motorbikemaster| June            |
| 2 | Subway      |              | Wooden         | Mechanic      | May             |
| 3 |             | Reggae        | Palace         | Architect     |                |
| 4 | Snowmobile  | Rock          | Gothic-revival | Bartender     | September       |
| 5 | Quad-bike   | Ambient      | Futuristic     | Librarian      |                |

From the given clues, we can start by placing some characters:
1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train. Since the transport options are listed in the table horizontally, and the transport driving positions are unknown, let's assume the first row represents the train driver for now. So, the first row should have ""Trance"" under Music-genre.
2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September. We don't know the exact position yet, but since we need to fill the second, fourth, and fifth rows for other clues, let's assume the fourth row represents the person with ""Reggae"" under Music-genre (September).
3. The fan of rock is the palace house. Since we don't have a fixed position for houses yet, let's try placing the third row as the Palace (with ""Rock"" under Music-genre). However, this conflicts with clue 4 since the subway driver can't be in the fourth row. Let's place the third row somewhere else later and find the Subway and Snowmobile positions first.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we don't know which rows represent these drivers, let's assume that row 2 (Subway) is to the left of row 3 (Snowmobile).
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house. We have already assumed that the fourth row represents the Reggae fan and doesn't fit with being the Subway driver, so we can't use this clue yet.
6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May. Since we don't know the exact position yet, let's place it in a position that matches other clues when possible. However, since we can't determine a suitable position for now, let's hold off on this for later.
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. We already know that row 2 (Subway) should be to the left of row 3 (Snowmobile), and quad-bikes are not in those positions. Let's place the Quad-bike driver in the fifth row for now.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since the houses aren't fixed yet, we can try placing Gothic-revival in the third position and see if it fits other clues. However, this conflicts with clue 3 since placing ""Rock"" under Music-genre doesn't let us put Gothic-revival as the third house. Let's place Gothic-revival somewhere else later when we find suitable positions for other houses.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since row 1 already has a fixed genre, let's assume that the first row represents something else (not Motorbikemaster or Folk) to make room for the Folk fan on the far left. We can later place ""Folk"" under the Music-genre of a row after finding suitable positions for other clues.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since we don't have a fixed position yet, let's assume that the June birthday is either the first or second row (Motorbikemaster or Folk). This means the Librarian could be in the third or fifth row.
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we know the position of the Mechanic, let's assume that either row 2 (Subway) or row 5 (Quad-bike) is the July birthday.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. We don't have a fixed position yet for houses, so let's place it somewhere where it doesn't conflict with other clues.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we don't have a fixed position yet, let's assume that the Ambient and Bartender are in one of the remaining rows (not first or second).
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. We know Motorbikemaster can't be in the first row due to clue 9, so let's assume that if the Motorbike driver is in any other row, Folk will be in a position connected to it (either left or right).
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we don't have a fixed position yet for houses, let's assume that the Futuristic house can be in any row where there's an available spot for it and doesn't conflict with other clues.

At this point, we have enough information to start solving the problem but need more constraints to fix the positions of the characters. Let me continue working on this puzzle and provide you with the final answer for **architect** when possible."	architect:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_4	architect	8	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step-by-step and assign numbers to each person. We will use lowercase letters (a, b, c, d, e) to represent the people.

1. From point 1, we know that the fan of trance drives the train, so train = a.
2. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, but we don't have enough information yet to identify this person.
3. From point 4 and 5, we know that subway = b (since it is on the left of snowmobile) and house = e (since it is the wooden house).
4. Since the architect has a birthday in May (point 6), let's assign c as the mechanic since he drives the quad-bike according to point 7, leaving d for the fan of rock.
5. From points 8 and 12, we know that gothic-revival house = b (since it is in the middle) and ranch-style house = a (since the motorbikemaster lives there). This means that e cannot be the motorbike driver (point 1) or the fan of trance, as the train driver has already been assigned. So, let's assume e = librarian temporarily.
6. From point 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left, which means c cannot be the fan of folk since c shares a side with june (point 10). This implies that d = fan of folk.
7. Now that we know d = fan of folk, it means e cannot be the librarian since the librarian is on the same side as the fan of folk (point 15). Therefore, a = librarian.
8. From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender, so bartender = f.
9. From points 11 and 14, we can deduce that july = c (since c shares a side with the mechanic) or d (since d shares a side with the motorbike driver). However, since july has already been assigned to someone else, it must be c (mechanic), which means d is july.
10. Since the fan of folk shares a side with the person driving the motorbike, we know that b = motorbike driver.
11. Finally, from point 15, since the librarian shares a side with the futuristic house, it means that the architect must be the futuristic house, which is g (as e is already assigned).

The final answer is **architect:g**."	architect:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_5	architect	8	" Architect: 3

Here's the logic behind it:

1. From point 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May. Let's denote A for the architect, M for the mechanic, L for the librarian, and so on.
2. Since the architect's birthday is in May and the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (point 10), we can say that either AJ or AI, where J represents the person with a birthday in June. But since the librarian cannot be to the left of the architect according to point 15, we can rule out the possibility of AI. So, AJ.
3. From points 2 and 4, we know that the fan of reggae is in September (R) and the person driving the subway (S) is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile (SM). Since R cannot be to the left (point 9), it means SR or RM. But since the subway is the wooden house (point 5) and from points 7 and 12, we know that the mechanic (M) drives the quad-bike and the motorbikemaster (MM) lives in the ranch-style house, which cannot be a neighbor of the subway according to point 11. Therefore, it must be SMR.
4. From points 8 and 14, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle (G) and the fan of folk (F) is on its left or right. Since the quad-bike driver (M) is also to the left or right of F according to point 7, it means MFG or FMG. But since M cannot be next to G (point 8), it must be FMG.
5. From points 1 and 3, we know that the fan of trance drives the train (T) and S is on its right. Since T must be a neighbor of F according to point 4, it means FTGM or TFMG. But since M cannot be next to G (point 8), it must be TFGM.
6. From points 12 and 13, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (MM) and the fan of ambient is the bartender (B). Since B is a neighbor of M according to point 14, it means MMB or BMM. But since M cannot be next to G (point 8), it must be BMM.
7. From points 11 and 12, we know that the person with a birthday in July (Julys) is on the left or right of M, but not next to it according to point 11. Since the librarian cannot be on the left of J according to point 10, it means JL or LJ. But since L cannot be next to G (point 8), it must be LJ.
8. Now we know that the arrangement is TFGM, BMM, JL, AJ, and SMR from points 3, 5, 7, and 1-2. Since the librarian is not on the left of June (point 10), it means LJ. And since M cannot be next to G (point 8), it must be BMM. So, the final arrangement is TFGM, BMM, JL, AJ, SMR.
9. Since we know the positions of all people except the architect (A), from points 1-2 and 6, we can infer that A is in position 3 (architect: 3)."	architect:3	architect:3	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_6	architect	8	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's first organize the given information into a clear table:

| Transport | Music-genre | House Style  | Job            | Birthday Month |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Motorbike | Trance     | Ranch-style  | Motorbikemaster| June          |
| Subway    | -          | Wooden       | -              | May           |
| Train     | Trance     | -            | -              | September     |
| Snowmobile| -          | Palace       | -              | February      |
| Quad-bike  | -          | Gothic-revival| Mechanic       | July          |
| -         | Rock       | Futuristic   | Architect      | -             |
| -         | Ambient    | -            | Bartender       | -             |
| -         | Folk       | -            | Librarian       | -             |

From the given clues, we can deduce:
1. The fan of trance is driving the train, so Train = Trance
2. The fan of reggae is born in September, so the person with the July birthday must be in Reggae
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, so Rock = Palace
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and the subway is the wooden house. Since Gothic-revival is in the middle, the other houses must be on the right side. So, Subway = Wooden (on the left) and Snowmobile = Palace (on the right)
5. The architect is born in May, so Architect = May
6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, so Quad-bike = Mechanic
7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so Gothic-revival = Subway (on the left) and Snowmobile = Palace (on the right)
8. The fan of folk is on the far left, so Folk = Ranch-style (since Motorbike and Gothic-revival are already assigned to other categories)
9. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June, but we know that the mechanic is born in July, which means they cannot be neighbors. So, Librarian = Train (on the left), and the only remaining option for the person with the June birthday is Motorbike (on the far right)
10. The fan of ambient is the bartender, so Ambient = Bartender
11. The person who's birthday is in Julys is on the left or right of the mechanic, but we already know that the librarian cannot be their neighbor. This means the quad-bike must be on the same side as the mechanic, making Mechanic = Right and Quad-bike = Left.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, so Motorbikemaster = Ranch-style
13. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but we already know that Folk = Ranch-style (on the far right), making Motorbike = Middle.
14. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, and we know that the futuristic house must be on the same side as the mechanic (since Mechanic = Right). So, Librarian = Futuristic (on the far left)
15. The fan of ambient is the bartender, so Ambient = Bartender

Now that we have placed all the people in their respective categories, here's where the **architect** is located:

architect:Middle (since we know the person driving the train = Architect)"	architect:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_7	architect	8	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the person who likes reggae (born in September) is not on the far left (because the fan of folk is there). Since the fan of folk is not driving the motorbike (point 9), this means that the person born in September is driving either the subway, train, snowmobile, quad-bike, or motorbike. As they are not the mechanic (point 7) and not on the far left (point 14), it has to be one of the other four vehicles. Since the fan of trance drives the train (point 1), and the train is not in the middle (points 5, 8, and 12), the person born in September must drive either the subway, snowmobile, quad-bike, or motorbike. Let's assume they drive the subway for now (we will check later if this assumption is correct).

2. From points 6 and 15, we know that the architect is born in May. Since the fan of rock lives in the palace house (point 4) and cannot be the architect (point 6), the architect cannot live in a palace, wooden, gothic-revival, or futuristic house. This leaves us with only one option: the ranch-style house (point 12).

3. From point 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since it cannot be the palace (as explained above), the only remaining options for the middle are the subway, train, snowmobile, quad-bike, or motorbike. However, since the architect lives in a ranch-style house and we assumed that the person born in September drives the subway (which is now occupied by the architect, as we will see), it means the person born in September cannot be in the middle. Therefore, the gothic-revival house must be either the first or last house.

4. Since the fan of folk is not driving the motorbike (point 9) and is neither on the far left nor the person driving the subway (which we assumed was the architect), the fan of folk must be driving one of the other vehicles, which are not the train (as the trance fan drives that) or the snowmobile (because it's to the left of the subway and we assumed it is occupied by the person born in February). This leaves us with either the quad-bike or the motorbike. Let's assume the person born in September drives the motorbike for now, so the fan of folk drives the quad-bike.

5. From points 3 and 12, we know that the ranch-style house is either the first or the last house. Since the architect lives there (point 2), and as we assumed the person born in September drives the subway (which is now occupied by the architect), this means the person born in September cannot be on the left of the ranch-style house, so it must be the last house. Therefore, the gothic-revival house must be the first house.

6. Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike (point 7) and the fan of folk drives that (as we assumed in step 4), this means that the mechanic is born in a month other than September, as we assumed the person born in September drives the motorbike. The only remaining options are June, May, February, July, or January. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (point 10) and the architect lives in the last house (as we determined in step 5), it means that the mechanic cannot be the librarian.

7. From point 11, we know that the person born in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we just proved that the mechanic is not the librarian and the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (point 10), it means that the person born in July cannot be the librarian either.

8. Now, let's check our assumptions. Since we assumed that the person born in September drives the subway and lives in a ranch-style house, this means that the architect is on the left or right of the mechanic (because the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june). However, from point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender. From point 14, we also know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (which we assumed is the person born in September). This means that if the architect was indeed on the left or right of the mechanic, it would imply that either the bartender (fan of ambient) or the person born in July (who we know cannot be the librarian) must be between the mechanic and the architect. However, since the fan of rock lives in the palace house (point 4), it means that the mechanic, architect, and bartender all have to be on the left side of the palace house. This leaves us with no room for the person born in July. Therefore, our assumption was incorrect: the person born in September cannot drive the subway or live in a ranch-style house.

9. Since we know that the person born in September drives neither the subway nor the motorbike, and they also cannot live in the ranch-style house (as it is either the first or last house), this means that they must be driving the snowmobile or the quad-bike. Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike (point 7), it means that the person born in September drives the snowmobile, and they live in a wooden, gothic-revival, palace, futuristic, or ranch-style house. From point 12, we know that the ranch-style house is either the first or last house, so let's assume the person born in September lives in the last house for now (we will check later if this assumption is correct).

10. Since the fan of folk drives the quad-bike and the mechanic cannot be the librarian or the person born in July (as explained above), it means that the librarian must be born in either June, May, February, or January. However, since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (point 15) and the fan of ambient (bartender) is between the palace and the last house (as we assumed in step 9), it means that the person born in July cannot be the librarian either. Therefore, our assumption that the person born in September lives in the last house was incorrect: they must live in the first house instead.

11. Now let's re-check our assumptions. Since we assumed that the person born in September drives the snowmobile and lives in the last house, this means that the mechanic cannot be on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (because they are on the same side as the librarian, who must be born in a month other than June), so the mechanic must live in either the first or second house. Since the fan of rock lives in the palace house (point 4) and the gothic-revival house is the first house (as we determined in step 5), it means that the mechanic cannot live in the first house, so they must live in the second house instead.

12. Since we know that the person born in September drives the snowmobile and lives in the first house, this means that the quad-bike is available for either the fan of folk or the fan of ambient (bartender). However, since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (point 15) and the bartender is between the palace and the last house (as we assumed in step 9), it means that the person born in July cannot be the librarian either. Therefore, our assumption was incorrect: the person born in September cannot live in the first house or drive the snowmobile.

13. Since the fan of rock lives in the palace house (point 4), this means that the mechanic cannot live in the second house (because they must be on the same side as the librarian, who must be born in a month other than June and cannot be the person born in July). Therefore, the only remaining option for the mechanic is the first house. However, since the gothic-revival house is the first house (as we determined in step 5), it means that the mechanic cannot live there either. This leaves us with no room for the person born in September to drive the snowmobile or live in a wooden, palace, or futuristic house.

14. Since we know that the fan of rock lives in the palace house (point 4) and the gothic-revival house is the first house (as we determined in step 5), it means that the only remaining option for the person born in September to drive the snowmobile is the quad-bike. However, since the mechanic lives in the first house (as we determined in step 11) and the fan of folk drives the quad-bike (as we assumed in step 9), it means that the person born in September cannot live in the first house. Therefore, our assumption was incorrect: the person born in September cannot drive the snowmobile or live in a gothic-revival house.

15. Since we know that the fan of rock lives in the palace house (point 4) and the person born in September cannot drive the snowmobile or live in a gothic-revival house, this means that the only remaining option for the person born in September to live in is either the wooden, futuristic, or ranch-style house. However, since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (point 15) and the bartender is between the palace and the last house (as we assumed in step 9), it means that the person born in July cannot be the librarian either. Therefore, our assumption was incorrect: the person born in September cannot live in a wooden, futuristic, or ranch-style house.

16. Since the fan of rock lives in the palace house (point 4) and the person born in September cannot drive the snowmobile or live in a gothic-revival, wooden, futuristic, or ranch-style house, this leaves us with no room for the person born in September to exist at all. However, we know that everyone has a birthday, so our assumptions must be incorrect: either the fan of rock does not really live in the palace house or there is some other information missing from the problem statement.

In summary, it seems like there is an inconsistency or missing information in the problem statement, as it appears to be impossible for everyone to have a birthday based on the given constraints. I recommend double-checking the problem statement to ensure that all the information is correct and complete.

Here's my analysis:
- The fan of rock lives in the palace house (point 4)
- The fan of folk drives the quad-bike, and the mechanic cannot be the librarian or the person born in July (as explained above). However, since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (point 15) and the bartender is between the palace and the last house (as we assumed in step 9), it means that the person born in July cannot be the librarian either. Therefore, our assumption was incorrect: the person born in September cannot drive the snowmobile or live in a gothic-revival house.
- The fan of rock lives in the palace house (point 4) and the person born in September cannot drive the snowmobile or live in a gothic-revival, wooden, futuristic, or ranch-style house, this leaves us with no room for the person born in September to exist at all. However, we know that everyone has a birthday, so our assumptions must be incorrect: either the fan of rock does not really live in the palace house or there is some other information missing from the problem statement.

I hope this analysis helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."	architect:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_8	architect	8	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

From points 1 and 4, we can deduce that the fan of trance (train driver) is not on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. So, the train driver cannot be in the middle or on the far left (due to point 9). Therefore, the train driver must be on the far right.

From points 5 and 15, we can deduce that the wooden house (subway driver) is not the librarian's house. So, the subway driver cannot be in the middle or on the left or right of the futuristic house. Therefore, the subway driver must be on the far left.

From points 6 and 10, we can deduce that the architect is not on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (since the librarian is already placed). So, the architect cannot be in the middle or on the far right. Therefore, the architect must be on the far left.

From points 12 and 14, we can deduce that the ranch-style house (motorbikemaster) is not the fan of folk's house. So, the motorbikemaster cannot be in the middle or on the far right. Therefore, the motorbikemaster must be on the far left.

From points 2 and 11, we can deduce that the person with a birthday in september (reggae fan) is not on the left of the mechanic or the person who's birthday is in july. So, the reggae fan cannot be in the middle or on the far right. Therefore, the reggae fan must be on the far left, but this contradicts our previous conclusion about the subway driver (far left) being the reggae fan. This means that our initial assumption about the reggae fan being the person with a birthday in september is incorrect, and we need to reconsider points 2 and 11.

Assuming that there was an error in the statement 2 (the fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September), let's reconsider:

From points 1 and 4, we can deduce that the fan of trance (train driver) is not on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. So, the train driver cannot be in the middle or on the far left. Therefore, the train driver must be on the far right.

From points 5 and 15, we can deduce that the wooden house (subway driver) is not the librarian's house. So, the subway driver cannot be in the middle or on the left or right of the futuristic house. Therefore, the subway driver must be on the far left.

From points 6 and 10, we can deduce that the architect is not on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (since the librarian is already placed). So, the architect cannot be in the middle or on the far right. Therefore, the architect must be on the far left.

From points 12 and 14, we can deduce that the ranch-style house (motorbikemaster) is not the fan of folk's house. So, the motorbikemaster cannot be in the middle or on the far right. Therefore, the motorbikemaster must be on the far left.

From points 3 and 14, we can deduce that the rock (palace) is not the fan of ambient's house. So, the palace cannot be on the left or the far right. Therefore, the palace must be in the middle.

Since the rock (palace) is in the middle, and we know that the motorbikemaster is on the far left, the quad-bike driver (mechanic) should be to the right of the palace. Since the architect is already placed on the far left, this means the mechanic must be on the far right.

From points 7 and 12, we can deduce that the fan of ambient (bartender) cannot be in the ranch-style house (motorbikemaster). So, the bartender cannot be in the middle or on the far left. Therefore, the bartender must be on the far right.

Since the mechanic is already placed on the far right, and we know that the subway driver (wooden house) is on the far left, this means the fan of folk must be between them. Since the gothic-revival house (person driving the snowmobile) is in the middle, and the motorbikemaster is already placed on the far left, this means the person with a birthday in june and the librarian must both be to the right of the motorbike. So, the person with a birthday in july (reggae fan) should be to the left of the motorbikemaster (far left), which contradicts our initial assumption about the reggae fan's placement. This means there is an error in the statement 11 (the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic).

Assuming that there was an error in the statement 11, let's reconsider:

From points 1 and 4, we can deduce that the fan of trance (train driver) is not on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. So, the train driver cannot be in the middle or on the far left. Therefore, the train driver must be on the far right.

From points 5 and 15, we can deduce that the wooden house (subway driver) is not the librarian's house. So, the subway driver cannot be in the middle or on the left or right of the futuristic house. Therefore, the subway driver must be on the far left.

From points 6 and 10, we can deduce that the architect is not on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (since the librarian is already placed). So, the architect cannot be in the middle or on the far right. Therefore, the architect must be on the far left.

From points 12 and 14, we can deduce that the ranch-style house (motorbikemaster) is not the fan of folk's house. So, the motorbikemaster cannot be in the middle or on the far right. Therefore, the motorbikemaster must be on the far left.

From points 3 and 14, we can deduce that the rock (palace) is not the fan of ambient's house. So, the palace cannot be on the left or the far right. Therefore, the palace must be in the middle.

Since the rock (palace) is in the middle, and we know that the motorbikemaster is on the far left, the quad-bike driver (mechanic) should be to the right of the palace. Since the architect is already placed on the far left, this means the mechanic must be on the far right.

Since the mechanic is already placed on the far right, and we know that the subway driver (wooden house) is on the far left, this means the fan of folk must be between them. Since the gothic-revival house (person driving the snowmobile) is in the middle, and the motorbikemaster is already placed on the far left, this means the person with a birthday in june and the librarian must both be to the right of the motorbike. So, the person with a birthday in july (reggae fan) should be to the left of the motorbikemaster (far left), which contradicts our initial assumption about the reggae fan's placement. This means there is an error in the statement 11 (the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic).

Assuming that there was an error in both statements 11 and 15, let's reconsider:

From points 1 and 4, we can deduce that the fan of trance (train driver) is not on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. So, the train driver cannot be in the middle or on the far left. Therefore, the train driver must be on the far right.

From points 5 and 15, we can deduce that the wooden house (subway driver) is not the librarian's house. So, the subway driver cannot be in the middle or on the left or right of the futuristic house. Therefore, the subway driver must be on the far left.

From points 6 and 10, we can deduce that the architect is not on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (since the librarian is already placed). So, the architect must be in the middle.

Since the rock (palace) cannot be on the left or the far right, and we know that the subway driver (wooden house) is on the far left, this means the quad-bike driver (mechanic) should be to the right of the palace. Since the architect is already placed in the middle, this means the mechanic must be on the far right.

Since the mechanic is already placed on the far right, and we know that the subway driver (wooden house) is on the far left, this means the fan of folk must be between them. Since the gothic-revival house (person driving the snowmobile) is in the middle, and the motorbikemaster is already placed on the far left, this means the person with a birthday in june and the librarian must both be to the right of the motorbike. This leaves only one position for the person who's birthday is in July (reggae fan), which contradicts our initial assumption about the reggae fan's placement.

Since there seems to be an inconsistency in the given statements, we cannot definitively determine the positions of all houses based on the information provided. It appears that either statements 11 and/or 15 contain errors, or some additional information is required to solve this puzzle."	architect:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_9	architect	8	" To solve this puzzle, we will approach it systematically by setting up a system of equations based on the given clues. Let's denote each person by a letter (A-E) and assign them their corresponding attributes:

1. transport: T_i (train), S_i (subway), M_i (motorbike), Q_i (quad-bike), Sm_i (snowmobile)
2. music-genre: Tr, Ro, A, Fa, Re
3. house: R, W, Gr, P, F
4. job: M, Mc, Ar, Ba, Li
5. birthday month: J, M, S, F, G

From the clues, we can derive a series of linear equations and inequalities to solve for each person's attributes:

1. Tr = T_i
2. Re = E
3. Ro = P
4. S_i < Sm_j (subway is on left of snowmobile)
5. S_i = W (subway is the wooden house)
6. Ar = B_j (architect is in May, and librarian is to the left or right of June's person, so j ≠ E)
7. Q_i = Mc
8. Gr = (G_i - 1) / 2 + K (gothic-revival house is in middle)
9. Fa = A_k (fan of folk is on the far left, so k = 1)
10. Li_j ≤ J or Li_j >=J (librarian is on the left or right of June's person)
11. Li_j < G_i or Li_j > G_i (librarian is not in July, so j ≠ E; also, librarian is not in February, so j ≠ A)
12. R = M
13. A = Ba_k (bartender is the fan of ambient)
14. Fa_i <= Mi or Fa_i >= Mi (fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, so i ≠ E)
15. Li_j <= F or Li_j >= F (librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house)

Now we can solve these equations step-by-step:

From clue 7 and clue 14, we know that i != E and k = 1. Hence, Q_i = Mc, Fa = A_1.

From clue 3, Ro = P. Since Ro, Fa, and Re are distinct, Ro can't be equal to Tr or Re. Therefore, T_i != Ro and T_i != Re.

From clue 2, Tr = T_i. From clues 9 and 14, we know that i != E and k = 1. Since T_i, Fa, and Re are distinct, T_i can't be equal to Tr or Re either.

From clue 6, Ar = B_j (architect is in May). Since the librarian is not in May, j cannot be E. Since there are only four people left for j (A, B, C, and D), we can set up two equations to find the possible values for j:

B_j = Ar  =>  B_j = Mc or Li_j < G_i (from clue 6)
C_j = Ar  =>  C_j = Mb or Li_j > G_i + 1 (since librarian is not in February and gothic-revival house is not the first or last, G_i >= 2)
D_j = Ar  =>  D_j = Tf or Li_j < Gr - 1 (from clue 8, Gr > 3)

From clues 5 and 10, we know that S_i = W. Since the librarian is not in May, j cannot be E. From clues 4 and 12, we know that T_i < Sm_j (subway is on the left of snowmobile) and R = M.

Since there are only two possible values for j (B or C), let's assume B_j = Ar first:

B_j = Ar => T_i ≠ Ro, Tr, Re, Fa, and Li_j < G_i.
If S_i = W and T_i = M, then there is no snowmobile (since the gothic-revival house is in the middle). Therefore, B_j cannot be Ar.

Next, let's assume C_j = Ar:

C_j = Ar => T_i ≠ Ro, Tr, Re, Fa, and Li_j > G_i + 1.
If S_i = W and T_i = M, then there is a snowmobile to the right of subway (since the librarian is not in February). Therefore, C_j cannot be Ar either.

Since both assumptions lead to contradictions, we have a contradiction in the problem statement, making it impossible to solve with the given information."	architect:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_architect_10	architect	8	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down by variables (transport, music-genre, house type, job, birth month) and use logical deductions.

1. Let A represent the architect, M represent the mechanic, B represent the bartender, L represent the librarian, G represent the gothic-revival house, P represent the palace, F represent the futuristic house, R represent the ranch-style house, and T represent the trance fan.
2. From point 1, we know that T drives the train, so T is not a subway, snowmobile, quad-bike driver. Also, since there are only 5 people and they drive 5 different means of transport, we can assign each person to one unique transport (e.g., A drives motorbike).
3. From point 2, we know that the reggae fan's birthday is in September, so the reggae fan cannot have a birthday in June, May, February, July, or any other month where someone else has their birthday.
4. From points 3 and 4, since the rock fan is the palace house (P), we know that P cannot be assigned to any other music genre except rock. Therefore, we can deduce that A, B, L, M, and T are not fans of rock, but they must represent the other genres in at least one assignment each.
5. From points 4 and 5, since the subway driver (let's say X) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (Y), we can assign them to two different houses. As there are only five houses, let Y be the gothic-revival house (G). Now we know that X cannot be G.
6. From points 5 and 6, since the subway driver X is the wooden house (W), we now know that A, B, L, M, T, and the other house drivers cannot be W.
7. From points 7 and 8, since the quad-bike driver (Z) is the mechanic (M), we now know that A, B, L, T, and the remaining three people are not Z. Also, Z cannot be X or Y, as they were already assigned to houses W and G.
8. From points 9 and 10, since the person driving the motorbike (V) has the fan of folk on their left or right (let's say V's left), we know that V cannot be in September or July, as those months are already assigned to reggae fans. Furthermore, since the librarian L is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June, and V's left neighbor cannot be in June (since it's February), we can deduce that L must be in June. Now, we know that V cannot be in June or July.
9. From points 11 and 12, since the person who's birthday is in July (let's say H) is on the left or right of M (Z), we can deduce that Z cannot be in July. As Z was already assigned to the quad-bike, we now know that H cannot be in February, May, September, or any other month where someone else has their birthday.
10. From points 13 and 14, since the fan of ambient is the bartender (B), we now know that B cannot be in any of the already assigned months (February, May, September, June, July). Since the person driving the motorbike (V) has the fan of folk on their left or right and cannot be in June or July, we can deduce that V is not a bartender.
11. From points 15 and 12, since the librarian L is on the left or right of the futuristic house (F), we know that F cannot be assigned to any of the already known houses (R, W, G, P). Since the mechanic M is the quad-bike driver (Z) and cannot be in July, we now know that F cannot be in February, May, September, or June.
12. From points 4, 5, 7, 8, and 11, we can place all the remaining assignments by following the clues given:
	* Since X is not G and Y is G, X must be W (subway) and Y can only be R (snowmobile).
	* Since Z is M (quad-bike), H cannot be in February, May, September, or June. However, as there are only five birth months left (June, May, September, February, July), H must be in the remaining month: January.
	* As L is already placed in June, B cannot be in June and must be in January (the last remaining birth month).
	* Since V has the fan of folk on their left or right, and L is in June, V can only be in January or July. However, as H is already placed in January, V must be in July.
13. Now we have all assignments:

Transport: motorbike -> July's person (V)
Subway  -> February's person (X)
Snowmobile -> Ranch-style house (Y)
Train   -> Trance fan (T)
Quad-bike -> Mechanic (M, January's person)

Music-genre: trance -> T (train driver)
rock    -> P (palace)
ambient -> B (January's bartender)
folk    -> July's person (V)
reggae  -> September's person (Reggae fan)

House: ranch-style -> Y (snowmobile driver)
wooden   -> X (subway driver)
gothic-revival -> G (subway left of snowmobile)
palace   -> P (rock fan)
futuristic -> Not assigned yet

Job: motorbikemaster  -> V (July's person, folk fan)
mechanic  -> M (January's quad-bike driver)
architect  -> A (Not assigned yet)
bartender  -> B (January's bartender)
librarian -> L (June's librarian)

Birth month: june, may, september, february, july

Now we have all the assignments. To find the architect, we can see that there is only one remaining house: palace (P), which means the architect must be in the palace (P). Thus, the answer is **architect:P**."	architect:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_bartender_1	bartender	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign each person a number based on their birth month (since we know their birthdays are in 5 different months). Let's start with June as our reference point. So, the person born in June is person #1, July is person #2, May is person #3, September is person #4, and February is person #5.

2. From point 14, we know that the fan of folk (person #4) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (whose job is ranch-style house). Since the gothic-revival house (#5) is in the middle, the motorbike driver must be on the left or right of #5. Let's assume the motorbike driver is on the left for now (as it simplifies the problem). So, we have:
   - June (#1): Librarian or futuristic house
   - July (#2): Mechanic and quad-biker
   - May (#3): Architect
   - September (#4): Folk fan (bartender) and reggae fan
   - February (#5): Train driver (trance fan) and subway driver

3. From point 7, we know that the quad-bike driver is the mechanic (#2). So, #2 is the mechanic and quad-biker.

4. From point 11, we know that the person born in July (#2) is on the left or right of the mechanic (#2), which means the mechanic cannot be in July. Therefore, July must be the librarian or futuristic house. Let's assume July is the librarian for now (as it simplifies the problem). So, we have:
   - June (#1): Librarian
   - July (#2): Mechanic and quad-biker
   - May (#3): Architect
   - September (#4): Folk fan (bartender) and reggae fan
   - February (#5): Train driver (trance fan) and subway driver

5. From point 9, we know that the fan of folk (#4) is on the far left. Since #1 (June) is already assigned as a librarian, the only place left for the bartender is on the far left, so #4 must be the bartender.

6. From point 6, we know that the architect is the person born in May (#3). So, #3 is the architect.

7. Now let's look at the remaining transport assignments (train, subway, snowmobile, and motorbike):
   - The train driver (trance fan) and subway driver are both left or right of the mechanic (quad-biker). Since the quad-bike is assigned to #2, the train driver and subway driver must be on the other side of #2.
   - We already know that July (#2) is the librarian. So, neither the train nor the subway can be in July. The only available month left for them is February (#5). Since the subway is the wooden house (point 5), the subway driver must be #5, and therefore the train driver (trance fan) is also #5.
   - From point 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. So, the snowmobile driver must be on the right of the quad-biker (#2), which means the snowmobile driver cannot be the mechanic. Therefore, the snowmobile driver is #3 or #4. Since the fan of folk (#4) is already assigned, the only possible transport left for person #3 is snowmobile, so #3 is the snowmobile driver.
   - The motorbike driver is the ranch-style house (point 12). We already know that July (#2) is the librarian, and June (#1) is a librarian too. Since there are only 5 people, the motorbike driver must be one of the remaining three (#3, #4, or #5). However, since person #3 and #4 have already been assigned to other transports, #5 must be the motorbike driver.

In summary:
- Bartender: #4
- Architect: #3
- Librarian: #1 (June) and #2 (July)
- Motorbike driver: #5 (February)
- Subway driver (trance fan): #5 (February)
- Snowmobile driver: #3 (May)
- Quad-biker (mechanic): #2 (July)

Note that the house assignments are based on our initial assumptions, and it's not explicitly stated in the puzzle how to assign the houses. However, since we know the correct order of people (based on their birthdays), we can infer the following:
- The wooden house (subway) is on the left or right of the ranch-style house (motorbike). Since #1 and #5 are assigned as librarian and motorbike driver, respectively, #1 must be on the left of #5. So, if the subway is to the left of the motorbike, then the wooden house is assigned to July (#2), and if the subway is to the right of the motorbike, then the wooden house is assigned to February (#5).
- The futuristic house can only be assigned to June or July, as they are the only two remaining months.
- The gothic-revival house (point 8) is in the middle, so it must be person #3 (May), making the ranch-style house (motorbike) person #5 and the futuristic house person #1 or #2.
- The palace (rock fan) is assigned to September (#4). Since we already know that the wooden house is not in September, the only available transport left for person #4 is train. However, since the train driver is already assigned to February (#5), the palace must be assigned to a different month (either June or July).
- The ambient fan (bartender) is on the left of the motorbike driver (person #5), so the bartender must be person #1, #2, or #4. Since we already know that the mechanic and reggae fan are in September (#4), the only possible transport left for the bartender is train or quad-bike, but since the quad-bike driver has been assigned, the bartender must be a train driver. However, since the train driver is already assigned to February (#5), the only available month left for the bartender is June or July."	bartender:4	bartender:4	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_bartender_2	bartender	7	" To solve this puzzle, we can set up a table to organize the information and find patterns that will help us assign each person to their respective roles. Here's the completed table:

|    | Transport | Music-genre  | House     | Job        | Birthday |
|---|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1  |   | Trance      |       | Motorbikemaster   | June |
| 2  |   |         | Wooden   |                  | May |
| 3  | Train     | Rock         | Palace    | Architect   | September |
| 4  | Subway    |            | Gothic-revival   |       | February  |
| 5  | Snowmobile| Reggae      |          |             | July |
| 6  | Quad-bike | Ambient     | Futuristic | Librarian    |         |
| 7 |           | Folk        | Ranch-style | Mechanic    | August   |
| 8 |           |            | Middle      |             |         |
| 9 | Motorbike |            | Left       |             |         |
| 10|          |            | Right      | Bartender     |         |
| 11|          |            | Left or right   |             | July  |
| 12|           |            | Right      | Motorbikemaster | June  |
| 13|           | Ambient    |           | Bartender    |         |
| 14|           | Folk        |          |             | Left or right   |
| 15|           |            | Right      | Librarian     |         |

From the information given, we can deduce that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (row 12) and the librarian lives to the left or right of the futuristic house (row 15). The librarian is also not on the same side as the person who's birthday is in june, so they cannot be the left neighbor (row 9 or 10). Therefore, the bartender must be on the opposite side from the motorbikemaster.

Since there are only three positions left for the librarian, the bartender can only occupy the position either directly to the right of the subway (position 10) or directly to the right of the quad-bike (position 6). As the mechanic is on the same transport as the person driving the quad-bike (row 7), the librarian cannot be in position 6, so the bartender must be in position 10.

Thus, the answer is **Bartender:10**."	bartender:4	bartender:10	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_bartender_3	bartender	7	" Let's solve this step by step:

1) From point 1, we know that the fan of trance drives the train. Since there are only three transport options left (motorbike, subway, and quad-bike), the train driver cannot drive any other vehicle. So, the train driver is out of consideration for the remaining transportation questions.

2) From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September. We'll come back to this later when we know more about the birthdays.

3) From point 4, since the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver, and from point 5, we know that the subway driver lives in the wooden house. This leaves us with only two possible houses for the snowmobile driver: gothic-revival (middle) or futuristic (right).

4) From point 7, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. This means the mechanic cannot be the subway driver since the subway driver drives a different vehicle. So, the mechanic must drive either the motorbike or the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver can't be the mechanic (because of point 3), the mechanic must drive the motorbike.

5) From point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house. This means the motorbikemaster cannot also drive the subway since the subway driver lives in a different house (wooden). So, the motorbikemaster must drive either the snowmobile or the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike is driven by the mechanic (point 7), the motorbikemaster must drive the snowmobile.

6) From point 15, we know that the librarian lives on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we already know where the motorbikemaster and the mechanic live, we can place the futuristic house next to them, but we don't know which side yet.

7) From point 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May. Since we already know the birthdays of some people (reggae fan in September and the mechanic in an unknown month), this leaves us with only one available spot for the architect: July (since the librarian is on the left or right of the mechanic, and the July person can't be the librarian because of point 11).

8) From point 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since we know the mechanic drives the motorbike (point 7), the snowmobile must be driven by someone other than the architect (since the architect lives in the futuristic house next to the motorbikemaster and the mechanic). This means that the only person left for the subway is the reggae fan, but this contradicts point 2 since the reggae fan has a birthday in September and the subway driver's house (wooden) suggests a different month.

There seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle as stated, and it cannot be solved with the given information."	bartender:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_bartender_4	bartender	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign each person/object a unique number from 1 to 5 (we can start with any object).

2. From clues 1-4, we know the following relationships between transport, music genres, and their positions:
   - Train: Trance (Person 1)
   - Subway: Not known yet (Person 2 or 3)
   - Snowmobile: Not known yet (Person 4 or 5)
   - Position of subway: Left of snowmobile (Constrains the order to be 2, 4 or 3, 5)

3. From clues 5-7, we know the following relationships between houses, jobs, and birthdays:
   - House 1: Wooden (Person 2 or 3)
   - House 2: Subway (Person 2 or 3, but not 5 due to clue 4)
   - House 3: Palace (Person 3)
   - House 4: Not known yet (Person 4 or 5)
   - House 5: Quad-bike (Person 4 or 5)
   - Job of Person 1: Not known yet
   - Job of Person 2: Mechanic (Person 7)
   - Job of Person 3: Architect (Person 6, who has a birthday in May)
   - Job of Person 4: Librarian or Bartender (Not determined yet)
   - Job of Person 5: Motorbikemaster or Mechanic (Person 7 due to clue 12 and 17)

4. From clues 8-10, we can establish the positions for some houses but not all:
   - Gothic-revival house is in the middle (House 3)
   - Folk fan is on the far left (Person 9, who has a birthday in September due to clue 14 and 2)
   - Librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we know that Person 6 has a birthday in May, the only options for June are Persons 1, 2, and 5 (but since Person 5 drives the quad-bike, which isn't next to Person 7 due to clue 17, it can't be Person 5). So the librarian must be on the left of Person 1 or 2. This means House 4 is to the right of House 1 (if House 1 were on the left) or House 2 (if House 2 were on the left), but we already know that House 3 is in the middle and House 5 is on the right (since it's a quad-bike). Therefore, the only possible arrangement for Houses 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 1-4-3-2. This also means that Person 1, 4, 3, and 2 have been determined.

5. From clues 11-15, we can now determine the remaining information:
   - The fan of ambient is the bartender (Person 5) since Person 5 is either Mechanic or Motorbikemaster (due to clue 17), and we know that Person 5 isn't Person 6 (the architect, who has a birthday in May), and Person 4 can't be Person 5 due to clue 18. Since there are only two remaining jobs (Motorbikemaster or Bartender), it must be the bartender. This means that House 5 is also the futuristic house, as hinted by clue 13.
   - The person driving the motorbike isn't Person 5 due to clue 20, so it must be Person 1 (Person 4 or 2 can't drive a motorbike because there are no more available positions for them). This also means that the folk fan is on the right of the motorbike driver (since the folk fan is on the far left and the librarian is to the left of June, which is Person 1 due to our previous determination).
   - The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since Person 5 can't be the motorbikemaster (due to clue 20), it must be Person 1. This means that House 1 is the ranch-style house.
   - We have already determined that House 2 is the subway and House 3 is the gothic-revival house, so House 4 must be the palace (since the palace can't be in the middle or on the far left due to clues 8 and 9). Therefore, Person 4 is the architect.

After sorting out the relationships, we get the final arrangement as follows:
1. Motorbikemaster (Person 1) - Ranch-style house
2. Subway driver - Wooden house (Mechanic, Person 7)
3. Architect (Person 4) - Palace
4. Librarian - Left of June (House 2)
5. Bartender (Person 5) - Futuristic house
6. Mechanic (Person 7) - Wooden house (Subway driver)
7. The fan of trance is the person driving the train - Not known yet
8. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in September - Person 5
9. The fan of rock is the palace - Not determined yet
10. The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the subway driver - Not known yet
11. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic - Already determined (Person 7)
12. The gothic-revival house is in the middle - Already determined (House 3)
13. The fan of folk is on the far left - Person 4 (Already determined, but we don't know the exact position)
14. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house - Already determined (House 5, but we don't know the exact position)
15. The motorbikemaster is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june - Already determined (Person 1, but we don't know the exact position).

Since we don't have enough information to determine the final positions for Person 6, 7, and the last two transport drivers, I cannot provide a definitive answer for where the bartender is. However, we now know that the bartender is Person 5."	bartender:4		False	False

- Since the fan of folk is on the far left (A), and the fan of folk is also on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (A), and the mechanic (F) cannot be to the left because the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (E, F or D), the librarian must be person A.
- Since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (E, A or F) and we know that A is the librarian, A cannot be the futuristic house. So, E is the futuristic house.
- Since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (A), and the mechanic (F) cannot be to the left because the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic, E must be the person driving the motorbike.
- Since the fan of ambient is the bartender (B:Ambient, E:Bartender), and we know that E is the bartender, B must be the wooden house.
- Now that we know B is the wooden house, we know that C cannot be the gothic-revival house because it has to be in the middle (C:Gothic-revival). Therefore, A must be the gothic-revival house.
- Since the architect is the person who's birthday is in May (B:Architect), B must be on the left or right of the person driving the subway (D) because the librarian (A) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. So, F cannot be on the far left because A has to be the fan of folk and the mechanic (F) has to be next to the subway driver (D). Therefore, B must be on the right side of D.
- Since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (E), and we know that A is the librarian, A cannot be on the far right because E has to be the fan of ambient (B). Therefore, A must be on the left side of E.
- Since F is the mechanic and cannot be on the far left because A has to be the fan of folk, F must be on the far right.
- Since D is driving the subway, D is on the left of F (D:Subway, F:Snowmobile).
- Now that we know B is on the right side of D and F is on the far right, A has to be on the left side of E.
- Since C is the fan of rock and the palace house, and we already know that D, A, B, F and E are sorted out, C can only be the palace house.
- Now that we know C is the palace house, we also know that D must be the person driving the subway (D:Subway) and F must be the person driving the snowmobile (F:Snowmobile).

The final table looks like this:
| Person  | Transport | Music-Genre | House      | Job       | Birthday Month|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A      | Subway   | Folk       | Gothic-revival| Librarian  | June  |
| B      | Train    | Ambient   | Wooden     | Bartender  | July |
| C      | Quad-bike| Rock      | Palace     | Architect  | Sept  |
| D      | Snowmobile| Reggae  | Futuristic | Librarian   | Feb  |
| E      | Motorbike| Folk      | Ranch-style| Mechanic   | May  |

So, the answer is **bartender:B**"	bartender:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_bartender_6	bartender	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From point 4, we know that the Subway driver is on the left of the Snowmobile driver. Let's label the persons as A, B (Subway and Snowmobile), C (Train), D, E, F (other transports). So, B < A.
2. Point 5 tells us that the Subway driver lives in a Wooden house. So, A = Wooden.
3. The fan of Rock is the Palace house. Since we know the Subway driver is A and the Palace is not A, A cannot be the fan of Rock. Let's assume the fan of Rock is C (Train).
4. Now let's focus on the birthdays:
   - June: Not assigned yet
   - May (Given as the Architect): D = May
   - September (Fan of Reggae): E = September
   - February: Not assigned yet
   - July (Given a position relative to the Mechanic, but we don't know who they are yet): G = July
5. Point 1 tells us that the Trance fan is C (Train). Since we know D and E already, C cannot be D or E. So, C = Trance.
6. Point 2 tells us that E (September) is a Reggae fan. But since we already assigned E, this point doesn't provide new information.
7. Point 3 assigns the Rock fan to C (Train). This confirms our assumption made in step 3.
8. From points 4 and 10, we can deduce that A cannot be on the left of June or the librarian. Since we know A is the Subway driver and A = Wooden, this also means that neither the Librarian nor June live in a Wooden house.
9. Point 6 assigns D (May) as the Architect.
10. From points 7 and 11, we can deduce that G (July) is the mechanic and is on the left or right of G. Since we know G now, this point doesn't provide new information.
11. Point 8 tells us that the Gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we know A (Subway), C (Train), D (Architect), and E (September), none of them can be the Gothic-revival house. So, one of the remaining transports must be the Gothic-revival house. Let's assume H = Gothic-revival for now.
12. Point 12 assigns the Ranch-style house to the Motorbikemaster. Since we know A (Subway), C (Train), D (Architect), E (September), and H (Gothic-revival), none of them can be the Motorbikemaster. So, F = Motorbike or B = Motorbike. Since B is already assigned as the Subway driver, let's assume F = Motorbike.
13. Point 13 assigns the Ambient fan to the Bartender (F). But since we haven't found a suitable position for F yet, this point doesn't provide new information.
14. Point 14 tells us that the Folk fan is on the left or right of the Motorbike driver. Since we know D (Architect) and E (September), neither of them can be the Folk fan. Also, since F = Motorbike is now assigned and F < B (Subway), the Folk fan must be between F and B. The only remaining options for the Folk fan are H and C, but since we already know H cannot be the Gothic-revival house, it means C = Folk. This contradicts our assumption that C is the Trance fan (from point 1), so let's reconsider our assumption: instead, assume F = Trance.
15. Point 15 tells us that the Librarian is on the left or right of the Futuristic house. Since we know A (Subway), C (Folk), D (Architect), and E (September), none of them can be the Futuristic house. So, I = Futuristic.
16. Now let's re-examine our assignments:
   - F = Trance (this contradicts the subway driver being a trance fan, but we have no other options for F yet)
   - A = Subway (Wooden house)
   - D = May (Architect)
   - E = September (Reggae)
   - C = Folk (contradicts the previous assumption, but we know C cannot be Trance or Rock now)
   - H = Gothic-revival (still a guess for now)
   - I = Futuristic house
17. Let's assign B as the Quad-bike since it has not been assigned yet and is likely to be in the list of transport options (Motorbike, Subway, Train, Snowmobile, Quad-bike). Also, let's rearrange the transports so that B < F.
18. With our current assignments, the only remaining transport options are the Snowmobile and the Motorbike for G (July), as it must be on the left or right of G. Since we already assigned a position to B, let's assume that G drives the Snowmobile.
19. Now we have all the transports assigned: A (Subway), B (Quad-bike), C (Folk), D (Architect), E (September), F (Trance, Motorbike), G (Snowmobile), H (Gothic-revival), I (Futuristic).
20. Finally, let's check the remaining information to confirm our solutions:
   - Point 9 tells us that the Folk fan (C) is on the left or right of the Motorbike driver (F). Since we know C and F now, this point confirms our assignments.
   - Point 10 tells us that either the librarian or June is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. We know the Librarian and June are I and D, respectively. Since we already have them assigned, this point confirms our assignments.
   - Point 11 tells us that G (July) is on the left or right of the mechanic (G). We know G and neither G nor I are the Mechanic, so this point doesn't provide new information.
21. All the points have been confirmed with our final assignments, so we're done.
22. To find the location of the Bartender, we can look up the assigned transports for each person: C (Folk) = Train, D (Architect) = Unknown, E (September) = Unknown, F (Trance, Motorbike) = Unknown, G (Snowmobile) = Snowmobile, H (Gothic-revival) = Unknown, I (Futuristic) = Unknown. The Bartender is the fan of Ambient and is on the same transport as F (Motorbike). Since we know F now, we can confirm that the Bartender is also on the Motorbike.
23. Therefore, the Bartender rides the Motorbike.

**The solution to the problem:** The Bartender rides the Motorbike."	bartender:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_bartender_7	bartender	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign a number to each person, starting from left to right (we will fill the positions one-by-one as we gather more information)
2. From the clues, identify the variables that can be uniquely determined, and try to assign values to them.
3. Once some variables are assigned, use the transitive properties of the relationships between the variables to deduce the values of the remaining variables.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all variables are assigned.
5. At the end, we will have the solution with **Bartender:X**, where X is the position number on the line.

Let's solve it!

1. Trance fan drives the train (clue 1), so the person driving the train must be FanTrance (let's call them T). Since the people prefer different music genres, T cannot be on the left or right of another trance fan (there is no one else with this preference). So, T must occupy a central position.
2. Reggae fan has birthday in September (clue 7), so the person with birthday in September must be FanReggae (let's call them R). Since there are only five different birthdays, we know that the other four people have birthdays in May, June, February, July, and either January or December. As R is not T (because they have different music preferences), R cannot be on the left of T (as per clue 4). So, T must occupy a position greater than R.
3. Rock fan lives in the palace (clue 4), so the person living in the palace must be FanRock (let's call them P). As there are only five different house types, we know that the other four people live in a ranch-style, wooden, gothic-revival, or futuristic house. Since T cannot be on the left of R, and R is not P (because they have different house preferences), P must occupy a position greater than R and T.
4. We now know that positions 1 to 3 are occupied by FanTrance(T), FanReggae(R), and FanRock(P). We still don't have enough information about the remaining positions (4-5) yet, so we will skip ahead for now.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house (clue 5), but we know that P lives in the palace. So, the wooden house must be one of the remaining positions (4 or 5). Let's say it is Position 4, so the Subway driver is WoodenHouse (let's call them S). Since S is on the left of Snowmobile (as per clue 4), and T cannot be on the left of R, we know that R and S are both to the left of T.
6. The architect has a birthday in May (clue 6), so the person with birthday in May must be Architect(A). Since A is not T, and we know that T is central, R, P, and S are all to the left of T, and A cannot be on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (clue 10), we know that A can only occupy position 2.
7. Now we have positions 1 (R), 2 (A), 3 (P), and 4 (S) filled, with T still unassigned. Since S is the subway driver and S is on the left of Snowmobile (clue 4), the Snowmobile driver must be Position 5 or to the right.
8. The fan of folk is on the far left (clue 9), but we already know that R, A, P, and S are all to the left of T. So, Folk must occupy position 1. But this conflicts with clue 6 as Architect has a birthday in May, which leaves no room for FanFolk on the far left. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle, and it's impossible to determine all positions based on the given information.

In conclusion, the puzzle appears to have an inconsistency, and we cannot find the solution with certainty. I encourage you to check if there might be any mistakes or missing clues!"	bartender:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_bartender_8	bartender	7	" To solve this puzzle, we will create a system of equations based on the given clues and then use logic to find the answers.

Let's assign a number (1-5) for each person, where the person with the trance music-genre preference is Person 1, reggae is Person 2, rock is Person 3, folk is Person 4, and ambient is Person 5. Similarly, let's use letters A-E for their houses and M1-M5 for jobs (motorbikemaster, mechanic, architect, librarian, bartender).

From clues 2, 7, and 9:
- Reggae: Person 2 (September)
- Mechanic: Person 7
- Folk (on the far left): Person 4 (Far Left)

From clues 6 and 10:
- Architect: Person 6 (May)
- Librarian (on the left or right of Person 5): Person 3,4, or 5. But since Folk is on the far left, it cannot be Person 4 or 5. So, librarian is either Person 3 (Mechanic's left) or Person 5 (Far Right).

From clues 11 and 12:
- Person with birthday in July: Either Mechanic's left or far right. But since the librarian can't be on the far right, it must be Person 3 (Mechanic's left).
- Motorbikemaster: Person 2 (Ranch-style house)

From clues 14 and 15:
- Ambient is Person 3 or 5. Since the librarian is on Person 5's left, ambient must be Person 5 (Bartender). So, Folk is on the far right.

Since Person 5 is the Bartender, we can determine their position as follows:
- Person 1 (Trance) drives the train which means they are not driving any other vehicle, so they are neither riding the subway nor snowmobile, quad-bike or motorbike. So, Person 1 cannot be on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (clue 4), implying that the person with the Subway is either Person 2 or 3.
- Since Person 5 is the Bartender and they are on Person 1's right, Person 1 cannot drive the subway. Thus, the person driving the subway must be Person 2 (Reggae).
- The subway driver (Person 2) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (Person 3).
- From clues 8 and 15, the gothic-revival house (G) is in the middle, so it must be between Person 4 (Folk) and Person 5 (Bartender), implying that Person 4 or Person 5 cannot have a gothic-revival house. Since Person 5 is the bartender, their house should not be Gothic Revival, meaning it must be either A, B, C, D, or E.
- If the Bartender (Person 5) has a ranch-style house (clue 12), then there are no ranch-style houses left for other people. But Person 3 and Person 4 both need houses. So, the ranch-style house must belong to either Person 3 or Person 4. Since Folk is on the far right, it cannot be Person 4. Thus, the ranch-style house belongs to Person 3 (Rock).
- Now we know that Person 3 has a ranch-style house and is an architect (clue 6), so their birth month must be May. Since their house is in the middle, they are between the subway driver (Reggae) and the snowmobile driver (Motorbikemaster). The only possible order is M1 > M3 > M2.
- So, Person 4 (Folk) is on the far right, which means that their house is either A or E. But since Folk can't have a gothic-revival house, it should be either A or B. Since the mechanic is the quad-bike driver (clue 7), and they are on the left of the librarian (Person 3 or 5), their only possible positions are M2 > M4 > M3 or M5. However, Person 4 cannot be between the subway driver and the snowmobile driver because Folk is on the far right. So, the only valid order is M1 > M3 > M2.
- Finally, since the librarian (Person 3) is either on the left or right of Person 5 (Bartender), and the bartender is on the far right, the possible positions are M3 < M5 or M5 < M3. Since Person 1 cannot drive the subway (clue 16), it must be M2 > M3. Thus, the only valid order is M1 > M3 > M2.
- Putting everything together, we get:
   - Trance (Person 1): Motorbikemaster, Palace House
   - Reggae (Person 2): Subway Driver, Futuristic House
   - Rock (Person 3): Architect, Ranch-style house (May), Left of Person 5 (Bartender)
   - Folk (Person 4): Far Right, A or B
   - Ambient (Person 5): Bartender, Gothic-Revival House (Since it's not A or E and not Person 4)

Unfortunately, the given clues do not provide enough information to determine the specific house for each person except the ranch-style house (May). But we can infer that Person 3 is the architect, and their house is the ranch style. So, the Bartender's house is either A or B but cannot be determined with the current set of clues.

In terms of the bartender's position: **bartender:5** (since they are the last in the order)"	bartender:4	bartender:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_bartender_9	bartender	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step.

1. From point 2 and 11, we know that the person with a birthday in September (reggae fan) is not next to the person with a birthday in July. Since there are only five people and they have birthdays in different months, this means that the person with a birthday in July must be either on the far left or right. Let's assume the person with a birthday in July is on the far left.

2. From point 4, we know that the subway driver (unknown music genre) is to the left of the snowmobile driver (also unknown). This means that neither can be the July person (since they must be on the extreme ends). So, both the subway and snowmobile drivers are either in May, June, February, or September.

3. From point 5, we know that the subway driver is the wooden house. This leaves us with only one possibility for the subway driver: it's either the mechanic (who drives a quad-bike), or someone else who hasn't been determined yet. Let's assume it's the mechanic. So, the mechanic drives the subway and lives in a wooden house.

4. From points 6, 7, and 12, we know that the architect (May birthday) lives in a ranch-style house, the mechanic is the motorbikemaster (a contradiction since motorbikes and quad-bikes are different), and the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. This means that the mechanic can't be the architect.

5. From point 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left. But we already placed the July person there. So, the fan of folk must be one of May, June, February, or September. Since the mechanic (who drives the subway) can't be the architect and can't be the fan of folk, this means that the fan of folk isn't in any of those months.

6. From points 10, 11, and 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in June (either motorbike driver or quad-bike driver), the person with a birthday in July (already placed), and the futuristic house. Since we can't place the fan of folk yet, let's assume that the librarian is on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house.

7. From points 3, 8, and 14, we know that the rock fan (palace house) isn't the gothic-revival house (which is in the middle), and the fan of folk can't be on the left of the motorbike driver yet because the librarian is there. This means that the rock fan must be one of the remaining houses: wooden, ranch-style, or futuristic. Since the mechanic (subway driver) lives in a wooden house and the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house, this leaves us with only one possibility: the palace is the rock fan.

8. With the palace as the rock fan, we now know that the gothic-revival house must be the fan of ambient (point 13). This leaves us with only two houses remaining for the fan of folk: the quad-bike driver's house and the snowmobile driver's house. Since the librarian is on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house, this means that the fan of folk must be in one of those two houses.

9. With all other possibilities exhausted, we can now place the remaining people and houses:
   - The snowmobile driver (unknown music genre) lives in a quad-bike driver's house and is on the right of the subway driver (mechanic). Since the fan of trance is the train driver and the rock fan is the palace, the only remaining genre is ambient for the snowmobile driver.
   - The fan of folk (librarian) lives in either the motorbike driver's house or the futuristic house. Since the librarian is on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house, this means that the fan of folk lives in the motorbike driver's house.
   - The ambient fan (gothic-revival house) is in the middle.

10. With all pieces in place, we can now determine the positions:
    a. The reggae fan (September birthday) is on the far right because the July person and librarian are already placed there.
    - Since the reggae fan can't be next to the trance fan or the mechanic (who drives the subway), this means that the reggae fan must be between the snowmobile driver (ambient) and one of the remaining people: the motorbike driver, quad-bike driver, or the person driving the train. Since the librarian is on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house, this means that the reggae fan can't be between the librarian and either the June person or the futuristic house. So, the reggae fan must be between the snowmobile driver (ambient) and either the motorbike driver (trance) or the quad-bike driver (unknown).
    b. The motorbike driver (trance) is on the left of the librarian because the librarian is on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house. Since the reggae fan can't be between the trance fan (motorbike driver) and the librarian, this means that the reggae fan must be either before or after the motorbike driver. But since the mechanic (subway driver) is already placed on the left of the snowmobile driver (ambient), this means that the reggae fan can't be after the motorbike driver. So, the reggae fan must be before the motorbike driver.
    c. The quad-bike driver (unknown music genre) is to the right of the subway driver (mechanic). Since the quad-bike driver lives in a ranch-style house (which is the motorbikemaster's house), this means that the quad-bike driver can't be the motorbikemaster. So, the unknown music genre of the quad-bike driver must be different from both trance and rock (since the motorbike driver is a trance fan and the palace is a rock fan). The only remaining genres are ambient, folk, and reggae. Since the librarian is already placed on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house, this means that the quad-bike driver can't be after the motorbike driver (since the librarian is to the left of the June person). So, the only possible position for the quad-bike driver is between the reggae fan (September) and the snowmobile driver (ambient), with the mechanic on the left.
    d. The person driving the train (unknown music genre) is the trance fan. Since the quad-bike driver can't be after the motorbike driver, this means that the train driver must be to the right of both the motorbike driver and the quad-bike driver. Since the librarian is already placed on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house, this means that the train driver can't be after the librarian. So, the only possible position for the train driver is between the reggae fan (September) and the gothic-revival house (ambient).
    e. The futuristic house (unknown music genre) is to the right of both the June person and the librarian because the librarian is already placed on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house. Since the quad-bike driver can't be after the motorbike driver, this means that the futuristic house can't be to the right of either the motorbike driver or the train driver (since the train driver is already placed between the reggae fan and the gothic-revival house). So, the only possible position for the futuristic house is to the right of the snowmobile driver (ambient) and before the librarian.
    f. The June person (unknown music genre) is on the far left because all other positions are already taken. Since the quad-bike driver can't be after the motorbike driver, this means that the June person must be before both the motorbike driver and the train driver.

11. With all pieces in place, we can now determine the music genres:
    a. The quad-bike driver (unknown music genre) lives in a ranch-style house (which is the motorbikemaster's house). Since the unknown music genre of the quad-bike driver must be different from both trance and rock, this leaves us with only one possibility: folk.
    b. The train driver (unknown music genre) is to the right of the reggae fan (September) and the gothic-revival house (ambient). Since the unknown music genre of the train driver must be different from both trance and rock, this leaves us with only one possibility: folk.
    c. The person driving the futuristic house (unknown music genre) is to the right of the snowmobile driver (ambient) and before the librarian. Since the unknown music genre of the futuristic house must be different from both trance, rock, ambient, folk, and reggae, this leaves us with only one possibility: reggae.

12. With all pieces in place and genres determined, we now have a complete solution:
    - The snowmobile driver (ambient) lives in a quad-bike driver's house and is on the right of the subway driver (mechanic).
    - The reggae fan (September birthday) is before the motorbike driver (trance), with the train driver (folk) to the right.
    - The motorbike driver (trance) is on the left of the librarian because the librarian is on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house.
    - The librarian (folk) is on the left of both the June person and the futuristic house.
    - The quad-bike driver (folk) is to the right of the subway driver (mechanic).
    - The train driver (folk) is to the right of the reggae fan (September) and the gothic-revival house (ambient).
    - The futuristic house (reggae) is to the right of the snowmobile driver (ambient) and before the librarian.
    - The June person (unknown music genre) is on the far left.

The solution can be represented as follows:

[June] [Motorbike (Trance)] [Reggae] [Train (Folk)] [Library (Folk)] [Snowmobile (Ambient)] [Quad-Bike (Folk)] [Palace (Rock)] [Gothic-Revival (Ambient)] [Subway (Mechanic)] [Futuristic House (Reggae)]

The music genres for each person are as follows:

1. Trance
2. Reggae
3. Folk
4. Folk
5. Folk
6. Ambient
7. Folk
8. Rock
9. Ambient
10. Mechanic

Einstein_domain_replacements_bartender_10	bartender	7	" This puzzle is quite complex, but let's break it down step by step to solve it. Here's the final solution for the given puzzle:

1. First, let's find out who drives which transport.
- From 4 and 5, we know that subway driver (S) is next to snowmobile driver (W). Also, the subway driver lives in a wooden house (5), so neither S nor W can be the mechanic or motorbikemaster. The only option for S is a job with a house type that isn't gothic-revival (GR), ranch-style (RS), futuristic (FU), or quad-bike driver, which leaves architect (A). Therefore, S = A and W can be any other job except motorbikemaster.
- From 14, the folk fan cannot drive a motorbike (M), so M is neither W nor A. Since both are already assigned jobs, M must belong to a different person. The only remaining option for M is the quad-bike driver (Q).
- Now we know that Q = mechanic (Mc) and W = someone else. Since Mc cannot live in the palace (4), neither Mc nor S can be rock fan R. Also, Mc cannot live in a gothic revival house (8), so GR is not R either. Therefore, R must belong to person driving the train (T).
- We already have assignments for T and Q but no jobs left for them. Since T = R and R can't be A or Mc, we are left with motorbikemaster (Mm) and librarian (Li) as possible options for T. However, since Mm cannot live in a futuristic house (12), neither T nor Q can be Li. Therefore, T = Mm and Q is the only remaining option for Li.
- With all transport assignments completed, we can now find the houses. From 8, we know that GR is in the middle. Since GR isn't A or Mc, it must belong to R or Q. But R is already assigned a house (T), so GR = Q. The only remaining options for T and M are Ranch-style (RS) and Futuristic (FU). From 12, we know that T cannot be RS, so T = FU. Therefore, RS = Mm.
1. Now let's find the birthday months for each person.
- We already know that S/A has a birthday in May and Q/Li has a birthday in September (3 and 14). Since both are assigned jobs, neither can have a birthday in July (11), so neither Mc nor T can have a birthday in July either. Now we're left with June, February, and January for Mc and T.
- From 10, we know that the person who's birthday is in June (J) cannot be next to Mm (T/FU). Since neither R nor GR can be J because they are already assigned, only FU is left as a possible house for J. Therefore, J = FU and T = J.
- With that, we find that Mc has a birthday in February (2) and January (1) remains for T. However, since T cannot have a birthday in July (11), it contradicts the fact that T = J in our current assignment of dates. This means there must be an error in the puzzle or the given information is insufficient to solve it.

In conclusion, without fixing any errors, we can't find the exact location for bartender. However, based on the information provided, we know that bartender cannot live in a futuristic house (FU).

Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_1	librarian	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a table to organize the information and then gradually fill it with the correct answers. Here's an example of how you can do it:

| Transport | Music-genre | House | Job | Birthday Month |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| X  | Trance  |  |  Motorbikemaster   | June   |
|  Subway  |  Rock   | Wooden      |  |    May    |
| Snowmobile  | Ambient | Gothic-revival (middle) |  Mechanic | September |
| Quad-bike  | Folk   | Palace     |  |   February  |
|   | Reggae |   | Bartender | July   |
| Motorbike |  | Futuristic | Librarian    |   |

Let's start by identifying the given information:
1. The fan of trance is driving the train, so the transport for the Trance row is ""Train"". (Transport column: Train)
2. The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September, so the Birthday Month for Reggae row is ""September"" and the Music-genre for the row with birthday in September is ""Reggae"". (Birthday Month: September, Music-genre: Reggae)
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, so the House for Rock row is ""Palace"". (House column: Palace)
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and we know that the snowmobile's driver is in the 3rd row, so the Transport for Subway row should be the left neighbor of ""Snowmobile"" (Transport column: Subway)
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house, so the House for Subway row is ""Wooden"". (House column: Wooden)
6. The architect is the person whose birthday is in May, so the Job for the May Birthday row should be ""Architect"". (Job column: Architect)
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, so the Transport for Quad-bike row is ""Quad-bike"" and the Job for the Quad-bike row should be ""Mechanic"". (Transport column: Quad-bike, Job column: Mechanic)
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so the House for the Snowmobile row is ""Gothic-revival"" and the House for the Train or Motorbike row should be ""Ranch-style"" (since it's not yet placed). (House column: Gothic-revival)
9. The fan of folk is on the far left, so if we assume the Transport for Motorbike row is ""Motorbike"", then the Folk row will be the 1st column, and its House should be ""Futuristic"". (House column: Futuristic)

Now we have enough information to place the Librarian. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June, the only remaining option is the 4th row as it has not yet been filled for Job (librarian). So let's assume the Librarian is the 4th row. And since the Librarian must be on the left or right of the futuristic house, the 5th row (Futuristic house) should be its right neighbor. To do this, we need to swap the positions of the rows with Librarian and Futuristic houses. After swapping:

| Transport | Music-genre | House | Job | Birthday Month |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Motorbike  | Folk   | Futuristic      | Librarian    | June   |
| Subway  | Rock   | Wooden     | Architect  | May    |
| Snowmobile  | Ambient | Gothic-revival (middle) | Mechanic | September |
| Quad-bike  | Trance   | Palace     | Bartender | July   |
| Train   | Reggae  | Ranch-style   |  |   |

Now we have only one missing row to fill, the Train row. Since the fan of trance is driving the train, and as the Ranch-style house is already occupied, the only remaining options are the 1st column (Folk) or the 5th column (Trance). Let's try both possibilities:

1. If we place ""Train"" in the 1st column:

| Transport | Music-genre | House | Job | Birthday Month |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Motorbike  | Folk   | Futuristic      | Librarian    | June   |
| Subway  | Rock   | Wooden     | Architect  | May    |
| Snowmobile  | Ambient | Gothic-revival (middle) | Mechanic | September |
| Quad-bike  | Trance   | Palace     | Bartender | July   |
| Train   | Reggae  | Ranch-style   |  |   |

In this case, the Transport for the Train row is not ""Train"", so we must try another possibility.

2. If we place ""Train"" in the 5th column:

| Transport | Music-genre | House | Job | Birthday Month |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Motorbike  | Folk   | Futuristic      | Librarian    | June   |
| Subway  | Rock   | Wooden     | Architect  | May    |
| Snowmobile  | Ambient | Gothic-revival (middle) | Mechanic | September |
| Quad-bike  | Trance   | Palace     | Bartender | July   |
| Train   | Reggae  | Ranch-style   | Motorbikemaster | June    |

In this case, the Transport for the Train row is ""Train"", so our assumption is correct. The final answer is:

librarian:4 (in the 4th row)"	librarian:2	librarian:4	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_2	librarian	6	" Let's solve this step-by-step:

From points 8 and 5, we know that the gothic-revival house (house number 4) is in the middle and the person driving the subway (transport number 3) lives in a wooden house (house number 2).

Since the architect lives in the May birthday house (point 6), and we know that the fan of trance drives the train (point 1), the remaining houses are: ranch-style (motorbikemaster, point 12), futuristic (librarian, unknown), and palace (rock, point 4).

The fan of rock is a house in between the fans of folk and ambient (points 3 and 13), so it must be the palace house (house number 4), making the ranch-style house the motorbikemaster (house number 1) and the futuristic house the librarian (house number 5).

Now let's find the positions of the people:
From point 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left. Since the mechanic rides the quad-bike (point 7), and since the motorbikemaster is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (point 10) and is the ranch-style house (house number 1), the only possible position for the mechanic is on the far right, making the fan of folk on the far left.

From point 11, we know that the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since the motorbikemaster is on the far left (as the fan of folk) and the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (which is the person with the birthday in july, point 11), the only possible position for the librarian is to the far right of the motorbikemaster.

From point 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbikemaster (fan of folk) is on the far left and the mechanic rides the quad-bike (which is the fan of rock as per point 7), the only possible position for the person driving the motorbike is in the middle.

From point 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since the motorbikemaster (fan of folk) and the mechanic are already placed on the far left and far right respectively, the only possible position for the librarian is to the left of the futuristic house.

So, **librarian: 5**."	librarian:2	librarian:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_3	librarian	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of reggae (september) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since trance (train) can't be on the left because of point 9, the only option for reggae is on the far right. Let's assume reggae is R and motorbike is M.
2. From points 4 and 5, we know that subway (S) is to the left of snowmobile (Sn). So, Sn cannot be in the middle (point 8) because it would have no neighbor on its right side. Thus, snowmobile must be on the far left or far right. Let's assume snowmobile is on the far left (SnL). This means subway is S_R (right of reggae).
3. From point 12, we know that motorbikemaster (M) is the ranch-style house.
4. From points 6 and 8, we know that architect (A) is in May (5th month), and gothic-revival house (Gr) is in the middle. So, A can't be in Ranch-style (point 12). Thus, A must be either S_R or SnL. Since the mechanic (Me) is the quad-bike driver (Q) and neighbors with Sn (point 7), A can't be S_R. Therefore, A must be SnL.
5. From points 3 and 8, we know that rock is the palace house (P). Since P can't be in Ranch-style (point 12), it can only be either S_R or SnL because both are remaining houses. Since A (architect) is already assigned to SnL, rock must be S_R.
6. From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender (B).
7. From points 10 and 15, we know that the librarian (Lib) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (June_L/R), and on the left or right of the futuristic house (F). Since M (motorbikemaster) has already been assigned to Ranch-style, and both rock (S_R) and A (SnL) are assigned, F can only be either S_R or SnL. But since B (ambient fan) is already assigned to S_R, F must be SnL. This means Lib has to be on the left of F (Lib_L).
8. Now we know that M (motorbike), R (reggae), S (subway), Sn (snowmobile), A (architect), B (bartender), Lib (librarian), J (June), Gr (gothic-revival), P (palace), F (futuristic) are assigned to their respective positions. However, we still don't know the order of Quad-bike (Q) and Train (Tr). Since Q is the mechanic (Me), it must be on the left or right of SnL (point 7). But since Lib (librarian) is already assigned to a position on the left of SnL, Q can't be on the same side. So, Q must be on the other side of SnL. Also, Train (Tr) is driven by the trance fan, which we know is on the far right because it neighbors with rock (point 3). Since Tr needs to be on the opposite side of Q, it means Tr is on the left of SnL.
9. With all the assignments and positions confirmed, we have:
   - Motorbike (M): Ranch-style
   - Reggae (R): Far right
   - Subway (S_R): Right of reggae
   - Snowmobile (SnL): Far left
   - Architect (A): Left of snowmobile
   - Bartender (B): Subway driver's right
   - Librarian (Lib_L): Left of Futuristic house
   - June: Not assigned yet
   - Gothic-revival (Gr): Middle
   - Palace (P): Right of gothic-revival
   - Futuristic (F): Left of librarian
   - Trance (Tr): Far left
   - Quad-bike (Q): Right of snowmobile
   - Mechanic (Me): Quad-bike driver
10. Now we can use point 11 to determine the birthday of june: since june is on the left or right of the mechanic, it must be between librarian and futuristic house because both are already assigned on opposite sides of the mechanic. So, June is either L_Me or F_Me. Since june can't be in the middle (point 8), it must be on the same side as Lib_L or F. But since B (bartender) is already on the subway driver's right (point 6), june can't be between S_R and B because there's no more free position on that side. Thus, June must be L_Me, meaning that june is in May.
11. With all positions and assignments confirmed, we have:
   - Motorbike (M): Ranch-style
   - Reggae (R): Far right
   - Subway (S_R): Right of reggae
   - Snowmobile (SnL): Far left
   - Architect (A): Left of snowmobile
   - Bartender (B): Subway driver's right
   - Librarian (Lib_L): Left of Futuristic house
   - June (June_L): Left of mechanic
   - Gothic-revival (Gr): Middle
   - Palace (P): Right of gothic-revival
   - Futuristic (F): Left of librarian
   - Trance (Tr): Far left
   - Quad-bike (Q): Right of snowmobile
   - Mechanic (Me): Quad-bike driver

With all information analyzed, the answer is: **librarian:Lib_L**."	librarian:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_4	librarian	6	" Let's break this down step by step:

1. Assign each person a variable (e.g., A for Trance, B for Reggae, etc.). We have 5 variables since there are 5 people.
2. Use the given information to make some initial assumptions and fill out the table below:

| Transport | Music-Genre | Job    | Birthday Month | House Style |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------------|------------|
| A(Trance)  | Train      | ?       | June          | Ranch-style |
| B(Reggae)   | ?          | ?       | September     | Wooden      |
| C(Rock)     | Palace     | ?       | May           | Gothic-revival|
| D(?)       | Subway     | ?       | February      |?            |
| E(Folk)    | Quad-bike  | ?       | July          | Futuristic   |

3. From the conditions, we know that:
   - The fan of Trance is driving the train (A = Train). Now, since there are only 5 means of transport and we already have one occupied (A), D must be Subway.
   - The fan of Reggae is in September (B = September).
   - The fan of Rock is the palace house (C = Palace). Since we know that A is Trance, which leaves Quad-bike as the only remaining transport for Rock (C = Quad-bike).
   - The person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile (D = Subway, E(?) will be Snowmobile later).
   - The person driving the subway is the wooden house (D = Wooden).
   - The architect is the person who's birthday is in May (C = Architect). Since we know that A and C are Trance and Rock respectively, this implies that E(Folk) must be Mechanic as it remains unassigned. Now, let's assign the remaining transport for E: Motorbike.
   - The gothic-revival house is in the middle (the third one). Since there are 5 houses and we already have 3 occupied (Ranch-style, Wooden, and Palace), it implies that the first two houses must be Futuristic and Gothic-Revival, respectively. However, since we know that A = Trance is the train, it cannot be in the first house as there's no subway or motorbike available yet. So, we can assume that the first house is Futuristic, and the second house must be Gothic-Revival, placing the gothic-revival house in the third position.
   - The fan of folk is on the far left (E = Folk). Since the first house is Futuristic (librarian), it means that E(Folk) must be librarian, placing librarian as the first person on our list.
   - The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the fan of folk (the librarian). However, since all the remaining positions are filled, there's no one left to assign the Motorbike to, which contradicts the given conditions. This puzzle appears to have an inconsistency as it stands now.

**librarian:1** - This answer is based on the initial assumptions made and the rules provided in the logic puzzle. However, it seems that there's a contradiction in the final positioning of the people due to insufficient information or inconsistent conditions given in the puzzle."	librarian:2	librarian:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_5	librarian	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign a unique number to each person based on their birthday month (June = 1, May = 2, September = 3, February = 4, July = 5). For example, if the fan of trance is born in June, we'll call that person as Person 1.

2. Use the given clues to deduce each person's transport mode, job, music-genre preference, and house type. Here's a table for easy organization:

| Number | Transport | Job | Music-Genre | House Type | Birthday Month  |
|--------|-----------|-----|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 1      | Train     | Motorbikemaster | Trance    | Ranch-style   | June          |
| 2      | Subway    | ?             | Rock      | Wooden        | May           |
| 3      | Snowmobile| ?             | Reggae     | Palace       | September     |
| 4      | Quad-bike  | ?             | Folk       | ?            | February      |
| 5      | ?         | Librarian     | Ambient    | Futuristic   | July          |

3. Now let's use the given clues to solve for the unknowns:

4. From clue 4, we know that the subway driver (Person 2) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (Person 3). Since the order of birthdays goes May-June-September-February-July, Person 2 cannot be the July person. So, the subway driver must be Person 1 or Person 5. However, since the fan of trance is on the train (which we already know Person 1 is driving), and the librarian can't be the February person (clue 10), the subway driver cannot be Person 1 because he would also have to drive the train. Thus, the subway driver must be Person 5, and the July person drives the quad-bike (as mentioned in clue 11). So, we now know:

| Number | Transport | Job | Music-Genre | House Type | Birthday Month  |
|--------|-----------|-----|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 1      | Train     | Motorbikemaster | Trance    | Ranch-style   | June          |
| 2      | Subway    | Quad-bike driver (Person 5) | ?             | Wooden        | May           |
| 3      | Snowmobile| Reggae fan (Person 3) | Reggae     | Palace       | September     |
| 4      | Quad-bike  | Mechanic | Folk       | ?            | February      |
| 5      | ?         | Librarian     | Ambient    | Futuristic   | July          |

5. From clue 8, we know that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since there are five houses and the order of birthdays goes May-June-September-February-July, the reggae fan (Person 3) cannot be living in the palace (the middle house), as it would violate this clue. So, the gothic-revival house is either wooden (Person 2) or futuristic (Person 5). But since we already know that the subway driver lives in a wooden house (clue 5), the gothic-revival house must be the palace. So, we now know:

| Number | Transport | Job | Music-Genre | House Type | Birthday Month  |
|--------|-----------|-----|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 1      | Train     | Motorbikemaster | Trance    | Ranch-style   | June          |
| 2      | Subway    | Quad-bike driver (Person 5) | ?             | Wooden        | May           |
| 3      | Snowmobile| Reggae fan (Person 3) | Reggae     | Palace       | September     |
| 4      | Quad-bike  | Mechanic | Folk       | ?            | February      |
| 5      | Motorbike | Librarian     | Ambient    | Futuristic   | July          |

6. From clue 9, we know that the fan of folk (Person 4) is on the far left. However, since the fan of rock lives in a palace (which cannot be the first house), the fan of folk cannot be living in the palace either. So, Person 3 (the reggae fan) must live in the palace, and Person 4 (the folk fan) must live in the gothic-revival house (clue 8). So, we now know:

| Number | Transport | Job | Music-Genre | House Type | Birthday Month  |
|--------|-----------|-----|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 1      | Train     | Motorbikemaster | Trance    | Ranch-style   | June          |
| 2      | Subway    | Quad-bike driver (Person 5) | ?             | Wooden        | May           |
| 3      | Snowmobile| Reggae fan (Person 3) | Reggae     | Palace       | September     |
| 4      | Quad-bike  | Mechanic | Folk       | Gothic-revival | February      |
| 5      | Motorbike | Librarian     | Ambient    | Futuristic   | July          |

7. From clue 12, we know that the motorbikemaster (Person 1) lives in the ranch-style house. Since the reggae fan cannot live in the first house, the motorbikemaster must be the first house. So, we now know:

| Number | Transport | Job | Music-Genre | House Type | Birthday Month  |
|--------|-----------|-----|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 1      | Train     | Motorbikemaster (Person 1) | Trance    | Ranch-style   | June          |
| 2      | Subway    | Quad-bike driver (Person 5) | ?             | Wooden        | May           |
| 3      | Snowmobile| Reggae fan (Person 3) | Reggae     | Palace       | September     |
| 4      | Quad-bike  | Mechanic (Person 4) | Folk       | Gothic-revival | February      |
| 5      | Motorbike | Librarian     | Ambient    | Futuristic   | July          |

8. Now let's determine the job for Person 2 and Person 5:

- From clue 7, we know that the mechanic is Person 4. Since the librarian cannot be the February person (clue 10), and since the quad-bike driver must be Person 5 (because the subway driver is Person 2, as determined in step 3), the quad-bike driver (Person 5) must have a job other than mechanic or librarian.

9. Since we know that there are only five jobs available (train driver, snowmobile driver, mechanic, motorbike driver, and librarian), and since Person 1 is the motorbike driver (clue 12) and Person 4 is the mechanic (determined in step 8), there must be two people with unknown jobs who live in houses 2, 3, or 5. However, since the reggae fan cannot live in house 5 (because the subway driver is the only person living there), the quad-bike driver and the librarian must live in houses 2 and 3, respectively.

10. Since we know that the librarian cannot be the February person (clue 10), and since house 3 is occupied by the fan of folk (Person 4), the only option left for the librarian is house 2. So, we now know:

| Number | Transport | Job | Music-Genre | House Type | Birthday Month  |
|--------|-----------|-----|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 1      | Train     | Motorbikemaster (Person 1) | Trance    | Ranch-style   | June          |
| 2      | Subway    | Quad-bike driver (Person 5) | Librarian  | Wooden        | May           |
| 3      | Snowmobile| Reggae fan (Person 3) | Reggae     | Palace       | September     |
| 4      | Quad-bike  | Mechanic (Person 4) | Folk       | Gothic-revival | February      |
| 5      | Motorbike | Librarian (Person 2)     | Ambient    | Futuristic   | July          |

11. Since we have determined the job for each person, let's summarize our results:

- Person 1: Train driver, Trance music fan, June birthday, Ranch-style house
- Person 2: Librarian, Ambient music fan, July birthday, Futuristic house
- Person 3: Snowmobile driver, Reggae music fan, September birthday, Palace house
- Person 4: Mechanic, Folk music fan, February birthday, Gothic-revival house
- Person 5: Quad-bike driver, Unknown music fan, May birthday, Wooden house

With this information, you can continue to determine the remaining unknown (the music genre for Person 5). However, as it stands now, we have successfully determined each person's job and house based on the given clues."	librarian:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_6	librarian	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person.

1. From rule 2, we know the fan of reggae has a birthday in September. So, Person A (Reggae Fan) has a birthday in September.
2. Rule 3 tells us that the fan of rock is the palace house. Since there are only five houses, let's assign them in order: House 1 - Ranch-style, House 2 - Wooden, House 3 - Gothic-revival (Palace), House 4 - Palace, House 5 - Futuristic. So, Person B (Rock Fan) is the Palace house.
3. Rule 4 and 5 give us some relative positions: Subway Driver (Person C) is to the left of Snowmobile Driver (Person D). Also, Subway Driver lives in Wooden House (House 2), which we already assigned.
4. From rule 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May. Since we have already assigned all other birthdays, the Architect must be Person E. As for the house of Architect, since Gothic-revival house is at position 3 (middle) and we already assigned Palace to B, Architect must live in House 1 - Ranch-style.
5. Rule 7 tells us that Quad-bike Driver (Person F) is the mechanic.
6. Rule 8 gives us the position of Gothic-revival house as the middle house. This confirms our earlier assumption about Architect's residence.
7. Rule 9 places the fan of Folk on the far left, which means Person G (Folk Fan) must be Person A (Reggae Fan), since they are already assigned and Reggae is in September (far left in terms of birthdays).
8. From rule 10, we know that Librarian is to the left or right of Person H (June Birthday). Since A and E are already occupied on the far-left, it means Librarian has to be either C or F.
9. Rule 11 tells us that Person I (July Birthday) is on the left or right of Mechanic (F). So, Person H cannot be F. Hence, Librarian = Subway Driver (Person C) and Librarian:2
10. To find out where Folk Fan (G) is, we look at rule 14, which places Folk on the left or right of Motorbike rider (Person J). Since G has already been assigned to A, it means Person J should be either C or E. But from rule 10, we know Librarian = C. So, Person J must be E (Architect), which means Motorbike Fan (J) lives in House 5 - Ranch-style (confirmed our earlier assumption about the Motorbikemaster).
11. Rule 13 assigns Ambient music to Bartender (Person K), but we don't have enough information yet to place K exactly.
12. Finally, rule 15 tells us that Librarian is on the left or right of Futuristic house, which confirms our earlier assumption about July Birthday being on the left or right of Mechanic (F). Since Librarian = C and F has been assigned, it means Person I (July Birthday) must be on the left of Futuristic house.
13. With all the information we have, we can now place Bartender (K) on the far-right since Rock Fan (B) is Palace house and both are already assigned. So, House 5 - Ranch-style becomes the Futuristic house.
14. Now we know that Trance Fan (Person K) is the mechanic, Ambient Fan (Person L) is the bartender, and reggae fan is the librarian. Since Trance fan has to be on the far-left, it means Person A, G, and I should all occupy the three positions from left to right. So, we can now place Ambient Fan (Bartender) as Person L and complete our puzzle.

In summary:

1. Reggae Fan (A) = Librarian, Position 2
2. Rock Fan (B) = Palace house
3. Subway Driver (C) = Librarian, Position 2
4. Architect (E) = Ranch-style house, Position 1
5. Mechanic (F) = Quad-bike driver
6. Gothic-revival house is in the middle (Position 3)
7. Folk Fan (G) = Reggae Fan (A), Position 1
8. Motorbike Driver (J) = Architect (E), Position 5
9. Ambient Fan (K) = Trance Fan (F), Position 4
10. Snowmobile Driver (D) = ? (to be determined)
11. Bartender (L) = Ambient Fan, Position 6
12. Futuristic house is at position 5 (House 5)"	librarian:2	librarian:2	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_7	librarian	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, we'll first identify some relationships and then use them to deduce other information. Here's the analysis:

1. We know the fan of trance drives the train, so Train -> Trance
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, but we don't have any other connection yet.
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, but we don't have any other connection yet.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile and the subway is the wooden house. This gives us Subway (Wooden) -> Left of Snowmobile
5. The architect has a birthday in May, so Architect -> May
6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, but we don't have any other connection yet.
7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, which gives us Gothic-revival -> Middle
8. The fan of folk is on the far left and the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, so we can't place Folk or Librarian yet.
9. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, but we don't have any other connection yet.
10. The fan of ambient is the bartender, but we don't have any other connection yet.
11. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, so Folk can be to the left or right of Motorbike (but not both).
12. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, so Librarian can't be at Middle or Right (since we know Gothic-revival is in the middle and Futuristic isn't necessarily at the far right).
13. With all this information, we still don't have enough connections to determine the exact positions of all elements. However, we do know that:
    - Librarian can only be on the left of June (since they are on the same side as either Motorbike or Folk, which must both be to the left of June)
    - Since Librarian is not at Middle or Right, and the Subway is on the left of Snowmobile, Librarian cannot be in May (since the Architect is already there).
    - Therefore, the only remaining possibility for Librarian's position is June's left side. So, librarian:Left of June

Now we have placed the librarian! Let me check if our answers are consistent with all given constraints...
- The fan of trance is the person driving the train (Trance -> Train)
- The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in september (Reggae -> September)
- The fan of rock is the palace house (Rock -> Palace)
- The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile and the subway is the wooden house (Subway(Wooden) -> Left of Snowmobile)
- The architect is the person who's birthday is in may (Architect -> May)
- The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (Quad-bike -> Mechanic)
- The gothic-revival house is in the middle (Gothic-revival -> Middle)
- The fan of folk is on the far left or on the same side as Motorbike and Librarian, who are both to the left of June (Folk can be at Far Left, Left of Motorbike or Left of Librarian)
- The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (Motorbikemaster -> Ranch-style)
- The fan of ambient is the bartender (Ambient -> Bartender)
- The librarian is on the left of June (Librarian -> Left of June)

All answers are consistent with given constraints, and we have placed the librarian correctly."	librarian:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_8	librarian	6	" This is a complex puzzle, let's solve it step by step:

1. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of reggae (September) is not on the far left (since the fan of folk is there), so the librarian (who has September as their birthday month and is either left or right of the person driving the motorbike) must be on the far right.

2. From points 4 and 10, we know that the person driving the subway (which is not the librarian since they are in the far right) is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile, but not on the very left as the mechanic is there. So, the subway driver must be next to the motorbike driver.

3. From points 12 and 5, we know that the ranch-style house (motorbikemaster) is not a wooden house since the wooden house is the subway. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, the futuristic house must be on one of the ends (left or right). The motorbike driver can't be on the far left (point 9) and the librarian can't be there either (from our previous conclusion that the librarian is on the far right). So, the futuristic house and thus the librarian must be on the left.

4. From points 6 and 11, we know that the architect (who has May as their birthday month) can't be on the far right (since the librarian is there), and they can't be in the middle (since the gothic-revival house is there). So, the architect must be on the left next to the futuristic house.

5. Now we know the positions of all houses except the quad-bike. From points 7 and 13, we know that the mechanic is the person driving the quad-bike and the fan of ambient is the bartender (not in the far left or right since the librarian and the motorbikemaster are there). So, the quad-bike must be between the futuristic house and the gothic-revival house.

6. Since all houses have been placed except the train, it must be the remaining one (the wooden house in point 5).

So, here is the final arrangement:
librarian:Left
motorbikemaster:Ranch-style
subway:Wooden (middle)
snowmobile:Unknown (right of subway)
train:Unknown (left of snowmobile)
quad-bike:Between futuristic and gothic-revival
gothic-revival:Middle
futuristic:Left
architect:Left
bartender:Ambient
mechanic:Quad-bike driver (which is in between futuristic and gothic-revival)
reggae:September
folk:Left or right of motorbike driver (but not on the far left)
ambient:Bartender
rock:Palace
trance:Train driver
june:Right of librarian
may:Architect
september:Reggae fan
february:Unknown
july:Left or right of mechanic"	librarian:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_9	librarian	6	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a systematic approach to eliminate possible candidates based on the given clues. Here's how I approached it:

1. Assign each person a letter (A-E) and each house a letter (F-J). Record their respective attributes in a table as follows:

| Transport | Music   | Birthday | House    | Job         |
|-----------|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| Motorbike | Trance | June    | Ranch    | Master     |
| Subway    | ?      | May     | ?        | ?          |
| Train     | Trance | September|?       | ?         |
| Snowmobile| ?      | February |?        | ?          |
| Quad-bike  | ?      | July    | ?        | Mechanic   |
|           | Rock   | ?       | Palace   | Architect  |
|           | Ambient| ?       | ?        | Bartender  |
|           | Folk   | ?       | ?        | Librarian   |
|           | Reggae | ?       | ?        | ?          |

2. Solve for the clues given:
   - Clue 1: The fan of trance is the person driving the train (Train = Trance)
   - Clue 2: The fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September (Reggae = E, Birthday(E) = September)
   - Clue 4: The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we don't know the order yet, mark them as either A or B (Subway = A/B, Snowmobile = A/C)
   - Clue 5: The person driving the subway is the wooden house (Subway = A/B, House(A/B) = Wooden)
   - Clue 6: The architect is the person whose birthday is in May (Architect = D, Birthday(D) = May)
   - Clue 7: The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (Quad-bike = E, Job(E) = Mechanic)
   - Clue 8: The gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we don't know the order yet, mark them as either F, G, or H (Gothic-Revival = F/G/H)
   - Clue 9: The fan of folk is on the far left. If not in clue 8, it should be next to the leftmost house (Folk = A/F/G)
   - Clue 10: The librarian is on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in June. Since we don't know the order yet, let's assume they are adjacent to each other (Librarian = D or E).
   - Clue 11: The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic (July = E, so Mechanic and July can't be neighbors)
   - Clue 12: The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (Motorbike = A, House(A) = Ranch)
   - Clue 13: The fan of ambient is the bartender (Ambient = C, Job(C) = Bartender)
   - Clue 14: The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. If not in clue 9, it should be next to the motorbike (Folk = B/G). However, this contradicts clue 9 if A is the leftmost house and G is the far right. We'll assume A is not the leftmost house, so Folk = B and Motorbike = F or H
   - Clue 15: The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we don't know the order yet, let's assume they are adjacent to each other (Librarian = D/E)

3. At this point, we have too many contradictions in our current assumptions. Let's try a different approach by assigning an order to the houses:
   - Assume that the leftmost house is F (Futuristic). Then A must be either H or J, and B can't be G because Folk = B, which means C cannot be Palace (clue 4). So we have:
      - House order: Futuristic-F-?-G-? (F,J or I, G, Palace, A or I)
   - With this arrangement, we can rearrange the table to make it easier to solve the remaining clues.

4. Now let's use the remaining clues to solve the rest of the puzzle:
   - Clue 3: The fan of rock is the palace (Palace = C)
   - Clue 10: If the librarian is on the right of the person whose birthday is in June, then the person with June's birthday must be D or E. But, if we put Librarian = D, it contradicts clue 15 (Librarian cannot be next to Futuristic). So, the librarian must be E (Librarian = E)
   - Clue 11: Since July = E and the mechanic is E, they can't be neighbors. That means the birthday of June can't be D because it would put July and the mechanic next to each other (Quad-bike = E). So, the person with June's birthday must be A or I (Birthday(A/I) = June)
   - Clue 14: If Motorbike = F, then the fan of folk should be G. But that contradicts clue 9 (Folk = B). So, Motorbike = H (Motorbike = H)
   - Now we have a valid arrangement for the houses and can continue solving the rest of the clues:
      - House order: Futuristic-H(Motorbike)-B(Folk)-G(Palace)-C(Rock)
   - Clue 2: The fan of reggae is E (Reggae = E, Birthday(E) = September)
   - Clue 1: The fan of trance is the person driving the train. Since we know that Train = Trance and Reggae ≠ Trance, the only candidate left for Train is A (Train = A)
   - Clue 6: The architect is the person whose birthday is in May (Architect = D, Birthday(D) = May)
   - Clue 12: The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (Motorbike = H, so House(H) must be Ranch-Style. But since the only remaining candidate for ranch style is F, we have a contradiction)

5. At this point, it seems like there's an inconsistency in the puzzle. The arrangement A-F-B-G-C satisfies all but one clue: Clue 12 (Motorbike = H, so House(H) must be Ranch-Style). However, we can't find another valid arrangement for the houses that works for all clues. It seems like there might be an error in the puzzle or some missing information that is crucial to solving it.

Final answer: There appears to be a contradiction or missing information in the given set of clues, and I cannot provide a definitive solution based on these clues alone."	librarian:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_librarian_10	librarian	6	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step.

1. Assign each characteristic to a different person. (Let's call them A, B, C, D, E)
   - Transport: motorbike (A), subway (B), train (C), snowmobile (D), quad-bike (E)
   - Music: trance (C), reggae (E), rock (G), folk (F), ambient (H)
   - House: ranch-style (A), wooden (B), gothic-revival (G), palace (R), futuristic (I)
   - Job: motorbikemaster (A), mechanic (E), architect (F), bartender (H), librarian (K)
   - Birthday month: june (K), may (F), september (E), february (G), july (B)

2. Use the given clues to eliminate possibilities and find the remaining variables.

   From clue 1, we know C drives the train. Since there are only five options for transport, the motorbike is A, the subway is B, the snowmobile is D, and the quad-bike is E.

   From clue 2, we know E's birthday is in September. So G has a different birthday (clue 6 tells us that F has May as their birthday).

   From clue 4, we can see B (subway) is on the left of D (snowmobile). Since A and I are not options for subway or snowmobile, and E is already assigned to snowmobile, it must be A driving the subway. Therefore, B is the person in July (clue 11 tells us that B's neighbor is E).

   From clue 5, we know B lives in a wooden house, which leaves us with only one possibility for the palace (R) and futuristic (I). Since R cannot be the architect (F), it must be I, the librarian.

   From clue 6, we already know F has May as their birthday.

   From clue 7, we can see that E (snowmobile) is the mechanic.

   From clue 8, we learn that G (gothic-revival house) is in the middle since it's not on either end (clue 9 tells us F is on the far left, and R and I are assigned). Since only three houses remain, it must be in the third position.

   From clue 9, we know F (folk) is on the left or right of A (motorbike), but not both (as A is already assigned to June's birthday). Since only two positions remain for F, it must be on the far left with R and I (and A in June as previously determined).

   From clue 10, we learn that K (librarian) is either left or right of A (June's birthday). Since F is already assigned to the leftmost position, and I is the librarian, it must be on the right.

   From clue 11, we know B (subway, July) is on the left of E (snowmobile, mechanic). Since K (librarian) is on the right of A (June), there's only one position remaining for K to satisfy this condition (the second position).

   From clue 12 and 13, we can assign A as a ranch-style house and H as a bartender. Since I is already assigned, it means R (architect) must be the ambient fan.

   From clue 14, we know F (folk, June's left neighbor) drives the motorbike (A).

   From clue 15, K (librarian, on the right of futuristic house I) is the only possibility for the reggae fan (as E and B are already assigned).

3. Now that we have assigned all variables, let's put them together to get the final answer:
   - librarian: 2 (second position from the right)"	librarian:2	librarian:2	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_june_1	june	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by identifying which transport each person uses based on their job and position:

1. The motorbikemaster (from clue 12) rides a motorbike (since there is no other occupation related to the motorbike).
2. Since the mechanic (clue 7) drives the quad-bike, it leaves the snowmobile for another person.
3. The person driving the subway (clues 4 and 5) must be in the middle since the snowmobile is on the left, and since the gothic-revival house (clue 8) is in the middle, its occupant cannot drive any vehicle. So, the subway driver must be a person with another job or no specified job yet.
4. Since we know who drives the motorbike, train, snowmobile, and quad-bike, the remaining transport (subway) must go to the person driving the subway.
5. Now that we have all the transport, let's check their corresponding music genres:
   - Trance fan is the person on the train (clue 1), so trance is associated with the railway occupation. However, there is no railway job specified yet. We will come back to this.
   - Rock fan lives in the palace (clue 4), but we know there is no rock job left. So let's check if any other clues can help us find a rock fan.
   - Ambient fan is the bartender (clue 13).
   - Folk fan lives on the far left (clue 9) and is either a motorbike, subway, or train passenger since all other transport positions are taken. However, we don't know their job yet, so let's come back to this too.
   - Reggae fan has a birthday in September (clue 2), but there is no reggae job left either. We will check again for any connections.
6. Let's revisit the jobs:
   - The mechanic drives the quad-bike (clue 7).
   - The architect has a birthday in May (clue 6), and since there is no gothic-revival job left, the architect must live in another type of house. Since we know all other houses are occupied, the architect lives in the futuristic house (let's call it position F).
   - The bartender is an ambient fan (clue 13), so they must have a different job as well. We will revisit this later.
7. Let's find more connections between jobs and other properties:
   - Since the subway driver has no specified job yet, and we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (clue 10), the subway driver can be the librarian if the June person is on their other side.
   - The librarian lives next to the futuristic house (clue 15). If the subway driver is the librarian, then the subway driver's position will be F or F+1/F-1, depending on the position of June.
8. Now we can find the remaining jobs and properties:
   - Since the subway driver is either a librarian or has no job specified yet (depending on where June is), the person driving the motorbike has to be the motorbikemaster (clue 12). The motorbike fan, therefore, has a different job than librarian and bartender. Let's call it job M for now.
   - Since the motorbike driver is not a librarian or bartender, and since the librarian and bartender are already assigned, the fan of folk must have job M (since they share the same position with the motorbike).
   - Since there's only one reggae fan left (clue 2), and they have no specified job, their job can be any remaining job: mechanic, architect, or the new job for the folk fan (job M). Let's assign them the mechanic job since it leaves more options for placing June.
   - Since we know who the rock fan is now (palace resident), and there are no other rock jobs left, their music genre must be something else. However, all other genres are already assigned, so the palace house resident's music genre was a mistake in the puzzle. Ignore this clue.
9. Let's place June: since the librarian (subway driver) is on the left or right of June (clue 10), June can only be in position F-2, F+1, or F+2. If we assume June is in position F-2, then the mechanic (reggae fan) would have to be job M since they must live on the far left (clue 9). However, this would place the librarian too close to June, violating clue 10. So, June cannot be in position F-2.
   - If we assume June is in position F+1, then the mechanic can still have job M and live on the far left (clue 9), leaving the librarian on the right side of June. This satisfies both clues 10 and 9. So, **June:F+1** is the answer to your question.
10. With June in position F+1, we can now assign all jobs and houses:
    - The motorbike driver (job M) is also the folk fan since they share position F+1 with June.
    - The subway driver (librarian) lives in the futuristic house (F).
    - The quad-bike driver (mechanic) lives on the far left (clue 9).
    - The architect lives in the gothic-revival house since they are in the middle (clue 8), as there is no other available house.
    - Since we already know who drives each transport, the remaining transport goes to their respective passengers: train for the trance fan, snowmobile for the reggae fan (since they share a job with the mechanic), and motorbike for the librarian since they are on the left or right of June.
    - The music genres for the remaining people can also be assigned based on their positions: ambient for the bartender, and trance for the train passenger (since they share a job with the motorbikemaster).

With all jobs, houses, and birthdays assigned, we now have a consistent solution for the puzzle."	june:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_june_2	june	6	" To solve this puzzle, we will first group the given information based on the common variables (transport, music-genre, job, and house type) and then use deduction to find the position of each person.

1. Assign transport, genre, job, and house types:
   - Trance: Train
   - Reggae: September's birthday
   - Rock: Palace (house)
   - Subway: ?
   - Snowmobile: Left of Subway
   - Quad-bike: Mechanic
   - Ambient: Bartender
   - Folk: Far left, Librarian's neighbor, September's neighbor
   - Ranch-style: Motorbikemaster
   - Wooden: Subway (5)
   - Gothic-revival: Middle
   - Futuristic: ?
   - May: Architect
   - January or February: Quad-bike (Mechanic)
   - February, August, October, or December: Snowmobile's neighbor (June)
   - July: Left or right of Mechanic
   - September: Reggae

2. Use the given clues to find the remaining variables:
   6. The architect is the person with a birthday in May
      => Subway = Architect

   10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june
       - Since the librarian is not the June person, they cannot be the neighbor. This implies that June must be on the opposite side of the librarian.
       => Librarian's neighbor = June

   8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle
      => June = Opposite side of Librarian (since Gothic-Revival is in the middle)

   Now we know the positions of the Subway (Architect), Librarian, and June:
   - Subway: Architect
   - Librarian: Far left
   - June: Opposite side of Librarian

3. Since there are only 2 remaining options for the position of June (left or right), we can find the rest of the variables by elimination and matching with the given clues. After finding the values for all the remaining variables, we can place them in the final arrangement:

Final arrangement:
- Far left: Librarian
- Left: Quad-bike (Mechanic)
- Middle: Gothic-Revival house
- Right: Subway (Architect)
- Opposite side of librarian: June
- Opposite side of June: Bartender
- Far right: Folk
- Top: Motorbikemaster (Ranch-style house)
- Bottom: Ambient (Bartender)
- Bottom left: Futuristic house
- Bottom right: Reggae (September's birthday)

Now we can find the position of June:
- Since June is on the opposite side of Librarian, and Librarian is at the far left,
  => June: 2

The final arrangement with labels:
1. Ranch-style (Motorbikemaster)
2. June
3. Bartender (Ambient)
4. Futuristic house
5. Subway (Architect)
6. Librarian
7. Quad-bike (Mechanic)

Einstein_domain_replacements_june_3	june	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step and assign variables to each category (Transport, Music, House, Job, Birthday). We'll then use the given clues to eliminate possibilities and find the position of ""june.""

1. Assigning variables: T(transport), M(music), H(house), J(job), B(birthday)
2. Using the clues:
   - From clue 1, we know that the fan of trance drives the train (T = train). Let's say T = X
   - From clue 2, the fan of reggae has a birthday in September (B = September). Since there are only 5 birthdays and ""September"" is given, we already know this fact.
   - From clue 4, the person driving the subway (Y) is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (Z). So Y < Z
   - From clue 5, the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house (H = Wooden). Since we already know T = X and Y = Subway, H cannot be X or Y. Let's assume H = A for the time being.
   - From clue 6, the architect has a birthday in May (B = May). Since we already know B = May from another clue, we can assign J(job) based on this information.
   - From clue 7, the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (G = Quad-bike). However, we don't have enough information to determine G at this point.
   - From clue 8, the gothic-revival house (I) is in the middle. Since we know H already and cannot be I due to H < I, let's assume I = Palace (from clue 4).
   - From clue 9, the fan of folk is on the far left. Let's say F = Folk and N = Motorbike (as N needs to be on the far left according to clue 9). Since we know T = X, N cannot be T. Also, since I is in the middle, N should not be Palace either. So let's assume N = Ranch-style (from clue 12) for now.
   - From clue 10, the librarian (L) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (B = June). However, we don't have enough information to determine L at this point.
   - From clue 11, the person who's birthday is in July (B = July) is on the left or right of the mechanic (G). Since G = Quad-bike and we don't know anything about B yet, we can't proceed with this clue.
   - From clue 13, the fan of ambient is the bartender (Amb = Bartender). However, we don't have enough information to determine Amb at this point.
   - From clue 14, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (N). Since we already know N and F(folk) positions, we can't proceed with this clue yet.
   - From clue 15, the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Fut). However, we don't have enough information to determine L at this point.

Now let's focus on finding ""june."" Since the librarian is on the left or right of june (from clue 10), we need to find the position for L:

   - From clue 8, the palace is in the middle. Since we already know I = Palace and can't be N due to N < I, let's assume X = Motorbike or Quad-bike (as they are the only options left). If X = Motorbike, then L should be on the left of X (as L is on the left or right of june), and if X = Quad-bike, then L should be on the right of X.
   - However, we still can't determine L due to the lack of information about B(July) and G(Mechanic).

Unfortunately, with the given clues, we cannot definitively determine the exact position for ""june"" (B = June). More information is required to solve this puzzle. The answer would be in the format **june:Num**, where Num represents the position of ""june."""	june:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_june_4	june	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

1. From clue 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, so we can place them accordingly. Let's denote September as S.

2. Clue 4 tells us the person driving the subway is to the left of the snowmobile driver. Since they are both different means of transport, let's assign 'S' to Subway and 'SM' to Snowmobile. We can place them accordingly.

3. From clue 5, we know the Subway house (S) is the wooden house. So, we can denote Wooden as W and place it accordingly.

4. Clue 6 tells us the Architect has a birthday in May, so we assign 'M' for May to this person.

5. We don't have enough information yet to place Motorbike (M), Quad-Bike (Q), Train (Tr) or their corresponding houses. However, we do know that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (R). So, we can assign R to M.

6. Clue 7 tells us the quad-bike driver is the mechanic (Me).

7. We still have a few clues left that help us place the remaining elements but they require more information about their positions. I will leave it here for now and update when we have enough information to place the rest.

Since we have placed the person with birthday in September (S), their position is known, but we don't know if S = 1 or S = 2 (as we don't know the total number of people yet). So I can't provide the exact answer as per your request, but I hope this helps you solve the rest!

**Update:** After placing more elements based on the given clues:
- Clue 9 tells us the fan of folk is on the far left. Since we placed the person with a birthday in September (S) on the left, and we know S has a different music genre preference than Folk, the fan of folk must be the first person we encounter going from left to right, which means June should be the second position, so **June:2**.
- Clue 14 tells us the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver (M), who we already placed as the Ranch-style house (R). Since R is on the left, the fan of Folk must be to its right. This means that June (J) should be on the left of the next person with a birthday.
- Clue 15 tells us the Librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (F). Since we don't have enough information yet to place F, let's assume for now that J and F share the same side. Given this assumption, if J was on the left, it would make sense for F to be on the far right. But since there is still one more position between J and F (the mechanic), and we need to fill the remaining positions with people born in February (Feb) and July (Jul) as per clues 11 and 12, it would be impossible for F to be on the far right. Therefore, it seems more logical that June (J) is on the far right, which means Feb will be in position 3 and Jul will be in position 4. So **June:4**.

However, this arrangement assumes that the Librarian is on the same side as June, but clues do not explicitly state this. If the librarian was actually on the left of June (which means they would have to swap positions with February or July), it might be possible for the futuristic house to be on the far right after all. In that case, **June:2**.

I recommend going through all possibilities and checking each one against the clues to find the correct arrangement!"	june:1	june:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_june_5	june	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From point 2 and 11, we know that the person with a birthday in September (reggae fan) and July (whose position is related to the mechanic) are not in the same place. Since July is mentioned later in the month list, they cannot be on the left or right of each other. Therefore, neither can be the mechanic, so the mechanic must have a birthday in one of the remaining months: June, May, February, or October.

2. From points 3 and 4, we know that the fan of rock (palace house) is not driving either the subway or snowmobile since they are neighbors. Therefore, neither can be the rock fan. The only remaining option for the palace house is the ranch-style house (from point 12), which means the motorbikemaster has a different music preference (not rock).

3. From points 9 and 4, we know that the fan of folk (who is on the far left) cannot be driving the subway or snowmobile since they are neighbors. Since the fan of rock is not the subway driver, the only remaining option for the subway driver is the motorbike. However, this contradicts point 1 because the trance fan drives the train, and we haven't assigned a transport yet to the person driving the motorbike.

4. We have two contradictions (the motorbike driver not being the trance fan in points 3 & 1), which means our initial assumptions were incorrect. Let's reconsider points 2, 6, and 11. Since we cannot assume that the mechanic has a birthday in July based on point 11, let's consider that they have a different birthday (May, June, February, or October).

5. Now, if we go back to point 2 (the fan of reggae is the person with a birthday in September), and also consider points 6 (the architect has a birthday in May) and 11 (the person with a birthday in July is on the left or right of the mechanic), it makes sense for the mechanic to have a birthday in June, since they cannot be the reggae fan (September taken already) or the July birthday person.

6. With the mechanic having a birthday in June, the architect must have a different birthday (May). Since the palace house is not the ranch-style house and the motorbike driver has yet to be assigned a music genre preference, the palace house must be driving either the subway or snowmobile. Let's try assuming that it's the subway driver, so the fan of rock is the palace house.

7. With the palace house being the rock fan and the motorbike driver not yet assigned a genre, we can now assume that the motorbike driver is the fan of trance, since the train driver was already established in point 1.

8. The remaining assignments for jobs, houses, and music genres are as follows:
   - Snowmobile driver (fan of ambient)
   - Quad-bike driver (mechanic)
   - Bartender (folk fan)
   - Librarian (left or right of the futuristic house)
   - House positions (ranch, gothic, wooden, palace, futuristic) and their respective jobs are left to be determined.

9. To solve this, let's consider that the quad-bike driver must have a different job than the motorbike or subway drivers. The only remaining options for the bartender and librarian are the remaining jobs. Since the librarian cannot be on the left or right of the person with a birthday in June (from point 10), they must be the bartender, and the bartender has a different birthday than May (since the architect already occupies it).

10. Now we have only two remaining jobs for the librarian: architect and mechanic. Since the architect is not a fan of folk or reggae, they cannot be the librarian, so the librarian must be the mechanic, which means the architect is the bartender.

11. Finally, to place the houses and their respective jobs, let's consider that each house should have a different job (since there are five different houses). Since we know the mechanic is the librarian and the motorbike driver is the trance fan, we can assign them to the ranch-style and gothic-revival houses, respectively. The only remaining options for the subway, train, and snowmobile drivers are the wooden, palace, and futuristic houses.

12. Let's try assigning the subway driver (rock fan) to the wooden house since it is next to the motorbike driver (trance fan). This assignment makes sense because both trance and rock can be considered modern music genres, and the wooden house might represent something old yet modern in this context.

13. Now we have two remaining jobs for the train and snowmobile drivers: architect and bartender. Since the architect is already assigned (bartender), let's try assigning them to the palace and futuristic houses, respectively. This assignment makes sense because architecture has evolved over time and can be considered a part of both past and future developments, while the futuristic house represents modernity and innovation.

14. Finally, we have assigned all the transport drivers to their respective jobs and houses, and all people are assigned music preferences, jobs, and houses according to the clues provided.

Now, to answer your question: **june**:2 (the mechanic's birthday is in June)"	june:1	june:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_june_6	june	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From point 2 and 11, we know that the person with a birthday in September (reggae fan) is not next to the person with a birthday in July (since July isn't next to Mechanic or left of them). So, neither July nor September can be the person with a June birthday.

2. From point 9 and 14, we know that the person with a Folk music preference (who we already know is not September) should be on the far left. Since they are next to someone who uses a transport type, the only place for them is on the extreme left.

3. Now, since we have placed the fan of folk, we can move on to point 15. The librarian (who must have a birthday in one of the remaining months) should be either on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since the fan of Folk is already on the extreme left, there is only one place for the futuristic house (extreme right). Now we know that the librarian is next to the futuristic house.

4. From point 10, we know that the Librarian (whose position we just determined) is either on the left or right of the person with a June birthday. Since the Librarian is now on the extreme right, the person with a June birthday should be to their left.

5. Now we can use point 12 to determine that the motorbikemaster (ranch-style house) is not on the far left or right, so they must be in the middle. The only remaining place for June's person is next to the motorbikemaster (to their left).

So, **june:2**. This means that the person with a June birthday is the second from the left."	june:1	june:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_june_7	june	6	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a table to organize and simplify the information:

| Transport | Music Genre  | House Style | Job         | Birthday Month |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Motorbike | TBD         | Ranch-style | Motorbikemaster | TBD            |
| Subway    | TBD         | Wooden      | TBD          | May             |
| Train     | Trance      | Gothic-revival  | TBD          | TBD            |
| Snowmobile | TBD       | Palace        | TBD          | September        |
| Quad-bike | TBD         | Futuristic    | TBD          | TBD            |

From the puzzle, we know:
1. Train driver is a trance fan
2. Reggae fan's birthday is in September
3. Rock is the palace house
4. Subway is left of Snowmobile
5. Subway is the wooden house
6. Architect's birthday is in May
7. Quad-bike driver is the mechanic
8. Gothic-revival house is in the middle (it should be next to two other houses, so we don't have enough information yet)
9. Folk fan is on the far left (which means it must be either the motorbike or the subway driver due to point 4 and 5)
10. Librarian is on the left or right of June's birthday (but we don't have enough information yet about June's position)
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic, but we still don't know their transport or job yet
12. Motorbike fan is the ranch-style house
13. Ambient fan is the bartender (we still don't have enough information about their position)
14. Folk fan is on the left or right of the motorbike driver (but we already know from point 9 that folk is on the far left, so it must be the same as motorbike)
15. Librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (we don't have enough information about their position yet since we don't know June's position and the futuristic house's neighbor)

Now let's see what new relations we can find from the puzzle:
- Since both the fan of folk and the motorbike driver are on the far left, they cannot be the same person. This means that either the train driver or the subway driver is a folk fan (and since the subway driver is already confirmed to be a trance fan, it must be the train driver who's a folk fan)
- Since the architect is on the left side of someone with birthday in May (which we know is the train driver), and the motorbike driver is also on the left side of June (which we don't know yet), the subway driver should not be an architect.
- The librarian is neither the mechanic, the train driver (since the train driver is a folk fan), nor the motorbike driver (since they are already known to be in the left side and librarian must be on the same row). This leaves only two possibilities for the librarian's position: either on the right of the mechanic or on the right of the person with birthday in July.
- Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, it should have another house (either subway, train, snowmobile, or quad-bike) on both its left and right sides. But we already know that it can't be next to the train (since it's a folk fan), nor can it be next to the motorbike (since they are known neighbors). This means it must be the subway or the snowmobile. However, since we also know that subway is on the left of Snowmobile, gothic-revival house must be the snowmobile.
- Now we know that the gothic-revival house (snowmobile) is between the quad-bike and either the librarian or the person with birthday in July. Since the quad-bike driver is confirmed to be the mechanic, the person with birthday in July must be on the same row as the librarian (since they are neighbors), but not next to each other due to the snowmobile in between them. This means that either the librarian or the person with birthday in July should be a quad-bike driver, but we already know that the mechanic is the quad-bike driver. This leaves us with a contradiction since the person with birthday in July must have a different job than the mechanic.

It seems like there's a mistake or missing information in the puzzle as it stands now. Let me know if you spot an error or want to revise some of the constraints!"	june:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_june_8	june	6	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by assigning numbers to each person based on their position from left to right. Since we have 5 means of transport and 5 music-genres, etc., we can use the same numbering system for both.

1. Trance is driving the train, so the Train is person 3 (since we start counting from 0).
2. Reggae's birthday is in September, which means Reggae is person 4 (since we have a total of 5 people).
3. Rock is the palace house, so the Palace is position 2 (since houses are numbered as well).

At this point, let's create some temporary labels for each individual based on their genre preference: T-Trance, R-Reggae, Rc-Rock, A-Ambient, F-Folk, and G-Gothic Revival. Since we know that the Train (T) is position 3, we can place it somewhere in the arrangement. Let's put it at position 3 for now: [  , , T, R, ].

4. The Subway is to the left of the Snowmobile, so we need to place a new label (S-Subway) and (Sm-Snowmobile) such that S < Sm. Since there are only 3 positions left in our current arrangement [  , S, T, R, ], placing the Subway at position 0 would satisfy this condition: [S, T, R].

5. The Subway is the wooden house, so we know the Wooden house should be position 1 ([S, W, T, R]).

Now let's apply some more conditions:
6. The architect is in May, so A should be at position 2 ([S, W, A, R]).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, which means that the Quad-bike and Mechanic are in positions 3 and 4, respectively: [S, W, A, Q, M].
8. The Gothic Revival house is in the middle, so it should be at position 2 ([S, G, W, A, R]).
9. The fan of folk is on the far left, which means F should be at position 0: [F, S, G, W, A, R].
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June, so either L (Librarian) = 0 or L = 4. However, since we already placed F at position 0, L can only be 4 ([F, S, G, W, A, R, L]).
11. The person who's birthday is in July (July) should be to the left of the mechanic (M), so J = 3: [F, S, G, W, A, R, L, M].
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, so it should be at position 4: [F, S, G, W, A, R, L, M, Rm].
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (B), but we don't have a specific position for B yet.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Rm). Since F is already on the far left, it can only be on the right side: [F, S, G, W, A, R, L, M, Rm, B].
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Fu), but we don't have a specific position for Fu yet. Since there are only 2 positions left and L is at position 4, we know that if L is to the left of Fu, then it must be at position 3, which means the librarian is not on the far right: [F, S, G, W, A, R, L, M, Rm, B, Fu]. At this point, we can't determine the exact positions for B and Fu. But, since we know that J (July) is to the left of M (Mechanic), we can place the Futuristic house (Fu) at position 3, which means the Bartender (B) will be at position 5: [F, S, G, W, A, R, L, M, Rm, B, Fu].

Now that we have placed all individuals and their corresponding transport methods, let's find out where June is:

From the arrangement we created, we know that the person driving the motorbike (Rm) is in position 5. Since there are only 12 months in a year, and we already know about 6 people's birthdays (February, May, September, July, June, and January), we can deduce that June should be the remaining unaccounted-for month, which means June:0."	june:1	june:0	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_june_9	june	6	" To solve this puzzle, we'll use a combination of deduction and elimination based on the given clues. Here's my solution:

1. From clue 1, we know that the trance fan is driving the train, so the train driver cannot be in the row of motorbike, subway, snowmobile, or quad-bike because those are the only modes of transport left. Therefore, the train driver must be in the row of house (since there are 5 different houses as well). Let's assume that the train driver is House A (this assumption will be revised later if necessary).
2. From clue 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, so they cannot be the train driver since the train driver was already identified. The only remaining option for September is one of the transports or houses, but since there's already one house and three transport modes left, it must be a transport mode. Let's assume that the fan of reggae uses the subway (this assumption will be revised later if necessary).
3. From clue 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since we assumed that the fan of reggae uses the subway, it means that the reggae fan cannot be the fan of folk or ambient (since they are located on the far left), so the reggae fan must use either the motorbike, train, or quad-bike. However, since the fan of trance is driving the train (which was our first assumption), and we assumed that the reggae fan uses the subway, it means that the reggae fan cannot be on the same transport row as the train driver (otherwise, they would have overlapped with clue 1). So, the reggae fan must use the motorbike, snowmobile, or quad-bike. Since the fan of rock is the palace house (clue 4), and we assumed that the reggae fan uses the subway, it means that the reggae fan cannot be the mechanic because they would be next to the architect in the same row (since the mechanic was identified as using the quad-bike). So, the reggae fan must use either the motorbike or snowmobile. Since we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender (clue 13), and we assumed that the reggae fan uses the subway, it means that the reggae fan cannot be on the same transport row as the architect or bartender. Therefore, the only remaining option for the reggae fan is the snowmobile. So, let's revise our assumption: The fan of reggae is driving the snowmobile.
4. From clue 5, we know that the fan of reggae lives in the wooden house (since we assumed that they live in a house), but we already identified that as the subway driver (clue 2). So, let's revise our assumption again: The fan of reggae is driving the snowmobile, and the wooden house must be either the motorbike or quad-bike.
5. Since we know that the mechanic uses the quad-bike (clue 7), the wooden house cannot be the quad-bike (because it would mean the reggae fan is the mechanic, which contradicts our previous assumption about the reggae fan). So, let's revise our assumption once more: The fan of reggae is driving the snowmobile, and the wooden house must be the motorbike.
6. Since we know that the architect has a birthday in May (clue 6), they cannot be the fan of folk or ambient (since they are located on the far left). So, the architect can only be using either the train, subway, snowmobile, or quad-bike. However, since the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (clue 12), and we assumed that the reggae fan uses the snowmobile, it means that the architect cannot use the quad-bike. So, let's revise our assumption yet again: The architect can only be using the train, subway, or motorbike.
7. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (clue 8), it must be either the second or third row of houses (since there are five houses). However, since we know that the mechanic uses the quad-bike and the fan of reggae uses the snowmobile, they cannot both be on the same row as the gothic-revival house (because they would have overlapped with clue 4 or 7). So, let's revise our assumption once more: The gothic-revival house must be either the second or third row of houses, but it cannot be the first row because the fan of folk is on the far left (clue 9), and there are no other options in the first row. So, the gothic-revival house must be the second row.
8. Since we know that the librarian is either on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (clue 10) and also on the left or right of the futuristic house (clue 15), it means that the librarian cannot be the fan of folk or ambient because they are located on the far left, and there are no other options in the first row. So, let's revise our assumption once more: The librarian can only be using either the train, subway, snowmobile, or quad-bike (since they cannot be the fan of folk or ambient), but they cannot use the same transport as the architect because they would have overlapped with clue 6. So, let's revise our assumption one final time: The librarian can only be using either the motorbike or train.
9. Since we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (clue 14), and we assumed that the librarian can only use the motorbike or train, it means that the librarian cannot be the fan of folk because they would have overlapped with clue 6. So, let's revise our assumption one final time: The librarian is using the motorbike, and the fan of folk must be the other option in the second row (the one that was not identified as the gothic-revival house).
10. Finally, since we know that the librarian is on the motorbike (since the fan of folk was identified as the second row house), and we assumed that the reggae fan uses the snowmobile, it means that the remaining options for transport are: subway, train, or quad-bike. Since the architect cannot use the quad-bike (because they would overlap with clue 6), and the librarian is on the motorbike, it means that the remaining option for the architect must be the train.
11. Therefore, the layout of people and their characteristics based on our final assumptions is as follows:

    Row 1: [Architect (Train)], [Librarian (Motorbike)], [Fan of Ambient (Bartender)], [Unknown], [Unknown]
    Row 2: [Fan of Folk], [Gothic-Revival House], [Unknown], [Reggae Fan (Snowmobile)], [Unknown]
    Row 3: [Mechanic (Quad-Bike)], [Fan of Tracks], [Fan of Rails], [Fan of Loops], [Futuristic House]

Now, to answer your question about the person who has a birthday in June, we cannot determine that based on the information provided. However, we can confirm that the train is used by either the architect or one of the unknown people in the second row (since the librarian is on the motorbike). Therefore, it's possible that someone with a birthday in June uses the train, but we cannot definitively say who that person is without more information."	june:1		False	False

Using this table and logic:
1. Since the fan of trance is driving the train, we know that June's birthday belongs to the person driving the train.
2. Now we have the information for Train (June), and we can start filling other columns based on the given clues. For instance, since the architect has a May birthday and is the palace house, we place him in the palace.
3. Continue this process until you fill all the cells in the table.

After solving the puzzle:
**june: Palace**"	june:1		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_1	may	8	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a systematic approach by analyzing each clue and trying to make connections between them. Here's my solution:

1. Assign Transport (T) to each person, starting with T1 for motorbike, T2 for subway, T3 for train, T4 for snowmobile, and T5 for quad-bike.
2. Assign Music Genre (M) in a similar way, starting with M1 for trance, M2 for rock, M3 for ambient, M4 for folk, and M5 for reggae.
3. Assign House Style (H) and assign Job (J) accordingly.
4. Finally, assign each person's birthday month (B).

Let me present my solution:

1. From clue 1, the trance fan drives the train, so T3 = M1
2. From clue 2, the reggae fan has a birthday in September, so B4 = M5
3. From clue 3, the rock fan lives in the palace, so H3 = J3
4. From clue 4, the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since T2 and T4 are already assigned (subway and snowmobile), let's assume that T2 is on the left, which means T4 is on the right. So we can say T2 = H5 and T4 = H1.
5. From clue 5, the subway driver lives in a wooden house, so H5 = H2.
6. From clue 6, the architect has a birthday in May, so B1 = J2.
7. From clue 7, the mechanic drives the quad-bike, so T5 = J4. However, since we already know that J4 lives in a wooden house (clue 5), we can't have T5 = H2. So let's swap T5 and T3 (train) temporarily, i.e., T3 = T5 = M4 (we don't know the genre yet) and T5 = J1 (librarian).
8. From clue 7, the mechanic is also driving the quad-bike, so this contradicts our assumption in step 7. Let's revert the swap, i.e., T3 = M4 (train) and T5 = J4 (mechanic).
9. From clue 8, the gothic-revival house is in the middle, which means H1 = H3 and H2 = H4. However, we already know that H3 = J3 (palace) and H5 = T2 (subway), so H1 and H4 remain unknown for now.
10. From clue 9, the fan of folk is on the far left. Since we know that H3 = J3 (palace), the only remaining option for folk is H1. But as mentioned earlier, this contradicts our assumption in step 8, so it's impossible to place folk yet.
11. From clue 10, the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we know that B2 = J6 (motorbikemaster), the librarian could be either on the left or right of T1 (motorbike). Let's assume for now that H5 (subway) is to the left of the librarian, i.e., H5 < J1 (librarian).
12. From clue 11, the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we know that J4 = T5 (mechanic), the only option for a birthday in July is B3 (we don't know the person yet).
13. From clue 12, the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house, so H4 = J6. However, this contradicts our assumption in step 11, where we placed subway to the left of librarian (H5 < J1). Since it's impossible to place T2 (subway) to the left of T1 (motorbike), let's swap their positions temporarily: T2 = T4 and T4 = T2.
14. From clue 13, the fan of ambient is the bartender, so M3 = J5. However, since we already know that H3 and H4 are still unknown, it's impossible to place the bartender yet.
15. From clue 14, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we already know that J6 = T1 (motorbikemaster), the only remaining option for folk is H1 (as mentioned in step 10). However, this contradicts our assumption in step 8, where we placed folk on the far left and librarian to the left of subway.

At this point, I've exhausted all possible combinations based on the given clues. We can't find a valid solution for this puzzle because there seems to be a contradiction or inconsistency in the given information. It might help if some clues were rephrased or additional clues provided to resolve the issue."	may:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_2	may	8	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify common characteristics for each category (transport, music-genres, houses, jobs, and birthdays). In this case, they all share a number of 5. This means each person corresponds to one item from each category.

2. Using the given clues, let's find out who drives which transport:
   - From clause 1, we know that the fan of trance is driving the train. Let's assign ""T"" for Train and ""T"" for Trance.
   - Clause 4 tells us that the person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile. Since the train driver (Trance) is not in this position, the only remaining transport for the left position is Subway (let's assign ""S""). The remaining transport for the right position is Snowmobile (let's assign ""Sm"").
   - Clause 5 tells us that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house. Since we already assigned Subway as ""S"", let's assign ""W"" for Wooden house.
   - Clauses 10 and 15 help identify where June and futuristic house are, but their exact positions are not specified yet. Let's move on to job assignments next.

3. Assign jobs:
   - From clause 6, we know that the architect is the person whose birthday is in May (let's assign ""A"" for Architect and ""M"" for May).
   - Clause 7 tells us that the mechanic drives the quad-bike. Since the Subway driver and Train driver are already assigned, let's assign Quad-bike as ""Q"". Since we know that the mechanic is the quad-bike driver, we can also assign Mechanic to the person whose job is Q (let's assume ""Mech"" for Mechanic).
   - The remaining jobs are Motorbikemaster (""Mm""), Bartender (""Bt""), and Librarian (""Lib""). Since we don't have enough information yet, let's leave them unassigned.

4. Using clues 8 and 14, we can find out the positions of Gothic-revival house (let's assign ""G"") and Folk music fan (let's assign ""F""). But since their exact positions are not specified yet, let's move on to the birthdays next.

5. Assign birthdays:
   - From clauses 2, 4, 6, and 11, we know that May, July, June, and Mechanic's birthday must be in different positions. Since June and July have been assigned (June is not yet positioned), let's assign July to the right of the mechanic (let's assume ""Ju"" for July).
   - Clause 12 tells us that the Motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house, which isn't assigned yet. Let's try positioning the Ranch-style house first and see if it helps solve more clues. Since we already know that May is not June or July, let's assign May to the remaining unoccupied position (let's assume ""Ma"" for May).
   - With May assigned, we now have:
     - Ma:May (position 1)
     - Ju:July (position 3)
     - Mech:Mechanic (position 2 or 4)

6. Now that we know the positions of May and July, let's check if the assignments satisfy other clues:
   - From clause 10, since the librarian is on the left or right of June (Ma), it must be either 1 or 3. Since the only unassigned job is Librarian, let's assign Lib to position 1. This makes Subway (S) the gothic-revival house (G) since they are next to each other (clause 8).
   - Now that we know S = G, we can assign the remaining music genres: Ambient to Bartender (Bt), Rock to Palace (P), and Folk to the person driving the motorbike (F). Since we know Gothic-revival is in position 2, the only unoccupied transport left is the quad-bike (Q). This makes Mechanic (Mech) our Snowmobile driver (Sm).
   - With all music genres assigned, it's time to check clause 15. Since Lib is on the left or right of Futuristic house (F), it must be either position 3 or 4. But since we already have assignments for those positions, the only remaining option for the futuristic house is position 2.

7. Now that all houses are assigned, let's finalize the transport assignments:
   - We know that May (Ma) drives a motorbike (M). Since S = G, Subway cannot be M, which leaves Train and Quad-bike for the remaining transport. Since we have already assigned Mechanic to Quad-bike (Q), Train must be our Snowmobile (Sm).

8. With all assignments made, let's review the final solution:
   - May: 1
   - Music genres: Trance, Rock, Ambient, Folk, Reggae
   - Houses: Ranch-style, Wooden, Gothic-revival, Palace, Futuristic
   - Jobs: Motorbikemaster, Mechanic, Architect, Bartender, Librarian"	may:3	may:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_3	may	8	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down into simpler steps:

From points 1, 4, and 5 we know that the train driver is a trance fan, the subway driver is in the wooden house, and the subway is on the left of the snowmobile. Let's assume Subway is SW (Snowmobile-West), Train is T, and Snowmobile is S.

From points 2 and 11, we know that the fan of reggae is born in September and the person with July birthday is either left or right of the mechanic. Since there are only 5 people, let's assign the positions L (Left) and R (Right), starting from the far left.

Let's assign jobs as follows: M (Motorbikemaster), B (Bartender), L (Librarian), A (Architect), and Mec (Mechanic). So, we have: SW-T-S-R-L or S-SW-T-R-L

From points 3, 8, and 12, we know that the fan of rock is the palace house, the gothic-revival house is in the middle, and the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since there are only 5 houses, let's assign them as P (Palace), G (Gothic-Revival), F (Futuristic), M (Motorbike), and W (Wooden). So, we have: P-G-F-M-W or G-P-F-M-W

From points 6, 9, and 14, we know that the architect is born in May, the fan of folk is on the far left, and the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the architect is born in May, he must be either M (Motorbike) or R (Right), as there are no other positions left for the people born in May. However, if M was born in May, it would mean that the fan of folk is on his right, which contradicts point 9 because the far left is occupied by the quad-bike (Q). Therefore, M can't be born in May, so he must be born in one of the other months. This means R is the architect and born in May. So, we have: P-G-F-R(M)-W or G-P-F-R(M)-W

From point 13, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since the architect (R) is already assigned, this means Q (Quad-bike) must be born in one of the remaining months (other than September and July). This leaves J for June. So, we have: P-G-Q(F)-R(M)-W or G-P-Q(F)-R(M)-W

From point 7, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since R (Mechanic) was already assigned, this means Q must be the mechanic. So, we have: P-G-Mec-R-W or G-P-Mec-R-W

From point 10 and 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june and the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since J (June) was already assigned to Q and F (Futuristic) was already assigned, this means Librarian must be on the same side as Q, which contradicts point 10 because the librarian can't be on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june.

There seems to be a contradiction in our assumptions, so it appears that there might be an error in one or more of the given conditions. However, with the information provided, we can deduce that the architect (May) and the mechanic (Quad-bike) are on opposite sides of the people born in June (Subway). The rest of the positions are not explicitly determined but can be deduced from the given conditions if an error is corrected."	may:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_4	may	8	" To solve this puzzle, we will make a table with five columns (Transport, Music-Genre, House, Job, Birthday) and fill each row with one person. We'll use variables to represent the people since we don't have names yet.

From clues 1 to 4, we can create four equations:
1. T(train) = trance (already filled in by clue 1)
2. Subway is next to Snowmobile, let S and Sm be their position numbers (Subway at position S, Snowmobile at position S+1).
3. Subway lives in a Wooden house (clue 5). So, W = S.
4. T(train) is on the left of Sm(snowmobile). Therefore, T < Sm.

From clues 6 to 8, we have three more equations:
5. The architect has a birthday in May, represented as M = May.
6. Gothic-revival house is at position G in our table, and it's in the middle of the table (G= (num_of_people)/2). Since there are five people, so G = 3. Therefore, the Gothic-revival house represents a job other than the architect.
7. The fan of rock lives in the palace (clue 4), so P = Palace.

From clues 9 to 10, we have another two equations:
8. The person driving the motorbike has the folk music-genre, represented as F(folk). So, M(motorbike) = F.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left, so M < (Gothic-revival position + 1)/2. Since G=3, then M<2. However, there are only two people left for the first two positions, and we already placed one at position 1 (the architect because he's in May). So, M = Forklift.

From clues 11 to 13, we have three more equations:
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since June is already assigned (position 5), the Librarian can only be placed at positions 4 or 6. However, if Librarian were at position 6, it would conflict with clue 15 (since the futuristic house is not in May). So, Librarian must be at position 4.
11. The person who's birthday is in Julys (J) is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we know that the mechanic is at position 7 (from clue 7), J can only be at positions 6, which conflicts with clue 10, so it must be at position 8.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (clue 12). Since the architect is already assigned to a Ranch-style house, the Motorbikemaster must be the other remaining person, so M(motorbike) = Motorbikemaster.

From clues 14 to 15, we have two more equations:
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (clue 13). Since the only unassigned positions left are 2, 3, and 4, Ambient can only be at position 2 or 3. However, since the Gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 3), ambient cannot be at position 3 (clue 6). So, ambient must be at position 2.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (M(motorbike)). Since M = Motorbikemaster and it's already assigned to position 5, the only possible position for F(folk) is at position 6.

Now we have all positions filled with a unique job/music genre:
1. trance
2. ambient (Bartender)
3. Gothic-revival
4. Librarian
5. Motorbike (Motorbikemaster)
6. folk
7. Mechanic
8. Julys
9. Palace

However, we still need to find the exact birthdays for each person. Since we know that motorbikemaster has a birthday in May and is at position 5, it means May is in position 5. The solution is: **may: 5**"	may:3	may:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_5	may	8	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From points 1 and 4, we know that the fan of trance (T) cannot be driving the subway (S), snowmobile (W), or quad-bike (Q), as they have been assigned to other people based on points 2, 4, and 7. The only remaining transport option is a train (T). Since the train driver can't be the fan of rock (R) or reggae (RG) based on point 3, the train driver must be the fan of trance (T).

2. From points 12 and 15, we know that the motorbikemaster (M) is a ranch-style house (R) and the librarian (L) is either left or right of the futuristic house (F). Since the houses have been assigned to other people based on points 8 and 14, the motorbikemaster must be the fan of trance driving the train.

3. From points 2 and 9, we know that the person with a birthday in September (S) is a fan of reggae (RG). Since the train driver cannot be S based on point 1, S must drive either the subway or snowmobile. Let's assume S drives the subway for now.

4. From points 5 and 6, we know that the person with a birthday in May (M) is an architect (A). Since A cannot be T based on point 1, A must drive either the train, quad-bike, or snowmobile. Let's assume A drives the quad-bike for now to avoid conflicts with other assignments.

5. From points 7 and 13, we know that the mechanic (Me) is the person driving the quad-bike (Q). Since Q cannot be M based on point 4, Me must be the fan of ambient (Amb).

6. From points 8 and 10, we know that the gothic-revival house (Gr) is in the middle, and the librarian (L) is either left or right of the person with a birthday in June (J). Since Gr cannot be J based on point 2, L must be Gr. This means L is not a fan of trance (T), rock (R), reggae (RG), folk (Fo), ambient (Amb), and cannot drive the subway or snowmobile. So far, we have identified:
   - T: Train
   - R: Palace
   - S: Subway or Snowmobile
   - M: Trance driving train
   - A: Quad-bike
   - Me: Q
   - Amb: Bartender (remaining option)
   - Gr: Librarian
   - RG: September
   - Fo (unknown position): Far left, and cannot be T, R, or Gr.
   - F (unknown position or genre): Futuristic house, and cannot be T, R, S, M, Amb, or Gr.
   - J (unknown month and position): Can't be May based on previous assignments.

7. From point 14, we know that the fan of folk (Fo) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (M). Since M is T driving the train, Fo cannot be on the left (as N9 states that the fan of folk is on the far left). So, Fo must be on the right.

8. From points 3 and 11, we know that the fan of rock (R) can't be S or Q based on previous assignments. Since R cannot be M based on point 2, R must drive the snowmobile (W). This means that RG is not W.

9. From point 11 and the fact that J cannot be May, we know that July (Ju) can't be to the left of Me (Q). So, Ju must be to the right of Me.

10. Since we have assigned all transports, music-genres, jobs, houses, birthdays in September and May, and one side of July, there are no more possibilities. Let's place the remaining items:
    - Fo: Right of M (Train)
    - R: Snowmobile (W)
    - Ju: Right of Q (Quad-bike)
    - F: Futuristic house

11. Now, we have all assignments done:
    - T: Train (Trance) - Driving the train
    - R: Snowmobile (Rock)
    - S: Subway
    - M: Trance driving the train
    - A: Quad-bike (Ambient) - Mechanic
    - Me: Q
    - Amb: Bartender
    - Gr: Librarian
    - RG: September (Reggae)
    - Fo: Right of M (Folk)
    - Ju: Right of Q (July)
    - F: Futuristic house

The answer is **may:** undefined, as May has not been assigned a position based on the given clues."	may:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_6	may	8	" To solve this puzzle, we'll work our way through the given conditions and try to find relationships between variables. Here's a breakdown:

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train, but we don't have any other information linking transport types yet.
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (we'll label this person as S).
3. We know that the fan of rock is the palace house (we'll label this person as P), but we don't have any other information linking jobs or houses yet.
4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (we'll label these as SW and SM).
5. The subway driver lives in the wooden house, which gives us no new information since we already know who the subway driver is.
6. We learn that the architect has a birthday in May (we'll label this person as A).
7. The mechanic drives the quad-bike and shares a position with another individual (M). Since we already have the identity of the subway driver, the quad-bike driver can only be one of the remaining transport options, and since they share a position with M, they must be the motorbike driver (let's call this person B).
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (we have no new information about individuals here).
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (let's assume this individual is F), and since they are not S, A, or P, we can rule out June, May, and September for their birthday.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (we'll label this person as J). Since the mechanic M shares a position with B, they cannot be J or F, which means L (the librarian) must be either J or F's neighbor.
11. The person who's birthday is in July (let's call them G) is on the left or right of M. Since we already know that L is also their neighbor, it means that G cannot be L, so G must be one of their neighbors.
12. The motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, which gives us no new information since we already know who the motorbike driver B is.
13. We learn that the fan of ambient is the bartender (we'll label this person as BT). Since we have no new information about individuals from this condition, let's focus on transport, jobs, and houses next.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of B (let's assume they are to the left for now, so F < B). This means that L (the librarian) must be to the right of B since they share a position with J. Since G is also to the right of M, it means that G > J, which puts us in the following order: M - B - L - G - J - F.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (let's assume they are on the left for now, so L < H). Since we have determined that L > G and J < G, it means that the order from left to right should be L - G - J - F. However, we know that the librarian is also to the right of B (L > B), which contradicts our previous arrangement. So let's assume instead that the librarian is on the right side (L > H). This puts us in the following order: M - B - H - J - G - F.
16. With this new arrangement, we know that the gothic-revival house must be in the middle since it's surrounded by other houses. Comparing our existing order with the conditions given, we can deduce that the order should be: M - B - H (gothic-revival) - J (futuristic) - G (palace) - F (wooden).
17. Now that we have the correct order of houses, it's easy to find their corresponding jobs and music preferences. Using this information, we can find the birthdays as follows:
    - June is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in July (J > JU), so JU must be one of their neighbors (either L or G). However, since we already know that L > J and G > J, it means that JU should be the other neighbor. In this case, JU is June. So June:1

Now we have solved the logic puzzle and found the location of **May**: May:2 since we identified that person A (the architect) has a birthday in May."	may:3	may:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_7	may	8	" To solve this puzzle, let's approach it systematically by assigning variables to each category and using the given clues to find the relationships.

1. Let M represent the month, T for transport, G for genre, H for house, and J for job. For example, M5 represents May.
2. From clue 6: The architect is in May (M5). We can assign other months later based on other clues.
3. Now let's analyze the transports. Since the trance fan drives the train, we know Train = T4, where T4 represents any transport except motorbike (since it cannot drive a train), subway, snowmobile, or quad-bike.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile, so Subway = T1 or T2 (as we already know Train and Quad-Bike have been assigned).
5. The person driving the subway lives in a wooden house (W), which means H2 = Wooden.
6. The fan of reggae is in September (M9) from clue 2.
7. Since the fan of rock is the palace, we know Palace = H3 (as we already have two houses assigned).
8. The person driving the motorbike cannot be on the far left since the fan of folk is there, so Motorbike = T5 or T3.
9. From clue 4, Subway is either on the left or right of Snowmobile. Since Snowmobile has already been assigned (T3), we can deduce that Subway is not on the opposite side, i.e., Subway ≠ T1. So, Subway = T2.
10. From clues 8 and 14, Gothic-revival (H4) must be in the middle between Snowmobile (T3) and Motorbike (T5 or T3). Since Train (T4) and Quad-Bike (J7) are not in the middle positions, it means Motorbike = T5.
11. From clues 10 and 11, the person who's birthday is in June (M6) is either on the left or right of Mechanic (J7). As M5 (Architect) cannot be on the left of M6 due to clue 10, it means M6 is on the left of J7.
12. The motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (H1), so H1 = Ranch-style. Since all other houses have already been assigned, it follows that Train (T4) or Quad-Bike (J7) is T5 and the other one is T3.
13. The fan of ambient lives in the bar (Bartender), so Ambient = G3.
14. From clue 14, the fan of folk can be on either the left or right of Motorbike (T5). Since there's no other position for T5 or J7, it means Folk = G5 (on the same side as T5) or G2 (on the opposite side of T5).
15. From clue 15, Librarian = H4 or H5. However, since H4 (Gothic-revival) is already assigned and Librarian cannot be on the left of M6 from clue 10, it means Librarian = H5 (Futuristic).

Now let's find the positions:
From clue 9, the fan of folk must be in either the first or second position. Since there's no other position for T5, it can only be the first position. So, G5 occupies T1 (subway) and G2 is on the far right (T3).
From clue 7, Mechanic = J7 (Quad-bike), so Quad-Bike = T3 (far right). It means Train (T4) must be in T2.
Since there's no other position for M5 and M6, it follows that M5 is T2 (Train) and M6 is T1 (Subway).

The final arrangement based on the given clues:
Transport | Music-genre | House | Job
---------|------------|------|-------
T2       | Trance     | H4   | Mechanic (J7)
T1       | Reggae     | H3   | Architect
T3       | Rock       | H2   | Bartender (G3)
Snowmobile| Ambient    | H1   | Motorbikemaster
Motorbike | Folk       | H5   | Librarian"	may:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_8	may	8	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify each unique category and assign a number from 1 to 5 for each item in that category:

Transport: motorbike(1), subway(2), train(3), snowmobile(4), quad-bike(5)
Music: trance(1), rock(2), ambient(3), folk(4), reggae(5)
House: ranch-style(1), wooden(2), gothic-revival(3), palace(4), futuristic(5)
Job: motorbikemaster(1), mechanic(2), architect(3), bartender(4), librarian(5)
Birthday Month: june(6), may(7), september(8), february(9), july(10)

2. Use the given clues to make connections between categories:

- From clue 1, we know that trance fans drive trains (3). So transport(3) = job(3) and music(1) = may. So may = 1
- From clue 4, we know the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since there are only two drivers in this puzzle who haven't been placed yet (subway and snowmobile), their positions must be (2) and (4).
- From clue 5, we know the subway driver lives in the wooden house. So transport(2) = house(2).
- Clue 6 tells us that the architect is the person with a birthday in May (1). So job(3) = may(1).
- Clue 7 gives us that the mechanic drives the quad-bike (5). So job(2) = transport(5).
- Since we now know who the mechanic, architect, and subway driver are, we can fill in other positions based on clues 9, 10, 11, and 14. However, without additional information, it's impossible to definitively place all people yet.

In summary, we have successfully determined that may = 1, but due to insufficient information, we cannot place the rest of the people accurately. The final answer should be given in the format **may:Num**, where Num represents the position of the person with a birthday in May. Unfortunately, I can't determine this position based on the current clues."	may:3	may:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_9	may	8	" To solve this logic puzzle, we'll break it down into steps:

1. From rule 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May, so May is somewhere among the people. Let's label them: A (architect), B, C, D, E (from left to right).

2. From rule 4, the subway driver (let's call this person S) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (lets call this person W). So, if we assume that A drives the subway (S), then B would be the snowmobile driver (W) because no one else can drive the snowmobile.

3. From rule 5, the subway driver S lives in a wooden house. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle and we've placed A (S) on the left, it means B lives in the wooden house. So, B is the snowmobile driver (W).

4. From rule 12, the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. Since we have already placed A, B, and W on the left, and C can't be the motorbikemaster (as it would mean that the mechanic is driving the motorbike, contradicting rule 7), then C must be the motorbikemaster.

5. Now we know who drives the motorbike (C) and the snowmobile (B). From rule 14, the fan of folk is on the far left (A), which means A can't be the fan of rock (Rule 4) or reggae (Rule 7) because those fans are already placed. So, we have two possibilities for A: trance or ambient.

6. Since the librarian (from rule 15) is on the left or right of the futuristic house, and we know C is the motorbikemaster (who lives in a ranch-style house), D can't be the librarian. So, E must be the librarian.

7. From rule 13, the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since B is already the snowmobile driver and cannot be the bartender (as it would mean that the mechanic is driving the ambient vehicle, contradicting rule 7), then A must be the trance fan (which means D is the reggae fan from rule 7).

8. Finally, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (rule 7) and the fan of folk is on the far left (A). Since both A and B are already taken, D must be the mechanic who drives the quad-bike.

9. From rule 10, the librarian (E) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we have already placed E, this means that either C or D has a birthday in June. But from rule 2, we know that the reggae fan has a birthday in September, which means D can't have a birthday in June (because D is the reggae fan). So, C has a birthday in June.

10. From rule 11, the person who's birthday is in July (C) is on the left or right of the mechanic (D). Since we have already placed C and D, there's no way to satisfy this rule. This means that our initial assumption about A being a trance fan was incorrect, and A must be the rock fan instead.

11. Now, with A as the rock fan, we know that D is the reggae fan (from rule 2) and E is the librarian (from rule 15). Since B is already the snowmobile driver, only C can drive the motorbike. This means C is the motorbikemaster.

12. With this new arrangement, we can now place the houses: A (rock fan) lives in a palace because of rule 4, B (snowmobile driver) lives in a wooden house as established earlier, C (motorbikemaster) lives in a ranch-style house (rule 12), D (reggae fan) lives in a futuristic house (as it's the only one left), and E (librarian) is on the left or right of the gothic-revival house.

Since we already placed A, B, C, and E, there's no way to satisfy rule 8 (the gothic-revival house is in the middle). This means our initial assumption about A being a trance fan was correct, and A must be the trance fan instead.

With this new arrangement, we can now place the houses: A (trance fan) lives in a gothic-revival house (as it's the only one left for A), B (snowmobile driver) lives in a wooden house as established earlier, C (motorbikemaster) lives in a ranch-style house (rule 12), D (reggae fan) lives in a futuristic house, and E (librarian) is on the left or right of the palace.

Since B, C, and E are already placed, there's no way to satisfy rule 5 (the subway driver lives in a wooden house). This means our initial assumption about A being a rock fan was correct, and A must be the rock fan instead.

Finally, since we have no way to satisfy rules 8, 12, or 14 with this arrangement, it seems there's an inconsistency in the puzzle, as it's impossible to place the people and houses according to the given conditions."	may:3		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_may_10	may	8	" To solve this logic puzzle, we will assign a number from 1 to 5 to each category (transport, music-genre, house, job, birthday month) and then use the given clues to find out which person corresponds to each number.

1. Assign transport: motorbike=1, subway=2, train=3, snowmobile=4, quad-bike=5
2. Assign music-genre: trance=6, rock=7, ambient=8, folk=9, reggae=10
3. Assign house: ranch-style=11, wooden=12, gothic-revival=13, palace=14, futuristic=15
4. Assign job: motorbikemaster=16, mechanic=17, architect=18, bartender=19, librarian=20
5. Assign birthday month: june=21, may=22, september=23, february=24, july=25

Now let's solve the clues:

1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train, so 6 = 3
2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in september, so 10 = 23
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, so 7 = 14
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, so we have a pair (Subway, Snowmobile). Using other clues, we can assign these numbers: Let's say Subway=2 and Snowmobile=4, which implies that 2 > 4
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house, so 2 = 12
6. The architect is the person who's birthday is in may, so 18 = 26 (since we already assigned numbers for other birthdays)
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, so 5 = 17
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so 13 must be between 12 and 14 or 14 and 15 (we don't have a solution yet, but we know it will be an odd number)
9. The person on the far left is the fan of folk, so 9 must be either 1 or 9
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, so 20 can be either 1 or 11 (as we don't have a solution yet)
11. The person who's birthday is in Julys is on the left or right of the mechanic, so 25 must be either 1 or 5 (as we don't have a solution yet)
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, so 16 = 11
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender, so 8 = 19
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, so if 9 = 1, then the person driving the motorbike must be 5 (since we know that folk = 9 and we already assigned numbers for other people)
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, so if 20 = 1, then the futuristic house must be either 3 or 15 (as we don't have a solution yet). However, since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, the futuristic house must be an even number. So let's say the futuristic house = 14

Now we can fill in the missing numbers:
- If the librarian was on the left of the person who's birthday is in june (21), then 20 = 1, but this conflicts with our earlier conclusion that the futuristic house is an even number. Thus, the librarian must be on the right of the person who's birthday is in june, so 20 = 11
- Since we know that 9 (folk) and 5 (motorbike) are adjacent and 5 > 9, the only possibility for the leftmost position (1) is reggae (10). So the person who's birthday is in september must be reggae and 23 = 1
- Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle, it should have an odd number between both sides. The only possibility left is if the gothic-revival house is 13 and the subway driver (wooden house) is 12. So we already know that 2 = 12
- Since the mechanic is driving the quad-bike, he must be 17. Now let's find his birthday month: since he is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in July (25), there are only two possibilities: 17 = 4 or 17 = 5. As we don't have a solution for February yet, let's assume 17 = 5, so 5 = February
- Now let's find the subway driver's birthday month: since the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (4), and the subway driver is the wooden house (12), there are only two possibilities for his birthday month: June or May. Since we already assigned may to the architect, the subway driver must have june as his birthday, so 2 = 6
- The only remaining person without a birthday is the snowmobile driver. Let's assign him January since it's the first month in the year (1)
- Finally, let's find the rest of the job assignments: Since the architect (18) has may as his birthday, we know that he is not the subway driver or motorbikemaster (who both have june as their birthdays). So the architect must be the bartender (19), the librarian (20), or the mechanic (17). Since the librarian and mechanic have already been assigned, the architect must be the quad-bike driver.

The final answer is:
- Transport: motorbike = 5, subway = 2, train = 3, snowmobile = 4, quad-bike = 17
- Music-genre: trance = 6, rock = 7, ambient = 8, folk = 9, reggae = 10
- House: ranch-style = 11, wooden = 12, gothic-revival = 13, palace = 14, futuristic = 14
- Job: motorbikemaster = 16, mechanic = 17, architect = 5, bartender = 19, librarian = 20
- Birthday month: june = 2, may = 11, september = 23, february = 24, july = 25"	may:3	may:11	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_1	september	7	" To solve this puzzle, we can use a combination of deduction and elimination to fill out the grid. Here's my solution:

1. Train driver (trance): We know the train driver likes trance. Since all other transport options have been assigned, the train driver must be person 5.
2. September birthday: We know the fan of reggae has a birthday in September. However, we don't have enough information to determine which person this is yet. Let's mark it as ""September:?"" for now.
3. Palace house (rock): The palace house is a fan of rock. Since all houses have been assigned, the palace must be person 4.
4. Subway placement: We know the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the quad-bike driver and motorbikemaster have already been determined to be next to each other, the subway driver cannot be at position 1 or 2. Also, the train and snowmobile drivers are both assigned, so they can't be at positions 3, 4, or 5 either. The only remaining options are position 6 (leftmost) and position 7 (rightmost). Since we know that the subway driver is not the wooden house (from point 5), it must be in position 6.
5. Subway house: We now know that the subway driver lives in a wooden house. Since all houses have been assigned, the subway driver must be person 1. This means that the snowmobile driver is at position 4 and the person driving the motorbike is at position 7.
6. May birthday (architect): We know the architect has a birthday in May. Since all people except for September have birthdays assigned, the architect must be either person 2 or 3. Since we already determined that the subway driver and snowmobile driver can't be at positions 2, 3, or 5, the only remaining option is position 6. This means that June birthday (librarian) is at position 1.
7. Quad-bike driver (mechanic): We know the quad-bike driver is a mechanic. Since we already determined who drives the subway and motorbike, and since all other transport options have been assigned, the quad-bike driver must be person 3. This means that the train driver is at position 4 (since they can't be at positions 1 or 7) and the snowmobile driver is at position 5.
8. Gothic-revival house (middle): We know the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since all houses have been assigned, it must be person 4 (the train driver).
9. Leftmost position (folk and librarian): We know that both folk and librarian are on the far left or next to them. Since we already determined who the librarian is (June birthday), and since we have already assigned all other people except for September, the only remaining option for the fan of folk is at position 2.
10. Left or right of June: We know the motorbikemaster must be on the left or right of the person with a June birthday (librarian). Since we already determined who the librarian is and that the train driver can't be at position 7 (because they are to the right of the snowmobile driver), the only remaining options for the motorbikemaster are positions 1 or 2. However, since the fan of folk is already assigned to position 2, the motorbikemaster must be in position 1 (ranch-style house).
11. Left or right of mechanic: We know the person with a July birthday is on the left or right of the mechanic (quad-bike driver). Since we already determined who the mechanic is (person 3), and since we have already assigned all other people except for September, the only remaining option for the July birthday person is at position 5.
12. Ambient fan (bartender): We know the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since all jobs have been assigned, the bartender must be person 6 (futuristic house). However, we already determined who lives in a futuristic house (July birthday person), so this contradicts our previous conclusion that July birthday is at position 5. There seems to be a mistake in the puzzle.
13. Folk and motorbike placement: Since we know that the fan of folk is on the far left, and since the motorbikemaster is next to or left of the person with a June birthday (librarian), the only remaining option for the motorbike driver is position 2. This means that the librarian must be at position 1 (ranch-style house).
14. Left or right of folk: Since we know the motorbikemaster is on the left or right of the person with a June birthday, and since we already determined who the motorbikemaster is (position 1), this means that the fan of folk must be at position 3 (gothic-revival house).
15. Left or right of futuristic: Since we know the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, and since we already determined who the librarian is (position 1), this means that the person with a July birthday must be at position 2 (since there's only one remaining option).

At this point, it appears that there may be a mistake in the puzzle as it doesn't seem possible to satisfy all given conditions. For example, assigning the fan of ambient to the bartender contradicts our previous conclusions about where the July birthday person and the gothic-revival house should be placed. I would recommend checking the puzzle for potential errors or inconsistencies.

In terms of the given answer format, we have identified that September is at position 2 (since it's the only remaining option for the fan of reggae). So, ""September:2"". However, as mentioned earlier, there seems to be a mistake in the puzzle itself that prevents us from being certain about this answer."	september:5	september:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_2	september	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step-by-step.

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train. Since there are five different modes of transport, we can assign numbers from 1 to 5 to them (in any order). Let's assume the train is number 3 for now. So, the person driving the train is Person 3.

2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September. We will find out their position later.

3. We know that the fan of rock lives in the palace house (number 4). This helps us to assign numbers to other houses. Let's assume the palace is number 5 for now.

4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we don't know the exact order yet, let's assign them numbers from 1 to 5 (subway first). Let's assume the subway is number 2 and the snowmobile is number 3 for now.

5. The person driving the subway lives in the wooden house (number 1).

6. The architect has a birthday in May, so they are Person 6.

7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. This means the quad-bike is either number 2, 3, or 4 and the mechanic is Person 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the quad-bike is number 4 for now.

8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle (number 3). This helps us to rearrange the house order: Palace, Gothic-Revival, Wooden. So, the houses are assigned as 5-3-1.

9. The fan of folk is on the far left (Person 1), so they must be a trance, rock, or ambient fan. However, we already know their positions. Let's move on to the next clue.

10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since we don't know the exact position of June's person yet, we can't assign the librarian a definite position, but we know they are on an edge (Person 1, 2, 4, or 5).

11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. This means Person 5 (July) is on the same side as the quad-bike (mechanic), which contradicts the information that the librarian (also June's neighbor) should be on the opposite side of July. So, this clue leads us to assume that the July birthday person might not actually be on the left or right of the mechanic.

12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house (number 2). This helps us to rearrange the transport order: Motorbike, Subway, Quad-bike, Train, Snowmobile. So, the transports are assigned as 2-1-4-3-5.

13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (Person 5).

14. Since we have rearranged the positions of the fans of trance and folk, we can now say that the fan of folk is to the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (Person 2). However, this contradicts our previous assumption that Person 1 is the fan of folk. So, it seems there might be a mistake in this puzzle as it currently stands.

15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we don't have enough information to determine their exact position yet, let's move on to the next clue.

From this point, there appears to be a contradiction in the information provided about the positions of the fans of folk and trance, so it seems that the puzzle might contain an error. However, if we assume that the librarian is Person 1 (Wooden house), we can continue solving the puzzle:

- Reggae fan is September (Person 5).
- Snowmobile driver is Person 4.
- Since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, and the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, the futuristic house must be Person 3 (Train), which means the quad-bike driver (Person 7) should be on the opposite side (either Person 2 or 4). This contradicts our assumption that the librarian is Person 1.

So, it seems the puzzle might contain an error. The correct solution can't be determined based on the information provided."	september:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_3	september	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step and assign numbers to each person based on the given clues:

1. The fan of trance is driving the train, so we can assign '5' (since there are 5 modes of transport) to this person.
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, which implies that our 'reggae' person is '2'.
3. The fan of rock is living in the palace house, but since we already assigned numbers to people, we can't place them yet.
4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. If we assign '1' as the subway driver (since there are 5 transport options), then the snowmobile driver must be '3'.
5. The subway driver lives in the wooden house, so '1' also becomes our 'wooden' person.
6. The architect has a birthday in May, which means our 'architect' is '6'.
7. The quad-bike driver (which we know from clue 8 that it's not '3') is the mechanic. Since we already assigned numbers to people, let's assign '4' as the quad-bike driver for now.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it must be between '1' and '3'. Let's place it as '2' (since we already have '1' and '3' assigned). However, this contradicts clue 6 stating that the architect lives in a wooden house. So, let's rearrange our current assignment:
   - gothic-revival house: '4' (mechanic)
   - subway driver & wooden house: '1'
   - architect: '2' (gothic-revival house)
9. The fan of folk is on the far left, which means it should be either '1', '4', or '7'. But since the mechanic (folk fan) is already assigned as '4', let's place '9' as the fan of folk and '3' as the person driving the motorbike.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who has a birthday in June, but we know that our 'june' person (number '7') can't be the librarian yet because there are no available places left for the librarian to the left of '7'. So let's move the librarian temporarily to '6':
   - librarian: '6'
11. The person who has a birthday in July is on the left or right of the mechanic, but we have already placed the mechanic and all other available spots are occupied by people with birthdays from different months. So let's place our 'july' person as '5':
   - fan of ambient (bartender): '5'
12. The motorbikemaster is living in a ranch-style house, which means it should be either '1', '3', or '7'. Since we already have '3' and '7' assigned, let's place the motorbikemaster as '1':
   - motorbikemaster: '1' (ranch-style house)
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender, which was already solved in step 11.
14. The person driving the motorbike has a fan of folk on their left or right, but since we already placed the folk fan as '9', there are no available spots to the left of '9' for another person:
   - this leads us to contradiction with clue 9, so let's move the librarian back to its original position:
     - librarian: '6'
15. The fan of ambient is the bartender, which was already solved in step 11.

Now we have a complete solution with no contradictions:
- subway driver & wooden house: '1'
- architect: '2' (gothic-revival house)
- mechanic (quad-bike driver): '4'
- fan of reggae (birthday in September): '2'
- gothic-revival house: '3' (mechanic)
- fan of folk: '9'
- motorbikemaster: '1' (ranch-style house)
- fan of ambient (bartender): '5'
- librarian: '6'
- fan of trance (driving the train): '5'

Now we can find the location of September by finding our reggae fan, who has a birthday in September:
**September: 2**"	september:5	september:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_4	september	7	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that trance fans are driving the train, so we can assign Transport 5 (Train) to Trance.
2. The person with a birthday in September is a fan of reggae. Let's call this Person A and assign Reggae to their preference (Person A: Reggae). We don't know yet where Person A is placed.
3. The fan of rock is the palace house, so we can assign House 4 (Palace) to Rock.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile driver and is in the wooden house. Since we already assigned Rock to the Palace, the only unassigned Transport and House are Subway and Wooden. So we can assign these to Person B (Subway, Wooden).
5. The architect has a birthday in May. Since we've assigned all the other jobs except Architect, the only unassigned preference is Ambient. So we can assign this to Person C (Architect: Ambient).
6. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. We don't know yet where Mechanic is placed or which Transport they are driving, so let's wait for more clues about them.
7. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so we can assign this to House 3 (Gothic-Revival). Since all other houses have been assigned preferences, it means that the remaining four people must have Folk, MotorbikeMaster, Trance, and Librarian as their preferences.
8. The fan of folk is on the far left. Since we know that Reggae, Ambient, and Rock are already placed, Folk can only be assigned to Person D (Folk). This leaves us with MotorbikeMaster, Trance, and Librarian for Person E, F, and G.
9. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we know that Person D has Folk preference, this means Person E (MotorbikeMaster) must be placed to the left or right of Person D.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since all other houses have been assigned preferences, it means the Futuristic house is assigned to House 5. Since we know that MotorbikeMaster and Librarian are still unassigned, the librarian must be placed to the left or right of Person E (MotorbikeMaster) or Person G (Librarian).
11. The fan of trance is the person driving the motorbike, but we don't know yet where MotorbikeMaster is placed. So we can't determine the position of Trance based on this clue.
12. Since all other jobs have been assigned preferences, it means that the remaining job (Librarian) must be assigned to Person F. This leaves us with Trance for Person G.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender. We know from our previous steps that the Bartender (Person C) has Ambient as their preference.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we know that Person E (MotorbikeMaster) has MotorbikeMaster preference and must be placed to the left or right of Person D (Folk), this means Person G (Trance) must also be placed to the left or right of Person D (Folk).
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we know that the Futuristic house is assigned to House 5 and the Librarian (Person F) has not been placed yet, it means that Person F must be placed to the left or right of Person G (Trance).
16. We have all the information now. To place our people, let's start with placing the Trance fan on the motorbike since we know they are driving it and position them based on the position of Reggae (Person A) and Folk (Person D). Let's say Trance (Person G) is placed to the right of Folk (Person D). This means that Librarian (Person F) must be placed to the left or right of Person G. Since we also know that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, let's place them next to the Futuristic house as well (on its left side for simplicity). This leaves us with only one position for Mechanic (Quad-Bike) and Subway driver. Since MotorbikeMaster must be placed to the left or right of Folk (Person D), we can place them on the same side as Trance (Person G) but before Librarian (Person F). The only remaining spot is next to Subway. So let's place Mechanic (Quad-Bike driver) there, and since Subway must be on the left of Snowmobile, this means that we can position them at the first spot.
17. Now we have all the people placed: Person A (Subway, May), Person B (Wooden House, September), Person C (Ambient, Bartender), Person D (Folk, Left of Motorbike), Person E (MotorbikeMaster, Right of Folk), Person F (Librarian, Left or right of Trance), and Person G (Trance, Right of Folk).
18. To find the position of September, we can see that Person B is the one with a birthday in September and they are placed in the Wooden house. Since all the houses have been assigned jobs, it means that Person B (September) is driving the Subway. So we can say **September:1**.

This is how we found the position of September based on the given logic puzzle."	september:5	september:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_5	september	7	" To solve this logic puzzle, we'll create a table to organize the information and use deductive reasoning. Here is the solved table:

| Transport | Music-genre | Job       | House      | Birthday  | Position     |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Train     | Trance     | ?         | Palace    | September | Left of Snowmobile (4) and Right of Mechanic (11) |
| Subway    | ?          | Motorbikemaster(12)      | Wooden    | May       | Left of Snowmobile (4), and the person driving the snowmobile is not in the middle (Gothic-revival house is in the middle, 8). So subway must be on the far left.|
| Snowmobile| ?          | Mechanic  | ?         | July      | Middle       |
| Quad-bike | ?          | ?         | ?         | February   | Not left or right of June (10) and not the person driving the motorbike (9), so it must be the person driving the snowmobile (7). |
| Motorbike | Folk       | Librarian  | Ranch-style(12) | June     | Left of Librarian (15) or Right of June (10) |

Now, let's analyze the given information:

1. The fan of trance is the person driving the train (1). Since we know that the subway is on the far left and the snowmobile is in the middle, the only remaining option for the train is the second position. So, Train:2
2. Since the fan of rock is the palace house (4), we can deduce that it's not the motorbike, quad-bike or subway since these houses are already assigned to people using those transports. The only remaining transport for the person who lives in the palace is the train. So, Rock:3
3. Since the architect is the person whose birthday is in May (6), we know that the architect can't be the train, motorbike, quad-bike or snowmobile because these jobs have already been assigned to people using those transports. The only remaining transport for the architect is the subway. So, Architect:4
4. Since the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic (7), we can deduce that the mechanic must be in position 3, since the snowmobile is in the middle and the quad-bike isn't on the far left (Quad-bike is on the right of the snowmobile, 11). So, Mechanic:3
5. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (8), we know that it can't be the palace or subway since these houses are already assigned to people living in those transports. The only remaining options for the gothic-revival house are the motorbike, train, and quad-bike, but the quad-bike is already assigned to the mechanic (5). So, Gothic-revival:5
6. Since the fan of folk is on the far left (9), we know that it can't be the motorbike or subway since these people are already assigned positions. The only remaining options for the person who likes Folk music are the train and quad-bike, but the quad-bike is already assigned to the mechanic (5). So, Folk:1
7. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (15), we know that the futuristic house must be in a position where there's at least one person between it and the librarian. The only positions where this can happen are 4, 6, and 8. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (5) and the motorbike isn't on the far right (9), the futuristic house must be in position 4 or 6. However, since the architect lives in the subway (3) and we know that the subway is on the left of the snowmobile, the only remaining option for the futuristic house is position 6. So, Futuristic:6
8. Since the fan of ambient is the bartender (13), we can deduce that the bartender must be in a position where there's at least one person between it and the librarian since the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (15). The only positions where this can happen are 4, 6, and 8. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (5) and the motorbike isn't on the far left (9), the only remaining option for the bartender is position 8. So, Ambient:8
9. Now that we have all the houses assigned, we can find the position of the snowmobile. Since it's to the right of the mechanic (11) and on the far left of the subway (4), the only remaining option for the snowmobile is position 5. So, Snowmobile:5
10. Now that we have all the jobs assigned, we can find the position of the motorbike. Since the motorbike isn't on the far right (9) and is to the left or right of June (10), the only remaining option for the motorbike is position 2 since the train is already assigned. So, Motorbike:2
11. Finally, we can find the position of September. Since September is on the left or right of the mechanic (11) and on the far left of June (10), the only remaining option for September is in position 1. So, September:1.

Congratulations! We have solved the logic puzzle."	september:5	september:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_6	september	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down and solve one piece at a time:

1. From point 1, we know that the trance fan is the person driving the train, but we don't have any information about the train yet. We'll come back to this later.
2. Point 2 tells us that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September. This gives us the first piece of information: **september:1**
3. From point 4, we know that the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we don't have enough information yet to identify these people, we can't place them yet, but remember this for later.
4. In point 5, the person driving the subway is also described as the wooden house. We still don't know who this is yet, so we can't place it either.
5. Points 6 and 7 tell us that the architect is in May and the mechanic drives the quad-bike. We don't have enough information to place these people yet.
6. In point 8, we learn that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we only have 5 houses and we know one of them (wooden) is a subway driver, we can deduce that the gothic-revival house isn't the subway driver or the quad-bike driver (as both are on the left and right of other houses). So, the gothic-revival house must be one of the remaining 3 houses.
7. From point 9, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left. Since we now know that the gothic-revival house isn't on the far left (because it's in the middle), the fan of folk must be one of the other houses. This leaves us with only two possibilities for the gothic-revival house: ranch-style or futuristic.
8. In point 10, we learn that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since we know **september:1**, this means that June cannot be on the far left (as the librarian can't be on the same side as September). So, June must be one of the remaining houses, but it can't be the gothic-revival house (since we now know it's either ranch-style or futuristic) and it also can't be the quad-bike driver (because they are on the left or right of the librarian). So, June must be either the wooden house (subway driver) or the train driver.
9. From point 12, we know that the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. Since June can't be the ranch-style house, it must be the train driver. This means that the quad-bike driver and the librarian are also in their respective places (quad-bike driver on the left of the librarian).
10. In point 13, we learn that the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we now know who the motorbikemaster and the quad-bike driver are, we can deduce that the bartender must be one of the remaining houses. But we also know that the librarian is already in place (on the left or right of June), so the bartender can't be the librarian. This leaves us with only one possibility: the bartender is the futuristic house.
11. From point 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (who we now know is the ranch-style house). Since the librarian and the quad-bike driver are in their places, the only remaining possibility for the fan of folk is on the far right.
12. In point 15, we learn that the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (which we now know is the bartender). Since we already placed the quad-bike driver and the fan of trance (motorbikemaster) on their respective sides, the only remaining possibility for the librarian is on the far left.
13. Finally, from point 4, we know that the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the quad-bike driver and the librarian are in their places (quad-bike driver on the left of the librarian), the only remaining possibility for the subway driver is on the far right.
14. From point 5, we know that the subway driver is also the wooden house. Since we already identified the subway driver as being on the far right, this means that the subway driver (and thus the wooden house) must be **september:5**.

So, **september:5** is the location of September in our arrangement."	september:5	september:5	True	True
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_7	september	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train, so we can assign the transport 'train' to the music genre 'trance'. Let's write them down like this:
    - Trance: Train

2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, but we don't have any information about their transport or house yet, so let's keep it for now:
    - Reggae: September (unknown transport and house)

3. We know the fan of rock lives in the palace, but no other information about them yet. So let's write it down:
    - Rock: Palace (unknown transport, birthday, and job)

4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Let's assume that the subway driver is A and snowmobile driver is B. Since the order matters, we write it down as 'Subway: A (on the left of Snowmobile: B)'.
    - Subway: A (on the left of Snowmobile: B)
    - Snowmobile: B

5. The person driving the subway lives in a wooden house. Since we already assigned the subway to A, this means 'Wooden: A'
    - Wooden: A

6. The architect has a birthday in May, so let's write it down as 'Architect: May'. We don't have any information about their transport or house yet, but we can assume they aren't driving the subway (since it was already assigned to A) or the quad-bike (since it will be assigned to the mechanic later).
    - Architect: May

7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since the quad-bike is not yet assigned, let's assume that 'Quad-bike: Mechanic'.
    - Quad-bike: Mechanic

8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle. We already know that the wooden and palace houses are occupied (Wooden: A, Palace: Rock), so the only remaining options are ranch-style, futuristic, and the unassigned house of September. Since the order matters, we can assume that 'Gothic-revival: Middle' means that it is the third house from left or right, which leaves us with only one option: the unassigned house of September should be the middle house. So let's write it down as 'Gothic-revival: Middle (September)'
    - Gothic-revival: Middle (September)

9. The fan of folk is on the far left, which means they are either the first or second person in line since we already know the first two houses (Wooden: A and Subway: A). Since the order matters and there are only two options, let's say that 'Folk: 1st'
    - Folk: 1st

10. The motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house. We already know that the ranch-style house is unassigned (Gothic-revival: Middle (September)), so let's write it down as 'Motorbikemaster: Ranch-style'.
    - Motorbikemaster: Ranch-style

11. The fan of ambient is the bartender, but we don't have any other information about them yet, so let's write it down as 'Ambient: Bartender (unknown transport, birthday, and house)'
    - Ambient: Bartender

12. The fan of folk is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since we already assigned the folk to 1st (Folk: 1st) and motorbikemaster to ranch-style (Motorbikemaster: Ranch-style), let's write it down as 'Person driving the motorbike: 2nd (on the left of Folk: 1st)'
    - Person driving the motorbike: 2nd (on the left of Folk: 1st)

13. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, but we don't know who it is yet. Since June hasn't been assigned yet, let's write it down as 'Librarian: On the left/right of June (unknown transport and house)'
    - Librarian: On the left/right of June

14. The fan of ambient is the bartender, but we don't have any other information about them yet, so let's write it down as 'Ambient: Bartender (unknown transport, birthday, and house)'
    - Ambient: Bartender

15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, but we don't have any information about who the librarian is yet. We already know that the Wooden, Gothic-revival, and Palace houses are occupied (Wooden: A, Gothic-revival: Middle (September), Palace: Rock). The only remaining options are Ranch-style, Quad-bike, and Futuristic. Since the order matters, we can assume that 'Futuristic: 4th' means that it is the fourth house from left or right, which leaves us with only one option: the unassigned house of June should be on the left of the futuristic house, and the librarian will be on the left or right of June. So let's write it down as 'Futuristic: 4th (on the left/right of June)'
    - Futuristic: 4th (on the left/right of June)

Now we have assigned all the people to their respective jobs, houses, transports, and birthdays. The only remaining unknown is June's birthday, but since it should be on the left of the futuristic house (Futuristic: 4th), we can say that 'June: 3rd or 4th'.

Since there are only five different months, we know that the remaining month should be July. Let's check if July can fit in any available spot:
- If June is the 3rd house, then July can be the 5th (on the left/right of Mechanic), but we don't have a free spot yet.
- If June is the 4th house, then July can be the 1st (on the left/right of Ambient: Bartender). This works since the librarian will be on the left or right of June, and the mechanic is already assigned to the quad-bike. So let's write it down as 'July: 1st (on the left/right of Ambient: Bartender)'
    - July: 1st (on the left/right of Ambient: Bartender)

Now we have solved the puzzle, and here is the final answer:
- Trance: Train
- Reggae: September (Subway, Snowmobile: unknown, House: Middle, Job: unknown)
- Rock: Palace (Transport, Birthday, and Job: unknown)
- Subway: A (on the left of Snowmobile: B, House: Wooden, Birthday: 2nd)
- Snowmobile: B (House: Ranch-style, Birthday: 3rd or 4th)
- Folk: 1st
- Person driving the motorbike: 2nd (on the left of Folk: 1st)
- Ambient: Bartender (Transport, Birthday, and House: unknown)
- Librarian: On the left/right of June (Transport, Birthday, and House: unknown)
- July: 1st (on the left/right of Ambient: Bartender)"	september:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_8	september	7	" To solve this puzzle, we'll use a combination of deduction and elimination. Here's my solution:

1. Assign each person a unique letter A to E, as they are 5 people.
2. Assign each transport a unique letter F to J (since there are 5 different means of transport).
3. Assign each music genre a unique letter K to O, since there are 5 different music genres.
4. Assign each house a unique letter P to V, as there are 5 different houses.
5. Assign each month a unique number from 1 to 5 (since the birthdays are in 5 different months).
6. Since we know the fan of trance drives the train, it must be F (train) driven by person E.
7. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (number 3), so let's assume they are A or B. We'll come back to this later.
8. From point 4, the fan of rock is the palace house (V). Since we don't know their identity yet, move on.
9. Point 5 tells us that the person driving the subway (I) lives in the wooden house (Q), so they must be D or C. The subway is not next to the snowmobile, so I can't be A, B, or E. Since we don't know their identity yet, move on.
10. Point 6 tells us that the architect has a birthday in May (number 2), so they must be D or C. However, since the architect isn't driving a vehicle, they can't be I or F. Since we don't know their identity yet, move on.
11. Point 7 tells us that the mechanic drives the quad-bike (H), so they must be A, B, D, or E. However, since the mechanic isn't driving a vehicle, they can't be F or I. Since we don't know their identity yet, move on.
12. Point 8 tells us that the gothic-revival house (R) is in the middle, so it must be C.
13. From point 9, we know the fan of folk is on the far left, which means they can't be I or J (since the subway and snowmobile aren't the farthest left). They also can't be G or H (since the mechanic isn't on the far left). So, folk must be A. Since we don't know their identity yet, move on.
14. From point 10, since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (number 4), they can't be B or E. They also can't be F (since we already know that F is E). So, let's assume the librarian is A or C.
15. From point 11, since the person who's birthday is in July (number 5) is on the left or right of the mechanic, they can't be F or I (since we know their positions). So, let's assume they are A or D. Since we can't place them yet, move on.
16. From point 13, since the fan of ambient is the bartender, they can't be A (since we know A is the fan of folk and librarian). So, let's assume the bartender is B or E. Since we don't know their identity yet, move on.
17. Since we have no more clues about the motorbikemaster, architect, July birthday person, or bartender, we can only make assumptions for now:
   - Let's assume the motorbikemaster is B (since they aren't the fan of folk, librarian, or mechanic). However, this contradicts point 9 (since the mechanic drives the quad-bike), so the motorbikemaster can't be B.
   - Let's assume the architect is D (since they aren't the fan of folk, librarian, or mechanic). This doesn't cause any contradictions, but we still don't know their identity yet.
   - Let's assume the July birthday person is A or C. However, this contradicts point 14 since the librarian can't be A (since we assumed the July birthday person is A). So, the July birthday person can't be A or C.
   - Since we don't know the bartender's identity yet, move on.
18. Since we've assigned all houses and jobs, let's check our assumptions about music genres and birthdays:
   - We have assigned all 5 music genres to someone, but we can only confirm the assignments for trance (F = E) and reggae (unknown). Let's revisit this later.
   - We haven't assigned all 5 birthdays yet, but we know that the fan of folk is A (September), the architect is D (May), and the July birthday person isn't A or C. So let's assume the remaining birthdays are B, E, and J (since they must be in different months).
19. Since we have assigned all houses, jobs, music genres, and 4 out of 5 birthdays, we can now revisit our assumptions about reggae and July birthday:
   - Since the fan of rock is the palace house (V), it means K = C or V. However, since we already know that C is the gothic-revival house, so K can't be C. Therefore, K must be V (so reggae is C).
   - Now that we know C is the fan of reggae, we also know their birthday is in September (number 3). Since we have assigned all birthdays except for J, it means J = 5 (July).
20. With all assignments completed, here's our final arrangement:
   - Music genres: Trance (E), Reggae (C), Rock (V), Ambient (B or E), Folk (A),
   - Transports: Motorbike (B or E), Subway (I or F), Train (F = E), Snowmobile (D or C), Quad-bike (A)
   - Houses: Ranch-style (B or E), Wooden (I or F), Gothic-revival (C), Palace (V), Futuristic (unknown)
   - Jobs: Motorbikemaster (D or C), Mechanic (A), Architect (D), Bartender (B or E), Librarian (A or C)
   - Birthdays: June (4), May (2), September (3), February (unknown), July (5)

With this final arrangement, the person whose birthday is in September lives in house C (gothic-revival), so **September: 3**."	september:5	september:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_9	september	7	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by making some observations and assumptions based on the given information.

1. We know that each person corresponds to a unique combination of transport, music-genre, house type, job, and birthday month.
2. Let's assume we number the positions from left to right (1 being the far left position). This will help us identify where each person is located.
3. Now let's try to place the people based on the given clues:

   - From clue 9, the fan of folk is on the far left. Since we know that the leftmost position is numbered as 1, the fan of folk must be in position 1 (September).

Now, let's try to fill out the rest of the positions based on clues:

- From clue 7, the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since we know that the mechanic can't be September (because they are the fan of folk), the mechanic must be in a position other than position 1. Since the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house and the librarian must be on their left or right, the mechanic must be between them (on either the left or the right). As there are no other specific clues about the location of the mechanic except that they are not September, we can't determine their exact position for now.
- From clue 14, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we know that the fan of folk (September) is on the far left, the person driving the motorbike must be in a position to the right of September. As there are no other specific clues about the location of the person driving the motorbike except that they are not June or July (clue 10 and 11), we can't determine their exact position for now.
- From clue 12, the motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house. As we know that the motorbikemaster must be to the right of September (because the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike), the ranch-style house must be in a position to the right of September.
- From clue 2, the fan of trance is the person driving the train. Since we know that the mechanic can't be September (because they are the fan of folk), and since the train driver must be to the right of the motorbikemaster (as the motorbikemaster is on the right of September), the train driver must be in a position to the right of the ranch-style house.
- From clue 4, the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we know that the train driver must be to the right of the motorbikemaster, the subway driver must be in a position before the motorbikemaster (on their left).
- From clue 5, the person driving the subway is the wooden house. As we know that the subway driver must be on the left of the motorbikemaster, the wooden house must be in a position to the left of the ranch-style house.
- From clue 6, the architect is the person whose birthday is in May. Since we know that the fan of folk (September) and the motorbikemaster are on the leftmost positions, and since the subway driver must be before the motorbikemaster, the only remaining position for the architect is between the wooden house and the ranch-style house.
- From clue 15, the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we know that the mechanic can't be September (because they are the fan of folk), the only remaining positions for the librarian are to the right of the ranch-style house and to the left or right of the futuristic house.
- From clue 1, the fan of trance is the person driving the train. Since we know that the subway driver must be before the motorbikemaster, the only remaining position for the train driver is between the wooden house (subway) and the ranch-style house (motorbike).
- From clue 13, the fan of ambient is the bartender. Since we know that the mechanic can't be September (because they are the fan of folk), and since the subway driver must be before the motorbikemaster, the only remaining positions for the bartender are to the right of the futuristic house (as the librarian is on their left or right) and between the train driver and the mechanic.
- From clue 10, the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since we know that June can only be between the architect and the futuristic house (as the subway driver must be before the motorbikemaster), the only remaining position for the person whose birthday is in June is between the train driver and the architect.
- From clue 11, the person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we know that the mechanic can't be September (because they are the fan of folk), and since the librarian is on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in June, the only remaining positions for the person whose birthday is in July are to the left or right of the futuristic house.

Now that we have filled all the positions based on clues, let's see if our arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:

1. The fan of trance (train driver) and the fan of folk (September) are in their respective positions.
2. The fan of reggae (person whose birthday is in September) is in position 1.
3. The fan of rock (palace house) is in a position that satisfies the condition.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and they are both in their respective positions.
5. The person driving the subway is the wooden house, which satisfies the condition.
6. The architect is in May, and they are in a position between the wooden house (subway) and the ranch-style house (motorbike), satisfying the condition.
7. The person driving the quad-bike (mechanic) is between the motorbikemaster (ranch-style house) and the librarian, but we can't determine their exact position without more information.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, which satisfies the condition.
9. The fan of ambient (bartender) is on the left or right of the futuristic house, and they are also between the train driver and the mechanic, satisfying the condition.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June, and they are also to the right of the ranch-style house (motorbike), satisfying the condition.
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic, but we can't determine their exact position without more information.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, which satisfies the condition.
13. The fan of ambient (bartender) is on the left or right of the futuristic house, and they are also between the train driver and the mechanic, satisfying the condition.

Our arrangement seems to satisfy all the conditions. However, without more information about the exact positions of the person whose birthday is in July (mechanic's position) and the librarian's exact position, we can't be certain. But if you provide more information, we can refine our answer.

Here's a possible arrangement based on the conditions provided:

1 - Reggae (September birthday)
2 - Subway (Subway driver)
3 - Wooden house (Subway driver)
4 - Architect (May birthday)
5 - Ranch-style house (Motorbike driver)
6 - Train (Trance fan)
7 - Palace (Rock fan)
8 - Gothic-revival house (House type)
9 - Bartender (Ambient fan, between train and mechanic)
10 - Futuristic house (Position of librarian)
? - Mechanic (July birthday, possibly on the left or right of futuristic house)"	september:5		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_september_10	september	7	" To solve this logic puzzle, we need to assign each variable (person/house/job) a unique number from 1 to 5. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. From point 4 and 8, we know that the person driving the subway is not in the middle. So, the subway driver cannot be the gothic-revival house (G), which leaves us with {Ranch-style, Wooden, Palace, Futuristic}. Given that the palace is the fan of rock (R), the subway driver can only be either Ranch or Futuristic. Since the subway driver is also the wooden house (W) from point 5, we have subway driver = W and House2 = R.

2. From points 1, 4, and 10, we know that the fan of trance cannot be on the left of the person driving the motorbike or the librarian. Given this, the fan of trance can only be either house 3 (T) or house 5 (H). Since T is already assigned as the subway driver and H is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (J), we have Trance = H and J = {2,4}.

3. From points 2 and 14, we know that the fan of reggae is the person whose birthday is in September (S). This means S is either house 2 or house 5. Given that S cannot be on the left of the motorbike driver from point 9, S must be H because T is already assigned to J and cannot be the far left.

4. From points 3, 6, and 15, we know that September's birthday person (S) is either the librarian or on the left or right of the futuristic house (F). Since the librarian (L) is already assigned to be on the left or right of F, S must be L. This means S = L.

5. From points 7 and 12, we know that the mechanic (M) is the person driving the quad-bike (Q). Given that Q is also assigned as M in point 7, we have Motorbikemaster = Ranch-style house.

6. Now we are left with assigning jobs to houses {G,T,F} and determining the birthdays for {1,4}. Since T is already assigned as the subway driver, the motorbikemaster can only be G or F. However, since a ranch-style house (M) cannot be in the middle (point 8), we have Motorbikemaster = F and Master is on the left of June (J).

7. Since the fan of ambient (A) is the bartender (B) from point 13, we can assign A as B. Now, the only remaining option for trance (T) is house 1 because T cannot be assigned to the motorbikemaster or librarian (already assigned). This leaves us with T = 1 and Ambient = B.

8. With all the assignments done, we can find out where September (S) is: S = L. To get the position of September in the arrangement, we can represent each house as a number from left to right. Since L is on the left of F, September's position is 2 (the first house from the left). So, we have **september:2**."	september:5	september:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_1	february	9	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Assign each person a letter from A to E based on their respective unique categories (transport, music, house, job, birth month). Since there are 5 people and 5 unique categories, we can easily assign them one-to-one.

2. Use the given clues to deduce relationships between the individuals:
   - From clue 1, we know that A is a fan of trance and drives the train (assuming that train corresponds to transport). Let's place A next to or on the train.
   - From clue 7, we know that E is the mechanic and drives the quad-bike. Since the mechanic is also E, let's place E on/next to the quad-bike.
   - From clue 12, we know that D is the motorbikemaster and lives in the ranch-style house. Let's place D next to or on the ranch-style house.
   - From clue 15, we know that either C or E (librarian or mechanic) is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we already placed E, let's assume C is the librarian and place C next to or on the futuristic house.
   - From clue 5, we know that B lives in the wooden house (subway). Since we've already assigned A, D, C, and E, let's place B on/next to the wooden house.
   - Now we have one more person left (F) whose birthday is in February. We can determine F's position using clues 10, 11, and 14:
     * Clue 10 states that the librarian (C) or someone to their left/right is the person who has a birthday in June. Since we know that D, C, B, E, and F are already placed, let's place F such that either C or F has a June birthday and satisfies clue 10.
     * Clue 11 states that the person born in July (either A, B, C, D, or F) is on the left or right of E (mechanic). Since we've already placed all people but A, let's place A such that their birthday is in July and they satisfy clue 11.
     * Clue 14 states that the fan of folk (F) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (D). Since we know that D and F are still unplaced, let's place them such that either F's birthday is in February or the folk fan is the one driving the motorbike.
   - From clues 4, 8, and 9, we can deduce the positions of B (subway), A (train), D (motorbike), F (birthday in February), and C (librarian):
     * Clue 4 states that the subway driver (B) is to the left of the snowmobile driver. Since E (mechanic) is driving the quad-bike, the only option for the snowmobile driver is A or D. We've already placed A, so let's place D on the motorbike and F to their left.
     * Clue 8 states that the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since we know that C lives in a wooden house (subway), B in a palace house, E in a quad-bike house, and A/D/F are still unplaced, let's place A or D on the train (gothic-revival) to their right and F to their left.
     * Clue 9 states that the fan of folk is on the far left. Since we know that C lives in a wooden house (subway), B in a palace house, E in a quad-bike house, D in a motorbike, and A/F are still unplaced, there's only one position left for F to be the fan of folk - on the far left.
   * Since we know that F is the fan of folk and has a birthday in February, their position satisfies all given clues, so we can place them accordingly:
      - **February:1** (on the far left)

Now we have placed everyone according to the given clues. The final arrangement looks like this:

- Motorbike: D (Folk fan in February)
- Train: A (Trance fan, not confirmed for any specific job yet)
- Subway: B (Palace house, Rock fan, May birthday)
- Snowmobile: A or another unplaced person (not determined yet)
- Quad-bike: E (Mechanic, Reggae fan in September)
- Ranch-style house: D (Motorbikemaster, not confirmed for any specific music genre yet)
- Wooden house (subway): B (Palace house, Rock fan, May birthday)
- Gothic-revival house (train): A or another unplaced person (not determined yet)
- Futuristic house: C (Librarian, not confirmed for any specific music genre yet)
- June: (either A or F)
- July: A (Trance fan, Train driver)"	february:4	february:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_2	february	9	" Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 2, we know the fan of reggae is born in September. We will assign numbers to the months for easier reference: June = 1, May = 2, September = 3, February = 2/12 (since it's the second month but in a different quarter), July = 7.

2. Since the fan of rock is the palace house (point 4), we can place the ""rock"" label on the ""palace"" house.

3. Now, let's start placing the houses based on their orders: The gothic-revival house is in the middle (point 8), so it goes at position 3. Since the ranch-style house is the motorbikemaster (point 12), it must be placed first (position 1) as it cannot be the middle one.

4. We know that the fan of folk is on the far left (point 9), so it goes at position 1, and since we already placed the ranch-style house, the ""folk"" label should go to the ""wooden"" house (since it's the only available house).

5. Now, we know that the mechanic is the one driving the quad-bike (point 7), so it goes at position 5 (as there are 5 transport options, and we already placed the first four). We can place ""mechanic"" on the ""wooden"" house since it's available.

6. The subway driver is to the left of the snowmobile driver (point 4), so they should be in positions 1 and 2, respectively, based on our arrangement. We already placed the first three houses, so the ""subway"" label can go on the ""gothic-revival"" house (position 3). The ""snowmobile"" label goes to the ""futuristic"" house (position 4).

7. The architect is born in May (point 6), so we know that this person must live in one of the remaining houses. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person born in June, and we already placed the subway driver (who is the architect) to the left of someone, the librarian cannot be on the same side as the June-born individual. This means the ""architect"" label can go on either the ""ranch-style"" house or the ""futuristic"" house. If we place it on the ranch-style house, the remaining houses would have two music fans (one folk and one ambient), which contradicts the fact that each house has a unique genre fan. So, the ""architect"" label should go on the ""futuristic"" house (position 4).

8. The librarian is not on the same side as the June-born individual (point 10) and is also not on the same side as the mechanic (point 11), which means the librarian must be in position 2. Since we already assigned all labels, the ""librarian"" label goes to the ""wooden"" house.

9. Now, we know that the fan of ambient is the bartender (point 13), so it should go on one of the remaining houses. We cannot place it in position 4 since it would create a conflict with the ""snowmobile"" driver, who is already there. So, the ""ambient"" label goes to the ""gothic-revival"" house (position 3).

10. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver (point 14), and we already placed the folk fan in position 1. Since the only available position for the motorbike driver now is position 2, the ""folk"" label must be on the left side of the ""motorbike"" label. This means that the remaining house, the ""palace,"" should have the ""folk"" label (position 3).

11. Lastly, the fan of trance is driving the train (point 1), so it goes in position 5. We already placed all labels except for February's person, but since we know their month, we can assign them a position: February:2/12.

Final answer: February:2/12"	february:4	february:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_3	february	9	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign transport (T), music-genre (M), house type (H), job (J), and birthday month (B) to each person as we go along. We will assume that people are ordered from left to right.

2. From point 1, the fan of trance is driving the train (T=train). Let T=5.
3. From point 2, the fan of reggae has a birthday in September (B=September). Let B3=September.
4. From point 4, the subway driver (T4) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (T6). T4<T6. Since we already have T5, T4 must be either 1 or 2. If T4=1, then T6 would have to be 3 or 4, but neither fits with other constraints. So T4=2. Let T4=subway and T2=snowmobile.
5. From point 5, the subway driver lives in the wooden house (H5). H5=wooden.
6. From point 6, the architect has a birthday in May (B2=May). Since we already have B3=September and B2=May, it means that no other person can have a birthday in July or June yet because they are adjacent to the librarian. So let's analyze other constraints with this knowledge.
7. From point 7, the mechanic is driving the quad-bike (T3). Let T3=quad-bike. Since the quad-bike driver is the mechanic, it means that we can now assign jobs to people based on their transport. We know the identities of T1, T2, T4, and T5. The only remaining transport is T3, so T7=mechanic.
8. From point 8, the gothic-revival house (H4) is in the middle. Since we have H5=wooden now, it means that there are three houses left: H1, H2, and H3. The only possibility for H4 being in the middle would be if H1=ranch-style (since T1=motorbike), H2=palace (from point 4), and H3=gothic-revival.
9. From point 9, the fan of folk is on the far left. Since we already have the identities of B3 (September) and T5 (train), it means that there are only four people remaining to be assigned a music genre or a house type or both. Since folk can't be on the right of T1 (motorbike), it means that H1=ranch-style, and the fan of folk must be the first person. Let M1=folk.
10. From point 10, the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June. Since we don't have any identified people with a June birthday yet, it doesn't affect our current analysis. However, it means that the librarian can only be assigned to the remaining people after we have identified someone with a June birthday.
11. From point 11, the person who's birthday is in July (B4) is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since T3=mechanic now, it means that B4 can be assigned to any remaining person except the one next to the librarian (since we don't have a June birthday identified yet).
12. From point 12, the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house (H1). H1=ranch-style. We can now assign M6=rock because the palace (H2) is the fan of rock.
13. From point 13, the bartender is a fan of ambient (M7). Since we know that folk (M1), trance (M5), and rock (M6) are already assigned, it means that M7=ambient must belong to one of the remaining people.
14. From point 14, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we know the identities of T1 and M1 now, it means that the only possible arrangement for the remaining people would be with M7=ambient next to T3 (mechanic) and T6 (snowmobile). However, since we can't have two consecutive same transports (from point 4), it means that T6 must belong to a different person. It also means that the librarian has to be on the right of the mechanic. Let L=librarian.
15. From point 15, the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (H6). Since we already have H1=ranch-style, H2=palace, H3=gothic-revival, and H5=wooden, it means that H6=futuristic. However, it also means that we can't assign the librarian yet because there is no remaining person to be assigned on the left of the futuristic house. Since B4 has to be on the left or right of the mechanic (T3), it also means that we can't assign B4 yet either.
16. We now have all constraints satisfied except for assigning the librarian and the person with a June birthday. Given that there are only 5 people remaining, it means that there must be at least one person having multiple characteristics (e.g., transport, music genre, or house type). The only possible overlap is between T3 (mechanic) and M7 (ambient), since they haven't been assigned anything else. However, given the constraints in points 14 and 15, it means that we can't have both T3 and M7 as the same person.
17. To resolve the contradiction, let's assume that the librarian (L) is on the right of the futuristic house (H6). It means that the only possible arrangement for the remaining people would be with L=bartender, B4=July, M7=ambient, and T6=quad-bike. However, it contradicts point 10 because it places the librarian on the left or right of someone with a June birthday.
18. Let's now assume that the librarian (L) is on the left of the futuristic house (H6). It means that the only possible arrangement for the remaining people would be with L=motorbikemaster, B4=July, M7=ambient, and T6=train. Since the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (H1), it means that we can now assign the remaining people based on our earlier analysis: T1=motorbike, T2=snowmobile, T4=subway, H2=palace, H3=gothic-revival, H5=wooden, and B3=September.
19. We have now assigned all people with their characteristics. The final arrangement is as follows:
   - Transport: motorbike (T1), snowmobile (T2), subway (T4), train (T5), quad-bike (T6)
   - Music Genre: folk (M1), trance (M5), rock (M6), ambient (M7)
   - House Type: ranch-style (H1), palace (H2), gothic-revival (H3), wooden (H5), futuristic (H6)
   - People: motorbikemaster (L=1), bartender (B4=July), librarian (T3=ambient), July birthday (B3=September)

The solution is the final arrangement of people and their characteristics."	february:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_4	february	9	" To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize and analyze the given information step by step:

1. Assign each person a letter from A to E (since we have five people).
2. Identify the transport, music genre, job, house type, and birthday month for each person.

Let's start with points 1-4:

1. The fan of trance is driving the train, so T is on a train.
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September, so R cannot be E (since E was assigned to the person with a birthday in September). Therefore, R = A or B.
3. The fan of rock lives in the palace house, so neither A nor R can live in the palace (as they are fans of trance and reggae, respectively). Thus, C = Palace.
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we know the fan of rock lives in the palace and isn't on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (as the palace can't be on the left), the subway driver must be on the right of the snowmobile. Also, since the subway driver cannot be A or R (from points 1 and 2), the only remaining option for the subway driver is D. Therefore, the person driving the snowmobile is E, and the subway driver is on the right.
5. Now that we know the position of the subway driver, we can also determine the position of the house types: Ranch-style is to the left of the subway (motorbikemaster), Wooden is the subway (as per point 5), and Gothic-revival is in the middle (as per point 7).
6. The fan of folk is on the far left, so that means N = F (Folk).
7. Since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, and we know the positions of Ranch-style, Wooden, Gothic-revival, and Palace houses, there is only one remaining option for the Librarian (L).
8. Now that we know the librarian (L), we can identify the position of the remaining birthday months. Since L is on the left or right of the futuristic house, and we know the positions of Ranch-style, Wooden, Gothic-revival, Palace, and Librarian houses, there are only two possible positions for F (June or July).
9. The fan of ambient is the bartender, so A cannot be B or E since they are fans of trance and reggae, respectively. Also, we know that A isn't in the palace (C) or gothic-revival (G) houses as they are fans of rock and folk, respectively. Therefore, only two remaining options for A: Quad-bike and Mechanic. However, if A was the mechanic, then we wouldn't be able to identify the position of F since the fan of ambient is on the right (L) or left (Quad-bike). Thus, A = Quad-bike.
10. Since A (the fan of ambient) is on the quad-bike and is not the librarian (since the librarian is on the left or right of the person with a birthday in June), we can now deduce that F (June) is on the far right.
11. Now that we know the position of F, we can place M (the motorbikemaster): since M lives in the ranch-style house and is not on the left of J (as per point 10), M must be on the right.
12. The only remaining person E has a birthday in September and prefers reggae, so E = Reggae.

Now that we have identified the position of each person, let's find the birthday months for them:

- Quad-bike (A): Ambient, May (as per point 6)
- Subway (D): Rock, February (since D is on the left or right of E)
- Snowmobile (E): Reggae, September (as given)
- Motorbike (M): Trance, June (as per point 1 and since M is on the right of F)
- Librarian (L): Not specified in the information given.

We have successfully placed four people with their respective birthday months:

Ambient: May, Rock: February, Reggae: September, Trance: June

However, we couldn't find the position of the librarian or their birthday month since it wasn't specified in the information given. So, the answer for the format **february:Num** is not applicable."	february:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_5	february	9	" To solve this puzzle, we will create a system to represent each characteristic for each person. We'll use letters (A-E) for people and numbers (1-5) for transport, genre, house, job, and birthday month respectively.

From the given information, we can make several deductions:

1. Transport:
   - From point 4, we know Subway is to the left of Snowmobile => Subway = A or B; Snowmobile = C or D
   - From points 5 and 7, we know Subway = Train_Fan (1) => Subway = A and Snowmobile = C
   - Since there are only two means of transport left for E (Quad-bike and Motorbike), and E is the mechanic from point 7, Quad-bike = E and Motorbike = B or D
   - We know that there is only one left for person D to drive (Snowmobile or Train) => Person D drives Snowmobile
   - Person A drives Subway

2. Music Genre:
   - From point 1, we know the fan of Trance is the person driving the Train => Trance = 1 (A)
   - From point 3, we know Rock = Palace_House => Rock = 4 (C)
   - We know that Reggae = September (3) and Folk = Left of Motorbike from points 2, 9, 10, and 14 => Folk = A or B. Since there's only one left for person B, Folk = B (June_Birthday)
   - We know Ambient = Bartender from point 13 => Ambient = E
   - Since Trance, Rock, Reggae, and Folk have been assigned, the remaining genre is Ambient => Ambient = 3 (E)

3. House:
   - From points 5 and 7, we know Subway_House = Wooden and Quad-bike_House = Mechanic's house => Wooden = 2 and Futuristic = 5
   - Since only one left for Gothic-revival (3), it must be in the middle => Gothic-revival = 4 (C)
   - We know Ranch_style = Motorbikemaster from point 12 => Ranch_style = B
   - Since Palace_House is Rock, we already found its place => Palace_House = 3 (C)
   - The only remaining house for person D is Left of Person A or Right of Person E => Left of Person A or Right of Person E = 1 (A)

4. Job:
   - From points 6 and 8, we know the Architect is the person with May_Birthday and the Gothic-revival house is in the middle => Architect = C (Palace_House)
   - Since only one left for Librarian (2), it must be either on the left or right of June_Birthday (B) => Librarian = A or D
   - We know Motorbikemaster = Ranch_style from point 12 => Motorbikemaster = B
   - Since only one left for Bartender, it must be Ambient_E => Bartender = E
   - The only remaining job for the person driving the Motorbike is Librarian => Librarian = A

5. Birthday:
   - From points 10 and 11, we know the Librarian (A) is on the left or right of June_Birthday (B), while July_Birthday's person is on the left or right of the mechanic (E) => A can't be on B's left nor E's right. Since only one left for September_Birthday (3), it must be Person A => September_Birthday = A (1)
   - Since we already found June_Birthday (B), May_Birthday (C), and July_Birthday (E), the remaining birthday for Person D is February. So, **February:D**."	february:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_6	february	9	" To solve this puzzle, let's first find out who has which birthday using clues 6, 11, and 10.

11: The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic drives a quad-bike (7), the mechanic cannot be the one with the July birthday as we know the fan of each music genre and job. So, the July birthday must be on the opposite side of the mechanic.

10: The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june. Since the motorbikemaster (12) lives in a ranch-style house, which we know is the motorbikemaster, the June birthday must be either the motorbikemaster or someone to their right (as per 10).

6: The architect is the person who's birthday is in May. Since the rock fan is the palace house (4), and the architect isn't a musician, the architect cannot be the one with the May birthday. However, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house, which means the June birthday cannot be the motorbikemaster. So, the May birthday must belong to someone other than the motorbikemaster.

Now let's find out where each genre fan is using clues 1, 3, 4, and 5.

1: The trance fan drives a train (1). Since we know the mechanic drives a quad-bike (7), the train driver cannot be the mechanic, so the June birthday can't be the mechanic as per 10. Therefore, the May birthday must belong to either the motorbikemaster or the architect (as they are the only ones left). Since we know that the rock fan is the palace house (4), and a house cannot drive a vehicle, the June birthday can't be the motorbikemaster, so the June birthday must be the architect.

3: The reggae fan has a September birthday (2). We also know that the mechanic drives a quad-bike (7) and is on the opposite side of the July birthday (11), so we know the positions of the mechanic and the librarian already (mechanic > librarian).

4: The fan of rock is the palace house (4). Since the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (4) and the train driver can't be the architect (1), this tells us that the row must be as follows: snowmobile, subway, palace, quad-bike, librarian.

5: The fan of folk is on the far left (9). Since we know the positions of the snowmobile, subway, and the palace house, and the mechanic is on the opposite side of the July birthday, this tells us that the row must be as follows: snowmobile > [mechanic] > librarian > subway > [far left], which means the far left person (folk fan) can't be the July birthday.

Now let's find out where each house is using clues 8, 12, and 14.

12: The motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house (12). Since we know the positions of the snowmobile, subway, and the palace house, the ranch-style house must be at position 5 (farthest right as per 10). Since the librarian is on the left or right of the June birthday, which is the architect (6), the ranch-style house (motorbikemaster) can't be the architect. Therefore, the motorbikemaster must be on the far right, and the architect must be one place to the left of the ranch-style house.

14: The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (14). Since we know the positions of all the houses except the gothic-revival house, and we know that the gothic-revival house must be in the middle (8), this tells us that the row must be as follows: [snowmobile], mechanic, librarian, subway, [gothic-revival], quad-bike, bartender, ambient, folk, motorbikemaster.

Now we know the positions of all houses and people except for the gothic-revival house and ambient fan. Since the gothic-revival house must be in the middle (8) and is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, it must be to the left of the motorbikemaster as we have already determined that the motorbikemaster is the far-right house. Therefore, the row is: [snowmobile], mechanic, librarian, subway, gothic-revival, quad-bike, bartender, ambient, folk, motorbikemaster

Finally, we can place the ambient fan using clue 13. Since the fan of ambient is the bartender (13), and we know the positions of all houses except the futuristic house, this tells us that the row must be as follows: [snowmobile], mechanic, librarian, subway, gothic-revival, quad-bike, ambient, folk, motorbikemaster, futuristic.

Now we know the positions of all houses and people except for the futuristic house. Since it must be on the far right (15), the row is finally: [snowmobile], mechanic, librarian, subway, gothic-revival, quad-bike, ambient, folk, motorbikemaster, futuristic

We can now find out where each birthday is. The only position left unassigned is the February birthday. Since we know that the motorbikemaster (June) is at position 5 and the architect (May) is at position 4, this leaves the February birthday for either position 1 or 2. However, since the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (4), the row must be as follows: [subway], snowmobile, palace, quad-bike, librarian, mechanic, ambient, folk, motorbikemaster, futuristic, which means that the February birthday can't be in position 2. Therefore, the February birthday is in position 1.

So, the answer to your question is **february:1**."	february:4	february:1	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_7	february	9	" To solve this puzzle, let's use deductive reasoning to eliminate possibilities and find the corresponding positions for each characteristic.

1. Trance fan is driving the train, so we can link trance (T), train (T).
2. The fan of reggae has a birthday in September (S), but we don't have any connection yet.
3. Rock fan is the palace house (P), and since we know T and P, we can eliminate motorbike, subway, snowmobile, quad-bike as the other houses. So the possible houses for the remaining 4 people are: ranch-style (R), wooden (W), gothic-revival (G), futuristic (F).
4. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and we know T and P, which helps us to eliminate some possibilities for their order. However, without more information, we can't determine the exact arrangement yet.
5. The person driving the subway is also the wooden house (W). Now, since we know W, we can also figure out the position of the person driving the snowmobile, and then deduce the location of other transports based on their given conditions. But it's not enough to find the exact arrangement yet.
6. The architect has a birthday in May (M), which allows us to link M with the possible job choices: librarian (L), motorbikemaster (MM), mechanic (Mec), bartender (B).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic, so we can link quad-bike (Q) with Mec. With that information, we can start connecting other positions to find the arrangement based on their given conditions.
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it must be between W and F, or R and W. Since we already assigned W, if G is in the middle, then F or R cannot be the ranch-style house (R). Therefore, R must be either wooden, gothic-revival, or futuristic. However, since we know W, the only possible option for R is a different one from W and G, which means R can only be F.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (L), but since we don't have any connection to link with L yet, it's not enough to determine their position.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (J), and since we know M and J, we can figure out the location for L based on their given conditions. But it's not enough to find the exact arrangement yet.
11. The person who's birthday is in July (G) is on the left or right of the mechanic (Mec), so we have another condition to work with when finding the arrangement.
12. The motorbikemaster is the ranch-style house, but since we already assigned R as futuristic, it means MM must be one of the remaining houses: W, G, or F.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender, so we can link ambient (A) with B. With that information, we can start connecting other positions to find the arrangement based on their given conditions.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but since we don't have any connection yet, it's not enough to determine their position.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house (F), so we have another condition to work with when finding the arrangement.

After considering all conditions and linking related characteristics, we can find the exact arrangement for each characteristic using a trial-and-error approach based on their given constraints. However, it's quite challenging to solve without any specific hint or additional information regarding the transportation order. I recommend checking if you have missed any connections between the given conditions, as some might help in finding the solution more efficiently."	february:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_8	february	9	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the trance fan drives the train, so we can assign transport (5) to the person who likes trance.
2. The reggae fan has a birthday in September, so we can assign month (4) to the person who likes reggae.
3. The rock fan lives in the palace house, so we can assign house (3) to the person who likes rock.
4. From 4 and 5, we know that subway (1) is next to snowmobile (2). Let's assume the order is 1-2.
5. The subway driver lives in the wooden house, so we can assign house (2) to the person driving the subway.
6. The architect has a birthday in May, so we can assign month (1) to the architect.
7. The quad-bike driver is the mechanic, so we can assign transport (4) to the mechanic and since the mechanic isn't assigned yet, let's assume he is the motorbikemaster (0).
8. The gothic-revival house is in the middle, so it must be house (3), which means the rock fan lives in a gothic-revival house.
9. The person driving the motorbike isn't assigned yet, but we know that the folk fan is on its left. Since the only unassigned positions are 0 and 6 (right of June), let's assume for now that the folk fan is in position 0. This means the fan of folk is the fan of motorbike.
10. The librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, so the librarian can only be in positions 0 (left) or 6 (right). Since the motorbikemaster/folk fan is already in position 0, the librarian must be in position 6.
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic, so it can only be in positions 0, 1, 2 (left) or 4, 5, 6 (right). Since we already know that the librarian is in position 6 and it's not next to the mechanic (who is position 4), July must be in position 5.
12. The motorbikemaster/folk fan is the ranch-style house, so we can assign house (0) to the person who likes motorbikes.
13. The ambient fan is the bartender, so we can assign job (4) to the ambient fan.
14. Since the folk fan (motorbikemaster) is on the left of the unassigned position 1, the fan of folk must be on its right, which means it's in position 2. This also confirms that the fan of folk and motorbike are the same person.
15. The librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house, so it can only be in positions 0, 3, or 4 (left) or 2, 5, 6 (right). Since the librarian is already in position 6 and it's not next to the futuristic house, it can't be on its right. Therefore, the futuristic house must be in position 0.

Now we have all positions assigned:
1. Motorbikemaster/Folk (Trance) - House 0 (Ranch-style)
2. Folk (Motorbike) - House 2 (Wooden)
3. Rock - House 3 (Gothic-revival)
4. Mechanic (Quad-bike) - Transport 4
5. Subway - House 2 (Wooden)
6. Librarian - House 6 (Futuristic)
7. September Birthday (Reggae) - Month 4
8. May Birthday (Architect) - Month 1
9. January, April or November (Unknown Job and House) - Months 0, 3 or 5
10. July Birthday - Month 5

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the specific day of each person's birthday. The only known positions are September (4), May (1), and July (5)."	february:4		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_9	february	9	" To solve this puzzle, we will use the given information to deduce the positions and characteristics of each person. Here's the solution in a step-by-step manner:

1. Identify the transport (T), music-genre (M), house style (H), job (J), and birth month (B) for each person.
2. From points 1, 2, and 3, we know that the fan of trance drives the train (T=train), the fan of reggae has a birthday in September (B=September), and the fan of rock lives in the palace (H=palace).
3. From point 4, since the person driving the subway is on the left of the snowmobile, we assign the subway to any transport option except motorbike, quad-bike, and snowmobile (T2=subway).
4. From point 5, the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house (H2=wooden), which leaves gothic-revival, palace, ranch-style, and futuristic for other houses.
5. From points 6, 7, and 12, the architect has a birthday in May (B3=May), the mechanic drives the quad-bike (T4=quad-bike), and the ranch-style house is the motorbikemaster's home (H5=ranch-style).
6. From points 8, 9, and 14, the gothic-revival house is in the middle (position 3) (H1=gothic-revival), the fan of folk is on the far left (position 1 or 5) (M3=folk), and the person driving the motorbike is to the left or right of the fan of folk.
7. From point 10, the librarian is either on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (B4=June). Since the mechanic has already been placed on the left or right side, and we know that the motorbike driver and fan of folk are also there, it means the librarian cannot be on the other available position. Thus, the librarian must be on the left side (position 2), as the only empty spot on the right is where June's person resides.
8. From point 13, the fan of ambient is the bartender (M5=ambient). Since we know that the motorbike driver and fan of folk are on either side of the librarian, and the librarian is on position 2, it means that M5 must be on positions 1 or 3. However, since M5 cannot be to the left of L (the librarian), it must be in position 3 (H4=futuristic).
9. From point 11, the person who's birthday is in July (B6) is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we already know that the mechanic is on the left side and no empty spots are available to place B6 on the left, it must be placed on the right (position 4).
10. Finally, with all positions filled, we can now find the birth months for each person: june (B1), may (B3), september (B2), february (B5), and july (B4). In the requested format, February is in position 5 (february:5)."	february:4	february:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_february_10	february	9	" To solve this puzzle, we'll first group the facts by their corresponding person based on the given information. Let's assign a number to each person:

1. Trance fan (T): has a birthday in May (M5), works as an architect (A).
2. Rock fan (R): lives in a palace (P), has a birthday in February (F2).
3. Ambient fan (Amb): is the bartender (B), is on the left of F6 or M5.
4. Reggae fan (Reg): has a birthday in September (S9), we don't know any other properties yet.
5. Folk fan (Folk): lives on the far left (L1), is on the left or right of T, is on the left or right of M.
6. Librarian (Lib): is on the left or right of F (M5) and Ranch-style house (Ran).
7. Motorbikemaster (MM): lives in a Ran-style house (Ran), we don't know any other properties yet.
8. Quad-bike driver (Qd): is the mechanic (Mec).
9. Subway driver (Sd): is on the left of Sg, lives in a wooden house (Wh).
10. Snowmobile driver (Sm): we don't know any other properties yet.
11. Gothic-revival house (Gr) is in the middle (Mid).
12. Futuristic house (Fut): we don't know any other properties yet.

From the given facts, we can see that T, Reg, Folk, Lib, Mec, and Sm are unknown for now. However, since S9 is Reg, we can identify Reg with person 4 (Reg:4). Now let's try to find more connections between the properties:

- Since Gr is in the middle, it can only be P or F2, but P has already been assigned to R. So Gr must be F2 (Gr:2).
- With Gr identified as F2, we know that Wh and Ran cannot coexist since they are different houses. Thus, Wh must be Sd (Wh:9). Also, since Wh:9 is on the left of Sm, Sm can only be Qd or Mec, but Mec has already been assigned to Qd. So Sm = Mec (Sm:3).
- Now we know that Lib is on the left or right of M5 and Ran. Since Lib is not Reg or Folk, it cannot be on either side of Reg, leaving only one possible spot for Lib, which is on the right of M5 (Lib:5R). This means that M5 must be the Ranch-style house (M5:1), as previously stated in point 12.
- With Lib's location known, we now know that T and Folk are on the left or right of M5, but not next to each other since Folk is on the far left. So Folk must be on the opposite side of M5 from Amb (Folk:5L). This also means that T can only be Amb, A, Mec, Sd, Sm, or MM. But we already know T cannot be Mec, Sm, or Reg due to their assigned properties. Since T cannot be Folk (as it's on the opposite side), T must be A. Thus, T:1.
- Now that T has been found, Ambient must be B since they are next to each other. So Amb:2.
- Since MM lives in a Ran house and is not Reg or Folk, it can only be T (MM:1), as previously stated in point 12.
- Now we have all the assigned properties: Trance fan, Rock fan, Ambient fan, Reggae fan, Librarian, Motorbikemaster, Mechanic, Subway driver, Snowmobile driver, Bartender, Gothic-revival house, Ranch-style house, Wooden house.
- The only remaining person is Folk (Folk:5L).

So we've found the location of all persons and houses, but to answer your question in the format you requested, February's location is: **february:2** (Gr:2) since F2 lives in the Gothic-revival house."	february:4	february:2	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_1	july	5	" To solve this logic puzzle, we will follow the given clues and organize the people based on their traits.

1. From clue 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, so September is fixed.
2. From clue 4, we know that the person driving the subway (who's house type isn't determined yet) is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
3. From clue 5, we know that the person driving the subway lives in a wooden house, so the Subway Driver = Wooden House.
4. Now, since the Gothic-revival house is in the middle (clue 8), and the Subway Driver is to its left, the Snowmobile Driver must be to the right of the Gothic-revival house. Also, the Motorbike Driver is on the left of the Snowmobile Driver (clue 4).
5. From clue 7, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic. Since the Mechanic must be somewhere other than the Subway Driver and Snowmobile Driver (due to clue 4), the Quad-Bike Driver = Mechanic.
6. Now we have the Subway Driver (Wooden House) -> Snowmobile Driver (to its right, Ranch-style or Futuristic house) -> Motorbike Driver (left of Snowmobile Driver) -> Quad-Bike Driver (Mechanic). We still need to find the other two houses.
7. From clue 12, we know that the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house, which means that the Ranch-style house is occupied by the Motorbike Driver (since the Subway and Snowmobile drivers are fixed).
8. Now, since the Gothic-revival house is in the middle (clue 8), the only remaining house must be Futuristic. So the Futuristic house = Librarian.
9. From clue 14, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the Motorbike Driver. Since all other people are fixed, and the Motorbike Driver occupies the Ranch-style house (clue 12), the Folk Fan must be in either September (reggae) or July (which we haven't found yet).
10. From clue 15, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the Futuristic house (July). Since the only other available months are June and February, July must be in between those two months.

So, **july:3** (between June and February)"	july:2	july:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_2	july	5	" To solve this puzzle, let's start by finding relationships between variables and trying to establish some patterns.

1. We know that trance fans use trains, so we can associate Trance with Train (T1). Let's assume T1 is in position X.
2. Similarly, since the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, we can assign Reggae to September (R3) and place R3 among the houses.
3. The person who drives the subway (S) is on the left of the snowmobile driver (SM), so S must be placed before SM. Also, S lives in a wooden house (W). Since we know W isn't in position Gothic-revival (Gr), it must be one of Ranch-style (R), Quad-bike (Q), or Futuristic (F). Given that the librarian is on the left or right of June (J6), and considering that we don't yet have a position for W, we can't place W as S. So, let's assume W = S for now and find other positions later.
4. Since Rock is the palace (P), and we already placed S before SM, P must be after SM.
5. The person driving the snowmobile (SM) isn't in September (since Reggae is in that position). So, SM can't be in February (since the fan of Folk is in that position). Thus, SM can only be in January, October, November, or December. We don't have enough information to determine the exact position of SM yet.
6. The person driving the quad-bike (Q) is the mechanic (Mec). Since we know Mec isn't in September and the fan of Folk isn't on the left, Q can only be in January, October, November, or December as well. We don't have enough information to determine the exact position of Q yet.
7. The gothic-revival house (Gr) is in the middle, so Gr must be placed after P and before SM if they are not in the same position.
8. The fan of Folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver (Mot), which isn't yet placed. So we can't determine the exact position of Folk yet. However, since the librarian is on the left or right of June (J6) and we don't have enough information to place Librarian yet, we know that Folk can't be in January, October, November, or December (since those positions are taken by S and Q). Thus, Folk must be in February, March, April, May, June, or July. Since we placed the architect (Arch) as the person with a birthday in May (6), there is no way for both to be on the same side of Mot since the librarian must be on the left or right of Arch, and we can't place Librarian yet due to the unknown position of Folk. Therefore, Folk cannot be in June (since J6 is known).
9. Ambient fans are bartenders (B), so B can only be in January, October, November, or December if S and Q aren't there. If we place B as a neighbor to Mot, it won't be possible for the librarian to be on the left or right of June since Librarian must also be placed next to Mot. Thus, B can't be in January, October, November, or December either. Therefore, B must be in February, March, April, May, or July, and it cannot be in June due to the same reason as Folk.
10. The motorbikemaster (Mot) is the ranch-style house (R), so R must be placed after SM if they aren't in the same position. Since we don't know the exact position of Mot yet, it's impossible to determine the exact position of R either.
11. Given that the fan of ambient is the bartender and they can't be in June, July, or any other known positions, B must be in May (6). Since Librarian must be on the left or right of June (J6) and we already placed B next to Mot, it means that Librarian can't be on the same side as J6. Therefore, Librarian must be on the opposite side of J6, meaning Librarian is in either January, October, November, or December.
12. We know that the librarian (Lib) lives in one of the unknown houses: Q, S, SM, Mot, R, F, Gr, or P. Since we already placed Lib next to J6, it can't be in October, November, or December because those positions are occupied by S and Q. So, Lib is either in January, February, May (J6), or June (J6).
13. Since the mechanic (Mec) drives the quad-bike (Q), we already placed Mec next to Lib, making Lib and Mec neighbors. Given that there are only five different means of transport, Q must be one of the remaining houses: S, SM, Mot, R, or F. However, since we already placed Q as a neighbor to Lib and the librarian can't live in December, Q can't be in December (since P is in that position). Thus, Q can only be in January, February, May (J6), or June (J6).
14. We know that there are only five different music-genres, so the fan of Folk must be one of the remaining people: S, SM, Mot, R, or Gr. Since we already placed Folk next to Mot and the librarian can't live in December, Folk can't be in December (since P is in that position). Thus, Folk can only be in January, February, May (J6), or June (J6).
15. Now we know that Mec drives Q and lives next to Lib, so Mec can only live in one of the remaining positions: S, SM, Mot, R, or Gr. If Mec is in S, it would mean that the fan of Folk is also in S (since the librarian can't live in December). But we already placed Folk next to Mot, which contradicts our current assumption. So, Mec can't be in S. Similarly, if Mec were SM, it would mean that the fan of Folk is also in SM, but since we know that the person driving the subway (S) lives in a wooden house (W), it means that W cannot be in September, February, or July (since Reggae, Folk, and Mec's positions are known). However, there are only three remaining months: January, October, and November. Since we already placed S before SM, SM can't live in those positions either. Thus, neither Mec nor Folk can be in S or SM.
16. Now let's consider if Mec is in Mot, which would mean that the fan of Folk lives in SM (since the librarian must live next to J6 and the only remaining position for them is on the opposite side of J6). In this case, it means that Reggae can't be in February since the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, which contradicts our assumption. Thus, Mec can't be in Mot either.
17. Now let's consider if Mec is in R, which would mean that the fan of Folk lives in SM (since the librarian must live next to J6 and the only remaining position for them is on the opposite side of J6). In this case, it means that Reggae can't be in July since the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, which contradicts our assumption. Thus, Mec can't be in R either.
18. Now let's consider if Mec is in F, which would mean that the fan of Folk lives in SM (since the librarian must live next to J6 and the only remaining position for them is on the opposite side of J6). In this case, it means that Reggae can't be in October since the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, which contradicts our assumption. Thus, Mec can't be in F either.
19. Since Mec cannot live in S, SM, Mot, R, or F, the only remaining position for Mec is Gr (since there are only five different means of transport). In this case, the fan of Folk lives in SM, which means that Reggae can't be in February or July since the fans of reggae and folk have birthdays in September. This leaves only one option: Reggae can live in October.
20. Now we know that Mec lives in Gr, Folk lives in SM, Reggae lives in October, B lives in May (J6), and Lib lives next to J6 on the opposite side. Since there are only five different music-genres, it means that Ambient must live in the remaining position: February or July. If Ambient were in February, it would mean that Mot lives in October (since B cannot live in June due to being a neighbor of the librarian), which contradicts our assumption that Reggae lives in October. Thus, Ambient can't be in February. Therefore, Ambient must be in July, and Mot lives in October as previously assumed.
21. Since we know the positions for all seven people and their means of transport, we can now assign them to their corresponding houses: Reggae (subway - S), Folk (truck - SM), Ambient (car - Gr), B (scooter - Mot), Librarian (bicycle - F), Mec (motorcycle - R), and Mot (airplane - Oct).
22. In conclusion, the solution for this problem is as follows: The seven people with their corresponding houses and means of transport are as follows:
- Reggae in the Subway (S)
- Folk in the Truck (SM)
- Ambient in the Car (Gr)
- B in the Scooter (Mot)
- Librarian in the Bicycle (F)
- Mec in the Motorcycle (R)
- Mot in the Airplane (Oct)"	july:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_3	july	5	" To solve this logic puzzle, we can assign a number to each person and object, starting from 1. Let's follow these steps:

1. From rule 12, the motorbikemaster (M) is the ranch-style house, so M=1.
2. From rule 4, the subway driver (S) is to the left of the snowmobile driver (Sn), so we can assume S<Sn (since numbers increase from left to right).
3. From rule 5, the subway driver lives in a wooden house (Wh), so Wh=S.
4. Since the architect (A) has a birthday in May and is not the subway driver (from rules 6 and 5), A>S.
5. From rule 14, the fan of folk (Fo) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (M), so Fo can't be the first person from the left (9, since Fo is on the far left from rule 9). So, assuming the order is M<Fo, we have our first two positions: M and Fo.
6. From rule 7, the quad-bike driver (Qd) is the mechanic (Me), so Me=Qd. We already know that Me>S since the subway driver is to the left of the quad-bike driver. So, our list now looks like: M<Fo<S<Me
7. From rule 15, the librarian (Li) is on the left or right of the futuristic house (Fu). Since we don't know the position of Fu yet, let's assume Li>Fo for now. So our list looks like: M<Fo<S<Me<Li
8. From rule 13, the fan of ambient (Amb) is the bartender (Ba), so Amb=Ba and Ba is not the first person from the left (since Amb isn't on the far left). So our list now looks like: M<Fo<S<Me<Li<Amb
9. From rule 10, the librarian (Li) is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (Ju). Since Li>Fo and Li>Amb (from previous steps), Ju must be between M and Fo, and our list now looks like: M<Fo<S<Me<Li<Amb<Ju
10. From rule 11, the person who's birthday is in July (Gu) is on the left or right of the mechanic (Me). Since Gu>Ju (from previous steps), we can now place Gu after Me, and our list looks like: M<Fo<S<Me<Li<Amb<Ju<Gu
11. From rule 3, the fan of rock is the palace house (Pa), so Pa=4. Since there are only 5 people left, we can deduce that Pa=4 and our list looks like: M<Fo<S<3<Li<Amb<Ju<Gu
12. From rule 14, the fan of folk (Fo) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (M). Since Fo>3 (Pa=4), we can place Fo after M, and our list looks like: M<Fo<S<3
13. From rule 9, the fan of folk (Fo) is on the far left. So our final arrangement is: M, Fo, S, 3, Li, Amb, Ju, Gu
14. Now we can assign the remaining objects and people to their houses. Since the gothic-revival house (Gr) is in the middle, Gr=4. But we already know that Pa=4, so Gr can't be the palace. So Gr must be the wooden house (Wh), and Wh=Gr=4.
15. The quad-bike driver (Qd) is the mechanic (Me), and Me=5. Since we already know that Me<S, Qd must be before S, so our list becomes: M, Fo, Qd, S, Li, Amb, Ju, Gu. But we know that Wh=4 and S=2, so the house numbers become: Ranch-style (1), Wooden (4), Quad-bike house (5), Subway house (2), Futuristic (3), Trance (6), Reggae (7), July (8). So **july:8**."	july:2	july:8	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_4	july	5	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. From point 2, we know that the fan of reggae has a birthday in September, so September cannot be July. So, July is not among the houses (since people have house types based on their birthdays).

2. Now let's assign jobs to the houses based on the given information:
   - From point 12, the motorbikemaster lives in the ranch-style house. We don't have any other information about this job, so let's assign it for now.
   - From point 8, the gothic-revival house is in the middle. Since there are five houses and the motorbikemaster already occupies one, the remaining four positions can only arrange in three unique ways (1234, 1324, or 1342). For now, we'll assume the arrangement is 1234.
   - From point 15, the librarian lives to the left or right of the futuristic house. Since we don't have any other information about the librarian yet, let's assign a job for now and then adjust it later if needed. So, let's say the librarian is on the far right (house 5) for this assumption.
   - From point 14, the fan of folk lives to the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we know that the motorbikemaster already occupies house 1 and the folk fan can't be in house 5 (librarian), the only remaining options are houses 2, 3, and 4.
   - From point 6, the architect has a birthday in May, so we know that the architect can't live in house 2 (since it's either occupied by the fan of folk or mechanic). Now, since the motorbikemaster is on the left, the librarian is on the right, and the only remaining houses for the architect are 1, 3, and 4. However, the arrangement we assumed places the librarian in house 5, so it contradicts our assumption that the architect can live in house 2 or 3. Thus, let's adjust our initial assumption to have the gothic-revival house at an arbitrary position (e.g., house 4).
   - Now we know that the librarian must be in house 5, and the remaining houses are: motorbikemaster (1), folk fan (2 or 3), architect (3), and gothic-revival (4). We don't have any other information about these jobs at this point.

3. Next, let's assign music genres based on the given information:
   - From points 1, 4, and 5, we know that the train driver is a trance fan, the subway driver is in house 2 (since it's to the left of the snowmobile), and the wooden house is the subway. So, the person driving the subway must be a fan of trance since the music preference doesn't change depending on the position of the houses.
   - From points 7 and 11, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike and lives next to the person who has a birthday in July. Since the quad-bike driver can't be the motorbikemaster (since they are separate jobs), the mechanic must drive the quad-bike.
   - From points 13 and 14, we know that the bartender is an ambient fan, and the fan of folk lives to the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we don't have any information about the bartender yet, let's assign a music genre for now and then adjust it later if needed. So, let's say the bartender is a folk fan (living in house 2) for this assumption.
   - From points 3 and 10, we know that the rock fan lives in the palace house, and the librarian or motorbikemaster (if they are not the librarian) is on the left or right of the person who has a birthday in June. Since we don't have any information about the rock fan yet, let's assign a music genre for now and then adjust it later if needed. So, let's say the rock fan lives in house 1 (motorbikemaster) for this assumption.
   - From point 9, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the far left, so they must be either the librarian or the person who has a birthday in June (if the librarian is not the person with a birthday in June). Since the fan of rock lives in house 1, and the librarian can't live in house 1, the only remaining option is that the person driving the motorbike has a birthday in June.
   - Now we know that the person driving the motorbike has a birthday in June (June:1), the fan of rock lives in house 1, the fan of folk lives in house 2, and the bartender is an ambient fan. We don't have any other information about these music genres at this point.

4. Finally, let's find out where July is:
   - From points 7 and 11, we know that the mechanic drives the quad-bike and lives next to the person who has a birthday in July. Since the motorbikemaster has a birthday in June and the fan of rock also lives in house 1, the only remaining options for the mechanic's position are houses 2 or 3 (since houses 4 and 5 are occupied by the gothic-revival and librarian, respectively).
   - From point 10, we know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who has a birthday in June. Since the motorbikemaster has a birthday in June and the librarian lives in house 5 (as determined earlier), the only remaining option for the librarian's position is house 4.
   - Now, since the mechanic drives the quad-bike and lives next to the person who has a birthday in July, the quad-bike must be driven by the person living in either house 1 or 3 (since houses 2, 4, and 5 are occupied). Since the motorbikemaster already occupies house 1, and the librarian lives on the left of June, the only remaining option is that the quad-bike driver has a birthday in July.
   - From point 6, we know that the architect has a birthday in May, so we know that May cannot be July (since it already has an assigned position). Thus, July must be the birthday of the person driving the quad-bike.

So, **July:3**."	july:2	july:3	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_5	july	5	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's start by finding connections between variables:

1. We know that the trance fan drives the train, but we don't have a direct link to any other variable. So, for now, we mark down that ""Trance"" corresponds to the train driver (T).
2. The reggae fan is in September (S). We also don't have any direct links with this information yet.
3. Rock corresponds to the palace house (P), but we can't link it with another variable at this point.
4. Subway (U) is on the left of Snowmobile (W), but we don't know who drives either vehicle yet.
5. Subway is the wooden house (H1). We don't have any direct links for H1 yet.
6. The architect has a birthday in May (M). This provides us with our first connection, as M corresponds to the person with the job of an architect (A).
7. Quad-bike (Q) is driven by the mechanic (Mec). We don't have any direct links for the mechanic yet.
8. The gothic-revival house (H3) is in the middle. This helps us identify H3 later on when we fill other positions.
9. The fan of folk is on the far left (FL). We know this person now, but we don't have any direct links for them yet.
10. The librarian (Lib) is either on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June (J). Let's wait until we find J to decide if Lib is on the left (L_Lib) or right (R_Lib).
11. July (Jl) is on the left or right of the mechanic, so we can't place Jl yet.
12. The motorbikemaster (MM) corresponds to the ranch-style house (H2), but we don't have any direct links for H2 yet.
13. The fan of ambient is the bartender (B). We don't have any direct links for B yet.
14. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but we can't place FL yet.
15. The librarian is either on the left or right of the futuristic house (H5). We know this already, but we can't decide if it's L_Lib or R_Lib yet.

Now let's analyze the position information:
4. Since U is to the left of W and H1 corresponds to U, there should be at least one person between U and W. Let's place W on the far right for now.
6. As A has a birthday in May (M), we can fill the positions as follows: M - L_Lib or R_Lib - J (if it exists) - FL - B - T - Q - W
13. Since B corresponds to ambient and B is on the left or right of T, there must be at least one person between B and T. Let's place B on the far left for now. So, our updated position information becomes: M - L_Lib or R_Lib - J (if it exists) - FL - B - T - Q - W
15. As H5 corresponds to the futuristic house, we can fill the positions as follows: P - H3 - H2 (MM) - H1 (U) - H4 (W if we decide to place W on the far right) - H5

At this point, we have enough information to solve the puzzle. Let's try to find out who has a birthday in June:
10 states that Lib is either on the left or right of J. Since we already know B (ambient fan), T (trance fan), and W (subway driver) are on the left, there should be at least one person between FL and B if L_Lib exists. If R_Lib exists, it should be placed after W. Therefore, either L_Lib or R_Lib must be placed before M (architect). As a result, the only remaining position for J is between M and A.

Now we know where J is located: June is between May (M) and the Architect (A), so June's position is J:2

Here's our final answer in the format you requested: July: Not Possible to Determine with Given Information"	july:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_6	july	5	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign each person a variable (e.g., A for the first person, B for the second, etc.).
2. Based on points 1-3, we know that Trance = Train, Reggae = September, and Rock = Palace. We can assign these to our variables based on their respective characteristics (e.g., Person A drives Train, Person D's birthday is in September, Person E lives in Palace).
3. From points 4-6, we know the relative positions of the subway, snowmobile, mechanic, and May's person. We can also assign these based on their respective characteristics (e.g., If A drives Subway, then B drives Snowmobile; A is to the left of B, so C is the mechanic).
4. From points 7-10, we can continue filling in the characteristics of each person, keeping track of who's where and what they do (e.g., If C is the mechanic, then G must be the quad-bike driver because the mechanic drives the quad-bike).
5. From points 11-13, we can further narrow down the possibilities for some variables (e.g., Since H's birthday is in July and the librarian is on the left or right of H, the librarian cannot be I, so L must be the librarian).
6. From points 14-15, we can make additional deductions about the positions of some people (e.g., Since K is the fan of folk and is on the left or right of A, who drives the motorbike, K cannot be I because I is already assigned to the librarian).
7. Now, we have enough information to assign all variables. However, since there are still multiple possible solutions due to the ambiguity in points 10, 11, 14, and 15 about who's on the left or right of whom, I will provide the solution with the minimal assumptions:

A (Trance, MotorbikeMaster, Ranch-style House) -> Librarian
B (Subway, Wooden House)
C (Reggae, Mechanic, Quad-bike)
D (Rock, September Birthday, Palace)
E (Ambient, Bartender, Gothic-revival House)
F (Folk, Left of A or motorbike, Snowmobile) -> I if on the left, J if on the right. We cannot determine this yet.
G (February Birthday, Architect, Train)
H (July Birthday, Futuristic House)
I (Librarian or Folk, Right of A or motorbike, Subway or Snowmobile) -> Assuming I is Librarian, I becomes the librarian, and F is on the right of A. So F must be the snowmobile driver. However, if we assume that I is the fan of folk, then F becomes the folk fan, but we cannot determine their position yet.
J (Left of I or motorbike, Left or right of H) -> Assuming J is on the left of I and motorbike, J must be the bartender since B is already taken. If J is on the right of I or motorbike, then we cannot determine their identity yet due to the ambiguity in point 10.
K (Left or right of A, September Birthday) -> Assuming K is on the left of A (since both F and I are assigned), K must be the fan of reggae. If K is on the right of A, then we cannot determine their identity yet due to the ambiguity in point 14.

The final solution without any assumptions is:
A (Trance, MotorbikeMaster, Ranch-style House) -> Librarian or Folk
B (Subway, Wooden House)
C (Reggae, Mechanic, Quad-bike)
D (Rock, September Birthday, Palace)
E (Ambient, Bartender, Gothic-revival House)
F (Folk, Left of A or motorbike, Snowmobile)
G (February Birthday, Architect, Train)
H (July Birthday, Futuristic House)
I (Librarian or Folk, Right of A or motorbike, Subway or Snowmobile)
J (Left of I or motorbike, Left or right of H)"	july:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_7	july	5	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down and find correlations between different variables. We will represent each variable with a letter for easier tracking:

1. Transport: T(train), S(subway), M(motorbike), Q(quad-bike), SM(snowmobile)
2. Music Genre: R(rock), F(folk), A(ambient), T(trance), Rg(reggae)
3. House Style: R(ranch-style), W(wooden), G(gothic-revival), P(palace), F(futuristic)
4. Occupation: Mm(motorbikemaster), M(mechanic), A(architect), B(bartender), L(librarian)
5. Birthday Month: J(june), M(may), S(september), F(february), Jg(july)

First, we can find the fans of reggae, folk and trance, which are associated with specific people (S, F, T). We know that S is in September. Since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (M), the person with the motorbike must be to the left of September (J or M). With the information from point 15, we can deduce that the librarian cannot be J since they are not on the left or right of the futuristic house. Therefore, the person with the motorbike is M. Since the fan of folk is on the far left, the fan of reggae and the person with the birthday in September must be on the same side as M (right-side).

Now we know that:
M: right-side -> T: not possible (as it's the fan of trance), so R or F. But since there are no other options for the reggae fan, T cannot be possible either, which means F is the person with the train.

We can also find that J and Jg are not related to each other as they are on different sides (left or right of someone else). We know J is M, so Jg must be on the opposite side of M.

With point 15, we can deduce that L cannot be F since it's not related to P. Therefore, L must be Jg, which implies J is A (architect) and must be in May as stated in point 6.

From points 4 and 5, the subway driver is W. Since W is not possible for any other transport, the only option left for W is the snowmobile (SM). This means that S (subway) is on the left of SM. We can find that there are only two options: R or G, but since there are no other possibilities for R, G must be the gothic-revival house in the middle.

From points 10 and 12, we know that B (bartender) cannot be J as they are on opposite sides of J, so it must be F or M. But since there are no other possibilities for F, B must be M. We can find that A (architect) is in May, so L (librarian) must be the person with the birthday in june and is either on the left or right side of J. Since Jg (July) is already placed on the opposite side of M, L (june) must be on the same side as M, which means B (bartender) cannot be on the other side. Therefore, B (bartender) must be on the left-side of M.

Now we can find that T is not possible for any other genre, so it must be A (ambient). With point 13, we know that A (ambient) is the bartender (B). Since we already placed B on the left side of M, T (trance) must be in J.

Finally, since Q cannot be any other job as it's assigned to the mechanic (M), we can find that R (rock) must be P (palace) and Jg (July) must be on the right side of M (since it's on the opposite side of L).

In conclusion, the order of houses from left to right is: R - M - B - T - P - G - L - W - F - S - SM - Jg.

And the answer is **july:5** as July (Jg) is in the 5th position in the given order."	july:2	july:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_8	july	5	" To solve this puzzle, we'll use deductive reasoning to find out the position of each person based on the given clues. Here's how I'd approach it:

1. We know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train. Since there are only five modes of transport, let's assign them numbers from 1 to 5 (let's say train = 3).

2. The fan of reggae is the person who's birthday is in september. Since we know birthdays are unique, let's set september's position as 4. This means july must be somewhere else.

3. From clue 4, the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver (so subway < snowmobile). Clue 5 tells us that the subway driver lives in a wooden house (wooden = 2), which means the snowmobile driver cannot live there (as gothic-revival takes the middle position, and since palace is rock, ranch-style and futuristic are left and right respectively, we can rule out those houses for the snowmobile driver).

4. The fan of rock is the palace house. Since palace is already assigned to position 4 (as it's the middle gothic-revival house), the fan of rock must be another job (architect) or music genre (not reggae, trance, or folk since we already know their positions).

5. From clue 6, the architect is the person who's birthday is in may, which means may = 1 (since we already know july = 3 and september = 4). This places rock at position 2 (as palace = 4 and positions are unique).

6. Now that we have the first three houses assigned (gothic-revival = 2, wooden = 5, and palace = 4), the remaining houses can be assigned in order: ranch-style (1), futuristic (3), and quad house (6) (since motorbikemaster is assigned to a house).

7. Clue 7 tells us that the mechanic drives the quad-bike, placing him at position 6. Since librarian must be on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june (position 2), and since all other positions are filled, the librarian must be either 1 (left) or 3 (right).

8. Clue 10 says that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in june, which means if librarian = 1, then the mechanic cannot be next to him/her because july must be between them. Therefore, librarian cannot be 1, making it 3 (right).

9. From clue 11, the person who's birthday is in july is on the left or right of the mechanic (position 6), meaning july can either be position 5 (quad-bike) or 7 (ambient bartender).

10. Since the fan of ambient is the bartender, and we have already placed librarian at position 3, the only position left for the bartender is position 8 (which leaves july = 5).

Finally, **july:5**."	july:2	july:5	True	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_9	july	5	" To solve this puzzle, we will work our way through the given clues and try to deduce the positions of each person based on their transport, music genre, job, birth month, and house.

1. We know that the fan of trance drives the train, but we don't have enough information yet to place them specifically in the arrangement. Let T represent the Trance fan, Train driver.
2. The person who likes Reggae has a birthday in September; let R represent this person.
3. We know that the fan of Rock is the palace house, but we don't have enough information yet to place them specifically in the arrangement. Let P represent the Rock fan, Palace owner.
4. The subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver; let S and SM represent these people, respectively. Since the gothic-revival house (GR) is in the middle, it cannot be either S or SM, so let's assume that S drives the subway. Therefore, the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of S, i.e., SM > S.
5. The subway driver lives in a wooden house, so W represents this person (and we already know it's S).
6. We know that the architect has a birthday in May; let A represent this person. Since GR is in the middle and A is not R or P, A cannot be either of them. Therefore, A must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be the left or right position of another person).
7. The person driving the quad-bike is the mechanic; let Q represent this person, and M represent the Mechanic. Since GR is in the middle, neither Q nor M can be it, so they must occupy one of the remaining positions.
8. We don't have enough information yet to place either Q or M specifically in the arrangement. However, since Q is the mechanic, we know that M cannot be a motorbikemaster, librarian, or bartender (as those jobs are already assigned to other people).
9. The fan of folk is on the far left; let F represent this person, and L represent the person driving the motorbike. Since F cannot be any of the already-assigned people, it must be either Q or M.
10. We know that the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June; let LB represent the Librarian and JS represent the person who has a birthday in June. Since neither F nor Q/M can be the Librarian, LB must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of F).
11. The person who's birthday is in July is on the left or right of the mechanic; let J represent this person. Since neither Q nor M can be J, we don't have enough information yet to place J specifically in the arrangement.
12. The motorbikemaster lives in a ranch-style house, so Ranch represents the Motorbikemaster (Mot). Since M is not Mot and cannot be any of the already-assigned people, M must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of F, LB, or J).
13. The fan of Ambient is the bartender; let B represent this person. Since neither Q nor M can be B and GR is in the middle, B cannot be GR. Therefore, B must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of F, LB, J, or Mot).
14. We don't have enough information yet to place either F or L specifically in relation to each other. However, since F is a fan of Folk and cannot be any of the already-assigned people, we know that F must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of B, Mot, J, or LB).
15. We don't have enough information yet to place the librarian specifically in relation to the futuristic house (FH). However, since L is on the left or right of JS, and neither F nor Q/M can be L, we know that L must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of B, Mot, J, F, or FH).
16. We now have enough information to determine where R is placed. Since R cannot be any of the already-assigned people and GR is in the middle, R must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of B, Mot, J, LB, F, or FH). However, since R is a fan of Trance and T cannot be any of the already-assigned people, we also know that R must be in a position to the right of T. Since there are only two positions remaining for R (if T is not the first person), both of those positions would contradict the fact that R has a birthday in September. Therefore, our assumption that T drives the train leads us to an inconsistency.
17. Given the inconsistency we found in step 16, let's reconsider the transport part of clue 2: Instead, suppose the fan of Trance rides the motorbike; let MT represent this person, and M represent the Motorbikemaster (as we already know its position from clue 12). Since neither F nor Q/M can be MT, MT must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of B, J, LB, F, or FH).
18. We now have enough information to place R in a position to its right. Since there are only two positions remaining for R, both of those positions would be consistent with R having a birthday in September and being a fan of Trance (if T is not the first person). Therefore, our revised assumption that MT rides the motorbike leads us to a possible solution.
19. We now have enough information to place J and LB in their positions as well. Since neither F nor Q/M can be LB or J, both of those people must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of B, MT, R, or FH). However, since we know that J's birthday is in July and they are on the left or right of the mechanic, we can place J in a position such that it is to the left of M (since Q cannot be M). Since LB is on the left or right of JS, they must occupy one of the remaining positions.
20. We don't have enough information yet to place F, B, Mot, or FH specifically in the arrangement. However, we know that F cannot be any of the already-assigned people and F is a fan of Folk. Therefore, F must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of MT, R, J, or LB). We also know that B is a fan of Ambient and cannot be any of the already-assigned people except for FH (since GR is in the middle), so B must occupy one of the remaining positions as well.
21. We still don't have enough information to place Mot or FH specifically in the arrangement. However, we know that Mot is a ranch-style house and cannot be any of the already-assigned people. Therefore, Mot must occupy one of the remaining positions (which may be either to the left or right of MT, R, J, LB, B, or F). Similarly, we also know that FH is not GR and cannot be any of the already-assigned people except for B (since GR is in the middle), so FH must occupy one of the remaining positions as well.
22. We now have enough information to place Mot and FH in their positions. Since Mot is a ranch-style house, it cannot be FH. Therefore, Mot must occupy a position such that it is to the left of FH (since GR is in the middle). Given this placement for Mot, there are only two remaining positions for FH, one of which would be consistent with it being the futuristic house. We now have enough information to place all people and houses in their respective positions.
23. Our final solution:

  1. Motorbikemaster (Mot): Ranch-style house
  2. Fan of Trance (MT): Rides the motorbike
  3. Bartender (B): Ambient fan, next to Mot
  4. Fan of Folk (F): To the left of B and MT
  5. Fan of September Birthday (R): Trance fan, next to F
  6. Fan of July Birthday (J): To the left of Motorbikemaster (Mot)
  7. Librarian (LB): Next to Fan of January Birthday (JS), to the right of J
  8. House: Grass-Roofed (GR): Middle position
  9. House: Futuristic (FH): Rightmost position

Since we found a consistent solution, our initial assumption that the fan of Trance rides the motorbike is correct."	july:2		False	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_july_10	july	5	" To solve this puzzle, we need to approach it systematically and deduce relationships between the given variables (transport, music-genres, houses, jobs, birthdays). Let's break down the problem and find out where July is located.

1. Trance - Train
2. Reggae - September
3. Rock - Palace (we know this later)
4. Subway left of Snowmobile
5. Subway - Wooden house
6. Architect - May
7. Quad-bike - Mechanic (but we need to find out who they are later)
8. Gothic-revival in the middle
9. Folk - Left (but we need to find out who they are later)
10. Librarian left or right of June
11. July left or right of Mechanic
12. Motorbikemaster - Ranch-style house
13. Ambient - Bartender
14. Folk left or right of Motorbike (but we need to find out who they are later)
15. Librarian left or right of Futuristic house

Now let's start finding the positions:

- Since we know that the Architect is in May, and the librarian is either on the left or right of June, we can deduce that the librarian must be in either May (if they are to the left of June) or June (if they are to the right). Let's assume they are in May for now.
- We know that the motorbikemaster is in the Ranch-style house, and there are only 5 houses available. Since we have already placed an occupant in May, the only remaining position for the Ranch-style house would be June. Therefore, the motorbikemaster is in June.
- Now, since the mechanic drives the Quad-bike, we can deduce that they are not the librarian (since they cannot be in both positions). They also cannot be in May or June because of our previous assumptions. So they must be in either September (Reggae) or July (we need to find out where it is).
- Next, let's analyze the position of the Subway and Snowmobile. Since the subway is on the left of the snowmobile, and we know that the subway is in the Wooden house, the only remaining positions for Snowmobile and other vehicles are:
  - Snowmobile can be either to the right of Motorbike (Ranch-style house) or at the end position. Since it's not at the end (because there are still four people left), it must be to the right of Motorbike. The only remaining positions for other vehicles would then be as follows:
    - Quad-bike would be on the far left, since Folk is on the left and the gothic-revival house is in the middle (leaving no room for any other vehicle to be on the left).
    - Train would then be at the end position, since it's not trance (as Trance is already taken by the person driving the train). This leaves us with Ambient and Rock. But we know that Rock is in the Palace house (we will see later), so Ambient must be in the remaining position.
  - In this scenario, Ambient would be at the end position, and since there are only four people left, it means that July has to be in the last position as well. So, **July:5**.
- Now let's analyze the jobs:
  - Since Motorbikemaster is the Ranch-style house (June), the motorbike master cannot be a mechanic (as we placed the mechanic earlier). The only remaining job for the motorbike master would be Bartender, but since Ambient is the bartender, it means that the motorbikemaster must be in one of the other jobs.
  - Since Architect is in May and Librarian is also in May, we know that they cannot both be the Architect or Librarian. The only remaining job for the person in May would be Mechanic. So, **Mechanic:May**.
- With the mechanic's position known, we can deduce that the Quad-bike driver must be either the Subway driver or the Snowmobile driver. Since there is no more room on the left for the Subway to be placed (as it would overlap with the position of July), it means that the Quad-bike driver and the Snowmobile driver are the same person, who drives the Snowmobile.
- Now we have only three people left: Folk, Reggae (September), and the remaining job (Motorbikemaster). Let's analyze their possible positions:
  - The Folk fan cannot be in the Ranch-style house (June) or the Wooden house (as July is at the end position). So, they can only occupy either the Subway or the Train.
    - If Folk were on the Train (Trance), it would mean that Ambient and Rock have to be in the same house as well. But since there are no more available houses for two people, this is not possible. So, Folk cannot be on the Train.
    - This leaves us with only one option: Folk must be on the Subway (since it's the only remaining position).
  - Now we know that the Subway driver (Quad-bike and Snowmobile) is on the left of July, so they cannot be in the last two positions. Since Folk is on the subway, we have to consider three remaining positions for them:
    - Position 3 would overlap with Rock if it were in the Palace house, so that's not possible.
    - Position 2 would also overlap with Ambient (end position) and July, so that's not possible either.
    - This leaves us with only one remaining position for Folk, which is Position 4. This means that Reggae must be in the last position (Position 5), and since there are no more available houses for them to occupy, it implies that Ambient would have to share a house with Rock.
- Now let's analyze the remaining jobs:
  - Since Folk is in Position 4, which leaves only two positions for the remaining job (Motorbikemaster). We can deduce that the Motorbikemaster must be either in Position 1 or Position 2.
    - If the Motorbikemaster were in Position 1, it would mean that they share a house with Reggae, but since there are no more available houses for them to occupy, this is not possible. So, Motorbikemaster must be in Position 2. This leaves us with only one remaining position for Rock and Ambient: Position 3 (since the Gothic-revival house is in the middle).
    - With Rock and Ambient in Position 3, we can now find out the last position for Reggae (Position 5) and place July between them.

Here's the final arrangement:
1. Bartender (Ambient)
2. Motorbikemaster
3. Architect (Rock), Mechanic
4. Folk
5. Librarian, July (Reggae), Subway driver (Quad-bike and Snowmobile)
6. Wooden house - July
7. Futuristic house - Librarian
8. Gothic-revival house - Architect and Mechanic
9. Palace house - Rock
10. Ranch-style house - Bartender and Motorbikemaster

And here's the final answer for the positions of July and Reggae: **July:6, Reggae:5**"	july:2	july:6	True	False
