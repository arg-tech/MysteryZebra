Explanation:

1. The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person watching mystery movies. So, lacrosse goes in the first row, and mystery goes in the first column.
2. The person who's sport is water-polo is the social-worker. So, water-polo goes in the second row, and social-worker goes in the second column.
3. The person drinking coffee is the person watching horror movies. Since coffee is in the third column, and we know that the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies, the person watching adventure movies must be in the fourth column. So, horror goes in the third column, and adventure goes in the fourth column.
4. The person who's sport is snowboarding is the person drinking tea. Since snowboarding is in the third row, and we know that the person drinking tea is in the third column, tea goes in the third row.
5. The person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies. So, the person watching adventure movies must be in the fourth column, and the person watching horror movies must be in the fifth column.
6. The person eating cranberry is the engineer. Since cranberry is in the fourth column, and we know that the person eating cranberry is in the fifth row, engineer goes in the fifth row.
7. The person eating spinach is the person watching western movies. Since spinach is in the second column, and we know that the person eating spinach is to the left of the bartender, the bartender must be in the third column. So, western goes in the second column.
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle. Since milk is in the third row, and we know that the person drinking tea is in the third column, the person drinking milk must be in the second column.
9. The person who's sport is cricket is on the far left. Since cricket is in the first row, and we know that the person eating spinach is to the left of the bartender, the person watching cricket must be in the first column. So, cricket goes in the first row.
10. The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the chef. Since cauliflower is in the fifth row, and we know that the person eating cranberry is in the fifth row, cauliflower can be in either the first or the third column. Since the person eating cauliflower is not the person eating spinach (because spinach is already in the second column), cauliflower goes in the third column.
11. The person eating spinach is to the left or right of the bartender. Since spinach is already in the second column, it must be either the first or the third column. Since the person eating spinach is not the person eating cranberry (because cranberry is already in the fourth column), and the person eating spinach is not the person eating cauliflower (because cauliflower is already in the third column), the person eating spinach must be in the first column.
12. The person eating grapes is the person drinking orange-juice. Since grapes is in the fifth column, and we know that the person eating grapes is the person drinking orange-juice, orange-juice goes in the fifth row.
13. The person who's sport is biathlon is the person eating lime. Since biathlon is in the fifth row, and we know that the person eating lime is in the fifth column, lime goes in the fifth row.
14. The person who's sport is cricket is to the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since cricket is already in the first column, the person watching drama movies must be in the second or the fourth column. Since the person watching drama movies is not the person watching horror movies (because horror is already in the fifth column), the person watching drama movies must be in the fourth column. So, drama goes in the fifth column.

This completes the solution to the logic puzzle."
Zebra_domain_replacements_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's assign variables to each person and their characteristics:
   - A: Hobby (singing), Color (red), Job (?), Movie-Genre (?), House (?)
   - B: Hobby (video-games), Color (?), Job (?), Movie-Genre (chesterfield), House (colonial)
   - C: Hobby (board-games), Color (?), Job (?), Movie-Genre (?), House (?)
   - D: Hobby (cooking), Color (?), Job (?), Movie-Genre (?), House (?)
   - E: Hobby (magic-tricks), Color (?), Job (?), Movie-Genre (?), House (?)

2. From the given clues, we can start filling in some information:
   - A: red
   - B: colonial
   - C: electrician (from 4)
   - D: leftmost (from 9)
   - E: horror (from 13)

3. Now let's use the positioning clues to arrange the people:
   - Since D is on the leftmost, we can place D in the first column.
   - Since C is to the left or right of D, we can place C in the second or fifth column.
   - Since A is singing and likes red, it must be to the right of D (as red is the only color left). So, A goes in the third column.
   - Since B is a colonial house, it must be in the fourth or fifth row (as we've placed three houses already). Let's place B in the fifth row for now.
   - Since E is magic-tricks and watches horror movies, it must be to the right of B (as horror is the last movie genre). So, E goes in the sixth column.
   - Since the freelancer is in the middle, it must be in the third row. However, we've already placed A and C there. So, let's move B to the third row and place the freelancer in the fifth row.

4. Now let's use the job and movie-genre clues to fill in the remaining information:
   - Since the journalist is the person who likes green, it must be to the right of A (as red and ivory are taken). So, the journalist goes in the fourth column.
   - Since the lawyer watches mystery movies, it must be in the fourth row (as we've placed the journalist, freelancer, and B already).
   - Since the person watching satire movies is the gothic-revival house, it must be in the second row (as we've placed A, C, and B already).
   - Since the person watching documentary movies is to the left or right of the craftsman house, it must be in the third or fifth row. However, we've placed the journalist, freelancer, and B in the third row. So, let's place the documentary watcher in the fifth row.
   - Since the person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the farmhouse house, it must be in the second, third, or fourth row. However, we've placed the satire watcher, journalist, and B in the second and fourth rows. So, let's place the fantasy watcher in the third row.
   - Since the person watching yellow documentaries is to the left or right of the craftsman house, it must be in the second, third, or fourth column. However, we've placed the satire watcher, journalist, A, and B in the second and fourth columns. So, let's place the documentary watcher in the third column.
   - Since the person who likes ivory is to the right of the person who likes green, it must be in the fourth or fifth column. However, we've placed the journalist, A, B, and the documentary watcher in the second, third, and fourth columns. So, let's place the ivory person in the fifth column.
   - Since the person who likes blue is to the left or right of the person who likes cooking, it must be in the second, third, or fourth column. However, we've placed the satire watcher, journalist, A, B, the documentary watcher, and the ivory person in the second, third, and fourth columns. So, let's place the blue person in the fifth column.

5. Now let's assign the remaining jobs and movie genres:
   - Since the person in the third row is a freelancer, it has no job left.
   - Since the person in the fifth row is an electrician, it has no job left.
   - Since the person in the fifth row is watching parliament (olg-gold), it has no movie genre left.
   - Since the person in the fifth column is a librarian (as all other jobs are taken), it has no job left.

Here is the final solution table:

In this table, the '#' represents an empty cell. The final solution table shows the hobbies, colors, jobs, movie genres, and houses for each person."
Zebra_domain_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning variables to each category and each person.

1. Let's assign the variables M1 to M5 for Music-Genre, F1 to F5 for Flower, B1 to B5 for Beverage, G1 to G5 for Movie-Genre, and D1 to D5 for Birthday.

2. We know that there are 5 different flowers, music-genres, movie-genres, beverages, and birthdays. So, each variable can only take one unique value from its respective set.

3. Let's start with the flowers:
   - Since the person who grows aconite is a fan of r&b (1), and r&b is the first music-genre, M1 = r&b and F1 = aconite.
   - The person who grows iris is drinking coffee (3), and coffee is the third beverage, so B3 = coffee and F3 = iris.
   - The person who grows iris is to the right of the person who grows rose (5), so F4 ≠ iris and F4 > F3.
   - The person who grows daffodil watches western movies (7), and western movies are the third movie-genre, so G3 = western and F5 = daffodil.
   - The person who grows begonia is a fan of pop (9), and pop is the first music-genre, so M1 = pop and F1 = begonia.
   - The only remaining flower is rose, so F2 = rose.

4. Now let's work on the music-genres:
   - Since the fan of dubstep is born in September (2), and there are only 5 birthdays, D2 = september and M2 = dubstep.
   - The fan of punk is drinking tea (4), and tea is the second beverage, so B2 = tea and M4 = punk.
   - The fan of house is watching horror movies (13), and horror movies are the fifth movie-genre, so G5 = horror and M5 = house.
   - The only remaining music-genre is pop (M1 = pop), which we already know is the first music-genre, so M3 = pop.

5. Let's work on the beverages:
   - The person drinking milk is in the middle (8), so B2 = milk.
   - The only remaining beverage is orange-juice, so B4 = orange-juice.
   - The only remaining beverage is water, so B5 = water.

6. Now let's work on the movie-genres:
   - The person watching musical movies is born in July (6), so G1 = musical and D1 = july.
   - The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in April (10), so G2 or G4 = sports. Since G3 = western (7), G2 = sports and G4 = fantasy.
   - The person watching fantasy movies is drinking orange-juice (12), so G4 = fantasy and F4 = orange-juice.
   - The person watching horror movies is a fan of house (13), so G5 = horror.

7. Finally, let's work on the birthdays:
   - The person born in September is a fan of dubstep (2), so D2 = september.
   - The person born in April is either a fan of sports or a fan of western movies (10), but we already know G2 = sports, so D3 = april.
   - The person born in February is not a fan of pop (14), so D4 ≠ february. Since D1 = july, D5 = august, and D2 = september, D4 = august.
   - The only remaining birthday is January, so D5 = january.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
| Music-Genre | r&b | dubstep | pop | punk | house |
| Flower     | aconite | rose | iris | daffodil | begonia |
| Beverage   | coffee | milk | orange-juice | tea | water |
| Movie-Genre | musical | sports | fantasy | western | horror |
| Birthday   | july  | september | april | august | january |
