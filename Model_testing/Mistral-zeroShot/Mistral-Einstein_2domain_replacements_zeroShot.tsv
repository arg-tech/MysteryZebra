Einstein_domain_replacements_0	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Since the norwegian is on the far left, the nationalities from left to right are Norwegian, British, Danish, German, Swede.

2. The palace house is in the middle, so it must be in the 3rd position. Since the norwegian is on the left of the palace, the palace must be between the Norwegian and the British, making the nationalities arrangement: Norwegian, British, Palace, Danish, Swede.

3. The bluemaster-smoker is the cottage house, so the blue-liker must be in the 1st position, and the cottage house is on the left of the palace, making the nationalities arrangement: Norwegian, Blue, Palace, Danish, Swede.

4. The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white, so the green-liker must be in the 2nd position, and the white-liker must be in the 4th position. Since the green-liker is also the townhouse, the arrangement is: Norwegian, Green, Townhouse, White, Swede.

5. The pall-mall-smoker is the onion-eater, so the onion-eater must be in the 5th position, and the arrangement is: Norwegian, Green, Townhouse, Onion, Swede.

6. The person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker, so the yellow-liker must be in the 3rd position, and the arrangement is: Norwegian, Green, Dunhill, Onion, Swede.

7. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the modern house, so the blend-smoker cannot be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. The only possible position for the blend-smoker is the 2nd position, making the arrangement: Norwegian, Blend, Green, Dunhill, Onion, Swede.

8. The german is the prince-smoker, so the german must be in the 4th position, and the arrangement is: Norwegian, Blend, Green, Prince, Dunhill, Onion, Swede.

9. The person eating eggplants is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker, so the eggplant-eater cannot be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. The only possible positions for the eggplant-eater are the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. Since the blend-smoker is already in the 2nd position, the eggplant-eater must be in the 4th position, and the arrangement is: Norwegian, Blend, Green, Eggplant, Prince, Dunhill, Onion, Swede.

10. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the modern house, so the modern house cannot be in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, or 7th position. The only possible positions for the modern house are the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. Since the blend-smoker is already in the 2nd position and the eggplant-eater is in the 4th position, the modern house must be in the 6th position, and the arrangement is: Norwegian, Blend, Green, Eggplant, Modern, Prince, Dunhill, Onion, Swede.

Final solution table:

|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| Norwegian	| Blend	| Green	| Eggplant	| Modern	|
| Nationality	|		|		|		|		|	Swede	|
| Food		|		|		|		|	Eggplant	|	Onion	|
| House	|		|		|		|		|		|
| Cigar		|		| Bluemaster	|		|		|	Dunhill	|

The table is not complete because the house and the cigar for the swede (strawberry-eater) are still missing. However, the nationalities, colors, and food are correctly placed according to the given clues."
Einstein_domain_replacements_1	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. We know the sports, colors, beverages, cigars, and birthdays. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 5 for each category.

2. From rule 1, the person who's sport is tennis is the person who likes red. So, let's assign red to the person in the 1st column (Column 1). Since there are 5 colors, the other colors must be assigned to the other columns. Let's assign green to Column 2, blue to Column 3, white to Column 4, and yellow to Column 5.

3. From rule 2, the person who's sport is snowboarding is the person whose birthday is in January. So, let's assign January to the 1st row (Row 1). Since there are 5 months, the other months must be assigned to the other rows. Let's assign February to Row 2, April to Row 3, June to Row 4, and November to Row 5.

4. From rule 3, the person who's sport is skateboarding is the person drinking tea. Since we know the sports and the birthday, we can deduce that the person drinking tea must be in Row 2, 3, 4, or 5 (not Row 1 because of rule 2). Since there are 5 beverages, the other beverages must be assigned to the other rows. Let's assign beer to Row 2, coffee to Row 3, milk to Row 4, and water to Row 5.

5. From rule 4, the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Since we know the colors, we can deduce that the person who likes green must be in Column 2 and the person who likes white must be in Column 4.

6. From rule 5, the person who likes green is the person drinking coffee. Since we know the color and the beverage, we can deduce that the person drinking coffee must be in Row 3.

7. From rule 6, the pall-mall-smoker is the person whose birthday is in April. Since we know the birthday, we can deduce that the pall-mall-smoker must be in Row 3.

8. From rule 8, the person drinking milk is in the middle. Since we know the beverages, we can deduce that the person drinking milk must be in Row 4.

9. From rule 9, the person who's sport is parkour is on the far left. Since we know the sports, we can deduce that the person who's sport is parkour must be in Column 1.

10. From rule 10, the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in February. Since we know the birthday and the cigar, we can deduce that the blend-smoker must be in Row 2 or Row 4.

11. From rule 11, the person who's birthday is in November is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker. Since we know the birthday, we can deduce that the dunhill-smoker must be in Row 5.

12. From rule 12, the bluemaster-smoker is the person drinking beer. Since we know the cigar and the beverage, we can deduce that the bluemaster-smoker must be in Row 2.

13. From rule 13, the person who's sport is soccer is the prince-smoker. Since we know the sport, we can deduce that the prince-smoker must be in one of the remaining rows (not Row 1 because of rule 2, not Row 3 because of rule 6, not Row 4 because of rule 8, and not Row 5 because of rule 11).

14. From rule 14, the person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since we know the sport and the color, we can deduce that the person who likes blue must be in Column 3.

15. From rule 15, the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since we know the cigar and the beverage, we can deduce that the person drinking water must be in Row 5.

Now we have enough information to fill the table:

| Color  | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

1. Since the norwegian is on the far left, we can place them in the first column. Let's put them in the first row as well, making them Norwegian (1), with the favorite color blue (1).

2. The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Since we already have the Norwegian in the first column, the only possible position for the person who likes green is in the second column (2). The person who likes green is also the person drinking coffee (3), so we can fill the second row with Green (2) and Coffee (3).

3. The person who likes yellow is traveling to edinburgh (7), so they must be in the fifth column (5). Since the norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue, the only possible position for the person who likes yellow is in the fourth column (4). However, we already have the person who likes green in the second column, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third column (3). The person who likes yellow is also drinking milk (8), so we can fill the third row with Yellow (3) and Milk (8).

4. The person who likes red is British (1), so they must be in the first column (1) as well. Since the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white, the only possible position for the person who likes red is in the fifth column (5).
