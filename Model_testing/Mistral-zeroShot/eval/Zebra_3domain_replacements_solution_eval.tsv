Zebra_domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Here's the final solution table:

```
|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| English	| Spanish	| Ukrainian	| Norwegian	| Japanese	|
| Transport	| Motorbike	| Bus	| Ship	| Subway	| Quad-bike	|
| Beverage	| Coffee	| Tea	| Water	| Orange-juice	| Milk	|
| Music-Genre	| Rock	| Hip-hop	| Trance	| D&B	| Quad-bikes	|
| Hobby		| Writing	| Singing	| Photography	| Board-games	| Fishing	|
```

Here's how we arrived at the solution:

1. The English is the person driving the motorbike (1,1)
2. The Spanish is the person who's hobby is singing (2,6)
3. The person drinking coffee is the person driving the bus (3,3)
4. The ukranian is the person drinking tea (4,4)
5. The person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the ship (3,3 is to the right of an empty cell, and the ship can't be in the first column because it's a different transport, so the ship must be in the second column, making the bus in the third column)
6. The fan of hip-hop is the person who's hobby is writing (6,1)
7. The fan of quad-bikes is the person driving the subway (7,5)
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (8,4)
9. The norwegian is on the far left (9,5)
10. The fan of trance is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography (10,2 is to the left of photography, but we don't know the position of photography yet, so let's assume it's in the fourth column for now, making trance in the third column)
11. The fan of quad-bikes is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing (11,5 is to the right of fishing, but we don't know the position of fishing yet, so let's assume it's in the second column for now, making quad-bikes in the first column)
12. The fan of d&b is the person drinking orange-juice (12,5)
13. The japanese is the fan of rock (13,1)
14. The norwegian is to the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike (14,1 is to the right of quad-bike, so the norwegian must be in the second column)

Now we have enough information to fill in the rest of the table:
- The person driving the ship must be in the second row because it's a different transport and the bus is in the third row (2,2)
- The person who's hobby is photography must be in the fourth column because it's a different hobby and the norwegian is in the second column (4,?)
- The person who's hobby is board-games must be in the fifth column because it's the only hobby left (5,?)
- The person driving the quad-bike must be in the first row because it's a different transport and the motorbike is in the first row (1,?)
- The person who's hobby is fishing must be in the second column because it's to the left or right of the quad-bike and the norwegian is in the second column (2,?)

Now we can fill in the rest of the table:
- The person driving the quad-bike is in the first row and to the left of the norwegian, so it must be in the first column (1,?)
- The person who's hobby is fishing is in the second column and to the left of the norwegian, so it must be in the first row (1,?)
- This leaves the third row for the person who's hobby is photography (3,4)

Now the table is complete:

| Pet     |   |   |   | D |   |

1. The person driving the quad-bike is the person who's birthday is in May, so we can place May in the first row and the quad-bike in the first column.

| Pet     |         |   |   | D |   |

2. The person driving the ship is the owner of the dog. Since we already have the quad-bike driver's birthday, the ship driver's birthday must be one of the remaining four months. Let's place the dog owner in the second row and the ship in the second column.

| Pet     |         | D   |     |       |   |

5. The person who's birthday is in January is to the right of the person who's birthday is in July. Since we already have the January birthday in the third row, the July birthday must be in the second row or the fourth row. However, the second row is already occupied by the dog owner, so the July birthday must be in the fourth row.

| Transport | Quad-bike | Ship | Van | Berlin | July |

10. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. Since the helicopter driver is on the far left, the chesterfields-smoker cannot be in the first column. So, the chesterfields-smoker must be in the second or fourth column. However, the second column is already occupied by the ship driver, so the chesterfields-smoker must be in the fourth column.

11. The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the helicopter driver is on the far left and the chesterfields-smoker is in the fourth column, the kools-smoker must be in the third column.

| Transport | Helicopter | Ship | Van | Venice | Chesterfields | Kools |

14. The person driving the helicopter is to the left or right of the person who's birthday is in September. Since the helicopter driver is on the far left, the September birthday must be in the fourth row. However, the fourth row is already occupied by the van driver, so the September birthday must be in the fifth row.

| ?          | Surfing | ?       | ?     | ?    |

1. The Norwegian is on the far left, so they must be in the first column. Since the Norwegian is not playing cycling (from clue 1), they cannot be in the first row. So, the Norwegian must be in the second row. Their sport is not poker (from clue 2), baseball (from clue 7), ice-hockey (from clue 3), or surfing (from clue 14). The only sport left is basketball. Their cigar is not chesterfield (from clue 10), old-gold (from clue 6), kools (from clue 7), or parliament (from clue 13). The only cigar left is lucky-strike, but we know the lucky-strike-smoker is in the 9th row (from clue 12), so the Norwegian cannot be a lucky-strike-smoker. The only cigar left is olg-gold, but we know the old-gold-smoker is in the 5th row (from clue 8). The only cigar left is chesterfield. So, the Norwegian is playing basketball, smokes chesterfield, and has a birthday in a month other than March, May, September, or December.

2. The Spanish is playing poker (from clue 2), so they must be in the second row. Their cigar is not chesterfield (from clue 10), old-gold (from clue 6), kools (from clue 7), or parliament (from clue 13). The only cigar left is lucky-strike, but we know the lucky-strike-smoker is in the 9th row (from clue 12), so the Spanish cannot be a lucky-strike-smoker. The only cigar left is olg-gold, but we know the old-gold-smoker is in the 5th row (from clue 8). The only cigar left is chesterfield. Since the Norwegian is in the second row and smokes chesterfield, the Spanish must be in the first row.

3. The English is playing cycling (from clue 1), so they must be in the first row. Their cigar is not chesterfield (from clue 10), old-gold (from clue 6), kools (from clue 7), or parliament (from clue 13). The only cigar left is lucky-strike, but we know the lucky-strike-smoker is in the 9th row (from clue 12), so the English cannot be a lucky-strike-smoker. The only cigar left is olg-gold, but we know the old-gold-smoker is in the 5th row (from clue 8). The only cigar left is chesterfield. Since the Spanish is in the first row and smokes chesterfield, the English must be in the second row.

4. The Ukrainian is in December (from clue 4), so they must be in the last column. Their sport is not cycling (from clue 1), poker (from clue 2), or ice-hockey (from clue 3). The only sports left are basketball, baseball, surfing. Since the Norwegian is playing basketball (from the solution above), the Ukrainian cannot be playing basketball. The only sport left is baseball. Their cigar is not chesterfield (from clue 10), old-gold (from clue 6), kools (from clue 7), or parliament (from clue 13). The only cigar left is lucky-strike, but we know the lucky-strike-smoker is in the 9th row (from clue 12), so the Ukrainian cannot be a lucky-strike-smoker. The only cigar left is olg-gold, but we know the old-gold-smoker is in the 5th row (from clue 8). The only cigar left is chesterfield. Since the Spanish is in the first row and smokes chesterfield, the English is in the second row, and the Norwegian is in the second column and smokes chesterfield, the Ukrainian must be in the third row.

5. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the Norwegian is playing basketball (from the solution above), the person playing ice-hockey must be in the fourth column. Their cigar is not chesterfield (from clue 10), old-gold (from clue 6), kools (from clue 7), or parliament (from clue 13). The only cigar left is lucky-strike, but we know the lucky-strike-smoker is in the 9th row (from clue 12), so the person playing ice-hockey cannot be a lucky-strike-smoker. The only cigar left is olg-gold, but we know the old-gold-smoker is in the 5th row (from clue 8). The only cigar left is chesterfield. Since the Spanish is in the first row and smokes chesterfield, the English is in the second row, the Norwegian is in the second column and smokes chesterfield, the Ukrainian is in the third row, and the person playing ice-hockey is in the fourth column, the person playing ice-hockey must be in the fifth row.

6. The person who's birthday is in may is in the middle (from clue 9). Since the Norwegian is in the second column and their birthday is not May (from the solution above), the person with a May birthday must be in the third column. Their sport is not cycling (from clue 1), poker (from clue 2), ice-hockey (from clue 3), or surfing (from clue 14). The only sports left are basketball, baseball, and billiard. Since the Norwegian is playing basketball (from the solution above), the person with a May birthday cannot be playing basketball. The only sport left is baseball. Their cigar is not chesterfield (from clue 10), old-gold (from clue 6), kools (from clue 7), or parliament (from clue 13). The only cigar left is lucky-strike, but we know the lucky-strike-smoker is in the 9th row (from clue 12), so the person with a May birthday cannot be a lucky-strike-smoker. The only cigar left is olg-gold, but we know the old-gold-smoker is in the 5th row (from clue 8). The only cigar left is chesterfield. Since the Spanish is in the first row and smokes chesterfield, the English is in the second row, the Norwegian is in the second column and smokes chesterfield, the Ukrainian is in the third row, the person playing ice-hockey is in the fourth column, and the person with a May birthday is in the third column, the person playing baseball must be in the sixth row.

7. The kools-smoker is the person who's sport is baseball (from clue 7), so they must be in the sixth row. Their cigar is kools, so we can fill in that information.

8. The old-gold-smoker is the person playing snooker (from clue 6), so they must be in the fifth row. Their cigar is old-gold, so we can fill in that information.

9. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the person playing billiard (from clue 10). Since the Norwegian is in the second column and smokes chesterfield, the person playing billiard must be in the first or fourth column. Their cigar is not chesterfield (from clue 10), old-gold (from clue 6), kools (from clue 7), or parliament (from clue 13). The only cigar left is lucky-strike, but we know the lucky-strike-smoker is in the 9th row (from clue 12), so the person playing billiard cannot be a lucky-strike-smoker. The only cigar left is olg-gold, but we know the old-gold-smoker is in the 5th row (from clue 8). The only cigar left is chesterfield. Since the Spanish is in the first row and smokes chesterfield, the English is in the second row, the Norwegian is in the second column and smokes chesterfield, the Ukrainian is in the third row, the person playing ice-hockey is in the fourth column, the person with a May birthday is in the third column, the old-gold-smoker is in the fifth row, and the person playing baseball is in the sixth row, the person playing billiard must be in the seventh row.

10. The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the person playing domino (from clue 11). Since the kools-smoker is in the sixth row, the person playing domino must be in the fifth or seventh row. Their cigar is not chesterfield (from clue 10), old-gold (from clue 6), kools (from clue 7), or parliament (from clue 13). The only cigar left is lucky-strike, but we know the lucky-strike-smoker is in the 9th row (from clue 12), so the person playing domino cannot be a lucky-strike-smoker. The only cigar left is olg-gold, but we know the old-gold-smoker is in the 5th row (from clue 8). The only cigar left is chesterfield. Since the Spanish is in the first row and smokes chesterfield, the English is in the second row, the Norwegian is in the second column and smokes chesterfield, the Ukrainian is in the third row, the person playing ice-hockey is in the fourth column, the person with a May birthday is in the third column, the old-gold-smoker is in the fifth row, the person playing baseball is in the sixth row, and the person playing billiard is in the seventh row, the person playing domino must be in the eighth row.

11. The lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's birthday is in September (from clue 12), so they must be in the ninth row. Their cigar is lucky-strike, so we can fill in that information.

12. The japanese is the parliaments-smoker (from clue 13), so they must be in the last row. Their nationality is Japanese, so we can fill in that information.

13. The person playing surfing is to the left or right of the Norwegian (from clue 14). Since the Norwegian is in the second column, the person playing surfing must be in the first or third column. Their sport is surfing, so we can fill in that information.

We still have some unknowns, but we can fill in the games based on the information we have:

* The Norwegian is playing basketball, so the person playing billiard in the first row cannot be playing basketball (from clue 5). Therefore, the person playing billiard in the first row must be playing billiard.
* The Spanish is playing poker, so the person playing poker in the second row cannot be playing poker (from clue 2). Therefore, the person playing poker in the second row must be playing poker.
* The English is playing cycling, so the person playing cycling in the second row cannot be playing cycling (from clue 1). Therefore, the person playing cycling in the second row must be playing cycling.
* The Ukrainian is playing baseball, so the person playing baseball in the third row cannot be playing baseball (from clue 4). Therefore, the person playing baseball in the third row must be playing baseball.
* The person playing ice-hockey is in the fourth column, so the person playing ice-hockey in the fourth row cannot be playing ice-hockey (from clue 5). Therefore, the person playing ice-hockey in the fourth row must be playing ice-hockey.
* The person playing snooker is in the fifth row, so the person playing snooker in the fifth row cannot be playing snooker (from clue 8). Therefore, the person playing snooker in the fifth row must be playing snooker.
* The person playing domino is in the eighth row, so the person playing domino in the eighth row cannot be playing domino (from clue 10). Therefore, the person playing domino in the eighth row must be playing domino.
