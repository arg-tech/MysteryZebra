1. Let's assign variables to each category:
   - C for Color
   - N for Nationality

   - S for Cigar

2. From the given information, we can make some initial assumptions:
   - There are 5 different colors, nationalities, pets, hobbies, and cigars.
   - Each row represents a different person.

3. Let's start with the nationalities:
   - N1: norwegian (position 1, according to 9)
   - N2: german (position 3, according to 13 and not 1, 2, or 4)
   - N3: british (position 4, according to 1 and not 1, 2, or 5)
   - N4: swedish (position 5, according to 2)
   - N5: danish (remaining position, according to 3)

   - C1: green (position 2, according to 4 and 5)
   - C2: red (position 1, according to 1)
   - C3: white (position 4, according to 14 and not 1, 2, or 5)
   - C4: blue (position 3, according to 14 and not 1, 2, 4, or 5)
   - C5: yellow (remaining position, according to 7 and not 1, 2, 3, or 4)

5. Next, let's assign pets:

   - P4: fish (position 4, not specified yet)

6. Now let's assign hobbies:
   - H1: woodworking (position 5, according to 12)
   - H2: fishing (position 2, according to 5)
   - H3: chess (position 5, according to 3)
   - H4: filmmaking (position 3, according to 8)
   - H5: photography (remaining position, according to 15 and not 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)

7. Finally, let's assign cigars:

   - S2: pall-mall (position 6, according to 6)
   - S3: prince (position 4, according to 13)
   - S4: blend (position 1, according to 10 and not 2 or 5)
   - S5: dunhill (remaining position, according to 7 and not 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6)

8. Now we can fill in the final solution table:

| Hobby	| woodworking	| fishing	| chess	| filmmaking	| photography	|
| Cigar		| bluemaster	| pall-mall	| prince	| blend	| dunhill	|

The final solution table is:

Einstein_domain_replacements_1	"Solving this puzzle requires a systematic approach. Let's break it down:

1. Assign colors to the columns (left to right): Blue, Green, Red, White, Yellow
2. Assign foods to the rows (top to bottom): Cucumber, Lettuce, Pear, Radish, Grapes
3. Assign pets to the cells where the corresponding food is eaten: Cat, Bird, Dog, Fish, Horse (we'll fill this in later)
4. Assign beverages to the cells where the corresponding food is eaten: Beer, Coffee, Milk, Tea, Water (we'll fill this in later)
5. Assign cigars to the cells where the corresponding beverage is drunk: bluemaster, dunhill, pall-mall, prince, blend (we'll fill this in later)

Now let's solve the clues:

1. The person eating cucumber is the person who likes red, so Red is in the row of Cucumber.
2. The person eating grapes is the owner of the dog, so Dog is in the row of Grapes.
3. The person eating lettuce is the person drinking tea, so Tea is in the column of Lettuce.
4. The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Since Green is in the second column, White must be in the fourth column.
5. The person who likes green is the person drinking coffee, so Coffee is in the second row.
6. The pall-mall-smoker is the owner of the bird, so Bird is in the column of the Pall-Mall cigar. Since Pall-Mall is not yet placed, we'll come back to this.
7. The person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker, so Yellow is in the column of Dunhill cigar.
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle, so Milk is in the third column.
9. The person eating radish is on the far left, so Radish is in the first column.
10. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since Cat is not yet placed, we'll come back to this.
11. The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker. Since Horse is not yet placed and we know the column of Dunhill, we'll come back to this.
12. The bluemaster-smoker is the person drinking beer, so Beer is in the column of Bluemaster.
13. The person eating pear is the prince-smoker, so Pear is in the column of Prince cigar.
14. The person eating radish is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since Radish is in the first column and Blue is in the fifth column, Radish must be either in the first or fifth row. Since it's already in the first row, the person who likes blue must be in the fifth row.
15. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since Blend is in the fourth or fifth column and Water is in the third column, Blend must be either in the second or fourth row. Since it's already in the fourth row, the person drinking water must be in the second row.

Now we can fill in the remaining information:

- The person who likes white is in the fourth column, so the fifth row must be empty.
- Since the person eating lettuce is the person drinking tea, Tea is in the third row.
- Since the person drinking milk is in the middle, the second row must be empty.
- Since the person eating radish is on the left or right of the person who likes blue, the first row must be empty.
- Since the person eating pear is the prince-smoker, the fifth column must be empty.
- Since the pall-mall-smoker is the owner of the bird, the second column must be empty.
- Since the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat, the first and fifth columns must be empty.
- Since the owner of the horses is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker, the third and fourth columns must be empty.

The final solution table is:

```

Einstein_domain_replacements_2	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. We can start by placing the norwegian on the far left (position 1) due to rule 9. Let's assume the nationality in position 1 is Norwegian.

2. Since the norwegian is on the left of the person who likes blue (rule 14), the blue color must be in position 2. So, the nationality in position 2 is British (rule 1).

3. The British likes red (rule 1), so the red color must be in position 3.

4. The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white (rule 4). Since the green color is already placed in position 2, the white color must be in position 4. So, the nationality in position 4 is German (rule 13, the german is the prince-smoker and prince is not among the colors, so it must be a nationality).

5. The person who likes green is the person who's hobby is gardening (rule 5), so the hobby gardening must be in position 2.

6. The pall-mall-smoker is the owner of the bird (rule 6), so the bird pet must be in position 3 (since the bird cannot be in position 1 or 2 due to the nationalities and hobbies already placed).

7. The person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker (rule 7), so the yellow color must be in position 5.

8. The person who's hobby is card-games is in the middle (rule 8), so the hobby card-games must be in position 3.

9. The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker (rule 11), and the owner of the horses cannot be in position 1 (due to the nationality already placed) or position 3 (due to the pet already placed), so the horse pet must be in position 5.

10. The bluemaster-smoker is the person who's hobby is drawing (rule 12), so the hobby drawing must be in position 5.

11. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (rule 10), and the blend-smoker cannot be in position 1 (due to the nationality already placed) or position 5 (due to the hobbies and pet already placed), so the cat pet must be in position 4.

12. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing (rule 15), and the blend-smoker cannot be in position 1 (due to the nationality already placed) or position 5 (due to the hobbies and pet already placed), so the fishing hobby must be in position 1.

13. Since all the nationalities, pets, hobbies, and colors have been placed, the final solution table is:

|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| fishing	|	green	|	bird	|	white	|	yellow	|
| Nationality	| norwegian	|	british	|	german	|	danish	|	swedish	|
| Pet		|	cat	|	dog	|	bird	|	fish	|	horse	|
| Hobby	|	fishing	|	gardening	|	card-games	|	drawing	|	video-games	|
| Cigar		|		|		|	pall-mall	|		|	blend	|
