Einstein_domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign the music genres to the rows (Transport):
   - Trance: Train
   - Rock: Subway (since it's on the left of the snowmobile, so it can't be the first row)
   - Ambient: Motorbike (since it's not the first row, not the train, not the subway, not the snowmobile, and not the quad-bike)
   - Folk: Quad-bike (since it's not the first row, not the train, not the subway, not the motorbike, and not the snowmobile)
   - Reggae: Snowmobile (since it's not the first row, not the train, not the subway, not the motorbike, and not the quad-bike)

2. Assign the houses to the columns (Music-Genre):
   - Ranch-style: Motorbikemaster (since it's not the gothic-revival, not the palace, not the wooden, not the futuristic)
   - Wooden: Subway (since it's not the gothic-revival, not the palace, not the ranch-style, not the futuristic, and it's the left of the snowmobile)
   - Gothic-revival: In the middle (since it's not the first or the last column)
   - Palace: Rock (since it's not the first column, not the gothic-revival, not the ranch-style, not the wooden, and not the futuristic)
   - Futuristic: Librarian (since it's not the first column, not the gothic-revival, not the ranch-style, not the wooden, and it's on the left or right of the librarian)

3. Assign the jobs to the cells (House):
   - Motorbikemaster: Ranch-style (already assigned)
   - Mechanic: Quad-bike (since it's the person driving the quad-bike)
   - Architect: May (since it's the person whose birthday is in May)
   - Bartender: Ambient (since it's the fan of ambient)
   - Librarian: Futuristic (already assigned)

4. Assign the birthdays to the cells (Job):
   - June: Not the first or the last row (since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in June)
   - May: Architect (already assigned)
   - September: Raggae (already assigned)
   - February: Not the first or the last row (since the librarian is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in February)
   - July: Not the first or the last row, and it's on the left or right of the mechanic (already assigned)

Now we have all the information to fill the table:

|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Transport		| Motorbike	|	Subway	|	Train	|	Snowmobile	|	Quad-bike	|

| House	|	Ranch-style	|	Wooden	|	Gothic-revival	|	Palace	|	Futuristic	|
| Job		|	Motorbikemaster	|	Architect	|	Mechanic	|	Bartender	|	Librarian	|

Finally, let's put '#############' around the solution table:
