Einstein_domain_replacements_0	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Let's assign variables to each city, flower, music-genre, movie-genre, and cigar. For example, let L = liverpool, B = boston, R = rome, E = edinburgh, N = nizza, I = iris, O = orchid, BF = balloon-flower, S = sunflower, Z = zinnia, W = western, D = drama, H = horror, SCI = scientific, MA = martial-arts, F = funk, R&B = r&b, C = classical, CNTRY = country, BM = bluemaster, DH = dunhill, PM = pall-mall, P = prince, B = blend.

2. From rule 1, the person growing iris is going to rome, so I_R = True.
3. From rule 2, the person growing zinnia is a fan of r&b, so Z_R&B = True.
4. From rule 3, the person growing orchid is watching scientific movies, so O_SCI = True.
5. From rule 4, the person going to boston is on the left of the person going to edinburgh, so B < E.
6. From rule 5, the person going to boston is watching drama movies, so B_D = True.
7. From rule 6, the pall-mall smoker is a fan of reggae, so PM_R&B = True.
8. From rule 7, the person going to nizza is the dunhill smoker, so N_DH = True.
9. From rule 8, the person watching horror movies is in the middle, so there are 3 people on the left and 2 on the right. Let's denote the positions as follows: L1, L2, L3, M, R1, R2.
10. From rule 9, the person growing sunflower is on the far left, so S_L1 = True.
11. From rule 10, the blend smoker is on the left or right of the fan of funk, so either B_F or L1_F or R2_F.
12. From rule 11, the fan of country is on the left or right of the dunhill smoker, so either N_C or L1_C or R2_C.
13. From rule 12 and 13, since the blend smoker is on the left or right of the fan of funk, and the fan of country is on the left or right of the dunhill smoker, we can deduce that L1_F and L1_C are both true.
14. From rule 14, the person growing sunflower is on the left or right of the person traveling to liverpool, so either S_L1 or S_R1 and L_S.
15. From rule 15, the blend smoker is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies, so either B_MA or L1_MA or R2_MA.

Now we have some constraints:
- I_R, Z_R&B, O_SCI, B < E, B_D, PM_R&B, N_DH, S_L1, L1_F, L1_C, L_S, S_L1 or S_R1, B_MA or L1_MA or R2_MA

Let's assign the remaining variables:
- Since the person growing sunflower is on the left or right of the person traveling to liverpool, and the person growing sunflower is on the far left (S_L1), the person traveling to liverpool must be on the right of the person growing sunflower, so L_S and L < S.
- Since the person growing balloon-flower is the prince smoker (from rule 13), we can assign P_BF.
- Since the person watching horror movies is in the middle (M_H), we can assign the remaining positions as follows: L1, L2, L3, M, R1, R2.
- Since the blend smoker is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies, and the fan of country is on the left or right of the dunhill smoker, we can assign B_MA, L1_MA, and R2_C.
- Since the fan of funk is on the left or right of the blend smoker, and the fan of country is on the left or right of the dunhill smoker, we can assign L1_F, L2_C, and R2_F.
- Since the person watching western movies is the bluemaster smoker (from rule 12), we can assign W_BM.

Now we have the following assignments:
- L = liverpool, B = boston, R = rome, E = edinburgh, N = nizza
- I = iris, O = orchid, BF = balloon-flower, S = sunflower, Z = zinnia
- W = western, D = drama, H = horror, SCI = scientific, MA = martial-arts
- F = funk, R&B = r&b, C = classical, CNTRY = country
- BM = bluemaster, DH = dunhill, PM = pall-mall, P = prince, B = blend
- L1, L2, L3, M, R1, R2
- I_R, Z_R&B, O_SCI, B < E, B_D, PM_R&B, N_DH, S_L1, L1_F, L1_C, L_S, S_L1 or S_R1, L < S, P_BF, M_H, L1_MA, R2_C, L1_F, L2_C, R2_F, W_BM

Now we can fill in the table:

|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| City		| liverpool | boston | rome | edinburgh | nizza |
| Flower	|		|		|	iris |	orchid |	zinnia |

| Movie-Genre	|	western |	drama |	scientific |		|	martial-arts |
| Cigar		|	bluemaster |	pall-mall |		|		|	dunhill |
