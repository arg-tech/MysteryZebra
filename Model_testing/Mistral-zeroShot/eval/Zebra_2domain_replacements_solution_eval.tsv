Since we already know the cities, cigars, and the positions of red, yellow, blue, snails, the project-manager, the dancer, the social-worker, the dog owner, the fox owner, and the horse owner, the ivory-liker must be in the first column (I).

|   | L | N | M | Y | C |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Since we already know the cities, cigars, the positions of red, yellow, green, blue, snails, the project-manager, the dancer, the dog owner, the fox owner, the ivory-liker, and the horse owner, the social-worker must be in the fourth column (SW). This contradicts our previous assumption that the social-worker is in the fourth column.

Assuming the social-worker is in the fifth column instead:

|   | L | N | M | Y | C |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R | L | N | F | Y | PM |
| G | A | I | SW| H |   |
| I | S |   |   |   | SW|

| Cigar|   | chesterfield | K |   |   |
| Pet|         | snails      |            | ivory | dog |

Now, the table is consistent with all given clues.

|   | L | N | M | Y | C |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R | L | N | F | Y | PM |
| G | A | I | SW| H |   |

| Cigar|   | chesterfield | K |   |   |
| Pet|         | snails      |            | ivory | dog |

So, the final solution table is:

6. The old-gold-smoker (O) is the owner of the snails (S), so we can place O in the fifth row and S in the fourth column.

10. The chesterfields-smoker (Ch) is on the left or right of the owner of the fox (Fx), so we can place Ch in the first or second column. Since the kools-smoker (K) is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (H), we can't place Ch in the first column. So, we'll place Ch in the second column.

| Food | Pg | L | P | F | I |
|------|---|---|--|--|--|
| Color| R | G | Y | B | W |
| Sport| S | Ch | C | F |   |

11. The kools-smoker (K) is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (H), so we can place K in the third or fourth column. Since the chesterfields-smoker (Ch) is on the left or right of the owner of the fox (Fx), we can't place K in the fourth column. So, we'll place K in the fourth column.

| Food | Pg | L | P | F | I |

| Cigar (Parliaments)|   |   |   |   | Pa |

14. The person eating pomegranate (Pg) is to the left or right of the person who likes blue (Bl), so we can place Bl in the third column.

Zebra_domain_replacements_2	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Place the person eating cranberry (C) next to the person who likes red (R).
2. Place the person eating potato (P) next to the owner of the dog (D).
3. Place the person who's hobby is collecting (C) to the left of the person who likes green (G).
4. Place the person eating banana (B) to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games (BG).
5. Since G is to the right of Ivory (I), place I to the left of G.
6. Place the old-gold-smoker (OG) next to the owner of the snails (S).
7. Place the kools-smoker (K) next to the person who likes yellow (Y).
8. Place the person who's hobby is photography (Ph) in the middle.
9. Place the person eating tomato (T) on the far left.
10. Since the chesterfields-smoker (CF) is on the left or right of the owner of the fox (F), place either F to the left of CF or to the right of CF. Let's place F to the left of CF for now.
11. Since the kools-smoker (K) is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (H), place H to the right of K.
12. Place the lucky-strike-smoker (LS) next to the person who's hobby is skydiving (SD).
13. Place the person eating carrot (Ca) next to the parliaments-smoker (Pa).
14. Since the person eating tomato (T) is to the left or right of the person who likes blue (B), place T to the left of B.

Now we have the following arrangement:

|		| T	| B	| F	| G	| Ph	|
| Food	|	|	|	|	|	|
| Color	|	|	|	|	|	|
| Hobby	|	|	|	|	|	|
| Cigar	|	|	| CF	|	|	|
| Pet	| D	|	|	|	|	|

We know that the person eating cranberry (C) is to the right of the person who likes red (R). Since R is not placed yet, we can't determine the exact position of C and R.

We also know that the person eating banana (B) is to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games (BG). Since B is already placed, we can't determine the exact position of BG yet.

We can't determine the exact positions of the colors, hobbies, cigars, and pets yet.

Final solution table:

The exact positions of the colors, hobbies, cigars, and pets cannot be determined with the given information."	{}	False	0	False
