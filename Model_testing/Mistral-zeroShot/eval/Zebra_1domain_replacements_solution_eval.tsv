| S3 | S3 |   |   |   |   |
| S4 | S4 |   |   |   |   |
| S5 | S5 |   |   |   |   |

20. Now we can place the remaining colors:

   - C3 is ivory (since it's to the left of C2 and C4)
   - C4 is yellow (since T2 smokes kools and likes yellow)
   - C5 is blue (since N5 is the japanese and the japanese is the parliaments-smoker)

21. Now we can place the remaining pets:

   - P1 is a dog (since the spanish is the owner of the dog)
   - P2 is a fox (since the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox)
   - P3 is a horse (since the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse)
   - P4 is a zebra (since it's the only pet left)
   - P5 is snails (since the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails)

22. Now we have the final solution table:

|   | N1 | N2 | N3 | N4 | N5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 |   | N2 |   |   |   |
| C2 | N1 |   |   |   |   |

Zebra_domain_replacements_1	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people based on their birthdays and favorite colors. Since the birthday in April is on the far left, we can place it in the first column. Since the birthday in October is the person who likes red, we can place red in the first row and October in the first column.

| Birthday | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Color   | R |   |   |   |   |

Since the birthday in May is the owner of the dog, we can place the dog in the second row and May in the second column. Since the person drinking coffee is the person who likes green, we can place green in the second row and coffee in the third column. Since the person drinking tea is the one with a birthday in January, we can place tea in the third row and January in the third column.

| Birthday | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Color   | R |   | G | T |   |
| Pet     |   | D |   |   |   |
| Beverage|   |   | C | T |   |

Now we know that the person who likes ivory is to the right of the person who likes green. So, we can place ivory in the fourth row. Since the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails, we can place snails in the fourth column.

| Birthday | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Color   | R |   | G | T | I |
| Pet     |   | D |   |   | S |
| Beverage|   |   | C | T | M |
| Cigar   |   |   |   | O |   |

Since the kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow, we can place yellow in the fifth row and kools in the fifth column. Since the person drinking milk is in the middle, we can place milk in the third column.

| Birthday | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Color   | R |   | G | T | I |
| Pet     |   | D |   |   | S |
| Beverage|   |   | C | T | M |
| Cigar   |   |   |   | O | K |

Since the person who likes blue is to the left or right of the person with a birthday in April, we can place blue in the second or fourth column. Since the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox, we can place chesterfields in the second or fourth row. Since the lucky-strike-smoker is the person drinking orange-juice, we can place orange-juice in the second row and lucky-strike in the second column. Since the person who's birthday is in march is the parliaments-smoker, we can place parliaments in the fifth row and March in the fifth column.

Since the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse, we can place the horse in the third row. Since the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails, we can place the snails in the fourth column.

Now we have a full table:

| Birthday | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Color   | R | B | G | T | I |
| Pet     |   | H | D |   | S |
| Beverage|   | OJ | C | T | M |
| Cigar   |   | LS | CF | OG | K |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Birthday | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

| Color   | R | B | G | T | I |
| Pet     |   | H | D |   | S |

Zebra_domain_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Place the Norwegian on the far left (position 1) since they are not the English (1), Spanish (2), or Ukrainian (4). Since there are 5 nationalities, the person in position 5 must be Japanese.

2. The Norwegian does not like red (1), so the English must like red (position 2). Since the English is not the Ukrainian (4), the Ukrainian must be in position 4.

3. The Ukrainian drinks tea (4), so the person in position 3 must drink coffee (3). Since the coffee drinker is not the English (2), the coffee drinker must be the Spanish (3).

4. The Spanish watches romance movies (3), so the person in position 1 must watch animation movies (1). Since the animation watcher is not the English (2), the animation watcher must be the Japanese (5).

5. The English likes red (2), so the person to the right of the Norwegian (1) must like ivory (since the English is not the person who likes green, yellow, blue, or ivory themselves). Place the person who likes ivory in position 3.

6. The old-gold-smoker watches spy movies (6), so the person in position 1 cannot smoke old-gold. The person in position 5 cannot smoke old-gold either, since they are the Japanese and the Japanese smoke parliaments (13). The person in position 3 cannot smoke old-gold, since they like ivory and the only cigar smoked by an ivory-liker is olg-gold (3). The person in position 4 cannot smoke old-gold, since they drink tea and the only tea-drinker is the Ukrainian (4). So, the person in position 2 must smoke old-gold and watch mystery movies (2).

7. The kools-smoker likes yellow (7), so the person in position 1 cannot like yellow. The person in position 5 cannot like yellow either, since they are the Japanese and the Japanese smoke parliaments (13). The person in position 3 cannot like yellow, since they like ivory and the only cigar smoked by an ivory-liker is olg-gold (3). The person in position 4 cannot like yellow, since they drink tea and the only tea-drinker is the Ukrainian (4). So, the person in position 2 must like yellow and smoke kools (2).

8. The person in the middle (position 3) drinks milk (8).

9. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the animation watcher (1 or 5). Since the animation watcher is the Japanese (5), the chesterfields-smoker cannot be the Japanese (5). So, the chesterfields-smoker must be the person in position 1.

10. The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the horror movie watcher. Since the horror movie watcher is not the English (2), Spanish (3), or Japanese (5), they must be the Ukrainian (4). Since the Ukrainian is not the person in position 1 or 5, the kools-smoker must be in position 2.

11. The lucky-strike-smoker drinks orange-juice (12).

12. The japanese is the parliaments-smoker (13).

13. The norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes blue is not the English (2), Spanish (3), Ukrainian (4), or Japanese (5), they must be the person in position 1 or 3. However, the Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes blue must be the person in position 3. Since the person in position 3 cannot smoke parliaments (13), they cannot be the Japanese (5). So, the person who likes blue must be the Norwegian (1).

Now, let's put the final solution table:
