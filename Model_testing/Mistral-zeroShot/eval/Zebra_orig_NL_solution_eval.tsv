Zebra_orig_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Place the English (EN) who likes red (R) in the first row.
2. Place the Norwegian (NO) on the far left (1st column) since they are not to the right of the person who likes blue.
3. Since the Norwegian is in the middle (column 1), the person drinking milk (M) must be in the middle row (row 3).
4. The person who likes green (G) is to the right of the person who likes ivory (I). So, the person who likes ivory (I) must be in the first or second row, and the person who likes green (G) must be in the second or third row. Let's place the person who likes ivory (I) in the second row, so the person who likes green (G) is in the third row.
5. The kools-smoker (K) likes yellow (Y), so place K in the second column (column 2).
6. The old-gold-smoker (OG) has snails (S), so place OG in the fifth column (column 5) since there are no other pets listed yet.
7. The chesterfields-smoker (CF) is on the left or right of the owner of the fox (F). Since the Norwegian (NO) is in the first column, the fox (F) cannot be in the first or second column. So, place F in the third column (column 3). Since CF is to the left or right of F, CF can be in columns 2 or 4. However, CF cannot be in the same column as K (column 2) or OG (column 5), so place CF in column 4.
8. The lucky-strike-smoker (LS) drinks orange-juice (OJ), so place LS in the fourth row (row 4).
9. The japanese (J) smokes parliaments (P), so place J in the fifth row (row 5).
10. The Spanish (ES) owns a dog (D), so place ES in a column where there is no dog yet. Since NO, K, OG, CF, LS, and J are already placed, the only available column is column 1. However, ES cannot be in the same column as NO (column 1), so ES must be in column 2.
11. The kools-smoker (K) is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (H). Since K is in column 2, H cannot be in column 1 or 2. So, place H in column 3. Since K is to the left or right of H, K can be in columns 1 or 3. However, K cannot be in the same column as CF (column 4), so place K in column 1.
12. The ukranian (UK) drinks tea (T), so place UK in a column where there is no tea yet. Since NO, K, OG, CF, LS, ES, D, and H are already placed, the only available column is column 4.
13. Since the person who likes green (G) is to the right of the person who likes ivory (I), and G is in the third row, I must be in the second row.
14. Since the norwegian (NO) is not to the right of the person who likes blue (B), and NO is in the first column, B must be in the second column.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:
