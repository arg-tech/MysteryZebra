Einstein_orig_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. The Norwegian lives in the first house (9), and the Brit lives in a Red house (1). Since they are not the same person, the Red house cannot be the first house. So, the Norwegian lives in the fifth house, and the Brit lives in the second house.

2. The Swede keeps Dogs (2), so the Dog owner cannot live in the first, second, or fifth house because the Norwegian, Brit, and Swede are already placed. The only remaining house for the Swede is the third house.

3. The Dane drinks Tea (3), so the Tea drinker cannot live in the first, second, or fifth house. The only remaining houses for the Dane are the third and fourth houses. Since the Dane cannot live next to the Swede (they keep the same pet), the Dane lives in the fourth house, and the third house is the Green house (5).

4. The Green house owner drinks Coffee (5), so the Coffee drinker cannot live in the first, second, or fifth house. The only remaining houses for the Green house owner are the third and fourth houses, but we already placed the Dane in the fourth house. So, the Green house owner lives in the third house.

5. The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds (6), so the Bird owner cannot live in the first, second, or fifth house. The only remaining houses for the Pall Mall smoker are the third and fourth houses, but we already placed the Green house owner and the Dane in those houses. Since the Pall Mall smoker cannot live next to the Blend smoker (they smoke the same brand), the Pall Mall smoker lives in the fifth house.

6. The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill (7), so the Dunhill smoker cannot live in the first, second, or fifth house. The only remaining house for the Yellow house owner is the fourth house, but we already placed the Dane in the fourth house. Since the Yellow house owner cannot live next to the Blend smoker, the Yellow house owner lives in the third house.

7. The owner living in the center house drinks Milk (8), so the Milk drinker cannot live in the first, second, or fifth house. The only remaining house for the Milk drinker is the fourth house, but we already placed the Dane in the fourth house. Since the Milk drinker cannot live next to the Blend smoker, the Milk drinker lives in the second house.

8. The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house (14), so the Blue house is either the second or the third house. Since the Norwegian lives in the fifth house, the Blue house cannot be the fifth house. Therefore, the Blue house is the second house, and the Norwegian lives in the first house.

9. The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats (10). The only remaining houses for the Blend smoker are the second and fourth houses, but we already placed the Dane in the fourth house. So, the Blend smoker lives in the second house, and the Cat owner lives in the third house.

10. The owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill (11). The only remaining houses for the Horse owner are the first and fifth houses. Since the Norwegian lives in the fifth house, the Horse owner lives in the first house.

11. The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer (12), so the Beer drinker cannot live in the first, second, or fifth house. The only remaining houses for the Beer drinker are the third and fourth houses, but we already placed the Green house owner and the Dane in those houses. Since the Beer drinker cannot live next to the Blend smoker, the Beer drinker lives in the first house.

12. The German smokes Prince (13), so the Prince smoker cannot live in the first, second, or fifth house. The only remaining houses for the German are the third and fourth houses, but we already placed the Green house owner and the Dane in those houses. Since the German cannot live next to the Blend smoker, the German lives in the fifth house.
