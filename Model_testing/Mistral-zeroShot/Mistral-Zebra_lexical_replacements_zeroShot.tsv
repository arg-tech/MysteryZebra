Zebra_lexical_replacements_0	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Let's assign variables to each nationality, color, beverage, cigar, and pet. For example, we can use M for Malaysian, I for Italian, D for Dutch, G for German, and Mx for Mexican. Similarly, we can use C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 for cigars, B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 for beverages, and P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 for pets.

2. From the given clues, we can start filling in the table:

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O |   |   |   |   |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | C2 | C3 |   |   |
| Pet         |   | P2 |   |   |   |

3. From clue 1, we know that M (Malaysian) likes orange (O). So, we can fill in the first row:

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O |   |   |   |   |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | C2 | C3 |   |   |
| Pet         |   | P2 |   |   |   |
|            | O |   |   |   |   |

4. From clue 2, we know that I (Italian) owns the goldfish (P2). So, we can fill in the second row:

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O |   |   |   |   |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | C2 | C3 |   |   |
| Pet         |   | G |   |   |   |
|            | O | G |   |   |   |

5. From clue 3, we know that the person drinking cola (B3) likes black. Since the person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine, and the Malaysian (M) already has a color, the only possible position for black is the fourth column. So, we can fill in the third row:

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O |   | B3 |   |   |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | C2 | C3 |   |   |
| Pet         |   | G |   |   |   |
|            | O | G | B3 |   |   |

6. From clue 4, we know that D (Dutch) drinks almond-lemonade (B4). Since the Dutch cannot be in the first column (clue 9), they must be in the fifth column. So, we can fill in the fourth row:

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O |   | B3 | B4 |   |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | C2 | C3 |   |   |
| Pet         |   | G |   |   |   |
|            | O | G | B3 | B4 |   |

7. From clue 5, we know that the person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine. Since the only person with a color in the fourth column is the Dutch (D), the person who likes aquamarine must be in the third column. So, we can fill in the third row with the color aquamarine (A) for the German (G):

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O |   | B3 | A |   |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | C2 | C3 |   |   |
| Pet         |   | G |   |   |   |
|            | O | G | B3 | A |   |

8. From clue 6, we know that the Fonseca-smoker (C1) owns the bird (P5). Since the Fonseca-smoker cannot be in the first column (clue 9), they must be in the fifth column. So, we can fill in the fifth row:

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O |   | B3 | A | C1 |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | C2 | C3 |   | C5 |
| Pet         |   | G |   |   | P5 |
|            | O | G | B3 | A | C1 |

9. From clue 7, we know that the Havana-smoker (C2) likes chestnut (C). Since the Havana-smoker cannot be in the first column (clue 9), they must be in the second column. So, we can fill in the second row:

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O | C | B3 | A | C1 |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | H | C3 |   | C5 |
| Pet         |   | G |   |   | P5 |
|            | O | C | B3 | A | C1 |

10. From clue 8, we know that the person drinking lemonade (B2) is in the middle. Since the only available position for lemonade is the third column, and the German (G) already has a color, the person drinking lemonade must be the Italian (I). So, we can fill in the second row with lemonade (L):

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O | L | B3 | A | C1 |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | H | C3 |   | C5 |
| Pet         |   | G |   |   | P5 |
|            | O | L | B3 | A | C1 |

11. From clue 10, we know that the coralmaster-smoker (C3) is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard (P3). Since the only available positions for the lizard are the first and fourth columns, and the Malaysian (M) and the Dutch (D) already have pets, the lizard must be owned by the German (G). So, we can fill in the fourth row with the lizard (Lz):

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O | L | B3 | Lz | C1 |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | H | C3 |   | C5 |
| Pet         |   | G |   | Lz | P5 |
|            | O | L | B3 | Lz | C1 |

12. From clue 11, we know that the Havana-smoker (C2) is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse (P4). Since the only available positions for the mouse are the second and fifth columns, and the Italian (I) already has a pet, the mouse must be owned by the Dutch (D). So, we can fill in the fourth row with the mouse (M):

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O | L | B3 | Lz | C1 |
| Beverage    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cigar       |   | H | C2 |   | C5 |
| Pet         |   | G | M | Lz | P5 |
|            | O | L | B3 | Lz | C1 |

13. From clue 12, we know that the baccarat-smoker (C4) drinks iced-tea (B5). So, we can fill in the fifth row:

|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O | L | B3 | Lz | C1 |
| Beverage    |   |   | B4 | B5 |   |
| Cigar       |   | H | C2 |   | C5 |
| Pet         |   | G | M | Lz | P5 |
|            | O | L | B3 | Lz | C1 |

14. From clue 13, we know that the mexican (Mx) is the tiparillo-smoker (C5). So, we can fill in the fifth row with tiparillo (T):

| Nationality | M | I | D | G | Mx |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| Color       | O | L | B3 | Lz | T |
| Beverage    |   |   | B4 | B5 |   |
| Cigar       |   | H | C2 |   | C5 |
| Pet         |   | G | M | Lz | P5 |
|            | O | L | B3 | Lz | T |

Now we have the final solution table:

#############

Zebra_lexical_replacements_1	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Place the Colombian in the first row, first column (1,1) as they like light-chestnut.
2. Place the Brazilian in the fifth row, fifth column (5,5) as they own the goldfish.
3. Since the cola drinker likes lilac, place the cola drinker in the second column (2,*) and the lilac person in the third column (3,*). Since the lilac person is to the right of the fuchsia person, place the fuchsia person in the fourth column (4,*).
4. Since the argentine drinks juice, place the argentine in the fourth row, second column (4,2).
5. Since the soy-milk drinker is in the middle, place the soy-milk drinker in the third row, third column (3,3).
6. Since the german is on the far left, place the german in the first row, second column (1,2).
7. Since the chestnut person is to the right of the fuchsia person, place the chestnut person in the fifth column (5,*). Since the german is to the left or right of the chestnut person, place the chestnut person in the sixth column (6,*).
8. Since the aristoff-smoker owns the mouse, place the mouse owner in the fifth row, fourth column (5,4) and the aristoff-smoker in the row above (4,3).
9. Since the oliveros-smoker likes coral, place the coral person in the second column (2,*) and the oliveros-smoker in the row above (1,1).
10. Since the person drinking fanta is the swisher-smoker, place the swisher-smoker in the third row, first column (3,1) and the fanta drinker in the third row, first column (3,1).

12. Since the dunhill-smoker is on the left or right of the cat owner, place the cat owner in the second row, fourth column (2,4) and the dunhill-smoker in the row above (1,3) or the row below (3,4).
13. Since the nigerian is the tiparillo-smoker, place the tiparillo-smoker in the fifth row, sixth column (5,6).
14. Since the german is to the left or right of the chestnut person, the german cannot be in the first or sixth column. So, the german must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth row. Since the german is not in the second row (already occupied by the lilac person), the german must be in the third, fourth, or fifth row. Since the german is not in the fifth row (already occupied by the Brazilian), the german must be in the fourth row. So, the german is in the fourth row, second column (4,2).

Zebra_lexical_replacements_2	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Place the Dutch on the far left (Nationality column, row 1). Since the Dutch is not the owner of any pet, we can't determine their color yet.

2. Place the Canadian on the second column (Nationality column, row 2) and assign them the rabbit (Pet column, row 5). Since the Canadian is not the owner of any cigar, we can't determine their color yet. The color of the Canadian's favorite beverage is Soy-Milk (Beverage column, row 3).

3. Place the Nigerian on the third column (Nationality column, row 1) and assign them Ebony (Color column, row 1). Since the Nigerian is not the owner of any pet, cigar, or drinks any beverage yet, we can't determine their favorite beverage.

4. Place the Brazilian on the fourth column (Nationality column, row 3) and assign them Hot-Chocolate (Beverage column, row 4). Since the Brazilian is not the owner of any pet, cigar, or has a specific color yet, we can't determine their color.

5. Place the Pakistani on the fifth column (Nationality column, row 5) and assign them the Game cigar (Cigar column, row 5). Since the Pakistani is not the owner of any pet, we can't determine their color yet.

6. Since the person drinking almond-soy-milk is the person who likes lilac (Beverage column, row 3 and Color column, row 2), we can place the person who likes lilac to the right of the person who likes blood-red (Color column, row 2). This means the Canadian cannot be the person who likes lilac, so the Nigerian must be the person who likes lilac.

7. The Swisher-smoker is the owner of the chinchilla (Cigar column, row 2 and Pet column, row 5). Since the Dutch is not the owner of any pet, the Swisher-smoker cannot be the Dutch. The only available spot for the Swisher-smoker is the second row (Cigar column, row 2), so the Canadian must be the Swisher-smoker.

8. The Montecristo-smoker is the person who likes amber (Cigar column, row 1 and Color column, row 3). Since the Dutch is not the Montecristo-smoker, the only available spot for the Montecristo-smoker is the fourth column (Cigar column, row 1). This means the Brazilian is the Montecristo-smoker.

9. The person drinking soy-milk is in the middle (Beverage column, row 3). Since the Canadian and the Brazilian are already placed, the only available spot for the person drinking soy-milk is the third column (Beverage column, row 3). This means the Nigerian is drinking soy-milk.

10. The Dannemann-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the pony (Cigar column, row 3 and Pet column, row 1). Since the Dutch is not the Dannemann-smoker, the only available spots for the Dannemann-smoker are the first and fifth columns (Cigar column, row 3). The Dannemann-smoker cannot be on the far left (Dutch is on the far left), so the Dannemann-smoker is on the fifth column (Cigar column, row 3). This means the Pakistani is the Dannemann-smoker.

11. The Montecristo-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster (Cigar column, row 1 and Pet column, row 4). Since the Brazilian is the Montecristo-smoker, the only available spots for the owner of the hamster are the second and fourth columns (Pet column, row 4). The owner of the hamster cannot be the Canadian (already placed), so the owner of the hamster is on the fourth column (Pet column, row 4). This means the Brazilian is to the left of the owner of the hamster.

12. The Tiparillo-smoker is the person drinking fanta (Cigar column, row 4 and Beverage column, row 5). Since the Pakistani is the Dannemann-smoker and the Dutch is not the Tiparillo-smoker, the only available spot for the Tiparillo-smoker is the first column (Cigar column, row 4). This means the Nigerian is the Tiparillo-smoker.

13. The only available spot for the owner of the pony is the second column (Pet column, row 1). Since the Canadian is not the owner of the pony, the owner of the pony must be the Brazilian.

14. The only available spot for the owner of the hamster is the fourth column (Pet column, row 4). Since the Brazilian is already the owner of the pony, the owner of the hamster must be the Dutch.

15. The only available spot for the person who likes white is the fifth column (Color column, row 5). Since the Pakistani is the Dannemann-smoker and the Dutch is the owner of the hamster, the only available spot for the person who likes white is the fifth column (Color column, row 5). This means the Pakistani likes white.
