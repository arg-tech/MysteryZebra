Lv7-2x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the position of the person watching adventure movies is odd and it's the 4th column, the adventure movies must be in column 1, 3, or 5. However, since the adventure movies are to the left or right of the project-manager (who has a job that must be in an even position), the adventure movies can only be in columns 3 or 5. Let's assume it's in column 3 for now.

2. The person watching action movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the security-guard. Since the scientific movies are not in the first column (as the engineer is on the far left or far right), the scientific movies must be in column 2 or 4. If they are in column 2, the action movies would be in column 1, which contradicts the fact that the adventure movies are in column 3. So, the scientific movies must be in column 4. This means the action movies are in column 5, and the security-guard is in column 2.

3. The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the project-manager. Since the project-manager is in an even position (between the scientific movies and the security-guard), the project-manager must be in column 2. This means the adventure movies are in column 1, and the person watching adventure movies is a freelancer.

4. The engineer is on the far left or far right. Since the adventure movies are in column 1 and the project-manager is in column 2, the engineer must be in column 5.

5. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the documentary movies are to the right of the action movies (column 5), the family movies must be in column 1, 2, or 3. If they are in column 1, the documentary movies would be in column 5, which contradicts the fact that the action movies are in column 5. So, the family movies must be in column 2.

6. The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies. Since the action movies are in column 5, the documentary movies must be in column 4.

7. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the security-guard. Since the security-guard is in column 2, the family movies must be in column 3 or 5. However, if they are in column 5, the documentary movies would be in column 1, which contradicts the fact that the documentary movies are to the right of the action movies. So, the family movies must be in column 3.

8. The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies. This is already satisfied as the documentary movies are in column 4 and the action movies are in column 5.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-2x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating nectarine is to the left of the person eating plum, we can place nectarine in the first or second column and plum in the fourth or fifth column. Let's place nectarine in the first column and plum in the fifth column for now.

2. The person eating radish is between the person eating eggplant and the person driving the train. Since the train is on the right of the subway (point 3), the train must be in the third column. So, the person driving the train is in the third row. This means the person driving the subway is in the second row. Now, we know that the person driving the train is to the right of the subway, so the subway is in the first or second column. Let's place it in the first column for now. This means the person driving the train is in the third row and the person driving the subway is in the second row.

3. The person driving the trike is on the far right, so it must be in the fifth column and in the fourth row (since the first row is already occupied by the person driving the jet-ski).

4. The person eating eggplant is to the left of the person eating radish. Since radish is in the third column, eggplant must be in the second column.

5. The person driving the jet-ski is on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already occupied by the person eating blueberry (point 8), the jet-ski must be in the fifth column.

6. Now, we have the following arrangement:

   | Food        | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
   |------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Food       | Blueberry | Eggplant | Train | Subway | Radish | Nectarine | Plum |
   | Transport  | Jet-ski | Roller | Subway | Train | Trike | - | - |

7. The person eating radish is between the person eating plum and the person driving the roller. Since plum is in the fifth column and the trike is in the fifth column, the roller must be in the fourth column.

8. Now, we have the final solution:

   | Food        | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
   |------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Food       | Blueberry | Eggplant | Train | Subway | Radish | Nectarine | Plum |
   | Transport  | Jet-ski | Roller | Subway | Train | Trike | - | - |

   So, the final solution is:

Lv7-2x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 5, the person eating avocado can be only in the first or the fifth column. Let's try both possibilities.

   Case 1: Avocado in the first column:
   | Food    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5  |
   | Nationality |   |   |   |   |   |
   - The Pakistani cannot be in the first column because the person eating avocado is on the far left (rule 5). So, the Pakistani must be in the second column.
   - The British cannot be in the second column because the Pakistani is to the left of the British (rule 3). So, the British must be in the third column.
   - The Japanese cannot be in the third column because the British is between the Japanese and the Pakistani (rule 3). So, the Japanese must be in the first column.
   - The Malaysian cannot be in the first or second column because the Malaysian is to the left or right of the person eating pineapple (rule 6). So, the Malaysian must be in the fourth column.
   - The person eating lettuce must be in the third column because it is to the left of the Pakistani (rule 4) and to the left of the Malaysian (rule 5).
   - The person eating pineapple can be in any of the remaining columns (second or fifth). Let's try both possibilities.
      - If pineapple is in the second column, the person eating pumpkin must be in the fifth column.
      - If pineapple is in the fifth column, the person eating pumpkin must be in the second column.

   Case 2: Avocado in the fifth column:
   | Food    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5  |
   | Nationality |   |   |   |   |   |
   - The reasoning for the first four nationalities is the same as in Case 1.
   - The person eating lettuce must be in the fourth column because it is to the left of the Pakistani (rule 4) and to the left of the Malaysian (rule 5).
   - The person eating pineapple can be in any of the remaining columns (second or fifth). Let's try both possibilities.
      - If pineapple is in the second column, the person eating pumpkin must be in the fifth column.
      - If pineapple is in the fifth column, the person eating pumpkin must be in the second column.

   Both cases lead to the same final arrangement, so we can choose either one. Let's choose Case 1 for simplicity:

   | Food    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5  |
   | Nationality | Japanese | British | Lettuce | Pakistani | Malaysian |
   | Food    | Avocado | Pineapple |  | Pumpkin |  |

   However, we don't know the exact position of the last two foods (pineapple and pumpkin). Since we have two possibilities, we can't determine the exact position of these two foods without more information.

   Final answer:
   ```
  #############
   | Food    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5  |
   | Nationality | Japanese | British | Lettuce | Pakistani | Malaysian |

Lv7-2x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the roller driver is between the Spanish and the Japanese, and there are no empty spaces, the roller driver must be either Spanish or Japanese. Let's assume the roller driver is Japanese (J).

2. The Egyptian (E) is on the far right, so we can place it in the last column.

3. The helicopter (H) is between the Egyptian and the Japanese, so it must be in the second-to-last column.

4. The tram (T) is on the far left, so it must be in the first column.

5. The Canadian (C) is on the left of the Japanese, so it must be in the second column.

6. The person driving the bike (B) is on the far left or far right. Since the tram is already on the far left, the bike must be on the far right.

7. The Spanish (S) is on the left or right of the person driving the bike. Since the bike is on the far right, the Spanish must be in the third column.

Now, let's place the remaining transport in the correct nationality:

- The person driving the taxi (X) can be any nationality, but since there are no empty spaces, it must be in the fourth column.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-2x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the owner of the hamster. Let's place the mystery person and hamster owner in the first two spots. We'll place the mystery person in the first spot (M1) and the hamster owner in the second spot (H2).

2. The owner of the bird is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Since the mystery person is already on the left, the bird owner must be on the right of the action person (A3).

3. The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person watching action movies. So, the zombie person (Z4) must be on the left of A3.

4. The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since we've already placed M1 and A3, A3 must be in the third spot, and M1 in the first spot.

5. The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies. Since we've placed M1, A3, and Z4, the scientific person (S) must be in the second spot, and the animation person (An) in the fourth spot.

6. The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since B3 is already placed, L can be either B2 or B4. However, since the owner of the rabbit is somewhere between the action person and the bird owner (A3 and B3), L cannot be B4. So, L is B2.

7. The owner of the bird is somewhere between the person watching action movies and the owner of the rabbit. Since A3 is the action person and L2 is the bird owner, the rabbit owner (R) must be between A3 and L2, so R is in the third spot.

8. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person watching animation movies. Since An is in the fourth spot, H must be in the first spot.

9. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since S is in the second spot, An must be in the fourth spot.

Now, let's put the pets and movies in the final table:

M1: Mystery, H1: Hamster, Z4: Zombie, A3: Action, S2: Scientific, An4: Animation, L2: Lizard, R3: Rabbit, B2: Bird

Lv7-2x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person watching superhero movies is somewhere between the owner of the dog and the person watching martial-arts movies. Let's place the superhero movies person in position 3 (to the right of the dog owner and to the left of the martial-arts movies person).

2. From point 2, the owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog. Since the superhero movies person is already in position 3 (which is to the right of the dog owner), the hamster owner must be in position 4.

3. From point 3, the owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the superhero movies person is in position 3 and the hamster owner in position 4, the satire movies person must be in position 1 or 2. If the satire movies person is in position 1, the rabbit owner would have to be in position 5, which contradicts point 7 (the rabbit owner is on the left or right of the martial-arts movies person, but the martial-arts movies person is not yet placed). So, the satire movies person is in position 2. Therefore, the rabbit owner is in position 3.

4. From point 4, the person watching adventure movies is somewhere between the owner of the rabbit and the person watching zombie movies. Since the rabbit owner is in position 3 and the martial-arts movies person is in position 1 (as we will place him soon), the adventure movies person must be in position 4.

5. From point 5, the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the hamster. Since the hamster owner is in position 4, the goldfish owner must be in position 2.

6. From point 6, the person watching satire movies is somewhere between the owner of the goldfish and the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the goldfish owner is in position 2 and the satire movies person is in position 2, the martial-arts movies person must be in position 1.

7. From point 7, the owner of the rabbit is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the martial-arts movies person is in position 1 and the rabbit owner is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

8. From point 8, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies. Since the martial-arts movies person is in position 1 and the superhero movies person is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

9. From point 9, the person watching satire movies is in an odd position. Since the satire movies person is in position 2, this condition is satisfied.

2. Let's assume the positions are numbered from left to right (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The person drinking mirinda is on the far left (3). So, mirinda is in position 1.

3. The owner of the frog is the person drinking hot-chocolate (6). So, hot-chocolate is in position 2.

4. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person drinking juice (4). The owner of the frog is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog (8). So, the owner of the hedgehog is in position 3.

5. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the owner of the rabbit (2). Since the owner of the frog is in position 2 and the owner of the rabbit is the person drinking juice (7), almond-milk is in position 4.

6. The owner of the rabbit is the person drinking juice (7). So, juice is in position 5.

7. The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the cat (5). The owner of the frog is in position 2, the owner of the hedgehog is in position 3, and the owner of the rabbit is in position 5. So, the owner of the dog must be in position 1 or 4. But the person drinking mirinda is in position 1 (3), so the owner of the dog is in position 4.

8. The person drinking water is left out. Since the positions are odd for the owner of the dog (4), the owner of the cat must be in position 3. So, water is in position 2.

Lv7-2x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is chess is on the far right, so we can place it in the last column (column 5).

2. The person eating tomato is between the person eating strawberry and the person who's hobby is hiking. Since we know the hobby of the person eating tomato's right neighbor (chess), we can place the hobby of the person eating tomato in the second column from the right (column 4). Now, we can place the hobby of the person who's hobby is hiking in the third column (column 3). Since the person eating tomato is not the person who's hobby is hiking, the person eating tomato must be in column 4. So, we can place the tomato in the first row (row 1).

3. The person eating garlic is not the person who's hobby is hiking, so it can't be in columns 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, it must be in columns 1, 2, or 6. Since the person eating strawberry is to the right of the person eating garlic, garlic can't be in column 1. Also, since the person who's hobby is puzzles is to the left of the person eating onion, garlic can't be in column 6. So, garlic must be in column 2.

4. The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since we placed hiking in column 3, collecting can be in columns 4 or 5. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is to the left of the person eating onion, collecting can't be in column 5. So, collecting must be in column 4.

5. The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we placed puzzles in the fifth column, strawberry can be in columns 4, 5, or 6. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person eating tomato, and we placed tomato in the first row, strawberry can't be in the first row. Also, since the person who's hobby is hiking is to the right of the person eating radish, and we placed hiking in the third column, strawberry can't be in columns 3, 4, or 5. So, strawberry must be in the sixth column.

6. The person who's hobby is reading can be in any column except the far right (column 5) because the person who's hobby is chess is in that column. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is to the left of the person eating onion, and we placed puzzles in the fifth column, reading can't be in the fifth column. So, reading can be in columns 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking, and we placed hiking in the third column, reading can't be in the third column. Since the person eating strawberry is between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is chess, reading can't be in the sixth column. So, reading must be in the first or second column.

7. The person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish. Since we placed radish in the second column, hiking can be in columns 3, 4, or 5. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking, and we placed collecting in the fourth column, hiking can't be in the fourth column. So, hiking must be in the third column.

8. The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion. Since we placed onion in the fifth column, puzzles can be in columns 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking, and we placed hiking in the third column, puzzles can't be in the third column. Since the person eating strawberry is between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is chess, and we placed strawberry in the sixth column, puzzles can't be in the sixth column. So, puzzles must be in the first, second, or fourth column. Since the person who's hobby is reading is to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles, and we placed reading in the first or second column, puzzles must be in the fourth column.

9. Now, we know the hobbies and the food for all the people except the person in the first row and the second column. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is to the left of the person eating onion, and we placed puzzles in the fourth column, the person eating onion must be in the second row. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is to the right of the person eating radish, and we placed hiking in the third column, the person eating radish must be in the first row. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person eating tomato, and we placed collecting in the fourth column, the person eating tomato must be in the third row. Since the person eating strawberry is between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is chess, and we placed strawberry in the sixth column, the person who's hobby is reading must be in the first row.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-2x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is badminton is the person who's sport is badminton, we know that the first row must contain 'badminton'. However, we don't know the beverage yet. Let's mark it as 'B' for now.

2. The person drinking almond-milk is not the person who's sport is water-polo, so the person in the second row cannot be 'water-polo' and cannot drink 'almond-milk'. Let's mark the second row as 'X' for now.

3. The person who's sport is tennis is on the far left or far right. Since the first row is already occupied, the third row must contain 'tennis'. Let's mark it as 'T'. The beverage for the third row is still unknown, so let's mark it as '?' for now.

4. The person who's sport is badminton is the person drinking 7up. Since we already know the first row contains 'badminton', the fifth row must contain '7up'. Let's mark it as '7'.

5. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we don't know the position of the person drinking iced-tea yet, we can't determine the position of the person playing water-polo. Let's mark the fourth row as 'WP' for now.

6. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we don't know the position of the person drinking almond-milk yet, we can't determine the position of the person playing lacrosse. Let's mark the second row as 'L' for now.

7. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since we know the fifth row contains '7up' and the third row contains 'T', the fourth row must contain 'soy-milk'. Let's mark it as 'SM'.

8. The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking coffee. Since we know the fourth row contains 'soy-milk' and the sixth row cannot contain 'coffee' (as the person playing baseball is not the person drinking coffee), the sixth row must contain 'L'. Let's mark it as 'L'.

9. The person who's sport is baseball is not the person drinking coffee. Since we know the sixth row contains 'L' (lacrosse), the first row cannot contain 'baseball'.

10. The person drinking soy-milk is the person who's sport is tennis. Since we know the third row contains 'T', the fifth row must contain 'soy-milk'. However, we already know this, so no new information here.

Now we have the following table:

|            |    1     |      2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage   | '7up'    | '?'         | '?'      | 'soy-milk' | '?'       |
| Sport      | 'badminton' | 'L' | 'tennis' | 'lacrosse' | 'water-polo' |

We still don't know the beverages for the second and sixth rows, and the position of the person playing water-polo.

Let's try to solve the remaining positions based on the information we have:

- The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse, so the second row cannot contain 'water-polo' (as it would be on the left of 'L'). Since the second row cannot contain 'almond-milk' either (as it's not the person who's sport is water-polo), the second row must contain 'coffee'. Let's mark it as 'C'.

- The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we know the fourth row contains 'soy-milk' and the fifth row contains '7up', the first row must contain 'water-polo'. Let's mark it as 'WP'.

- The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person playing water-polo. Since we know the first row contains 'WP' and the fifth row contains '7up', the third row must contain 'iced-tea'. Let's mark it as 'IT'.

Now we have the following table:

|            |    1     |      2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage   | '7up'    | 'coffee'    | 'iced-tea'| 'soy-milk' | '?'       |
| Sport      | 'water-polo' | 'L' | 'tennis' | 'lacrosse' | 'badminton' |

We still don't know the beverage for the sixth row. However, since the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk, and the fifth row contains '7up' and 'soy-milk', the sixth row must contain 'almond-milk'. Let's mark it as 'AM'.

Finally, we have the following table:

|            |    1     |      2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage   | '7up'    | 'coffee'    | 'iced-tea'| 'soy-milk' | 'almond-milk' |
| Sport      | 'water-polo' | 'L' | 'tennis' | 'lacrosse' | 'badminton' |

This table satisfies all the given conditions, so the final solution is:

#############
| Beverage   | '7up'    | 'coffee'    | 'iced-tea' | 'soy-milk' | 'almond-milk' |
| Sport      | 'water-polo' | 'L' | 'tennis' | 'lacrosse' | 'badminton' |
