Lv7-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching fantasy movies is not the leftmost person, and the person who surfs is not the rightmost person. So, the person watching fantasy movies cannot be in the first or third column.

2. The person who plays basketball is in the middle, so it must be in the second column.

3. The person who plays basketball is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since the person watching fantasy movies is not in the first or third column, the person driving the boat must be in the first column. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
   | Hobby         | fishing     | basketball   | photography|
   | Movie-Genre   |             |              |          |
   | Sport         | boat       |              |          |
   | Transport     |             |              |          |

4. The person driving the helicopter is between the person who cycles and the person watching thriller movies. Since the person watching fantasy movies is not the leftmost person, the person watching thriller movies must be in the third column. So, the person cycling must be in the second column. The person driving the helicopter can only be in the first column, as the person watching thriller movies is in the third column. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
   | Hobby         | fishing     | cycling     | photography|
   | Movie-Genre   |             |              | thriller  |
   | Sport         | boat       | basketball   | helicopter|
   | Transport     | van        |              |           |

5. The person watching disaster movies is between the person who fishes and the person who takes photographs. So, the person taking photographs must be in the third column, and the person watching disaster movies must be in the second column. The person who fishes must be in the first column. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
   | Hobby         | fishing     | disaster     | photography|
   | Movie-Genre   |             |              | thriller  |
   | Sport         | boat       | basketball   | helicopter|
   | Transport     | van        |              |           |

6. The person watching magic-tricks is not the person who fishes, so it must be in the second or third column. Since the person watching disaster movies is in the second column, the person watching magic-tricks must be in the third column. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
   | Hobby         | fishing     | disaster     | magic-tricks|
   | Movie-Genre   |             |              | thriller  |
   | Sport         | boat       | basketball   | helicopter|
   | Transport     | van        |              |           |

7. The person taking photographs is not the person who does magic-tricks, so it must be in the first or second column. Since the person watching disaster movies is in the second column, the person taking photographs must be in the first column. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
   | Hobby         | fishing     | disaster     | magic-tricks|

   | Transport     |             |              |           |

8. The only remaining hobby for the person in the second column is photography. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |      1      |      2       |    3     |

   | Transport     |             |              |           |

9. The only remaining movie genre for the person in the first column is disaster. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |      1      |      2       |    3     |

   | Transport     | van        |              |           |

10. The only remaining sport for the person in the third column is cycling. So, the table looks like this:

Lv7-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 3 different movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and sports. So, each row and each column should have unique values.

2. Let's start with the Movie-Genre row. We know that there are 3 different genres: horror, mystery, and western. Let's assign them to the columns from left to right (1, 2, 3).

3. Now, let's assign the Music-Genre row. We know that the fan of hip-hop is watching horror movies, so hip-hop must be in column 1. The fan of techno is in the middle, so techno must be in column 2. The remaining genre, funk, must be in column 3.

4. Now, let's assign the Pet row. We know that the owner of the cat is somewhere between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's sport is tennis. Since we don't know the exact positions of golf and tennis yet, we can't assign the cat yet. The owner of the hamster is the person watching western movies, so hamster goes in column 3. The owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is golf, so we'll place the ferret in the same column as golf when we assign sports.

5. Now, let's assign the Sport row. We know that the person watching western movies is the owner of the hamster, so western movies can't be in the third column (since hamster is there). So, western movies must be in the second column, and mystery movies must be in the first column. This means that horror movies are in the third column. Now, we know that the person watching horror movies is the fan of hip-hop, so hip-hop is in the first column.

6. The person watching western movies is to the right of the person watching horror movies, so golf (since it's to the right of mystery in the Sport row) must be in the third column. Tennis must be in the second column. This means that golf is in the same column as the ferret (since the owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is golf).

7. The fan of techno is in the middle, so techno is in the second column.

8. Now, we can assign the pets. The owner of the cat is somewhere between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's sport is tennis. Since we know that the cat is not in the third column (since it's the column of the hamster and the western movies), the cat must be in the first column.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Movie-Genre   | horror  |   mystery | western  |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop |   techno  |   funk   |
| Pet           |   cat   |   ferret  |   hamster|
| Sport         |   golf  |   tennis  |   badminton|

Lv7-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different items for each category (beverage, hobby, job, movie-genre). Let's label them A, B, C for each category.

2. From point 1, we know that the hobby of collecting is watching mystery movies, so we can place 'collecting' in the 'Movie-Genre' column and 'mystery' in the 'Hobby' column. Let's place 'collecting' in the first row and 'mystery' in the first column of the 'Movie-Genre' and 'Hobby' respectively.

3. From point 2, the manager is to the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since we have placed 'mystery' in the first row, we can't place 'manager' in the first row. So, let's place 'manager' in the second row. Since the manager is to the left of the person watching adventure movies, the person watching adventure movies must be in the third row. So, let's place 'adventure' in the third row of the 'Movie-Genre' column.

4. From point 3, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the teacher. Since we have placed 'manager' in the second row and 'adventure' in the third row, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in the first row. So, let's place 'rock-climbing' in the first row of the 'Hobby' column. Since the teacher is not the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (point 4), the teacher must be in the second or third row.

5. From point 5, the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the manager. Since we have placed 'manager' in the second row and 'adventure' in the third row, the 'manager' must be in the first row and the 'adventure' must be in the second row. So, let's swap 'manager' and 'adventure' in the second row.

6. From point 6, the person drinking iced-tea is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person drinking almond-milk. Since we have placed 'rock-climbing' in the first row and 'almond-milk' is yet to be placed, the person drinking iced-tea must be in the second row. Since it's between 'rock-climbing' and 'almond-milk', it can't be in the first column (as 'rock-climbing' is in the first column). So, it must be in the second or third column. But since the manager is in the first column and the person watching adventure movies is in the second column, the person drinking iced-tea must be in the third column of the second row.

7. From point 7, the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the manager and the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we have placed 'manager' in the first row and 'iced-tea' in the second row, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in the first row. But we have already placed 'collecting' in the first row. This contradicts the information given in point 7. There seems to be an error in the puzzle as it's impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

Final solution table (with the given information):

|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | iced-tea     | almond-milk| 7up        |

| Job           | manager      | paramedic  | teacher    |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure    |            | family     |

However, there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it's impossible to satisfy all the conditions."
Lv7-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is either to the left or right of the fan of classical. Since the person who's hobby is baking is the fan of classical (from point 3), the person who's hobby is puzzles cannot be on the same side as the person who's hobby is baking. So, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be on the other side of the person who's hobby is baking.

2. The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games (from point 2).

3. Now, let's place the person who's hobby is puzzles on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking. This means the person who's hobby is video-games must be on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking.

4. The person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person drinking water (from point 5). Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking, the person drinking water must be on the other side of the person who's hobby is baking. So, the person drinking water is on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking.

5. The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding (from point 4).

6. The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere between the fan of gospel and the person who's hobby is video-games (from point 6). Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking, the person who's hobby is video-games must be on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking. So, the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking. This means the person who's sport is tennis must be on the left side of the person who's hobby is video-games and on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking.

7. The person drinking water is on the right side of the fan of classical (from point 4). Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking, the fan of classical must be on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking.

8. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person drinking milk (from point 8). Since the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking, the person drinking milk must be on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking.

Now, let's place the sports:
- The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking, the person who's sport is volleyball must be on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking.
- The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person drinking milk and on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking, the person who's sport is tennis must be on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking.
- The person who's sport is snowboarding must be on the right side of the person who's sport is volleyball and on the left side of the person who's sport is tennis.

Now, let's place the music-genres:
- The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking and the person who's sport is tennis is on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking. So, the person who's hobby is classical must be on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking, and the person who's hobby is gospel must be on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking.
- The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person who's hobby is metal is the only genre left, the person who's hobby is metal must be on the right side of the person who's hobby is video-games.

Now, let's place the beverages:
- The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person who's hobby is juicing is the only beverage left for the left side, the person who's hobby is juicing must be the person who's hobby is puzzles.
- The person who's hobby is baking is the fan of classical. Since the person who's hobby is juicing is on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking, the person who's hobby is drinking milk must be on the left side of the person who's hobby is baking. So, the person who's hobby is drinking milk is the person who's hobby is baking.
- The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person who's hobby is drinking water is on the right side of the person who's hobby is baking, the person who's hobby is drinking water must be the person who's hobby is video-games.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |     2     |      3       |

Lv7-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere between the person who's sport is skiing and the person eating pumpkin. Since there are only 3 people and they are ordered from left to right, the only possible arrangement for these three people is: Skiing - Snowboarding - Pumpkin.

2. From point 2, the Egyptian is somewhere to the right of the British. Since we already know the arrangement of the sports, the only possible arrangement for the nationalities is: British - Egyptian - Japanese (or Japanese - British - Egyptian, but since the Japanese is mentioned to be on the right of the British in point 6, we can rule this out).

3. From point 3, the fan of salsa is not the person eating pumpkin. Since we know the arrangement of the sports and nationalities, the only possible arrangement for the music-genres is: Classical - Pop - Salsa.

4. From point 4, the person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the fan of classical. Since we know the arrangement of the sports and nationalities, the only possible arrangement for the music-genres is: Classical - Pop - Salsa (as we already determined in point 3).

5. From point 5, the person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin. Since we know the arrangement of the sports, nationalities, and music-genres, the only possible arrangement for the foods is: Pumpkin - Strawberry (as placing strawberry on the left of pumpkin would violate point 1, and placing strawberry on the right of pumpkin would violate point 5).

6. From point 6, the British is on the left or right of the Japanese. Since we already know the arrangement of the nationalities, this point doesn't provide any new information.

7. From point 7, the person eating eggplant is on the left of the Japanese. Since we already know the arrangement of the nationalities, this point doesn't provide any new information.

Now we have all the information to fill the table:

Lv7-4x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Let's assume the sports are in order from left to right: Baseball, Climbing, Surfing. This means the jobs and movie-genres can be arranged as follows:

   | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet | Sport |
   |---------------|------------|-----|-------|
   | Architect     |            |     |       |
   | Designer      |            |     |       |
   | Electrician   |            |     |       |

2. The electrician is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since climbing is the second sport, the electrician must be in the first or second position. However, the designer owns a hamster, so the electrician can't be in the first position because the designer must be to the right of the electrician (point 3). So, the electrician is in the second position, and the architect is in the first position.

   | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet | Sport |
   |---------------|------------|-----|-------|
   | Architect     |            |     | Climbing |
   | Electrician   |            |     |       |
   | Designer      |            |     |       |

3. The designer is the owner of the hamster. So, the designer is in the third position.

   | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet | Sport |
   |---------------|------------|-----|-------|
   | Architect     |            |     | Climbing |
   | Electrician   |            |     |       |
   | Designer      | Family     | Hamster|       |

4. The designer is on the left or right of the person watching spy movies (point 4). Since the designer is already placed, the person watching spy movies must be in the second position.

   | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet | Sport |
   |---------------|------------|-----|-------|
   | Architect     |            |     | Climbing |
   | Spy-Movie     | Spy        |     |       |
   | Designer      | Family     | Hamster|       |
   | Electrician   |            |     |       |

5. The person watching spy movies is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the owner of the rat (point 5). Since we don't know the movie genres yet, let's assume the movie genres are in order from left to right: Drama, Spy, Family.

   | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet | Sport |
   |---------------|------------|-----|-------|
   | Architect     | Drama      |     | Climbing |
   | Spy-Movie     | Spy        |     |       |
   | Designer      | Family     | Hamster|       |
   | Electrician   |            |     |       |

6. The architect is the person who's sport is climbing (point 6).

   | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet | Sport |
   |---------------|------------|-----|-------|
   | Architect     | Drama      |     | Climbing |
   | Spy-Movie     | Spy        |     |       |
   | Designer      | Family     | Hamster|       |
   | Electrician   |            |     |       |

7. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching drama movies (point 7). Since the movie genres are already placed, the remaining movie genre must be for the electrician.

   | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet | Sport |
   |---------------|------------|-----|-------|
   | Architect     | Drama      |     | Climbing |
   | Spy-Movie     | Spy        |     |       |
   | Designer      | Family     | Hamster|       |
   | Electrician   | Drama      |     |       |

8. The owner of the goat is not the designer (point 8). Since the designer already has a pet (hamster), the owner of the goat must be the architect. However, we can't place the goat yet because we don't know the pets for the other jobs.

   | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet | Sport |
   |---------------|------------|-----|-------|
   | Architect     | Drama      | Goat | Climbing |
   | Spy-Movie     | Spy        |     |       |
   | Designer      | Family     | Hamster|       |
   | Electrician   | Drama      |     |       |

At this point, we can't determine the pets for the other jobs because we don't have enough information. The table is as follows:

   | Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet | Sport |
   |---------------|------------|-----|-------|
   | Architect     | Drama      | Goat | Climbing |
   | Spy-Movie     | Spy        |     |       |
   | Designer      | Family     | Hamster|       |
   | Electrician   | Drama      |     |       |

This is as far as we can solve the puzzle with the given information."
Lv7-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of ambient is on the far left, so we can place it in the first column. Let's put it in the Job column (1st row).

   |               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
   | Job           | Ambient |                 |          |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |                 |          |
   | Music-Genre   |         |                 |          |
   | Sport         |         |                 |          |

2. Since the fan of ambient is in the first column, the fan of metal cannot be in the first column (as per rule 3). So, let's place the fan of metal in the 3rd column (Job 3).

   |               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
   | Job           | Ambient |                 | Metal    |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |                 |          |
   | Music-Genre   |         |                 |          |
   | Sport         |         |                 |          |

3. Now, the fan of metal is not the project-manager (as per rule 4), so the project-manager must be in the remaining job (Job 2).

   |               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
   | Job           | Ambient | Project-Manager | Metal    |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |                 |          |
   | Music-Genre   |         |                 |          |
   | Sport         |         |                 |          |

4. The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (as per rule 2). Since the fan of ambient is not a sportsperson (as per the given options), the only possible arrangement for sports is skateboarding (Job 1), soccer (Job 2), and tennis (Job 3). However, this arrangement violates rule 2, so we need to rearrange the sports. Let's swap skateboarding and tennis.

   |               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
   | Job           | Ambient | Project-Manager | Metal    |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |                 |          |
   | Music-Genre   |         |                 |          |
   | Sport         | Tennis  | Soccer          | Skateboarding|

5. The person watching comedy movies is somewhere between the coach and the person watching spy movies (as per rule 5 and 6). Since the coach cannot be in the first row (as the fan of ambient is there), the coach must be in the second row. The person watching spy movies must be in the third row. So, let's place comedy movies in the second row.

   |               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
   | Job           | Ambient | Comedy         | Metal    |
   | Movie-Genre   |         | Spy           |          |
   | Music-Genre   |         |               |          |
   | Sport         | Tennis  | Soccer         | Skateboarding|

6. The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is soccer (as per rule 7). So, the person watching spy movies must be in the third column.

   |               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
   | Job           | Ambient | Comedy         | Metal    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy    |               |          |
   | Music-Genre   |         |               |          |
   | Sport         | Tennis  | Soccer         | Skateboarding|

7. Now, we have to place the remaining movie-genres and music-genres. Since the fan of ambient is in the first column, the remaining movie-genres must be in the second and third columns. Similarly, the remaining music-genres must be in the second and third rows. Let's place epic in the second column (Movie-Genre 2) and spy in the third column (Movie-Genre 3).

   |               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
   | Job           | Ambient | Comedy         | Metal    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy    | Epic           |          |
   | Music-Genre   |         |               |          |
   | Sport         | Tennis  | Soccer         | Skateboarding|

8. The remaining music-genres are ambient (already placed), hip-hop, and metal. Since the fan of metal is in the third column (Job 3), hip-hop must be in the second row (Music-Genre 2).

   |               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
   | Job           | Ambient | Comedy         | Metal    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy    | Epic           |          |
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-hop|               | Metal    |
   | Sport         | Tennis  | Soccer         | Skateboarding|

9. Now, the only remaining genre is ambient (Music-Genre 1). Since it's already placed, we have solved the puzzle.

   |               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
   | Job           | Ambient | Comedy         | Metal    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy    | Epic           |          |
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-hop|               | Metal    |
   | Sport         | Tennis  | Soccer         | Skateboarding|

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, and nationalities. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 3 for each category.

2. Let's assign the hobbies: Fishing = 1, Reading = 2, Skydiving = 3.

3. Let's assign the jobs: Architect = 1, Bartender = 2, Videographer = 3.

4. Let's assign the movie-genres: Family = 1, Fantasy = 2, Romance = 3.

5. Let's assign the nationalities: Australian = 3, Indian = 1, Russian = 2.

6. From point 1, the person watching fantasy movies is the bartender (2). So, the Movie-Genre for row 2 is 2 (Fantasy).

7. The person watching family movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing (1). So, the Movie-Genre for row 1 must be 1 (Family).

8. The Australian is on the far right. Since we already know the nationalities, the person in row 3 must be Australian.

9. The russian is not the person who's hobby is reading. Since we already know the hobbies, the person in row 2 cannot be Russian. So, the person in row 1 must be Russian.

10. The videographer is somewhere between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the bartender. Since we already know the jobs and they are in rows 1 and 2, the person in row 3 must be the videographer.

11. Now, we know the nationality of the people in all rows. Since the Australian is on the far right (row 3), the nationality for row 1 and row 2 must be Indian and Russian respectively.

12. The only remaining information is the hobby for row 3 (videographer). Since we know the nationality for row 3 (Russian), and the Russian is not the person who's hobby is reading, the hobby for row 3 must be either fishing or skydiving. But since the person watching family movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing (row 1), and the person in row 3 (Russian) is not on the left of row 1, the hobby for row 3 must be skydiving.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person with the hobby of traveling is to the right of the person with the sport of water-polo. Let's place them in the last two columns and the last two rows, so we can start filling the table from the top.

   |               |     1     |     2      |     3     |
   | Hobby         | Traveling |           | Water-polo|

   | Sport         |           |           |           |

2. The person with the hobby of hiking is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the traveling and water-polo, the hiking person must be in the first column. Let's place hiking in the first row.

   |               |     1     |     2      |     3     |

3. The person with the sport of water-polo is to the right of the person with the sport of golf. Since we already placed water-polo, let's place golf in the second row.

   |               |     1     |     2      |     3     |

4. The person with the sport of golf is to the left of the French. Since we already placed golf, the French cannot be in the second row. So, the French must be in the third row.

5. The Indonesian is between the Pakistani and the owner of the bird. Since the Indonesian cannot be in the first row (because the hobby of the first row is hiking), the Indonesian must be in the second row. The only nationality left for the first row is the Pakistani.

6. The Pakistani is not the owner of the hedgehog. Since the only pet left is the hedgehog, the Pakistani cannot be in the first column. So, the hedgehog must be owned by the person with the hobby of hiking (in the first row).

Lv7-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 hobbies, 3 music-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 sports. So, each row and each column should have one unique value.

2. Let's start with the hobbies. Since there are 3 hobbies, we can assign them to the rows as follows:
   - Row 1: Filmmaking
   - Row 2: Writing
   - Row 3: Woodworking

3. Now let's assign the music-genres to the columns. Since there are 3 music-genres, we can assign them to the columns as follows:
   - Column 1: Hip-hop
   - Column 2: Rock
   - Column 3: Salsa

4. Now let's assign the nationalities. Since there are 3 nationalities, we can assign them to the rows and columns that don't have values yet. We'll start with the person who's hobby is writing (Row 2) and the person who's sport is soccer (Column 3).
   - Row 2: Writing (already assigned)
   - Row 1: Brazilian (since the Brazilian is to the left of the person who's sport is soccer)
   - Row 3: Dutch (since the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere between the Dutch and the person who's sport is water-polo)
   - Column 3: Soccer (already assigned)

5. Now we have the nationality for Row 1, so we can assign the sport for Row 1. Since the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer, and we know the sport for Column 3 is soccer, the sport for Row 1 must be parkour (since parkour is the only sport left).
   - Row 1: Filmmaking, Brazilian, Parkour

6. Now we have the nationality and sport for Row 3, so we can assign the hobby for Row 3. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere between the Dutch and the person who's sport is water-polo, and we know the sport for Column 3 is soccer, the hobby for Row 3 must be water-polo (since water-polo is the only hobby left).
   - Row 3: Woodworking, Dutch, Water-polo

7. Now we have the hobby for Row 3, so we can assign the nationality for Row 3. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere between the Dutch and the person who's sport is water-polo, and we know the hobby for Row 3 is water-polo, the nationality for Row 3 must be Italian (since Brazilian and Dutch are already assigned).
   - Row 3: Woodworking, Italian, Water-polo

8. Now we have the nationality for Row 3, so we can assign the music-genre for Column 2. Since the fan of salsa is on the right of the fan of hip-hop and on the right of the fan of salsa, and we know the nationality for Row 3 is Italian, the music-genre for Column 2 must be rock (since hip-hop and salsa are already assigned).
   - Column 2: Rock

9. Now we have the music-genre for Column 2, so we can assign the nationality for Column 1. Since the fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing, and we know the music-genre for Column 2 is rock, the nationality for Column 1 must be Dutch (since Brazilian and Italian are already assigned).
   - Column 1: Dutch

10. Now we have the nationality for Column 1, so we can assign the sport for Column 1. Since the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer, and we know the nationality for Column 1 is Dutch, the sport for Column 1 must be water-polo (since soccer and parkour are already assigned).
    - Column 1: Dutch, Water-polo

11. Now we have the sport for Column 1, so we can assign the music-genre for Column 3. Since the fan of salsa is on the right of the fan of hip-hop and on the right of the fan of salsa, and we know the sport for Column 3 is soccer, the music-genre for Column 3 must be hip-hop (since rock and salsa are already assigned).
    - Column 3: Soccer, Hip-hop

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Filmmaking| Dutch   | Parkour |
|   Writing   |   Brazil| Water-polo|
