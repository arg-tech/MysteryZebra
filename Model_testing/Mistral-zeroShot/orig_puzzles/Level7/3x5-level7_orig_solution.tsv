Lv7-3x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them A (Argentine), P (Polish), M (Mexican), R (Russian), and S (remaining person).

2. From point 1, we know A is in the first column. From point 5, we know P is not in the first column. So, P must be in the second column.

3. From point 2, A's music genre can't be ambient because the fan of ambient is either left or right of the skateboard driver, and A is the only one left. So, A's music genre must be one of blues, classical, r&b, or soul. Let's assume A is a blues fan for now.

4. From point 3, the fan of ambient can't be A or the skateboard driver (since A is a blues fan and the skateboard driver is to the left or right of M). The only remaining person is R, so R is the fan of ambient.

5. From point 11, R is also the Russian. So, R's nationality is Russian, and his music genre is ambient.

6. From point 4, A can't be the fan of ambient, so A must be the fan of one of the remaining genres (classical, r&b, or soul). Let's assume A is a classical fan for now.

7. From point 7, the roller driver is between A and S (the fan of soul). Since A is a classical fan and S is to the right of P (from point 4), the roller driver must be to the left of S. So, S must be in the 5th column.

8. From point 8, S's music genre is either blues, r&b, or classical (since S is to the left or right of M). Let's assume S is a r&b fan for now.

9. From point 9, S (the fan of r&b) is to the left of R (the fan of ambient). Since R is in the second column, S must be in the first column, which contradicts our assumption that A is in the first column. So, S can't be a r&b fan.

10. Back to point 8, S's music genre must be blues or classical. Let's assume S is a blues fan. This means A is a classical fan.

11. From point 12, the skateboard driver is to the left or right of M. Since M is in the 4th column, the skateboard driver must be in the 3rd or 5th column. But the skateboard driver can't be in the 5th column because S is already there (from point 7). So, the skateboard driver is in the 3rd column.

12. From point 13, the snowmobile driver is to the right of the fan of r&b. Since R is the fan of ambient and S is the fan of blues, M must be the fan of r&b.

13. From point 6, the snowmobile driver is in an odd position. The only odd positions left are the 1st and 3rd. But the 1st position is already taken by A (from point 1), so the snowmobile driver is in the 3rd column.

14. From point 10, the polish is a fan of blues. Since P is in the 2nd column, the only remaining column for the fan of soul is the 5th column.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4      |    5    |
| Music-Genre   | Classical | Blues  |   R&B     |   Soul    |  Ambient|
| Nationality   | Argentine | Polish | Mexican   |   -       | Russian |
| Transport     |   -       |   -    | Skateboard| Snowmobile| Boat    |

Note that we don't have enough information to determine the transport for all people."
Lv7-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the volleyball player is not the grapefruit eater, so the grapefruit can't be in the first or last position. Let's place the grapefruit in position 3 for now.

2. The golf player is between the grapefruit and pear eater. So, the pear can't be in the first or last position, and it can't be in position 3 (since the grapefruit is there). Let's place the pear in position 5 for now.

3. The dancer is between the skateboarder and cricket player. Since the skateboarder is the bartender (from point 9), the dancer can't be in the first position. Also, the dancer can't be in the last position because the volleyball player can be either the first or last (point 14). So, let's place the dancer in position 2 for now.

4. The volleyball player is to the right of the golf player. Since the golf player is between the grapefruit and pear (point 2), the volleyball player can't be in the first two positions. Also, the volleyball player can't be in the last position because the freelancer is to the left of the golf player (point 12). So, let's place the volleyball player in position 4 for now.

5. The weightlifting player is on the far left. Since the volleyball player can be the first or last (point 14), the weightlifting player must be in the first position. So, the weightlifting player is eating cucumber.

6. The police-officer is to the left of the cucumber eater. Since the weightlifting player is the cucumber eater, the police-officer can't be in the last position. So, the police-officer is eating watermelon (point 13).

7. The pear eater is on the right of the watermelon eater (point 10). So, the pear eater is in position 6.

8. The potato eater is between the cucumber eater and the pear eater (point 7). So, the potato eater is in position 4.

9. The skateboarder is the bartender (point 9). So, the skateboarder is in position 1.

10. The golf player is between the grapefruit and pear (point 2). So, the golf player is in position 2.

11. The freelancer is to the left of the golf player (point 12). So, the freelancer is in position 5.

12. The watermelon eater is in an odd position (point 11). Since the weightlifting player is in position 1, the watermelon eater must be in position 3.

13. The volleyball player is on the far left or far right (point 14). Since the weightlifting player is in the first position and the pear eater is in the sixth position, the volleyball player must be in the last position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-3x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking iced-tea is not in the first or last position (from rule 1 and 3). So, the possible positions for iced-tea are 2, 3, or 4.

2. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket (rule 2). Since cricket can't be in the first position (rule 10), the possible positions for snowboarding are 2, 3, or 5. Let's assume snowboarding is in position 2 for now.

3. The fan of trance is between the fan of funk and the fan of blues (rule 4). Since funk can't be in the first position (rule 9), the possible positions for funk are 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume funk is in position 3 for now.

4. The person who's sport is baseball is on the far right (rule 3). So, baseball must be in position 5.

5. The fan of blues is somewhere between the person drinking water and the person who's sport is badminton (rule 8). Since badminton can't be in the first position (rule 10), the possible positions for badminton are 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume badminton is in position 4 for now.

6. The person who's sport is cricket is to the right of the fan of funk (rule 9). So, cricket must be in position 5 or 4. But if cricket was in position 4, it would be before badminton, which contradicts rule 8. So, cricket must be in position 5.

7. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding (rule 11). Since skateboarding can't be in the first position (rule 1), the possible positions for skateboarding are 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume skateboarding is in position 3 for now.

8. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (rule 5). Since hot-chocolate can't be in the first position (rule 10), the possible positions for hot-chocolate are 2, 3, 4, or 5. If hot-chocolate was in position 3, it would be next to coffee, which contradicts rule 5. So, hot-chocolate must be in position 2 or 4. But if hot-chocolate was in position 4, it would be before skateboarding, which contradicts rule 7. So, hot-chocolate must be in position 2.

9. The person drinking water must be in position 1.

10. The fan of rock is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cricket (rule 6). Since cricket is in position 5, rock must be in position 4 or 5. But if rock was in position 5, it would be after baseball, which contradicts rule 4. So, rock must be in position 4.

11. The fan of house must be in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |       4       |    5     |

Now, let's fill in the missing sports and music-genres:

12. The person who's sport is badminton is not the person drinking hot-chocolate (rule 10). So, badminton must be in position 4.

13. The person who's sport is skateboarding is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 11). Since iced-tea is in position 2, skateboarding must be in position 1.

14. The person who's sport is cricket is in position 5.

15. The person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 2.

16. The fan of funk is in position 3.

17. The fan of trance is between the fan of funk and the fan of blues (rule 4). Since funk is in position 3 and blues can't be in the first position (rule 9), the fan of blues must be in position 5.

18. The fan of house must be in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |       4       |    5     |

Now, let's fill in the missing music-genre:

19. The fan of trance is between the fan of funk and the fan of blues (rule 4). Since funk is in position 3 and blues is in position 5, trance must be in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating avocado is to the left of the Italian (#1), and there are only 4 positions to the left of the Italian, the avocado can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. The British is to the right of the Indonesian (#2), so the Indonesian cannot be in position 1 (as there is no position to the left). So, the Indonesian can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The French is not the person eating avocado (#3), so the French cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (as they all contain avocado eaters). So, the French must be in position 5.

4. The owner of the goat is between the owner of the cat and the French (#4). Since the French is in position 5, the goat cannot be in position 1, 2, or 5. So, the goat can be in positions 3 or 4.

5. The owner of the pony is on the far left or far right (#5). Since the French is in position 5, the pony cannot be in position 5. So, the pony must be in position 1.

6. The owner of the goat is to the right of the owner of the cat (#6). Since the pony is in position 1, the goat cannot be in position 1 either. So, the goat must be in position 3 or 4.

7. The French is between the owner of the goat and the person eating lime (#7). Since the French is in position 5, the lime eater cannot be in position 5. So, the lime eater can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. The owner of the rat is to the right of the Indonesian (#8). Since the Indonesian can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, the rat cannot be in position 1. So, the rat can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

9. The Indonesian is to the left of the person eating watermelon (#14). Since the Indonesian can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, the watermelon eater cannot be in position 1. So, the watermelon eater can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. The person eating papaya is to the left of the person eating lime (#13). Since the lime eater can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, the papaya eater cannot be in position 5. So, the papaya eater can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

11. The owner of the rat is to the right of the person eating papaya (#11). Since the papaya eater can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, the rat cannot be in position 1. So, the rat can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

12. The Indonesian is to the left of the person eating watermelon (#14), and the owner of the rat is to the right of the Indonesian (#8). This means the watermelon eater and the rat cannot be in the same row. So, the watermelon eater and the rat must be in different rows.

13. The person eating pineapple is to the left of the person eating avocado (#9). Since the avocado eater can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, the pineapple eater cannot be in position 5. So, the pineapple eater can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

14. The owner of the cat is not the person eating watermelon (#10). Since the watermelon eater can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, the cat cannot be in the same row as the watermelon eater.

Now, let's place the remaining items:
- The goat cannot be in the same row as the cat (as the goat is to the right of the cat), so the goat cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
- The lime eater cannot be in the same row as the rat (as the rat is to the right of the lime eater), so the lime eater cannot be in positions 2 or 4.

We have placed all the items except for the pineapple eater and the rat. Since the rat cannot be in position 1, the pineapple eater must be in position 1. The rat can be in any of the remaining positions (2, 3, 4, or 5). However, since the rat must be to the right of the Indonesian and the Indonesian is to the left of the watermelon eater, the rat cannot be in position 2 (as it would be to the left of the Indonesian). So, the rat can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Let's place the lime eater:
- The lime eater cannot be in the same row as the rat (as the rat is to the right of the lime eater), so the lime eater cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- The lime eater cannot be in the same row as the watermelon eater (as the Indonesian is to the left of the watermelon eater and the rat is to the right of the Indonesian, so the lime eater cannot be between the Indonesian and the watermelon eater).

So, the only remaining position for the lime eater is position 2.

Now, the only remaining position for the rat is position 3.

Finally, the watermelon eater can be in any of the remaining positions (4 or 5).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv7-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the American is on the right of the Canadian, we can place them in columns 2 and 3, with the American in column 3 (to avoid having the American and Thai next to each other).

   |               |     1      |     2     |       3       |     4     |    5    |

   Now, the Canadian is in column 2.

2. The person eating orange is on the right of the Polish. Since the Polish cannot be in column 1 (because the gardener, who is the Polish, is in column 3), the orange eater must be in column 4 or 5. But if the orange eater were in column 5, the Polish would have to be in column 1, which contradicts the fact that the gardener is the Polish. So, the orange eater is in column 4.

   |               |     1      |     2     |       3       |     4     |    5    |

   Now, the Polish is in column 1.

3. The person eating plum is to the left of the Canadian. So, the Canadian cannot be in column 3 (because the American is there), and the plum eater cannot be in column 5 (because the gardener, who is the Polish, is in column 3). So, the Canadian is in column 2 and the plum eater is in column 1.

   |               |     1      |     2     |       3       |     4     |    5    |

4. The person who's hobby is gardening is the Polish, so it's already filled.

5. The person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the right of the Polish. So, it can only be in column 4 or 5. But if it were in column 5, it would be to the right of the American, who is eating garlic (according to the next condition), which contradicts the condition that the garlic eater is to the right of the American. So, the skydiving person is in column 4.

6. The American is on the left or right of the Thai. Since the American is in column 3, the Thai can only be in column 1 or 2. But if the Thai were in column 1, the plum eater would have to be in column 5, which contradicts the fact that the skydiving person is in column 4. So, the Thai is in column 2.

7. The japanese is somewhere to the left of the person eating pineapple. So, the Japanese can only be in column 1 or 2. But if the Japanese were in column 1, the plum eater would have to be in column 5, which contradicts the fact that the skydiving person is in column 4. So, the Japanese is in column 2.

10. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere between the polish and the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the Polish is in column 1 and the skydiving person is in column 4, the rock-climbing person must be in column 2 or 3. But if it were in column 2, it would be the Canadian, which contradicts the fact that the Canadian is a gardener. So, the rock-climbing person is in column 3.

11. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the far left. Since there are only 5 hobbies, the sudoku person must be in column 1.

   |               |     1     |     2     |       3       |     4     |    5    |

12. The person eating garlic is somewhere to the right of the American. Since the American is in column 3, the garlic eater must be in column 4 or 5. But if it were in column 5, it would be to the right of the drawing person, which contradicts the fact that the drawing person is on the far right. So, the garlic eater is in column 4.

   |               |     1     |     2     |       3       |     4     |    5    |

13. The person who's hobby is gardening is the person eating pineapple. This contradicts the fact that the gardener is the Polish, who is in column 3. So, this condition cannot be true.

Since we have a contradiction, there is no valid solution for this puzzle.

This table represents one of the possible solutions, but the condition that the person who's hobby is gardening is the person eating pineapple cannot be true."
Lv7-3x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people and 5 items for each category (beverage, job, nationality). Let's label the positions from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2. From rule 7, the person drinking mirinda is in an odd position. So, mirinda cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 6 (since those are even numbers). Therefore, mirinda must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. From rule 12, the dancer is on the left of the videographer. Since the dancer cannot be in position 5 (because the person drinking fanta is to the right of the dancer, and fanta cannot be in position 5), the dancer must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

4. From rule 4, the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the dancer. So, fanta cannot be in positions 1 or 2. Therefore, fanta must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

5. From rule 5, the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the turkish. Since the turkish is the journalist (rule 10), and the journalist is not in position 5 (because the person drinking tea is to the right of the journalist, and tea cannot be in position 5), the turkish cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the turkish must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

6. From rule 11, the turkish is on the left of the malaysian. Since the malaysian cannot be in position 1 (because the coach is not the indonesian, and the indonesian is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking juice, which means the indonesian cannot be in position 1), the malaysian must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. From rule 8, the engineer is the british. Since the engineer cannot be in position 5 (because the person drinking tea is to the right of the engineer, and tea cannot be in position 5), the british cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the british must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. From rule 9, the british is somewhere between the videographer and the person drinking tea. Since the videographer cannot be in position 5 (because the person drinking mirinda is in an odd position), the videographer cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the videographer must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

9. Now we have placed the following:
   - Mirinda in position 1
   - Dancer in position 1, 2, or 3
   - Fanta in position 3, 4, or 5
   - Turkish (Journalist) in position 1, 2, 3, or 4
   - Malaysian in position 2, 3, 4, or 5
   - British (Engineer) in position 1, 2, 3, or 4
   - Videographer in position 1, 2, 3, or 4

10. From rule 6, the indonesian is somewhere between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking juice. Since the indonesian cannot be in position 1 (because the coach is not the indonesian), the indonesian must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

11. From rule 3, the person drinking lemonade is in the middle. So, the person drinking lemonade is in position 3.

12. Since the indonesian is to the right of the person drinking lemonade and to the left of the person drinking juice, the indonesian can only be in position 4.

13. Now we have placed the following:
   - Mirinda in position 1
   - Dancer in position 1
   - Fanta in position 5
   - Turkish (Journalist) in position 2
   - Malaysian in position 4
   - British (Engineer) in position 3
   - Videographer in position 2

14. From rule 1, the coach is not the indonesian. So, the coach cannot be in position 4 (since the indonesian is in position 4). Therefore, the coach must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

15. From rule 2, the person drinking lemonade is in the middle. So, the person drinking lemonade is in position 3. But we already placed the dancer in position 1 and the indonesian in position 4. This means the person drinking lemonade cannot be in position 3. So, the coach must be in position 3.

16. Now we have placed the following:
   - Mirinda in position 1
   - Dancer in position 1
   - Coach in position 3
   - Turkish (Journalist) in position 2
   - Malaysian in position 4
   - British (Engineer) in position 5
   - Videographer in position 2

17. From rule 13, the person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the journalist. Since the journalist is in position 2, the person drinking tea must be in position 4 or 5. But we already placed the Malaysian in position 4. So, the person drinking tea must be in position 5.

18. From rule 14, the person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5, the person drinking juice must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But we already placed the dancer in position 1, the coach in position 3, and the mirinda in position 1. So, the person drinking juice must be in position 2.

19. Now we have placed the following:
   - Mirinda in position 1
   - Dancer in position 1
   - Coach in position 3
   - Turkish (Journalist) in position 2
   - Malaysian in position 4
   - British (Engineer) in position 5
   - Videographer in position 2
   - Juice in position 2

20. Finally, the only beverage left is tea. Since the person drinking tea is to the right of the journalist and to the left of the videographer, the person drinking tea must be in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1     |      2       |    3     |     4      |     5     |

Lv7-3x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is the coach, and he is on the right of the teacher (rule 11). So, let's place the coach in the 5th position (rightmost) and the teacher in the 4th position.

   |     |     1      |     2      |    3     |       4        |    5     |

   |     | Coach     |            |          | Teacher       | Baseball |

2. The teacher is between the person who's sport is biathlon and the police-officer (rule 7). Since the teacher is in the 4th position, the biathlon must be in the 3rd position, and the police-officer in the 6th position.

   |     |     1      |     2      |    3     |       4        |    5     |

3. The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball (rule 2). Since the coach (baseball) is in the 5th position, water-polo must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th position. However, since the teacher is between biathlon and the police-officer, water-polo cannot be in the 4th position. So, water-polo can only be in the 1st or 2nd position. Let's place it in the 1st position.

   |     |     1     |     2      |    3     |       4        |    5     |

4. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the biathlon (since the teacher is between biathlon and the police-officer, and the teacher is not the tennis player). The only available position for tennis is the 2nd position.

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

5. The owner of the dog is on the right of the teacher (rule 11). Since the teacher is in the 4th position, the dog owner can only be in the 5th position (coach).

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

6. The owner of the hamster is not the person who's sport is lacrosse (rule 10). Since we haven't placed lacrosse yet, let's place the hamster owner in the 1st position (water-polo is already taken, so it must be another sport).

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

7. The owner of the goat is on the far right (rule 12). Since the coach (dog owner) is in the 5th position, the goat owner must be in the 6th position (police-officer).

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

8. The paramedic is not the owner of the hamster (rule 13). So, the paramedic must be in the 3rd position.

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

9. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the police-officer (rule 9). Since the police-officer is in the 6th position, lacrosse can be in the 4th or 5th position. However, since the teacher is between biathlon and the police-officer, lacrosse cannot be in the 4th position. So, lacrosse can only be in the 5th position.

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

10. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the biathlon (already placed). Since tennis is in the 2nd position, biathlon must be in the 3rd position.

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

11. The freelancer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis (rule 4). Since tennis is in the 2nd position, the freelancer can be in the 1st or 4th position. However, since the teacher is between biathlon and the police-officer, the freelancer cannot be in the 4th position. So, the freelancer can only be in the 1st position.

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

12. The owner of the guinea-pig is not the person who's sport is lacrosse (rule 10). Since we have already placed lacrosse, the guinea-pig owner can be any of the remaining positions. Let's place the guinea-pig owner in the 3rd position (biathlon).

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

13. The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball (rule 2). Since water-polo is in the 1st position and baseball is in the 5th position, water-polo is on the left of baseball.

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

14. The owner of the goat is on the far right (rule 12). Since the police-officer is already in the 6th position, the goat owner cannot be in the 6th position. So, the goat owner must be in the 5th position (coach). However, this contradicts rule 4, which states that the freelancer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. To resolve this contradiction, we need to swap the positions of the coach and the freelancer.

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

15. The owner of the goat is the coach (rule 14). So, the coach is in the 5th position (goat owner) and the freelancer is in the 1st position.

   |     |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4        |    5     |

Lv7-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can represent them as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 from left to right.

2. Let's assign the hobbies to the people:
   - P1: Hiking (from rule 2)
   - P2: Fishing (from rule 3)
   - P3: Magic-tricks (we don't know yet)
   - P4: Reading (from rule 7 and 8)
   - P5: Skydiving (from rule 5)

3. Now let's assign the music-genres:
   - P1: We don't know yet
   - P2: Trance (from rule 3, since P2 is fishing and the fan of trance is not the polish)
   - P3: Electronic (from rules 4 and 14, since the colombian is to the right of P3 and between P3 and the fan of electronic)
   - P4: Punk (from rule 7)
   - P5: Pop (we don't know yet)

4. Now let's assign the nationalities:
   - P1: Colombian (from rules 4 and 10, since P1 is hiking and to the left of the colombian)
   - P2: Brazilian (from rules 6 and 12, since P2 is fishing and to the right of P1, who is hiking)
   - P3: Dutch (from rules 15 and 9, since the dutch is to the left of P4, who is reading, and P5, who is skydiving, is to the right of P3)
   - P4: Polish (we don't know yet)
   - P5: Pakistani (from rule 5, since P5 is skydiving and to the right of P4, who is not skydiving)

5. Now we have only one nationality left, Polish. Since the colombian is to the right of the fan of electronic (P3), and the colombian is to the right of the person who's hobby is reading (P4), the Polish must be between P3 and P4. Also, the Polish cannot be P3 (since the fan of trance is not the polish), so the Polish must be P4.

6. Now we can fill in the final table:

   |               |      1       |    2    |     3     |     4      |     5     |
   | Hobby         | Colombian   | Brazilian| Dutch    | Polish    | Pakistani |
   | Music-Genre   |            | Trance  | Electronic| Punk     | Pop      |
   | Nationality   |            |         |           |            |           |

7. We still don't know the nationality for P3 (Dutch) and the music-genre for P5 (Pakistani). However, since the nationality of P3 is known, we can fill in the nationality column.

   |               |      1       |    2    |     3     |     4      |     5     |
   | Hobby         | Colombian   | Brazilian| Dutch    | Polish    | Pakistani |
   | Music-Genre   |            | Trance  | Electronic| Punk     | Pop      |
   | Nationality   | Brazilian  | Colombian| Dutch    | Polish    | Pakistani |

8. Now we can fill in the music-genre for P5. Since the pakistani is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving (P5), and the fan of pop is on the left or right of the fan of punk (P4), the music-genre for P5 must be pop.

   |               |      1       |    2    |     3     |     4      |     5     |
   | Hobby         | Colombian   | Brazilian| Dutch    | Polish    | Pakistani |
   | Music-Genre   |            | Trance  | Electronic| Punk     | Pop      |
   | Nationality   | Brazilian  | Colombian| Dutch    | Polish    | Pakistani |

9. Now we have filled in all the information in the table.

   |               |      1       |    2    |     3     |     4      |     5     |
   | Hobby         | Colombian   | Brazilian| Dutch    | Polish    | Pakistani |
   | Music-Genre   |            | Trance  | Electronic| Punk     | Pop      |
   | Nationality   | Brazilian  | Colombian| Dutch    | Polish    | Pakistani |

So the final solution table is:

Lv7-3x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the Polish cannot be in position 5 (since there's no pepper in the table). So, the Polish can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. From rule 2, the person eating cranberry cannot be in position 3 (since the German is in position 3). So, the cranberry can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

3. From rule 3, the Polish cannot be in position 1 (since the fishing hobby is not allowed there). So, the Polish can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

4. From rule 4, the Australian cannot be in position 5 (since the camping hobby is not allowed there). Also, the Australian cannot be in position 1 (since the camping hobby is not allowed there either, and the Australian is to the left of the person who's hobby is camping). So, the Australian can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

5. From rule 5, the person eating kiwi cannot be in the middle (since the person eating kiwi is on the far left or far right). So, the kiwi can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

6. From rule 6, the person eating orange cannot be in position 3 (since the Canadian cannot be there, and the Canadian is not the person eating orange). So, the orange can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

7. From rule 7, the person eating orange cannot be in position 1 (since the person eating orange is to the right of the person who's hobby is camping, and the camping hobby is not in position 1). So, the orange can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

8. From rule 8, the magic-tricks hobby cannot be in position 1 (since the Italian is to the right of the magic-tricks hobby). So, the magic-tricks hobby can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

9. From rule 9, the magic-tricks hobby cannot be in position 5 (since the puzzles hobby is to the left of the magic-tricks hobby). So, the magic-tricks hobby can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

10. From rule 10, the Italian cannot be in position 3 (since the Italian is not the person eating orange, and the orange is in position 3). So, the Italian can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

11. From rule 11, the person eating cranberry is the Polish. So, the Polish is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and the cranberry is in the same position.

12. From rule 12, the person eating orange is between the person who's hobby is camping and the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the camping hobby is not in position 1, the orange cannot be in position 1 either. So, the orange can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

13. From rule 13, the person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the Polish (who is eating cranberry) is in position 1, the reading hobby cannot be in position 2 (since the Polish is to the left of the person who's hobby is reading). So, the reading hobby can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

14. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the puzzles hobby is not in position 1, the fishing hobby cannot be in position 1 either. So, the fishing hobby can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

15. From rule 15, the Polish is somewhere to the right of the person eating cranberry. Since the Polish is in position 1, the person eating cranberry is in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's check the possibilities:

- If the person eating cranberry is in position 1, then the Polish is in position 1, the person eating cranberry is in position 1, the person eating orange is in position 2, the person who's hobby is reading is in position 3, the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 4, and the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 5. This satisfies all the rules.

- If the person eating cranberry is in position 2, then the Polish is in position 2, the person eating cranberry is in position 2, the person eating orange is in position 4, the person who's hobby is reading is in position 3, the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 5, and the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 1. This also satisfies all the rules.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| Cranberry | Polish | Orange | Reading | Fishing | Puzzles |
#############
|         1 |      2 |       4|        3|        5|    1    |
|         2 |      1 |       4|        3|        5|    2    |

Both tables are valid solutions."
Lv7-3x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 11, we know that the Spanish is the fan of jazz. Let's place the Spanish in the first row, third column (1,3) as they are preferring jazz.

2. From rule 12, we know that the Chinese is on the right of the Argentine. Since the Spanish is already in the first row, the Argentine must be in the first row, second column (1,2).

3. From rule 3, we know that the fan of trance is not the Chinese. Since the Chinese is in the second column (1,2), the trance fan cannot be in the second row. So, the trance fan must be in the second row, either the first or third column. Let's place the trance fan in the second row, third column (2,3) for now.

4. From rule 2, we know that the fan of jazz (Spanish) is to the left of the fan of trance. So, the Spanish (1,3) must be to the left of the trance fan (2,3). This means the trance fan must be in the second row, first column (2,1).

5. From rule 6, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the fan of trance. So, the skateboarding person must be in the second row, second column (2,2).

6. From rule 1, we know that the people prefer 5 different music-genres. Since we have placed the Spanish (jazz), the trance fan, and the skateboarding person, the remaining music genres (ambient, classical, salsa, and surf) must be distributed among the remaining people (Argentine, Chinese, Italian, and German). Let's place the Argentine with ambient (1,2) as it is already placed.

7. From rule 5, we know that the fan of salsa is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. So, the salsa fan must be in the first row, second column (1,2).

8. From rule 4, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is not placed yet, let's place the Italian in the third row, second column (3,2).

9. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the snowboarding person is not placed yet, the cricket person must be in the fourth row, second column (4,2).

10. From rule 9, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere between the Spanish and the person who's sport is handball. Since the skateboarding person is already placed (2,2), the handball person must be in the third row, second column (3,2).

11. From rule 6, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the fan of trance. Since the skateboarding person is already placed (2,2), the trance fan must be in the fourth row, third column (4,3).

12. From rule 4, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the Italian. Since the snowboarding person is not placed yet, let's place the snowboarding person in the fourth row, third column (4,3).

13. From rule 1, we know that the people prefer 5 different types of sport. Since we have placed cricket, handball, skateboarding, snowboarding, and the Italian is still not placed, the Italian must be playing cricket (3,2).

14. From rule 7, we know that the fan of salsa is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. Since the handball person is already placed (3,2), the salsa fan must be in the third row, first column (3,1).

15. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the snowboarding person is already placed (4,3), the cricket person must be in the fourth row, first column (4,1).

16. From rule 10, we know that the person who's sport is handball is not the Chinese. Since the handball person is already placed (3,2), the Chinese must be playing salsa (1,4).

17. From rule 9, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere between the Spanish and the person who's sport is handball. Since the skateboarding person is already placed (2,2), the remaining music genre (classical) must be with the German. So, the German is playing classical music (5,4).

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Jazz     | Ambient |   Skateboarding   |   Snowboarding   | Handball |
#############
|   Spanish  |   Argentine  |   Italian   |   Chinese   |   German  |
#############
|   Classical |   Salsa   |   Cricket   |   Trance   |   Surfing |
#############
```

This table represents the final solution to the puzzle."
