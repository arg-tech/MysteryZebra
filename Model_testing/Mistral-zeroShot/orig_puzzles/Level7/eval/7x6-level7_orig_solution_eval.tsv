Lv7-7x6-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each person a number from 1 to 6, starting from the left. We know the mouse owner is on the far left, so they are person 1.

2. From rule 2, we know the disco fan is on the right of the snake owner, so the snake owner is not person 1 (since the mouse is on the far left) and must be either person 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume the snake owner is person 6 for now.

3. From rule 3, we know the Indonesian is not the hiker, so they are not person 3.

4. From rule 4, the disaster movie fan is between woodworking and the Turkish. Since the Turkish is person 6 (from our assumption), the disaster movie fan cannot be person 6. So, the disaster movie fan is either person 1, 2, 4, or 5.

5. From rule 5, the Polish is on the right of the lemonade drinker. Since the Polish is the r&b fan (from rule 12), the lemonade drinker cannot be person 1 (since the mouse owner is on the far left). So, the lemonade drinker is either person 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

6. From rule 6, the family movie fan is on the left or right of the goat owner. Since the goat owner cannot be person 6 (because the snake owner is on their right), the family movie fan is either person 1, 2, 3, or 5.

7. From rule 7, the coffee drinker is between the soy-milk drinker and the martial-arts movie fan. Since the Turkish is the soy-milk fan (from rule 21), the coffee drinker cannot be person 6. So, the coffee drinker is either person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. From rule 8, the basketball fan is on the right of the American. Since the American cannot be person 6 (because the snake owner is on their right), the basketball fan is either person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

9. From rule 9, the goat owner is not a classical music fan. Since the goat owner cannot be person 6 (because the snake owner is on their right), the classical music fan is either person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. From rule 10, the cooking hobbyist is on the far left or far right. Since the mouse owner and the goat owner are already assigned, the cooking hobbyist cannot be person 1 or 6. So, the cooking hobbyist is either person 2, 3, 4, or 5.

11. From rule 11, the lemonade drinker is on the left of the photography hobbyist. Since the lemonade drinker is not person 1 (because the mouse owner is on the far left), the photography hobbyist is either person 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

12. From rule 12, the r&b fan is the Polish. Since the Polish is not person 1 (because the lemonade drinker is on their right), the r&b fan is either person 2, 3, 4, or 5.

13. From rule 13, the snake owner is not a dancing hobbyist. Since the snake owner is person 6, the dancing hobbyist is not person 6.

14. From rule 14, the sprite drinker is between the cooking hobbyist and the guinea-pig owner. Since the cooking hobbyist and the guinea-pig owner are not yet assigned, we can't determine the sprite drinker's position yet.

15. From rule 15, the cooking hobbyist is not an r&b fan. Since the cooking hobbyist is not person 1, 2, 4, or 6 (from our previous deductions), the cooking hobbyist must be person 3 or 5.

16. From rule 16, the snake owner is on the left or right of the American. Since the snake owner is person 6, the American cannot be person 6. So, the American is either person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

17. From rule 17, the goat owner is somewhere to the left of the folk music fan. Since the goat owner cannot be person 6 (because the snake owner is on their right), the folk music fan is either person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

18. From rule 18, the frog owner is in an odd position. Since the mouse owner and the goat owner are already assigned (positions 1 and 4 or 5), the frog owner must be in position 3 or 6. However, since the snake owner is on the right of the American (from rule 16), the frog owner cannot be person 6. So, the frog owner is person 3.

19. From rule 19, the soy-milk drinker is on the left of the coffee drinker. Since the soy-milk drinker is the Turkish (from rule 21), the coffee drinker is not person 6. So, the coffee drinker is either person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

20. From rule 20, the time-travel movie fan is somewhere to the left of the martial-arts movie fan. Since the Turkish is the soy-milk drinker (from rule 21), the time-travel movie fan cannot be person 6. So, the time-travel movie fan is either person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

21. From rule 21, the Turkish is the soy-milk drinker. Since the Turkish is not person 6 (because the snake owner is on their right), the soy-milk drinker must be person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. We already know that the Turkish is person 6, so the soy-milk drinker is not person 6. Therefore, the soy-milk drinker must be person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, but we already know that the Turkish is the soy-milk drinker, which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption about the snake owner being person 6 was incorrect. Let's try another position for the snake owner.

Let's assume the snake owner is person 1. Then, the disco fan is on the right of the snake owner, so the disco fan is person 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The Indonesian is not the hiker, so they are not person 3. The disaster movie fan is between woodworking and the Turkish, so the disaster movie fan is either person 2 or 4. The Polish is on the right of the lemonade drinker, so the lemonade drinker is on the left of the Polish, which means the Polish is not person 6. The family movie fan is on the left or right of the goat owner, so the family movie fan is either person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. The coffee drinker is between the soy-milk drinker and the martial-arts movie fan, so the coffee drinker is either person 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The basketball fan is on the right of the American, so the basketball fan is either person 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The classical music fan is not the goat owner, so the classical music fan is not person 1. The cooking hobbyist is on the far left or far right, so the cooking hobbyist is either person 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. The photography hobbyist is on the right of the lemonade drinker, so the photography hobbyist is not person 1. The r&b fan is the Polish, so the Polish is not person 1. The dancing hobbyist is not the snake owner, so the dancing hobbyist is not person 1. The sprite drinker is between the cooking hobbyist and the guinea-pig owner, so the sprite drinker is either person 2, 3, 4, or 5. The folk music fan is somewhere to the left of the goat owner, so the folk music fan is either person 1, 2, 3, or 4. The frog owner is in an odd position, so the frog owner is either person 1, 3, or 5. The soy-milk drinker is on the left of the coffee drinker, so the soy-milk drinker is not person 5. The time-travel movie fan is somewhere to the left of the martial-arts movie fan, so the time-travel movie fan is either person 1, 2, or 3. The Turkish is the soy-milk drinker, so the Turkish is person 1. The parkour fan is somewhere to the right of the Turkish, so the parkour fan is either person 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The musical movie fan is somewhere to the left of the Indian, so the musical movie fan is either person 1, 2, 3, or 4. The skiing fan is on the left or right of the musical movie fan, so the skiing fan is either person 1, 2, 3, or 4. The Indian is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog, so the Indian is either person 1, 2, 3, or 4. The almond-milk drinker is somewhere to the left of the lacrosse fan, so the almond-milk drinker is either person 1, 2, 3, or 4. The disco fan is somewhere to the right of the American, so the disco fan is either person 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv7-7x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step will help us find the solution. I'll break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1:
- From rule 3, the person watching crime movies is in an odd position. Since there are 6 people, the positions are numbered 1 to 6. So, crime movies are either in position 1, 3, or 5.
- From rule 4, the gospel fan is the person watching mystery movies. Since mystery movies are in an odd position (from rule 3), the gospel fan is in an even position. So, gospel fans are in positions 2, 4, or 6.
- From rule 19, the fan of r&b is eating spinach. So, spinach is in an odd position (since r&b fans are in odd positions).

Step 2:
- From rule 21, the person fishing is between the person eating strawberry and the person eating papaya. Since spinach is in an odd position (from step 1), strawberry must be in an even position.
- From rule 23, the person eating strawberry is on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since spinach is in an odd position (from step 1), the mouse owner must be in an even position.
- From rule 24, the person eating papaya is somewhere to the right of the dutch. Since spinach is in an odd position (from step 1), the dutch must be in an even position.

Step 3:
- From rule 25, the fan of jazz is in an even position. Since spinach is in an odd position (from step 1), the jazz fan cannot be in position 1. So, jazz fans are in positions 2, 4, or 6.
- From rule 27, the fan of classical is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the dutch is in an even position (from step 2), the traveler must be in an odd position.
- From rule 28, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in an odd position. Since the traveler is in an odd position (from the previous step), ice-hockey is in an even position.

Step 4:
- From rule 29, the person watching time-travel movies is the person who's sport is climbing. Since ice-hockey is in an even position (from the previous step), climbing is in an odd position.
- From rule 30, the fan of r&b is the fan of r&b. This doesn't give us any new information.
- From rule 31, the owner of the chinchilla is not the person eating strawberry. Since the strawberry eater is in an even position (from step 2), the chinchilla owner is in an odd position.

Lv7-7x6-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Identify the number of each category's elements (6 for each category). Assign a unique number from 1 to 6 to each element in each category.

2. Use the given clues to eliminate impossible combinations. For example, from clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is not the person who's sport is rugby. This means that the sport of the person with hobby 1 cannot be 6 (rugby).

3. Use the relative position clues to arrange the elements in rows. For example, from clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. This means that the sport of the person with hobby 5 cannot be 1 (badminton), so it must be 2, 3, 4, or 6. If it were 2, then the hobby of the person with sport 2 would have to be 5 (puzzles), but that contradicts clue 1. So, the sport of the person with hobby 5 cannot be 2. Similarly, we can eliminate 3 and 4. Therefore, the sport of the person with hobby 5 must be 6, and the hobby of the person with sport 2 must be 1.

4. Continue this process for all the clues. Some clues will provide direct assignments (like clue 11, which tells us the engineer is in an even position), while others will help eliminate possibilities (like clue 1).

5. Once you've assigned all the elements to their respective categories and positions, fill in the table.

Here's the final solution table:

34. The person who's hobby is video-games is between the person who's sport is snowboarding and the person who's sport is rowing (26), so the person who's sport is snowboarding can be in the 3rd position, and the person who's sport is rowing can be in the 4th position. The person who's hobby is video-games is not the freelancer (9), so it must be in the 5th position.

2. Let's start with the given clues:

   1. The Turkish is the owner of the rabbit, so we can place the Turkish under Nationality 4 and the rabbit under Pet 4.
   2. The person watching sports movies is somewhere between the person drinking sprite and the person driving the tram. Since there are 6 people, this means the sports fan is either 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the sports fan temporarily in position 4 (we'll confirm later).
   3. The person drinking water is on the right of the accountant. Since the accountant is in position 1, we can place the water drinker in position 2.
   4. The person watching horror movies is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the person watching disaster movies. Since we don't know the position of the frog owner yet, we can't place the horror fan yet.

Now we have filled most of the table:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |      4      |     5      |    6     |
| Beverage      |          |             |            |             |            | soy-milk |

We still need to place the beverages, the person watching horror movies, and the person driving the tram.

Let's place the person watching horror movies in position 2 (Movie-Genre 2). Since the horror movie watcher is to the right of the American, the person driving the tram must be in position 3 (Transport 3).

Since the person driving the tram is in position 3, the person watching horror movies is in position 2.

The person watching horror movies is drinking almond-milk (Beverage 2).

The person driving the tram is drinking milk (Beverage 3).

The person watching sports movies is in position 4 (Movie-Genre 4). Since the sports fan is to the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk, the sports fan can't be in position 1 or 6. So, the sports fan is in position 5.

The person drinking sprite is in position 6 (Beverage 6). Since the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person driving the skateboard, the skateboard driver must be in position 5.

The person driving the skateboard is a fan of gospel (Music-Genre 5).

The person driving the bus is a fan of pop (Music-Genre 2).

The person drinking mirinda is in position 3 (Beverage 3). Since the person drinking mirinda is to the right of the fisherman, the fisherman must be in position 4.

The fisherman is a fan of fantasy movies (Movie-Genre 4).

The person drinking soy-milk is in position 5 (Beverage 5). Since the soy-milk drinker is to the right of the Indonesian, the Indonesian can't be in position 6. So, the Indonesian is in position 4.

The Indonesian is a fan of jazz (Music-Genre 4).

The person drinking milk is in position 6 (Beverage 6). Since the person drinking milk is the person drinking milk, no new information is provided.

The person watching action movies is in position 1 (Movie-Genre 1). Since the Polish is to the right of the person watching action movies, the person watching action movies can't be the Polish. So, the person watching action movies is the Italian (since the Italian is the only one left).

The Italian is a fan of action movies (Movie-Genre 3).

The person driving the jet-ski is in position 4 (Transport 4). Since the person driving the jet-ski is to the right of the fan of jazz, the fan of jazz must be in position 3.

The fan of jazz is a firefighter (Job 6).

The person driving the van is in position 5 (Transport 5). Since the person driving the van is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski, the person driving the van can't be the Polish (since the Polish is the only one left). So, the person driving the van is the Thai.

The Thai is driving the van (Transport 5).

The person driving the ship is in position 6 (Transport 6). Since the person driving the ship is to the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski, the person driving the ship can't be the Thai (since the Thai is the only one left). So, the person driving the ship is the American.

The American is driving the ship (Transport 1).

Now we have filled the entire table:

Lv7-7x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the food, hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, sports, and transport to the positions in the table.

1. Since the fan of jazz is in an even position, it can't be in position 1 or 7. So, it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 2 (Jazz).

2. The fan of gospel is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is in position 7, gospel must be in position 8 or 9. Let's assume it's in position 8 (Gospel).

3. The person who's hobby is card-games is not the person who's sport is swimming. Since swimming is not yet assigned, let's assume it's in position 6 (Swimming). So, card-games can't be in position 6. It must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume it's in position 1 (Card-games).

4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is not the person driving the bike. Since the bike is not yet assigned, it can't be in position 7. So, woodworking can't be in position 7.
