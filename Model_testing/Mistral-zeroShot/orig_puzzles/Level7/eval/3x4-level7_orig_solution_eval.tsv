Lv7-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 music-genres, 4 nationalities, and 4 sports. So, each row and each column should have one unique value.

2. Let's start with the Music-Genre row. Since the Thai is a fan of Disco, Disco must be in the 3rd column (1st row is already taken). Classical must be in the 1st column (2nd row is the far right), Country in the 2nd column, and Funk in the 4th column.

3. Now, let's fill the Nationality column. The Brazilian is in an odd position (3, 1, 3 are odd), so the Brazilian is in the 3rd row. Since the Italian is not the fan of Classical, the Italian cannot be in the 2nd row. So, the Italian must be in the 1st row (leaving the 4th row for the Colombian).

4. Now, let's fill the Sport column. The person who's sport is Badminton is between the fan of Country and the fan of Disco, so Badminton must be in the 2nd row. The person who's sport is Ice-Hockey is on the left or right of the Brazilian, so Ice-Hockey must be in the 1st or 3rd row. Since the person who's sport is Rugby is not the Thai, it cannot be in the 3rd row. So, Rugby must be in the 4th row. This leaves Sailing for the 1st row.

5. Now, we have the following table:

   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country | Disco | Funk  |
   |------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|
   | Nationality | Brazil   | Italian | Thai  | Colombian|
   | Sport      | Sailing  | Badminton| Ice-Hockey | Rugby |

6. The person who's sport is Ice-Hockey is on the left of the Brazilian, so Ice-Hockey is in the 1st row.

7. The person who's sport is Rugby is on the left or right of the fan of Funk, so Rugby is in the 4th column.

8. Now, we have the final table:

   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country | Disco | Funk  |
   |------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|
   | Nationality | Brazil   | Italian | Thai  | Colombian|
   | Sport      | Sailing  | Badminton| Ice-Hockey | Rugby |

   So, the final table is:

   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country | Disco | Funk  |
   |------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|
   | Nationality | Brazil   | Italian | Thai  | Colombian|
   | Sport      | Sailing  | Badminton| Ice-Hockey | Rugby |

   This table satisfies all the given conditions. So, the final solution is:

   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country | Disco | Funk  |
   |------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|
   | Nationality | Brazil   | Italian | Thai  | Colombian|
   | Sport      | Sailing  | Badminton| Ice-Hockey | Rugby |

Lv7-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 items in each category, we can represent the positions with numbers from 1 to 4.

2. From point 2, the person eating blueberry (Nigerian) must be in an odd position. So, Blueberry cannot be in position 1 or 4.

3. From point 3, the person drinking sprite is not the person eating cauliflower. Since there are only 4 items, sprite cannot be in position 1 (as it would be next to cauliflower in position 2). So, Sprite cannot be in position 1.

4. From point 4, the person drinking water is the person eating pepper. Since the person eating pepper is the polish (from point 6), Water must be in position 3 (as it is the only position left for Pepper).

5. From point 5, the person eating blueberry (Nigerian) is the nigerian. Since we know that Blueberry is not in position 1 or 4, and it's not in position 2 (as it would be next to Sprite), Blueberry must be in position 4.

6. From point 6, the person eating pepper is the polish. Since we know that Pepper is in position 3, the Polish is in position 3.

7. From point 7, the person drinking sprite is on the right of the Mexican. Since we know that Sprite is not in position 1, Sprite must be in position 2 or 4. But if Sprite was in position 4, it would be on the left of the Mexican (as the Mexican is the only one left to be placed), which contradicts point 7. So, Sprite must be in position 2.

8. From point 8, the person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the Mexican. Since we know that Blueberry is on the far left (position 4), Raspberry cannot be in position 1 (as it would be on the far right). So, Raspberry must be in position 2 or 3. But if Raspberry was in position 2, it would be on the left of the Mexican (as the Mexican is the only one left to be placed), which contradicts point 8. So, Raspberry must be in position 3.

9. From point 9, the person drinking 7up is somewhere between the person eating raspberry and the person drinking sprite. Since we know that Raspberry is in position 3 and Sprite is in position 2, 7up must be in position 1 or 2 or 4. But if 7up was in position 1, it would be on the left of Raspberry (as Raspberry is in position 3), which contradicts point 9. So, 7up must be in position 4.

10. From point 10, the nigerian (who is eating Blueberry) is on the left or right of the person eating pepper. Since we know that Blueberry is in position 4 and Pepper is in position 3, the nigerian (Blueberry) can be in position 2 or 4. But if the nigerian was in position 2, it would contradict point 2 (as the positions are numbered from 1 to 4 and 2 is an even position). So, the nigerian must be in position 4.

Lv7-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the bus is on the far right (3rd position) and the boat is to its right (4th position), the bus driver's nationality and hobby, as well as the boat driver's nationality and hobby can be filled in.

2. The person with the hobby of fishing is in the even positions. Since the bus driver is in the 3rd position, the person with the hobby of fishing must be in the 2nd or 4th position. However, since the bus driver is on the far right, the person with the hobby of fishing cannot be in the 4th position (as that would place the bus driver in the 3rd position again). So, the person with the hobby of fishing is in the 2nd position.

3. Now we know the nationality and hobby of the bus and boat drivers. Let's fill in the nationalities of the other people based on the given clues. The American cannot be in the 1st position (as per clue 4), so they must be in the 3rd or 4th position. Since the bus driver is American, the American cannot be the boat driver. So, the American must be in the 4th position. The Dutch cannot be in the 1st position (as per clue 8), so they must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. Since the Dutch cannot be the American or the boat driver, they must be in the 2nd position. The Russian cannot be in the 1st position (as per clue 4), so they must be in the 3rd or 4th position. Since the Russian cannot be the American or the boat driver, they must be in the 3rd position. The Nationalities are now filled.

4. Now let's fill in the hobbies. Since the person with the hobby of fishing is in the 2nd position and the person with the hobby of camping is to the left of the person with the hobby of board-games (clue 8), the hobby of camping must be in the 1st position. The hobby of board-games must be in the 4th position (as the person with the hobby of fishing is in the 2nd position and the Dutch are in the 2nd position). The hobby of writing cannot be in the 1st or 4th position (as those are already filled), so it must be in the 3rd position. The hobby of camping is in the 1st position, so the person with the hobby of camping is Dutch. The hobby of board-games is in the 4th position, so the person with the hobby of board-games is American. The hobby of fishing is in the 2nd position, so the person with the hobby of fishing is Nigerian. The hobby of writing is in the 3rd position, so the person with the hobby of writing is Russian. The hobbies are now filled.

5. Finally, let's fill in the transport. Since the American is driving the bus, the American is driving the bus. The Dutch cannot be driving the boat (as the boat is to the right of the bus), so the Dutch must be driving the bike. The Russian cannot be driving the taxi (as the taxi is to the left of the bike), so the Russian must be driving the boat. The person with the hobby of fishing cannot be driving the taxi (as per clue 5), so the person with the hobby of camping must be driving the taxi. The person with the hobby of writing cannot be driving the boat (as the boat is driven by the Russian), so the person with the hobby of writing must be driving the boat. The person with the hobby of camping is driving the taxi, so they are Dutch. The person with the hobby of writing is driving the boat, so they are Russian. The person with the hobby of fishing is not driving any transport (as they are not driving the taxi), so they are not driving any transport. The person with the hobby of board-games is American and is not driving any transport (as the bus is driven by the American), so they are not driving any transport. The transport is now filled.

The final solution table is:

Lv7-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 music genres, 4 nationalities, and 4 means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. The fan of jazz is on the far right, so Jazz = 4.

3. The indian is the person driving the motorbike, so Indian = Motorbike = 2.

4. The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the motorbike, so Airplane > 2. Since there are only 4 options, Airplane = 3. The argentine is the person driving the airplane, so Argentine = Airplane = 3.

5. The fan of gospel is the person driving the motorbike, so Gospel = Motorbike = 2.

6. The mexican is the fan of salsa, so Mexican = Salsa = 1.

7. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of blues. Since we already know the positions of Jazz (4), Gospel (2), and Salsa (1), the only possible position for Blues is 3. So, Blues = 3.

8. The person driving the ship is somewhere between the fan of gospel and the fan of jazz. Since we know the positions of Gospel (2) and Jazz (4), the only possible position for Ship is 3. So, Ship = 3.

Now we have the nationalities: Argentine (3), Indian (2), Mexican (1), and we don't know the nationality for the person driving the ship (3). However, since we don't need to know the nationalities for our final answer, we can fill the table with any nationality for the person driving the ship.

The final table is:

  |               |     1     |     2     |    3    |     4     |

| Nationality   | Any      | Indian   | Argentine| Mexican  |
| Transport     | Ship     | Motorbike| Airplane | Quad-bike|

Since we don't know the nationality for the person driving the ship, we can't fill it with a specific nationality. So, the final solution table is:

3. The fan of blues (B) is in an even position, so B is either in the second (2) or fourth (4) position. Since B is not the person drinking lemonade (1), B cannot be in the first position. So, B must be in the fourth position (4).

4. The person drinking cola (C) is not the fan of reggae, so C cannot be in the fourth position (4). Also, C is somewhere between the fan of country (Cn) and the person drinking fanta (F). Since C cannot be in the fourth position, C must be in the second position.

Lv7-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different nationalities, so each nationality must be assigned to a unique row. Let's assign them row by row from top to bottom: British (1), Egyptian (4), Colombian (3), and Chinese (2).

2. We know that the Egyptian is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since there are 4 different hobbies, the hobbies must be assigned to columns from left to right: Chess (1), Filmmaking (2), Magic-tricks (4), and Photography (3).

3. Now we know that the Egyptian is in row 4 and column 4 (Magic-tricks).

4. Since the Egyptian is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess, the Chess player must be in row 1, 2, or 3. But since the Colombian is to the right of the 7up drinker (who we will assign the Chess hobby), the Chess player cannot be in row 3. So, the Chess player is in row 1 or 2. Let's assume the Chess player is in row 1 (Column 1).

5. We know that the person drinking 7up is the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the Chess player is in row 1, the Filmmaker must be in row 2 or 3. But since the Colombian is to the right of the 7up drinker, the Filmmaker cannot be in row 3. So, the Filmmaker is in row 2 (Column 2). This means the 7up drinker is in row 1 (Column 2).

6. Since the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking lemonade, the Lemonade drinker must be in column 1, 3, or 4. But since the Lemonade drinker is not British (from point 8), the Lemonade drinker cannot be in column 1. So, the Lemonade drinker is in column 3 or 4. But since the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking fanta (from point 7), the Lemonade drinker cannot be in column 4. So, the Lemonade drinker is in column 3 (Row 1, 2, or 4). Let's assume the Lemonade drinker is in row 1 (Column 3).

7. Now we know that the person drinking soy-milk is in column 1, 2, or 4. But since the person drinking lemonade is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk (from point 4), the soy-milk drinker cannot be in column 1. So, the soy-milk drinker is in column 2 or 4. But since the person drinking fanta is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk (from point 7), the soy-milk drinker cannot be in column 4. So, the soy-milk drinker is in column 2 (Row 1, 3, or 4). Let's assume the soy-milk drinker is in row 4 (Column 2).

8. Now we know that the Chinese is in row 2. Since the person drinking fanta is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk, the Fanta drinker must be in column 3 or 4. But since the person drinking lemonade is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (from point 4), the Fanta drinker cannot be in column 3. So, the Fanta drinker is in column 4 (Row 2, 3, or 4). But since the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking lemonade (from point 6), the Fanta drinker cannot be in row 2. So, the Fanta drinker is in row 3 or 4. Let's assume the Fanta drinker is in row 3 (Column 4).

9. Now we know that the British is not the Lemonade drinker (from point 8). Since the British cannot be in row 1 (because the Egyptian is in row 1), the British must be in row 2, 3, or 4. But since the person drinking fanta is in row 3, the British cannot be in row 3. So, the British is in row 2 or 4. But since the person drinking soy-milk is in row 4, the British cannot be in row 4. So, the British is in row 2 (Column 1).

So, the final solution table is:

|               |       British       |     Fanta     |      Soy-milk      |       Lemonade      |

Lv7-3x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the motorbike is to the left of the person driving the airplane, we can place them in the first three columns (1, 2, or 3). Let's place the motorbike driver in column 1.

2. The owner of the goat is to the right of the doctor. Since the motorbike driver is in the first column, the goat owner must be in the last three columns (3, 4, or 5). Let's place the goat owner in column 4.

3. The owner of the dog is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the goat. Since the goat owner is in column 4, the goldfish owner must be in column 2 or 3. Let's place the goldfish owner in column 2.

4. The doctor is to the right of the musician. Since the goat owner is in column 4, the doctor must be in column 5.

5. The musician is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the airplane. Since the motorbike driver is in column 1, the quad-bike driver must be in column 3, and the airplane driver must be in column 5.

6. The person driving the train is in an even position. Since the motorbike driver is in column 1, the quad-bike driver is in column 3, and the airplane driver is in column 5, the train driver must be in column 2 or 4. Let's place the train driver in column 2.

7. The owner of the frog is to the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish owner is in column 2, the frog owner must be in column 1.

8. The librarian is to the left of the owner of the dog. Since the dog owner is between the goldfish owner (column 2) and the goat owner (column 4), the librarian must be in column 1.

9. Now we have the following arrangement:

   | Transport  |         |         |          |             |

10. The person driving the train is to the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver is in column 1, the train driver must be in column 2 or 3. However, the train driver is already in column 2. So, the train driver must be in column 3, and the motorbike driver must be in column 1.

11. Now the arrangement is:

    | Job         |     1     |    2     |     3     |      4       |

12. The person driving the quad-bike is between the musician and the airplane driver. Since the musician is in column 2 and the airplane driver is in column 5, the quad-bike driver must be in column 3 or 4. However, the quad-bike driver is already in column 3. So, the quad-bike driver must be in column 4, and the musician must be in column 2.

13. Now the arrangement is:

    |------------|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
    | Job        | Motorbike| Musician | Train     |   Goat      |
    | Pet        |  Frog    |         |          |   Dog       |
    | Transport  |         |         |          |             |

14. The doctor is to the right of the musician. Since the musician is in column 2, the doctor must be in column 3 or 4. However, the doctor is already in column 5. So, there seems to be a contradiction here. The given conditions cannot be satisfied.

Therefore, the puzzle has no valid solution.

Final answer: The puzzle has no valid solution."	{}	False	0	False
Lv7-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the hobbies and movie genres, so we can fill in the first row with the hobbies and the second row with the movie genres.

2. The owner of the lizard is the person who's hobby is dancing, so we can place dancing in the third column of the first row and lizard in the first column of the third row.

3. The owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we know the position of the lizard and dancing, we can place gardening in the fourth column of the first row. Now, we can place fish in the second column of the second row, but we don't know yet which pet is in the first column of the second row.

4. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we know the position of the lizard, dancing, and gardening, we can place rat in the first column of the third row.

5. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Since we know the position of the gardening, we can place martial-arts in the second column of the second row and horror in the third column of the second row.

6. The person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since we know the position of martial-arts and horror, we can place musical in the first column of the second row.

7. The person watching horror movies is somewhere between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person watching spy movies. Since we know the position of martial-arts and horror, we can place spy in the fourth column of the second row.

8. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left. Since we know the position of musical, martial-arts, horror, and gardening, we can place board-games in the first column of the first row.

9. The person watching horror movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard. Since we know the position of horror, we can't place it to the right of the lizard (because the lizard is the owner of the dancing hobby and we already placed it in the first column of the third row). So, horror must be in the fourth column of the second row.

10. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog. Since we know the position of board-games, gardening, and dancing, we can place drawing in the second column of the first row. Now, we know that the hedgehog can't be in the first column of the third row (because the lizard is already there), so the hedgehog must be in the second column of the third row.

Now, we have filled all the positions except for the first column of the second row. Since we know that the person watching musical movies is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies, and we know the position of musical and martial-arts, the only possible position for the first column of the second row is fish.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |      1      |      2       |    3    |     4     |

Lv7-3x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Let's denote A for animation, S for superhero, C for crime, H for horror, and P for papaya, G for goat, D for dog, Cg for chinchilla, and B for blueberry, Bb for broccoli, and Pp for papaya.

2. From point 1, we can write A < S.

3. The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating broccoli. So, we can write BbC or CBb.

4. The owner of the dog is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. So, D is to the right of Cg.

5. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere between the person watching animation movies and the person eating asparagus. So, A < S < Asp or Asp < S < A.

6. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating blueberry. So, B < S.

7. The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goldfish. So, Cg < G.

8. The owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies. So, A < G.

9. The owner of the dog is on the left of the person watching crime movies. So, D < C.

10. The owner of the goat is on the left of the person eating papaya. So, G < Pp.

Now, let's arrange the table:

|               |     1      |     2     |     3     |    4     |
| Food          |           |           |           |          |
| Movie-Genre   |           |           |           |          |
| Pet           |           |           |           |          |

We know A < S, B < S, D < C, Cg < G, A < G, and D < C.

Let's place Asparagus (Asp) in the first row, as it has to be on the left of S. Let's place A in the first column and S in the second column. So, we have Asp in the first row and A in the first column.

Now, we know A < S < Asp. Let's place Blueberry (B) in the third column as it is to the left of S. So, we have B in the third column.

Now, we know B < S. Let's place Broccoli (Bb) in the fourth column as it is to the right of B. So, we have Bb in the fourth column.

Now, we know A < G and D < C. Let's place Dog (D) in the second row and Crime (C) in the second column. So, we have D in the second row and C in the second column.

Now, we know D < C. Let's place Chinchilla (Cg) in the first row and Animation (A) in the first column. So, we have Cg in the first row and A in the first column.

Now, we know Cg < G. Let's place Goat (G) in the third row. So, we have G in the third row.

Now, we know A < G. Let's place Papaya (Pp) in the fourth row. So, we have Pp in the fourth row.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Asparagus |   Animation |   Chinchilla |   Broccoli  |
|            |            |             |            |

Lv7-3x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is surfing is not the person driving the scooter. Let's place surfing in a position where it's not the scooter driver.

2. The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since we've placed surfing, let's place weightlifting in the leftmost position.

3. The italian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since we've placed surfing and weightlifting, let's place Italian in the third position (as the second person from the right).

4. The person driving the boat is not the egyptian. Since we've placed weightlifting, surfing, and Italian, let's place the boat driver in the second position (as the person who does baseball or water-polo).

5. The malaysian is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since we've placed weightlifting, surfing, Italian, and the boat driver, let's place Malaysian in the fourth position (as the person who does water-polo or snowmobile).

6. The brazilian is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since we've placed weightlifting, surfing, Italian, the boat driver, and Malaysian, the only position left for the brazilian is the first position (doing baseball).

7. The person driving the snowmobile is not the brazilian (as the brazilian is in the first position). Since we've placed weightlifting, surfing, Italian, the boat driver, and Malaysian, the only position left for the snowmobile driver is the fifth position.

8. Now we know that the person who does water-polo is Malaysian.

Final solution table:
