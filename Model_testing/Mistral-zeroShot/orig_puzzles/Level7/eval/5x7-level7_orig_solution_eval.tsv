Lv7-5x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, we know the Malaysian is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the Malaysian is on the far left (since we can always swap positions if needed). So, the Malaysian is in position 1, and the guinea-pig owner is 1.

2. From rule 1, we know there are 7 different beverages. Since the Malaysian is drinking tea (from rule 10), the beverage in position 6 must be different. So, let's assume position 6 is cola.

3. From rule 21, we know the person drinking mirinda is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the guinea-pig (Malaysian). Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the bird owner must be in position 2 and the mirinda drinker in position 3.

4. From rule 19, we know the architect is to the left of the person drinking cola (position 6). So, the architect cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. The architect must be in position 5.

Lv7-5x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the seven positions (1-7) and the seven people (A-G).

2. We can start by placing the people based on the given clues. For example, we know that the fan of dubstep is to the right of the person drinking cola (clue 2), so we can place the person drinking cola in an odd position (clue 22) and the fan of dubstep to its right. Let's say the person drinking cola is in position 1 (A), so the fan of dubstep is in position 3 (C).

3. We can continue placing people based on other clues. For example, the owner of the cat is to the right of the person playing cricket (clue 3), so the person playing cricket must be to the left of the owner of the cat. If the person playing cricket is in position 2 (B), then the owner of the cat is in position 4 (D).

4. We can use the information from one clue to help solve other clues. For example, we know that the fan of soul is not the person watching musical movies (clue 1), so the person watching musical movies cannot be the fan of soul. If the person watching musical movies is in position 5 (E), then the fan of soul cannot be in positions 1-4, so it must be in position 6 (F).

5. We can continue this process, using each clue to eliminate possible positions for the remaining people. For example, we know that the person drinking fanta is not the fan of pop (clue 8), so the fan of pop cannot be in positions 1-6. Since there are only two remaining positions (7 and A), the fan of pop must be in position 7 (G).

6. Once we have placed all the people, we can fill in the remaining information (beverages, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, sports) based on the given clues.

After a lot of deduction and elimination, here is the final solution table:

```

The table is not complete because we don't know the jobs, music genres, nationalities, and pets for positions 3, 6, and 4 respectively. However, we know that the person in position 3 drinks sprite, the person in position 6 is a software-developer, and the person in position 4 is the pakistani. We also know that the person in position 3 prefers funk, the person in position 6 is a firefighter, and the person in position 4 is a fan of house. The rest of the information is not specified in the puzzle.

However, since we have enough information to uniquely determine the positions of the American, the dancer, the fan of dubstep, the mexican, the pakistani, the software-developer, the firefighter, and the Malaysian, we can conclude that the table is consistent with the given information.

Lv7-5x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's find the positions of the nationalities:

Lv7-5x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's assign some variables to make it easier to reason about the puzzle:

- M: Movie-Genre (adventure, animation, drama, epic, fantasy, martial-arts, western)
- N: Nationality (argentine, brazilian, colombian, dutch, egyptian, nigerian, thai)
- P: Pet (cat, frog, hedgehog, lizard, mouse, pony, rabbit)
- S: Sport (climbing, golf, parkour, skateboarding, soccer, surfing, tennis)
- T: Transport (airplane, bike, quad-bike, roller, snowmobile, train, van)

Let's start by finding the position of the brazilian, as we know their sport is soccer:

1. The brazilian is in an even position because there are 7 nationalities, and the owner of the mouse is in an odd position (1. #4). So, the brazilian cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.
2. The brazilian is not in position 6 because the person watching adventure movies is not the person driving the airplane (17.).
3. The brazilian is not in position 2 because the person who's sport is golf is not the owner of the frog (19.).
4. The brazilian is not in position 4 because the owner of the mouse is in an odd position (1.).

The only remaining even position is 6, so the brazilian is in position 6.

Now, let's find the position of the owner of the mouse:

1. The owner of the mouse is in an odd position (1.).
2. The owner of the mouse is not in position 4 because the brazilian is in position 6 (the brazilian's position is known now).
3. The owner of the mouse is not in position 1, 3, or 5 because the brazilian is in position 6, and the owner of the mouse must be to the left of the brazilian (22.).

The only remaining odd position is 7.
