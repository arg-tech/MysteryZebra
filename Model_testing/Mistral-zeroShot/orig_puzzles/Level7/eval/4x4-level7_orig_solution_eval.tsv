Lv7-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Colombian is either to the left or right of the owner of the horse (##3). Let's assume the Colombian is on the left of the horse owner (Column 1 or 2).

2. The owner of the horse is on the right of the fan of trance (Column 3 or 4). Since the Colombian is on the left of the horse owner, the fan of trance must be in Column 1, 2, or 4.

3. The fan of blues is on the far left or far right (Column 1 or 4). Since the fan of trance is in Column 1, the fan of blues must be in Column 4.

4. The owner of the rabbit is the Russian (Column 2). Since the fan of blues is in Column 4, the Russian (rabbit owner) cannot be in Column 4. So, the Russian must be in Column 1 or 3.

5. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train (Column 1, 2, or 3 is the bike, and Column 2, 3, or 4 is the train). Since the fan of blues is in Column 4, the train cannot be in Column 4. So, the train must be in Column 1, 2, or 3. The bike cannot be in Column 4 either, so it must be in Column 1, 2, or 3 as well.

6. The Colombian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship (Column 1, 2, or 3 is the ship). Since the train and bike are in Columns 1, 2, or 3, the ship cannot be in Column 1. So, the ship is in Column 2 or 3.

7. The owner of the dog is on the far left (Column 1). Since the ship is in Column 2 or 3, the dog cannot be in Column 2 or 3. So, the dog is in Column 1.

8. The person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the Russian (Column 1, 2, or 3 is the train, and Column 2 is the Russian). Since the dog is in Column 1, the train cannot be in Column 1. So, the train is in Column 2 or 3.

9. The person driving the tram is the owner of the rabbit (Column 2). Since the train is in Column 2 or 3, the tram cannot be in Column 2 or 3. So, the tram is in Column 1.

10. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere between the person driving the bike and the fan of blues (Column 1, 2, or 3 is the bike, Column 4 is the fan of blues, and Column 2 is the rabbit owner). Since the dog is in Column 1, the rabbit owner (tram driver) cannot be in Column 1. So, the rabbit owner is in Column 2 or 3. Since the train is in Column 2, the rabbit owner (tram driver) cannot be in Column 3. So, the rabbit owner (tram driver) is in Column 2.

11. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the horse (Column 2 is the rabbit owner, and Column 3 is the horse owner). So, the horse owner is in Column 1.

12. The turkish is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram (Column 1 is the tram, Column 2 is the rabbit owner, so Column 3 or 4 is the Turkish). Since the horse owner is in Column 1, the Turkish cannot be in Column 1. So, the Turkish is in Column 3 or 4.

13. The fan of jazz is on the left or right of the Spanish (Column 1, 2, or 4 is the fan of jazz, and Column 3 is the Spanish). Since the Turkish is in Column 3 or 4, the fan of jazz cannot be in Column 3. So, the fan of jazz is in Column 1 or 4. Since the dog is in Column 1, the fan of jazz cannot be in Column 1. So, the fan of jazz is in Column 4.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |   Dog     |  Rabbit |  Horse  |  Jazz   |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Russian | Turkish | Spanish |
| Pet           |         |        |        |        |
| Transport     |  Bike    |  Tram   |  Train  |  Ship   |

We still need to fill in the pets. Since the dog is in Column 1, the cat, horse, and rabbit must be in Columns 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |   Dog     |  Cat    |  Horse  |  Jazz   |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Russian | Turkish | Spanish |
| Pet           |         |  Rabbit |        |        |
| Transport     |  Bike    |  Tram   |  Train  |  Ship   |

However, we don't have enough information to determine the specific music genre for each person. So, the final solution table with the music genres is:

|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |   Dog     |  ?      |  ?      |  Jazz   |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Russian | Turkish | Spanish |
| Pet           |         |  Rabbit |        |        |
| Transport     |  Bike    |  Tram   |  Train  |  Ship   |

Where the question marks represent the unknown music genres."	{'music-genre': ['dog', '?', '?', 'jazz'], 'nationality': ['colombian', 'russian', 'turkish', 'spanish'], 'pet': ['', 'rabbit', '', ''], 'transport': ['bike', 'tram', 'train', 'ship']}	True	3	False
Lv7-4x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that weightlifting is to the left of ice-hockey. Let's place weightlifting (W) in the first position and ice-hockey (I) in the second position.

2. From rule 2, the Indonesian (Ind) is to the right of the Italian (It). Since we already have two people, let's place It in the third position and Ind in the fourth position.

3. From rule 3, the person watching thriller movies (Thr) is to the right of the person eating watermelon (WM). Since we have four positions filled, the watermelon eater must be in the second position. So, WM is in position 2 and Thr is in position 3 or 4.

4. From rule 4, the Australian (Aus) is the person playing volleyball (V). Since we know the position of the Indonesian, the Australian must be in the first, third, or fifth position. However, since the Australian is playing volleyball, which is a sport to the right of weightlifting (according to rule 11), the Australian cannot be in the first position. So, Aus is in the third or fifth position, and V is in the first or fifth position.

5. From rule 5, the crime movie watcher (Cr) is on the left or right of the Indonesian. Since we know the position of the Indonesian, the crime movie watcher must be in the first, second, or fourth position. However, since the crime movie watcher is to the right of the Indonesian (according to rule 5), the crime movie watcher cannot be in the first position. So, Cr is in the second or fourth position.

6. From rule 6, the Chinese (Ch) is to the right of the person eating onion (On). Since we have five positions filled, the onion eater must be in the fourth position. So, On is in position 4.

7. From rule 7, the watermelon eater is between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the Australian. Since we know the position of the watermelon eater and the Australian, the person playing ice-hockey must be in the first position. So, I is in position 1.

8. From rule 8, the person eating apricot (Ap) is in an odd position. Since we have filled the first four positions, Ap must be in the fifth position.

9. From rule 9, the person eating apricot is to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since we know the position of the person playing ice-hockey, the person eating apricot must be in the third position.

10. From rule 10, the person watching time-travel movies (TT) is to the right of the person who's sport is golf (G). Since we have filled all the positions, the person playing golf must be in the first position. So, G is in position 1.

Now, let's put everything together:

|               |     1     |      2      |       3       |     4      |
| Food          |   G       |   WM        |   Ap         |   On       |
| Movie-Genre   |   TT      |   Thr       |   -          |   Cr       |
| Nationality   |   Ch      |   -         |   It         |   Ind      |
| Sport         |   G       |   I         |   V          |   W        |

We still have a missing food for the third position. Since we know the nationality and movie genre of the third person, we can deduce the food they eat. Let's assume the third person eats mango (M).

|               |     1     |      2      |       3       |     4      |
| Food          |   G       |   WM        |   M           |   On       |

Lv7-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 jobs, 4 movie-genres, 4 nationalities, and 4 pets. This means each row and each column should have one unique value.

2. From clue 10, we know the owner of the lizard is not the person watching zombie movies, so the person watching zombie movies cannot be on the right of the owner of the lizard.

3. From clue 11, we know the designer is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the owner of the lizard is not the person watching martial-arts movies (clue 11), the designer cannot be the owner of the lizard.

4. From clue 12, we know the russian is the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the lizard is not the Russian (as the lizard is not a horse), the lizard cannot be owned by the Russian.

5. From clue 2, we know the owner of the lizard is somewhere between the bartender and the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the lizard cannot be the Russian (clue 4), the person watching martial-arts movies cannot be the Russian either. So, the person watching martial-arts movies must be on the right of the bartender.

6. From clue 5, we know the German is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is not the German (as the German cannot be on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies, and the left is already occupied by the bartender), the person watching zombie movies must be on the left of the bartender.

7. From clue 9, we know the bartender is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching zombie movies is on the left of the bartender, the person watching crime movies must be on the right of the bartender.

8. From clue 8, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is not the social-worker. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the bartender, and the person watching crime movies is on the right of the bartender, the social-worker must be on the left of the bartender.

9. From clue 4, we know the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the social-worker. Since the social-worker is on the left of the bartender, the owner of the dog can be either on the left of the social-worker or on the right of the bartender.

10. From clue 6, we know the owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching crime movies is on the right of the bartender, and the social-worker is on the left of the bartender, the person watching action movies must be on the left of the bartender. So, the owner of the dog cannot be on the right of the bartender.

11. Now we know the owner of the dog is on the left of the social-worker. Since the person watching action movies is on the left of the bartender, and the owner of the dog is on the left of the social-worker, the owner of the dog must be the person watching action movies.

12. From clue 3, we know the designer is Polish. Since the designer is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies, and the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the bartender, the designer must be on the left of the bartender.

13. From clue 7, we know the project-manager is not the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching crime movies is on the right of the bartender, the project-manager must be on the left of the bartender.

14. Now we have placed all the jobs. The only remaining positions are for movie-genres, nationalities, and pets. Since each row and each column should have one unique value, we can fill in the remaining cells based on the information we have.

Lv7-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Let's place the crime movie person (C) and rock-climbing person (R) in the first two spots.

| Beverage      |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

2. The scientist is the person drinking almond-milk (A). Since the person drinking almond-milk is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk (S), A must be in the first three spots. Let's place A in the first spot.

| Beverage      |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

3. The person drinking mirinda (M) is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite (S). Since A is already in the first three spots, M must be in the first two spots. But M can't be in the first spot because A is already there, so M must be in the second spot.

| Beverage      |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

5. The person who's hobby is cooking (Cook) is not the person watching crime movies (C). Since C is already in the first row, Cook can't be in the first four spots. So, Cook must be in the fifth spot.

| Beverage      |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

6. The person drinking soy-milk (Soy) is on the left of the person watching drama movies (D). Since Soy can't be in the first four spots, it must be in the fifth spot.

| Beverage      |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

7. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks (MT) is on the right of the project-manager (PM). Since Cook and Soy are already in the fifth spot, MT must be in the sixth spot.

| Beverage      |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

8. The police-officer (PO) is somewhere between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (MT) and the person who's hobby is cooking (Cook). Since PO can't be in the first five spots, it must be in the sixth spot.

| Beverage      |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

10. The mechanic (Mechanic) is not the person watching crime movies (C). Since C is already in the second spot, Mechanic can't be in the first or second spot. So, Mechanic must be in the third spot.

| Beverage      |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

Lv7-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 items in each category, so we can fill the first row with the beverages, second row with the foods, third row with nationalities, and fourth row with the transports.

2. From point 1, we know the french is on the left of the person eating spinach. Since the french can't be in the first position (because the french is not the person eating banana, which is not the turkish), the french must be in the second position. So, the second row should be: `######### | spinach | ########`

3. The person drinking almond-milk is the person eating cabbage. Since the french is not the person eating cabbage, the person drinking almond-milk can't be in the first or second position. So, the first row should be: `almond-milk | ######## | ########`

4. The person eating banana is not the turkish, so the turkish must be eating one of the remaining three foods. Since the french is not the person eating spinach, the turkish can't eat spinach. So, the third row should be: `######### | ######## | ######## | turkish`

5. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is on the far left (point 7), the person driving the trike can't be in the first position. So, the fourth row should be: `######### | ######## | ######## | ########`

6. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski (points 10 and 15). Since the person driving the ship is on the far left (point 7), the person driving the jet-ski can't be in the first position. So, the fourth row should be: `ship | ######## | ######## | jet-ski`

7. The person driving the roller is somewhere between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the trike (point 9). Since the person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski (point 10), the person driving the roller can't be in the first position. So, the fourth row should be: `ship | roller | jet-ski | trike`

8. The person drinking soy-milk is the person driving the jet-ski (point 8). So, the first row should be: `soy-milk | ######## | ######## | ########`

9. The person drinking tea is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the person eating spinach (point 12). Since the person drinking soy-milk is the person driving the jet-ski, the person drinking tea can't be in the fourth position. So, the second row should be: `######### | tea | ######## | spinach`

10. The person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the brazilian (point 13). Since the french is on the left of the person eating spinach, the brazilian can't be in the second position. So, the second row should be: `######### | cabbage | brazilian | spinach`

11. The only remaining food is broccoli, so the first row should be: `######### | ######## | ######## | ########`

Now, we have filled all the positions except for the first row (beverages). Since we know the person drinking soy-milk is the person driving the jet-ski, the only remaining beverage is milk. So, the first row should be: `milk | ######## | ######## | ########`

The final solution table is:

```
milk | ######## | ######## | ########
almond-milk | ######## | ######## | ########
soy-milk | ######## | ######## | ########
######### | cabbage | brazilian | spinach
ship | roller | jet-ski | trike
```

However, I can't fill the remaining positions because there is not enough information provided to determine the exact positions of the foods, nationalities, and transports. The given clues only allow us to place the beverages, the french, the turkish, the ship, the jet-ski, and the roller in their respective positions."	{}	False	0	False
Lv7-4x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the argentine is not the coffee drinker, they can't be in the first or third row. So, the argentine is either in the second or fourth row.

2. The journalist is on the left or right of the nurse. Since the argentine can't be in the first row (because the journalist can't be in the first row), the nurse can't be in the first column. So, the nurse is either in the second or fourth column.

3. The doctor is the almond-milk drinker. Since the argentine can't be in the first row, the almond-milk can't be in the first row either. So, the almond-milk is either in the second or fourth row.

4. The soy-milk drinker is on the left or right of the spinach eater. Since the almond-milk can't be in the first row, the spinach eater can't be in the first column. So, the spinach eater is either in the second or fourth column.

5. The pakistani is on the left of the broccoli eater. Since the almond-milk can't be in the first row, the broccoli eater can't be in the first column. So, the broccoli eater is either in the second or fourth column.

6. The pakistani is on the left of the almond-milk drinker. Since the almond-milk can't be in the first row, the pakistani can't be in the second column. So, the pakistani is in the first column, and the broccoli eater is in the second column.

7. The nurse is between the tea drinker and the almond-milk drinker. Since the almond-milk can't be in the first row, the nurse can't be in the first row either. So, the nurse is in the second or fourth row. Since the nurse is on the left or right of the journalist, the journalist can't be in the fourth row. So, the nurse is in the second row, and the journalist is in the fourth row.

8. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the japanese. Since the almond-milk can't be in the first row, the japanese can't be in the second row. So, the japanese is in the first or third row. Since the pakistani is on the left of the almond-milk drinker, the almond-milk drinker can't be in the fourth column. So, the almond-milk drinker is in the first column, and the japanese is in the third row.

9. The doctor is the italian. Since the almond-milk drinker is the doctor and the doctor is the italian, the almond-milk drinker is the italian.

10. The person eating broccoli is between the person eating spinach and the journalist. Since the broccoli eater is in the second column, the spinach eater must be in the first column, and the journalist must be in the fourth column.

11. The scientist is the person eating raspberry. Since the broccoli eater is in the second column, the raspberry eater must be in the third column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv7-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so each item in the table represents a person.

2. Let's assign the beverages to the people:
   - Person 1: Hot-chocolate (1st condition violated, so it can't be the person watching comedy movies)
   - Person 2: Cola
   - Person 3: Soy-milk (8th condition violated, so it can't be the owner of the dog)
   - Person 4: 7up (10th condition implies Person 3 drinks soy-milk, so Person 4 must drink 7up)

3. Now let's assign the movie genres:
   - Person 1: Adventure (12th condition violated, so it can't be the owner of the snake)
   - Person 2: Comedy (1st condition is already violated, so it can't be the person drinking hot-chocolate)
   - Person 3: Superhero (4th condition implies Person 4 drives the ship, so Person 3 must watch superhero movies)
   - Person 4: Family (2nd condition violated, so it can't be the owner of the turtle)

4. Now let's assign the pets:
   - Person 1: Dog (7th condition implies Person 2 or Person 4 drinks hot-chocolate, but Person 4 already has 7up, so Person 2 must drink hot-chocolate)
   - Person 2: Goldfish (6th condition implies Person 2 is in an odd position, so Person 1 must be the owner of the dog)
   - Person 3: Turtle (4th condition is already fulfilled, so Person 3 must be the owner of the turtle)
   - Person 4: Snake (14th condition implies Person 3 is in an even position, so Person 1 must be the owner of the snake)

5. Finally, let's assign the means of transport:
   - Person 1: Bus (9th condition is already fulfilled, so Person 1 must drive the bus)
   - Person 2: Quad-bike (5th condition violated, so it can't be the person watching comedy movies)
   - Person 3: Ship (4th condition is already fulfilled, so Person 3 drives the ship)
   - Person 4: Tram (13th condition implies Person 4 is between Person 1 and Person 3, but Person 1 and Person 3 already have their positions, so Person 4 must be the owner of the turtle, which is a contradiction. However, since there are only 4 positions, the only remaining option is that Person 4 drives the tram)

2. From rule 5, the fan of punk is on the far left, so we can fill in the first row with P for Punk.

3. From rule 12, the fan of dubstep is to the right of the fan of reggae, so the Music-Genre column cannot have Reggae in the first position. Let's fill in the second row with D for Dubstep.

4. From rule 10, the person eating lemon is the fan of reggae, so the Food column cannot have Lemon in the first position. Let's fill in the third row with L for Lemon.

5. From rule 13, the person drinking soy-milk is on the far left or far right. Since we already have Punk in the first position, Soy-Milk cannot be in the first or last position. Let's fill in the fourth row with S for Soy-Milk.

6. From rule 1, the Beverage column cannot have Mirinda in the first position because it's not the person eating Broccoli (rule 4). So, let's fill in the first column with H for Hot-Chocolate.

7. From rule 7, the person eating Apricot is the person drinking Juice. Since we already have Hot-Chocolate and Soy-Milk, Juice must be in the second position. So, the Beverage column is H, J, S, M.

8. From rule 3, the person eating Apricot is to the right of the fan of Reggae. Since we already have Lemon and Soy-Milk, Apricot must be in the third or fourth position. But since the person eating Apricot is also the person drinking Juice (rule 7), Apricot must be in the fourth position. So, the Food column is A, B, L, A.

9. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we already have Baking in the third position, Chess must be in the second position. So, the Hobby column is B, C, M, T.

11. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. So, the Hobby column is B, C, M, T.

12. From rule 6, the person eating Apricot is somewhere between the fan of Jazz and the person drinking Hot-Chocolate. Since we already have the positions of Apricot and Hot-Chocolate, Jazz must be in the first position. So, the Music-Genre column is J, D, P, R.

13. From rule 11, the fan of Jazz is not the person who's hobby is chess. Since we already have the positions of Jazz and Chess, the Hobby column is B, C, M, T.

14. From rule 4, the person drinking Mirinda is on the left or right of the person eating Broccoli. Since we already have the positions of Mirinda and Lemon, Broccoli must be in the second position. So, the Food column is A, B, L, A.

1. From point 10, the engineer must be in an even position, so they can't be in the first or last spot.

2. From point 11, the engineer is on the left or right of the nurse. Since the engineer can't be in the first position, the nurse must be in the first position.

3. From point 14, the mechanic is not the person eating onion. Since the nurse is in the first position, the mechanic can't be in the second position (as it would violate point 11). So, the mechanic must be in the third position.

4. From point 7, the engineer is to the right of the mechanic. So, the engineer must be in the fourth position.

So, the person drinking sprite must be in the second position.

9. From point 9, the person drinking sprite is between the person eating eggplant and the person eating tomato. Since the person eating eggplant is in the second position and the person drinking sprite is in the second position, the person eating tomato must be in the third position.

10. From point 2, the person drinking 7up is somewhere between the photographer and the person drinking water. Since the person drinking sprite is in the second position and the person eating tomato is in the third position, the person drinking 7up can't be in the fourth position (as it would violate point 3). So, the person drinking 7up must be in the fifth position.

11. From point 6, the photographer is to the left of the person drinking water. So, the photographer must be in the first position.

12. From point 8, the person driving the ship is on the right of the photographer. So, the person driving the ship must be in the sixth position.

13. From point 5, the person drinking 7up is to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the person drinking 7up is in the fifth position and the person driving the ship is in the sixth position, the person driving the taxi must be in the fourth position.

Since the Canadian is in the fourth position, the nationality in the fourth position must be Canadian. Since the Malaysian can't be in the first position, the Malaysian must be in the third position. Since the owner of the snake is between the Malaysian and the person who's hobby is camping, the nationality in the first position must be Thai (to the left of the Malaysian), and the nationality in the second position must be Italian.
