Lv7-5x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating strawberry is to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Let's place the strawberry eater in the last position (column 4). Since the sport of skiing is to the left, it must be in column 3.

2. The person who's hobby is board-games is to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, the board-games person must be in column 1 or 2, and the puzzles person in column 3 or 4. Since the person eating carrot is the person who's hobby is puzzles (from rule 7), the carrot eater must be in column 3.

3. The person watching horror movies is between the person driving the van and the person watching thriller movies. Since the van driver cannot be in the last position (as the strawberry eater is there), the van driver must be in column 1 or 2. If the van driver is in column 1, then the horror movie watcher must be in column 2 and the thriller movie watcher in column 3 or 4. If the van driver is in column 2, then the horror movie watcher must be in column 1 and the thriller movie watcher in column 3.

4. The person eating lime is to the right of the person eating strawberry. Since the strawberry eater is in column 4, the lime eater must be in column 2 or 3.

5. The person who's sport is rugby is to the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since the handball player is in column 3 (as the skiing person is to the left), the rugby player must be in column 4.

6. The person watching thriller movies is not the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver cannot be in the last position (as the strawberry eater is there), the motorbike driver must be in column 1 or 2. If the motorbike driver is in column 1, then the thriller movie watcher must be in column 2 or 4. If the motorbike driver is in column 2, then the thriller movie watcher must be in column 1 or 3.

7. The person driving the train is to the right of the person eating cucumber. Since the cucumber eater cannot be in the last position (as the strawberry eater is there), the cucumber eater must be in column 1, 2, or 3. If the cucumber eater is in column 1, then the train driver must be in column 2 or 3. If the cucumber eater is in column 2, then the train driver must be in column 3 or 4. If the cucumber eater is in column 3, then the train driver must be in column 4.

8. The person who's sport is handball is to the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the handball player is in column 3 and the skiing person is in column 2 or 3, the skiing person must be in column 2.

9. The person who's sport is rugby is to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the rugby player is in column 4, the zombie movie watcher must be in column 1 or 2.

10. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the far right. Since the lime eater and the strawberry eater are already placed, the gardener must be in column 1.

11. The person who's sport is rugby is to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the rugby player is in column 4 and the gardener is in column 1, the zombie movie watcher must be in column 2.

12. The person eating lime is on the left or right of the person eating strawberry. Since the strawberry eater is in column 4 and the lime eater is already placed in column 2, the lime eater must be in column 2.

13. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the gardener is in column 1 and the zombie movie watcher is in column 2, the water-polo player must be in column 3 or 4. If the water-polo player is in column 3, then the reader must be in column 1. If the water-polo player is in column 4, then the reader must be in column 2.

14. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the jet-ski driver cannot be in the first position (as the gardener is there), the jet-ski driver must be in column 2. This means the zombie movie watcher must be in column 3.

15. The person who's hobby is reading is between the person watching thriller movies and the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the gardener is in column 1 and the thriller movie watcher is in column 2, the reader must be in column 3.

16. The person watching horror movies is to the right of the person eating carrot. Since the carrot eater is in column 3, the horror movie watcher must be in column 4.

17. The person who's hobby is board-games is not the person watching zombie movies. Since the board-games person is in column 1 or 2, the zombie movie watcher is not in column 1 or 2. This means the zombie movie watcher is in column 3 and the board-games person is in column 2.

18. The person who's sport is water-polo is not the person driving the train. Since the train driver is in column 2, the water-polo player must be in column 1, 3, or 4. If the water-polo player is in column 1, then the reader must be in column 3. If the water-polo player is in column 3, then the reader must be in column 1. If the water-polo player is in column 4, then the reader must be in column 2. But we already know the reader is in column 3, so the water-polo player must be in column 3.

Now, let's put the final solution in the table:

Lv7-5x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the rat owner is to the right of the juice drinker. Let's place the rat owner in the last column (column 4) and the juice drinker in the first available spot to the left (column 1).

2. The soul fan is the traveler. Let's place the traveler in the second column (column 2).

3. The boat driver is to the left or right of the woodworker. Since the rat owner (who is also the hot-chocolate drinker) is in column 4, and we already placed the traveler in column 2, the only available spots for the boat driver are columns 1 and 3. Let's place the boat driver in column 3 for now. This means the woodworker must be in column 1 or 2, but since the traveler is in column 2, the woodworker must be in column 1.

4. The subway driver is to the left of the ship driver. Since the boat driver is in column 3, the ship driver must be in column 4. This means the subway driver must be in column 1, 2, or 5. But the metal fan is to the right of the milk drinker, and the milk drinker must be in the last available spot (column 4), so the subway driver cannot be in column 4. Therefore, the subway driver must be in column 1 or 2. Let's place the subway driver in column 1 for now.

5. The reggae fan is not the fanta drinker. Since the fanta drinker must be in the first available spot to the right of the rat owner (in column 2), the reggae fan cannot be in column 2. So, the reggae fan must be in column 1, 3, or 4. But the soul fan is to the right of the fanta drinker, so the reggae fan cannot be in column 2. Also, the reggae fan cannot be in column 4 because the milk drinker is in that spot. So, the reggae fan must be in column 3.

6. The puzzles hobbyist is to the left of the soul fan. Since the soul fan is in column 2, the puzzles hobbyist must be in column 1.

7. The fish owner is between the traveler and the woodworker. Since the traveler is in column 2 and the woodworker is in column 1, the fish owner must be in column 2.

8. The hot-chocolate drinker is to the right of the fish owner. Since the fish owner is in column 2, the hot-chocolate drinker must be in column 3 or 4. But the rat owner (who is also the hot-chocolate drinker) is in column 4, so the hot-chocolate drinker must be in column 3.

9. The rock fan is not the fanta drinker. Since the fanta drinker is in column 2, the rock fan cannot be in column 2. So, the rock fan must be in column 1, 3, or 4. But the reggae fan is in column 3, and the metal fan is to the right of the milk drinker (who is in column 4), so the rock fan cannot be in column 4. Therefore, the rock fan must be in column 1.

10. The juice drinker is somewhere to the left of the rat owner (who is also the hot-chocolate drinker). Since the hot-chocolate drinker is in column 3, the juice drinker must be in column 1 or 2. But the reggae fan is in column 3, and the rock fan is in column 1, so the juice drinker must be in column 2.

11. The boat driver is in column 3, the ship driver is in column 4, and the subway driver is in column 1.

12. The woodworker is in column 1, the traveler is in column 2, and the fish owner is in column 2.

13. The puzzles hobbyist is in column 1, the soul fan is in column 2, and the reggae fan is in column 3.

14. The metal fan is in column 4, the rock fan is in column 1, and the juice drinker is in column 2.

15. The hot-chocolate drinker is in column 3, the rat owner is in column 4, and the fanta drinker is in column 2.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-5x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, pets, and sports are all different for each person, we can fill in the table with unique options for each category.

2. Let's start with the hobbies. Since the person with puzzles is to the left of the person with reading, we can place puzzles in the first or second column and reading in the third or fourth column. Let's place puzzles in the first column and reading in the third column for now.

3. The person with puzzles is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla and the owner of the pony. Since the chinchilla is on the right of the pony, the person with puzzles must be on the left of the chinchilla, so we place the chinchilla in the second column.

4. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the chinchilla is in the second column, the mystery movie-watcher must be in the fourth column. Let's place mystery movies in the fourth column.

5. The analyst is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the volleyball player can't be the owner of the pony (from rule 11), the analyst must be in the first or second row. Let's place the analyst in the first row for now.

6. The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the mystery movie-watcher is in the fourth column and the pony can't be in the fourth row (from rule 6), the pony must be in the third row. Let's place the pony in the third row.

7. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. Since the person with puzzles is in the first column and the mystery movie-watcher is in the fourth column, the person with satire movies must be in the second or third column. Let's place satire movies in the second column for now.

8. The videographer is somewhere between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the person watching satire movies. Since the person with puzzles is in the first column and the person with satire movies is in the second column, the videographer must be in the third column.

9. The writer is somewhere between the person who's sport is cricket and the person who's sport is handball. Since the volleyball player is in the fourth row and the pony is in the third row, the cricket player must be in the first row and the handball player in the second row. The writer must be in the second row as well, between cricket and handball, so we place the writer in the second row.

10. The writer is in an even position. Since the writer is in the second row, this condition is satisfied.

11. The person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person with handball is in the second row and the person with reading is in the third column, the person with handball must be in the first column.

12. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the hamster. Since the chinchilla is in the second row and the hamster must be below the pony (as the pony is in the third row), the hamster must be in the fourth row.

13. The person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the person with zombie movies can't be in the first or fourth column (as the person with puzzles is in the first column and the person with satire movies is in the second column), the person with zombie movies must be in the third column.

14. The person who's hobby is reading is not the owner of the pony. Since the pony is in the third row, the person with reading can't be in the third column (as the person with satire movies is there). So, the person with reading must be in the fourth column.

15. The person who's sport is rowing is not in the third row. Since the pony is in the third row, the rower can't be there. So, the rower must be in the first or fourth row.

16. The person who's sport is volleyball is not the owner of the pony. Since the pony is in the third row, the volleyball player can't be there. So, the volleyball player must be in the first or fourth row.

17. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the mystery movie-watcher is in the fourth column and the person with satire movies is in the second column, the person with mystery movies must be in the first column.

Now, we have a conflict: both the rower and the volleyball player can't be in the first or fourth row, but the person watching mystery movies must be in the first column, which is the first row. To resolve this, let's swap the rower and the volleyball player. So, the rower is in the first row and the volleyball player is in the fourth row.

The final solution table is:

|               |      1      |     2      |      3       |     4      |

Lv7-5x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill in the row names with the 4 sports (Climbing, Cycling, Lacrosse, Parkour). Let's place Cycling on the far right (4th column) because it's the person who's also the musician (from rule 16).

16. From rule 12, the person who's sport is parkour is not the owner of the hedgehog. Since we already have Hedgehog, Parkour must be in the 1st column.

    | Sport   | Climbing | Cycling | Tea      | Hedgehog |

    | Job    | Chef    | Coffee  | French   | Ferret   |

    |       |         | Manager |          |          |

Now we have filled all the columns and rows with the given information. The final solution table is:

   | Sport   | Parkour | Cycling | Tea      | Climbing |

However, we still don't have the jobs, nationalities, and pets filled in. Unfortunately, there are multiple possible solutions for these missing details as we don't have enough unique constraints for them.

Lv7-5x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 items in each category, so we can label them A, B, C, D for each category.

2. From point 11, we know that the martial-arts movie watcher is on the left or right of the German. Since the Egyptian is on the left of the martial-arts movie watcher (point 7), the German must be either A or B. Let's assume the German is A.

3. From point 12, we know that the person eating tomato is the person watching martial-arts movies. So, Tomato = Martial-arts. Since the Egyptian is on the left of the person eating garlic (point 7), the garlic cannot be A or B. So, let's assume Garlic = C.

4. From point 5, we know that the person eating eggplant is on the left of the Egyptian. So, Eggplant = B.

5. From point 13, we know that the pakistani is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the Egyptian is on the left of the pakistani (point 14), the jet-ski driver cannot be A or B. So, let's assume Jet-ski = D.

6. From point 6, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since the jet-ski driver is D, Mirinda cannot be D. So, let's assume Mirinda = A.

7. From point 10, we know that the pakistani is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the snowmobile. Since the jet-ski driver is D and the pakistani is on the left of the jet-ski driver (point 14), the almond-milk drinker must be C. So, Almond-milk = C.

8. From point 9, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the almond-milk drinker is C and the water drinker cannot be A (point 6), the water drinker must be B. So, Water = B.

9. From point 2, we know that the martial-arts movie watcher is between the person drinking fanta and the person drinking water. Since the martial-arts movie watcher is Tomato = B and the water drinker is B, the fanta drinker must be A. So, Fanta = A.

10. From point 3, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is not the person driving the boat. Since the boat driver cannot be A (point 6) or B (point 9), the boat driver must be D. So, Boat = D.

11. From point 8, we know that the pakistani is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the snowmobile. Since the almond-milk drinker is C and the boat driver is D, the snowmobile driver must be A. So, Snowmobile = A.

12. From point 4, we know that the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. Since the musical movies cannot be A (point 1) or D (point 10), the musical movies must be B. So, Musical = B.

13. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different favourite beverages, and we have already assigned A = Fanta, B = Water, C = Almond-milk, and D = Mirinda. So, there is no room for the fourth beverage. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the given information.

However, if we ignore point 1 and assume that there are only 3 different favourite beverages, the rest of the puzzle can be solved as follows:

Lv7-5x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them P1 (leftmost), P2, P3, and P4 (rightmost).

2. From point 1, we know that P1 drives the van. So, we can fill in the first row with the Transport column as ""van"".

3. From point 2, we know that the person who surfs is either P1 or P3. Since P1 is already taken, let's assume P3 surfs. So, we can fill in the third row with ""surfing"" in the Sport column.

4. From point 3, the person who surfs is between P2 (biathlon) and P4 (lacrosse). Since P3 surfs, P2 must be biathlon and P4 must be lacrosse. So, we can fill in the second and fourth rows with ""biathlon"" and ""lacrosse"" in the Sport column, respectively.

5. From point 5, the person driving the trike is not P2 (biathlon). So, P1, P3, or P4 can drive the trike. Let's assume P1 drives the trike. So, we can fill in the first row with ""trike"" in the Transport column.

6. From point 4, we know that the person driving the trike is to the right of P3 (d&b). Since P1 drives the trike, P3 must be d&b. So, we can fill in the third row with ""d&b"" in the Music-Genre column.

7. From point 6, P1 (trike) is not the person eating grapes. So, P2, P3, or P4 can eat grapes. Let's assume P4 eats grapes. So, we can fill in the fourth row with ""grapes"" in the Food column.

8. From point 8, P4 (lacrosse) is on the right of P2 (crime). Since P3 (d&b) is to the left of P1 (trike), P2 must be crime. So, we can fill in the second row with ""crime"" in the Movie-Genre column.

9. From point 9, P3 (d&b) is to the left of P1 (trike). Since P4 (lacrosse) is to the right of P2 (crime), P1 must be parkour. So, we can fill in the first row with ""parkour"" in the Sport column.

10. From point 10, the person watching documentary is on the left of the person watching epic. Since P2 (crime) is between P1 (parkour) and P4 (lacrosse), P3 must be epic. So, we can fill in the third row with ""epic"" in the Movie-Genre column.

11. From point 11, the fan of ambient is on the right of P2 (biathlon). Since P3 (d&b) is to the left of P1 (trike), P4 must be ambient. So, we can fill in the fourth row with ""ambient"" in the Music-Genre column.

12. From point 12, the person eating broccoli is not P3 (d&b). Since P4 (lacrosse) is to the right of P2 (crime), P1 and P2 cannot eat broccoli. So, P3 must eat broccoli. So, we can fill in the third row with ""broccoli"" in the Food column.

13. From point 13, P2 (crime) is eating broccoli. So, we already have the Food column filled.

14. From point 14, P4 (lacrosse) is on the right of P2 (crime). Since P3 (d&b) is to the left of P1 (trike), P1 must be parkour. So, we already have the Sport column filled.

15. From point 10, the person watching documentary is on the left of the person watching epic. Since P3 (epic) is to the right of P2 (crime), P1 must be documentary. So, we can fill in the first row with ""documentary"" in the Movie-Genre column.

16. From point 7, P4 (lacrosse) is eating grapes. So, we already have the Food column filled.

17. From point 9, P3 (d&b) is to the left of P1 (trike). Since P4 (lacrosse) is to the right of P2 (crime), P1 must be parkour. So, we already have the Sport column filled.

18. From point 6, P1 (trike) is not the person eating grapes. Since P4 (lacrosse) is eating grapes, P1 cannot eat grapes. So, P2 must eat grapes. So, we can fill in the second row with ""grapes"" in the Food column.

19. From point 11, the fan of ambient is on the right of P2 (biathlon). Since P3 (d&b) is to the left of P1 (trike), P4 must be ambient. So, we already have the Music-Genre column filled.

20. From point 8, P4 (lacrosse) is on the right of P2 (crime). Since P3 (d&b) is to the left of P1 (trike), P1 must be parkour. So, we already have the Sport column filled.

21. From point 5, P1 (trike) is not the person driving the van. Since P4 (lacrosse) is not the person driving the van, P2 must drive the van. So, we can fill in the second row with ""van"" in the Transport column.

Now, we have the final solution table:

#############
```

We still need to fill in the remaining columns. Let's fill them based on the remaining clues:

22. From point 15, the person watching documentary is on the left of the person watching epic. Since P2 (crime) is between P1 (documentary) and P4 (lacrosse), P3 must watch epic movies. So, we can fill in the third row with ""epic"" in the Movie-Genre column.

23. From point 16, the person watching superhero movies is between P3 (epic) and P4 (lacrosse). Since P2 (crime) is between P1 (documentary) and P3 (epic), P4 must watch superhero movies. So, we can fill in the fourth row with ""superhero"" in the Movie-Genre column.

24. From point 18, the person watching crime movies is eating kale. Since P2 (crime) is between P1 (documentary) and P3 (epic), P1 cannot eat kale. So, P4 must eat kale. So, we can fill in the fourth row with ""kale"" in the Food column.

25. From point 19, the fan of ambient is on the right of P2 (biathlon). Since P3 (d&b) is to the left of P1 (trike), P1 cannot be ambient. So, P4 must be ambient. Since P2 (biathlon) is to the left of P3 (d&b), P1 must be electronic. So, we can fill in the first row with ""electronic"" in the Music-Genre column.

26. From point 20, the fan of techno is not the person driving the van. Since P2 (crime) is between P1 (documentary) and P3 (epic), P4 cannot drive the van. So, P1 must drive the car. So, we can fill in the first row with ""car"" in the Transport column.

Now, we have the final solution table:

```

We still need to fill in the Transport column for P4. Since P4 (lacrosse) is to the right of P2 (crime), P4 cannot drive the van. Since P4 (lacrosse) is to the left of P3 (d&b), P4 cannot drive the trike. So, P4 must drive the tram. So, we can fill in the fourth row with ""tram"" in the Transport column.

14. From point 1.11, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the person watching sports movies and the person playing ice-hockey. Since we already know the position of Sports and Volleyball, we can place Iced-Tea in the 4th position.

|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |       4       |

| Sport         | Basketball | Ice-Hockey| Skateboarding| Volleyball    |

15. From point 1.2, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is the fan of punk. Since we already know the position of Punk, this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-5x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is between the person watching horror movies and the person watching crime movies. Let's place them in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

2. From rule 11, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies. Since skateboarding is one of the four sports, it must be in position 3, 4. But from rule 7, we know that time-travel movies are in positions 2, 3, 4. So, skateboarding can't be in positions 3 or 4. It must be in position 1. Therefore, horror movies are in position 2, time-travel movies are in position 3, and crime movies are in position 4.

3. From rule 2, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Since surfing is one of the four sports, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But from the placement of horror, time-travel, and crime movies, we know that surfing can't be in positions 2, 3, or 4. So, surfing must be in position 1. Therefore, fanta is in position 4.

4. From rule 12, we know that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since magic-tricks is one of the four hobbies, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But from the placement of horror, time-travel, and crime movies, we know that magic-tricks can't be in positions 2, 3, or 4. So, magic-tricks must be in position 1. Therefore, rock-climbing is in position 3.

5. From rule 13, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is somewhere between the person drinking fanta and the person who's hobby is chess. Since camping is one of the four hobbies, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But from the placement of horror, time-travel, and crime movies, we know that camping can't be in positions 1 or 3. So, camping must be in position 2. Therefore, chess is in position 4.

6. From rule 10, we know that the person drinking sprite is the person who's hobby is camping. So, sprite is in position 2.

7. From rule 8, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the person who's sport is baseball and the person driving the van. Since iced-tea is one of the four beverages, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But from the placement of horror, time-travel, and crime movies, we know that iced-tea can't be in positions 1 or 4. So, iced-tea must be in position 3. Therefore, baseball is in position 1 and the van is in position 4.

8. From rule 6, we know that the person driving the van is not the person watching horror movies. Since the van is in position 4, horror movies are not in position 4. So, horror movies are in position 2.

9. From rule 9, we know that the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies. Since the roller is not the van (which is to the right of horror movies), the roller must be on the left of horror movies. So, the roller is in position 1.

10. From rule 5, we know that the person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since crime movies are in position 4, magic-tricks are in position 1. So, the person watching crime movies is in position 3.

11. From rule 4, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller. Since the roller is in position 1, tennis is in position 2, 3, or 4. But from the placement of horror, time-travel, and crime movies, we know that tennis can't be in position 4. So, tennis is in position 2 or 3. But from rule 7, we know that time-travel movies are in position 3. So, tennis is in position 2.

12. From rule 1, we know that the person watching scientific movies is somewhere between the person watching crime movies and the person watching time-travel movies. Since crime movies are in position 3 and time-travel movies are in position 3, scientific movies must be in position 1 or 4. But from rule 10, we know that the person drinking sprite is the person who's hobby is camping. Since camping is in position 2, scientific movies can't be in position 2. So, scientific movies are in position 4.

13. From rule 3, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the person who's sport is baseball and the person driving the van. Since baseball is in position 1 and the van is in position 4, iced-tea must be in position 2 or 3. But from rule 11, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is in position 2. So, iced-tea is in position 3.

14. From rule 14, we know that the person driving the airplane is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate is one of the four beverages, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But from the placement of horror, time-travel, crime, scientific, and iced-tea movies, we know that hot-chocolate can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Final solution table:

|               |      1       |      2      |       3       |       4       |

Lv7-5x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the table with 4 columns.

2. From rule 1, we know the nationalities, so we can fill in the Nationality column. Let's assume the order is British, Mexican, Polish, Turkish.

3. From rule 2, we know the Turkish is drinking Cola, so we can fill in the Beverage column for the 4th row (Turkish).

4. From rule 5, we know the Turkish is to the left of the person eating Broccoli, so the Broccoli must be in the 3rd column (Polish).

5. From rule 6, the person eating Broccoli is not the Polish, so the Broccoli must be in the 2nd column (Mexican).

6. Now we know the Mexican is eating Broccoli, so we can fill in the Food column for the 2nd row (Mexican).

7. From rule 12, the person eating Blueberry is on the left of the person eating Broccoli, so the Blueberry must be in the 1st column.

8. From rule 13, the person eating Pomegranate is not the British, so the Pomegranate must be in the 4th column (Turkish).

9. From rule 14, the Polish is not the person eating Broccoli (already filled), so the Polish must be in the 3rd row.

10. From rule 15, the person who's sport is skiing is to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we don't know the sports yet, let's assume the Biathlon is in the 1st row for now.

11. From rule 11, the Teacher is between the Cola drinker (Turkish) and the Journalist. Since the Journalist can't be in the 1st row (already filled), the Teacher must be in the 2nd row (Mexican).

12. From rule 8, the Manager is to the right of the Journalist. Since the Journalist is in the 2nd row (Mexican), the Manager must be in the 4th row (Turkish).

13. From rule 7, the person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the British. Since the British is in the 1st row, the Sailing must be in the 2nd row (Mexican).

14. From rule 5, the person drinking Lemonade is not the person who's sport is Sailing (already filled), so the Lemonade must be in the 3rd row (Polish).

15. From rule 9, the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing (already filled). Since the Sailing is in the 2nd row, the Snowboarding can be in the 1st or 4th row. However, since the Biathlon is in the 1st row, the Snowboarding must be in the 4th row (Turkish).

16. From rule 16, the Journalist is not the person who's sport is skiing (already filled), so the Journalist must be in the 3rd row (Polish).

17. Now we know the Sports, so we can fill in the Sport column. Let's assume the order is Biathlon, Sailing, Snowboarding, Skiing.

18. From rule 10, the person eating Pomegranate is between the person who's sport is Biathlon and the person who's sport is Snowboarding, so the Pomegranate must be in the 2nd row (Mexican).

19. From rule 15, the person who's sport is skiing is to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon (already filled), so the Skiing must be in the 4th row (Turkish).

20. Now we know the Food, so we can fill in the Food column. Let's assume the order is Broccoli, Blueberry, Pomegranate, Mango.

21. Finally, from rule 3, the person drinking Mirinda is between the person drinking Juice and the person drinking Lemonade. Since the Juice is in the 2nd row (Mexican) and the Lemonade is in the 3rd row (Polish), the Mirinda must be in the 3rd row (Polish).

So, the final solution table is:

|               |       Blueberry      |       Broccoli      |      Pomegranate     |      Mango       |

Lv7-5x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 items in each category, so we can represent each category with numbers from 1 to 4. Let's assign each item in each category a number.

   Beverage: 1 - Cola, 2 - Juice, 3 - Lemonade, 4 - Tea
   Food: 1 - Eggplant, 2 - Kale, 3 - Nectarine, 4 - Onion
   Movie-Genre: 1 - Comedy, 2 - Martial-Arts, 3 - Musical, 4 - Scientific
   Nationality: 1 - American, 2 - British, 3 - French, 4 - Turkish
   Transport: 1 - Airplane, 2 - Bus, 3 - Subway, 4 - Van

2. From rule 1, we know that the person watching comedy movies is not the person eating eggplant. So, Comedy cannot be in position 1 (since it's the only even position and Eggplant is assigned to an odd position).

   So, Comedy = {2, 3, 4}
   Eggplant = {1}

3. From rule 2, the person watching martial-arts movies is in an even position. Since Comedy is not in position 2, Martial-Arts must be in position 2.

   Martial-Arts = {2}

4. From rule 3, the person watching musical movies is between the person eating onion and the person watching martial-arts movies. Since Martial-Arts is in position 2, Musical must be in position 3 or 4. But from rule 7, the person eating onion is somewhere to the right of the person eating nectarine. So, Musical cannot be in position 4.

   Musical = {3}

5. From rule 4, the person eating kale is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since Comedy is in position 2, Kale must be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 8, the person eating kale is on the far left or far right. Since the British is on the far left (rule 12), Kale cannot be in position 1.

   Kale = {2}

6. From rule 6, the person drinking cola is somewhere between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching musical movies. Since Musical is in position 3, Scientific must be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 14, the person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating nectarine. So, Scientific cannot be in position 2.

   Scientific = {1}

7. From rule 9, the person drinking cola is between the American and the person driving the van. Since American is in position 1 (from rule 17), Cola cannot be in position 4. So, Cola must be in position 2 or 3. But from rule 6, Cola is between Scientific and Musical, so it cannot be in position 3.

   Cola = {2}

8. From rule 10, the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person driving the van. Since Van is in position 4, Lemonade cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3.

   Lemonade = {4}

9. From rule 11, the person driving the bus is on the far right. Since there are only 4 positions and Lemonade, Onion, and Turkish (from rule 13) are already assigned to positions, the Bus must be in position 4.

   Bus = {4}

10. From rule 15, the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since Subway is not assigned yet, let's assign it to position 3 for now. This means Juice can be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 16, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the American. Since American is in position 1, Juice cannot be in position 1.

    Juice = {2}

11. From rule 13, the person driving the airplane is the Turkish. Since Turkish is in position 3 (from rule 12 and rule 11), the only remaining position for the American is position 1.

    American = {1}

12. Now we know the positions for American, Turkish, and Bus. From rule 5, the person watching martial-arts movies is in an even position. Since American and Turkish are in positions 1 and 3, Martial-Arts must be in position 2.

    Martial-Arts = {2}

13. From rule 7, the person eating onion is somewhere to the right of the person eating nectarine. Since Nectarine is not assigned yet, let's assign it to position 3 for now. This means Onion can be in position 2, 3, or 4. But from rule 16, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the American. Since American is in position 1, Onion cannot be in position 4.

    Onion = {2, 3}

14. From rule 14, the person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating nectarine. Since Nectarine is in position 3, Scientific must be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 6, Cola is between Scientific and Musical, so Scientific cannot be in position 2.

    Scientific = {1}

15. Now we know the positions for American, Turkish, Bus, Martial-Arts, Scientific, and Cola. From rule 15, the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since Subway is in position 3, Juice can be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 16, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the American. Since American is in position 1, Juice cannot be in position 1.

    Juice = {2}

16. From rule 17, the person eating eggplant is on the left of the American. Since American is in position 1, Eggplant must be in position 1.

    Eggplant = {1}

17. From rule 18, the only remaining position for Nectarine is position 3.

    Nectarine = {3}

18. From rule 19, the only remaining position for Onion is position 2.

    Onion = {2}

19. From rule 20, the only remaining position for Kale is position 4.

    Kale = {4}

20. From rule 21, the only remaining position for Juice is position 1.

    Juice = {1}

21. From rule 22, the only remaining position for Subway is position 2.

    Subway = {2}

22. From rule 23, the only remaining position for Lemonade is position 4.

    Lemonade = {4}

So, the final solution table is:
