Lv7-5x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so we can number them from 1 to 5.

2. From rule 12, the person driving the jet-ski is in an odd position, so Jet-Ski = 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume Jet-Ski = 3 for now.

3. From rule 4, the person driving the helicopter is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the subway. Since Jet-Ski = 3, Helicopter = 2 or 4. Let's assume Helicopter = 4 for now.

4. From rule 2, the person drinking fanta is somewhere between the Indonesian and the fan of reggae. Since the American is the fan of reggae (rule 8), and we assumed Helicopter = 4 (which is an even position), the Indonesian must be in position 2. So, Indonesian = 2.

5. From rule 7, the Turkish is between the fan of gospel and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the Thai is the fan of blues (rule 14), and we assumed Helicopter = 4, the Turkish must be in position 3. So, Turkish = 3.

6. From rule 19, the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we placed the Indonesian (who is the fan of dancing) in position 2, Fanta can't be in position 1. So, Fanta = 5.

7. From rule 20, the person drinking hot-chocolate is between the person driving the helicopter and the person drinking mirinda. Since we assumed Helicopter = 4 and Fanta = 5, Hot-Chocolate = 6.

8. From rule 6, the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere between the fan of ambient and the person driving the helicopter. Since we placed the Indonesian (who is the fan of dancing) in position 2, the only possible position for the fan of ambient is 1. So, Ambient = 1.

9. From rule 18, the fan of ambient is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since we assumed Jet-Ski = 3, Ambient can't be in position 2. So, Ambient = 1 and Jet-Ski = 3.

10. From rule 16, the person who's hobby is writing is somewhere between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the person drinking milk. Since we placed the Indonesian (who has the hobby of puzzles) in position 2, the only possible positions for Writing and Milk are 3 and 4. Let's assume Writing = 3 for now.

11. From rule 15, the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since we placed Fanta (which is drinking mirinda) in position 5, Reading must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But since Writing = 3 and we assumed it's between Reading and Milk, Reading can't be in position 4. So, Reading = 1 or 2.

12. From rule 13, the person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since Reading = 1 or 2, Tram = 2 or 4. But since we assumed Writing = 3 and it's between Reading and Milk, Tram can't be in position 4. So, Tram = 2.

13. From rule 11, the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the Thai. Since we placed the Thai in position 3, Milk can't be in position 1. So, Milk = 5.

14. From rule 17, the person who's hobby is reading is not the person drinking mirinda. Since we placed Reading = 1 or 2 and Fanta (which is drinking mirinda) is in position 5, Reading can't be in position 2. So, Reading = 1.

15. From rule 9, the fan of ambient is not the Indonesian. Since we placed the Indonesian in position 2, Ambient can't be in position 2. So, Ambient = 1.

16. From rule 21, the person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since we placed the American (who is the fan of reggae) in position 1, Helicopter can't be in position 5. So, Helicopter = 4.

17. From rule 22, the person driving the bike is not the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we placed the Indonesian (who has the hobby of puzzles) in position 2, Bike can't be in position 2. So, Bike = 3 or 5.

18. From rule 11, the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the Thai. Since we placed the Thai in position 3, Milk can't be in position 1. So, Milk = 5.

19. From rule 23, the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the fan of house. Since we placed the fan of house in position 4 (as it's the only remaining position), Fanta can't be in position 5. So, Fanta = 1.

20. From rule 10, the colombian is not the fan of house. Since we placed the fan of house in position 4, Colombian can't be in position 4. So, Colombian = 2, 3, or 5. But since we assumed Bike = 3 and it's not the person who's hobby is puzzles, Colombian can't be in position 3. So, Colombian = 2.

21. From rule 13, the person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since we placed Reading = 1, Tram can't be in position 5. So, Tram = 2.

22. From rule 2, the person drinking fanta is somewhere between the Indonesian and the fan of reggae. Since we placed the Indonesian in position 2 and the American (who is the fan of reggae) in position 1, Fanta can't be in position 3. So, Fanta = 1 and Colombian = 2.

23. From rule 11, the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the Thai. Since we placed the Thai in position 3, Milk can't be in position 1. So, Milk = 5.

24. From rule 16, the person who's hobby is writing is somewhere between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the person drinking milk. Since we placed the Indonesian (who has the hobby of puzzles) in position 2 and Milk = 5, Writing can't be in position 3. So, Writing = 4.

25. From rule 1, there are 5 different nationalities. We have placed American, Indonesian, and Turkish. The remaining nationalities are Colombian, Thai, and one more. Since Colombian = 2, the last nationality is Thai.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-5x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 16, the person eating artichoke is driving the car. So, we can place the artichoke in the first column and the car in the fifth row.

2. From rule 7, the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the person eating artichoke. So, the skateboard can't be in the first column. Let's place it in the second column (column 2).

3. From rule 8, the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the accountant. Since the skateboard is in the second column, the accountant must be in the third column (column 3).

4. From rule 9, the person driving the car (artichoke) is also the person who's hobby is collecting. So, we know that collecting is in the first row. Since collecting is in the middle (rule 15), it must be in the third column.

5. From rule 11, the person driving the roller is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the skateboard is in the second column and the car (artichoke) is in the fifth column, the roller can't be in the second, fourth, or fifth columns. So, it must be in the first column.

6. From rule 14, the fisherman is somewhere between the chef and the person eating kiwi. Since the chef is not yet placed, let's place the kiwi in the fourth column (column 4). The fisherman can't be in the first column (already occupied by the roller), so he must be in the second or third column. Since he is between the chef and the kiwi, he must be in the third column (column 3).

7. From rule 19, the fisherman is on the right of the lawyer. Since the fisherman is in the third column, the lawyer must be in the fifth column (column 5).

8. From rule 17, the lawyer is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the lawyer is in the fifth column, sudoku must be in the fourth column.

9. From rule 18, the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the dressmaker. Since the lawyer is in the fifth column, the dressmaker must be in the fourth column. So, baseball must be in the second column.

10. From rule 10, the person who's sport is climbing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since baseball is in the second column, climbing must be in the first column.

11. From rule 13, the person who's sport is tennis is on the far left or far right. Since climbing is in the first column and baseball is in the second column, tennis must be in the fifth column.

12. From rule 15, the person eating artichoke is somewhere to the left of the person eating peach. Since artichoke is in the first column, peach must be in the second column.

13. From rule 12, the person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the person eating artichoke. Since artichoke is in the first column, the boat can't be in the first column. So, it must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth columns. Since the skateboard is in the second column, the boat can't be in the second column. Since the car (artichoke) is in the fifth column, the boat can't be in the fifth column. So, the boat must be in the third or fourth column.

14. From rule 18, the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the dressmaker. Since baseball is in the second column and the dressmaker is in the fourth column, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the fifth column.

15. From rule 20, the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since tennis is in the fifth column, reading must be in the fourth column.

16. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person eating peach. Since peach is in the second column, baking must be in the third column.

17. From rule 16, the person eating peach is in the second column. So, the remaining food (kiwi and potato) must be in the fourth and fifth columns. Since climbing is in the first column, the remaining food can't be in the first column. So, kiwi must be in the fourth column and potato must be in the fifth column.

So, the final solution table is:

|             |     1      |     2      |     3      |     4      |     5      |

| Transport   | car       | roller    |           |            | skateboard |

The job column is still empty. Since the chef is not yet placed, let's place the chef in the third row (job). The remaining jobs are accountant, dressmaker, and fisherman. Since the accountant is on the left of the skateboard (rule 8), the accountant can't be in the fifth column (already occupied by the lawyer). So, the accountant must be in the first or second column. Since the skateboard is in the second column, the accountant can't be in the second column. So, the accountant must be in the first column.

Since the accountant is in the first column, the remaining jobs are dressmaker and fisherman. Since the fisherman is on the right of the lawyer (rule 19), the fisherman can't be in the first column (already occupied by the accountant). So, the fisherman must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth columns. Since the accountant is in the first column, the fisherman can't be in the first column. Since the skateboard is in the second column, the fisherman can't be in the second column. Since the lawyer is in the fifth column, the fisherman can't be in the fifth column. So, the fisherman must be in the third or fourth column.

Since the fisherman is in the third or fourth column, the dressmaker must be in the second column.

So, the final solution table is:

|             |     1      |     2      |     3      |     4      |     5      |

| Hobby       | collecting |           | baking    |            |           |
| Job         | accountant | dressmaker | fisherman |            | lawyer    |
| Sport       |           | baseball  |           | tennis     |           |
| Transport   | car       | roller    |           |            | skateboard |

The sport column is still empty. Since the remaining sport is cycling, it must be in the third row (sport).

So, the final solution table is:

|             |     1      |     2      |     3      |     4      |     5      |

| Transport   | car       | roller    |           |            | skateboard |

The table is now complete.

Lv7-5x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Egyptian is the cricket player (14) and not the trike driver (1). So, the cricket player cannot be in the positions 1, 3, or 5 (since they are odd positions and the trike driver must be in an odd position).

2. Let's place the Egyptian (cricket player) in position 2. Now, the trike driver cannot be in position 4 or 5 (since the cricket player is to their left). So, the trike driver is in position 1.

3. The person watching horror movies is to the left of the blueberry eater (2). Since the Egyptian (blueberry eater) is in position 2, the horror movie watcher is in position 1.

4. The surfing person is to the left or right of the Argentine (13). Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the Argentine must be in position 3 or 5. If the Argentine is in position 3, the surfing person must be in position 4 or 5. But position 5 is already taken by the trike driver, so the Argentine is in position 5 and the surfing person is in position 4.

5. The person eating kale is on the far left or far right (8). Since the Egyptian (cricket player) and the horror movie watcher are already placed, the kale eater cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the kale eater is in position 4 or 5. But position 5 is already taken by the Argentine, so the kale eater is in position 5.

6. The person eating eggplant is between the weightlifting person and the sailing person (6). Since the Egyptian (cricket player) and the horror movie watcher are already placed, the weightlifting person cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the weightlifting person is in position 4. This means the eggplant eater is in position 3.

7. The person watching thriller movies is not the motorbike driver (7). Since the horror movie watcher is in position 1, the thriller movie watcher cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5. So, the thriller movie watcher is in position 3.

8. The person watching musical movies is to the right of the kale eater (12). Since the kale eater is in position 5, the musical movie watcher is in position 6.

9. The thriller movie watcher is between the cricket player and the eggplant eater (9). Since the cricket player is in position 2 and the eggplant eater is in position 3, the thriller movie watcher is in position 4.

10. The Argentine is to the left of the cranberry eater (10). Since the Argentine is in position 5, the cranberry eater is in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 1 is already taken by the horror movie watcher, so the cranberry eater is in position 3.

11. The Egyptian is on the far left (11). This is already fulfilled since the Egyptian is in position 2.

12. The kale eater is to the right of the musical movie watcher (12). Since the musical movie watcher is in position 6, the kale eater is in position 5.

13. The Argentine is to the left or right of the surfing person (13). Since the Argentine is in position 5, the surfing person is in position 4.

14. The motorbike driver is to the left of the romance movie watcher (14). Since the romance movie watcher is in position 6, the motorbike driver is in position 5.

15. The romance movie watcher is to the right of the cranberry eater (15). Since the cranberry eater is in position 3, the romance movie watcher is in position 4.

16. The romance movie watcher is to the left or right of the trike driver (16). Since the romance movie watcher is in position 4 and the trike driver is in position 1, this condition is fulfilled.

17. The motorbike driver is to the right of the boat driver (17). Since the motorbike driver is in position 5, the boat driver is in position 1.

18. The Canadian is to the left or right of the adventure movie watcher (18). Since the Canadian cannot be in position 1 (already taken by the boat driver), the Canadian is in position 3 or 5. But position 5 is already taken by the Argentine, so the Canadian is in position 3.

19. The Canadian is to the left or right of the sailing person (19). Since the Canadian is in position 3, the sailing person is in position 4 or 5. But position 5 is already taken by the Argentine, so the sailing person is in position 4.

20. The thriller movie watcher is in an even position (20). This is already fulfilled since the thriller movie watcher is in position 4.

21. The Pakistani is to the right of the cranberry eater (21). Since the cranberry eater is in position 3, the Pakistani is in position 5.

22. The romance movie watcher is to the left or right of the golf player (22). Since the romance movie watcher is in position 4 and the golf player cannot be in position 1 (already taken by the boat driver), the golf player is in position 3.

Lv7-5x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can fill in the row and column headers with the numbers 1 to 5.

2. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is the police-officer. So, we can fill in the hobby for person 5 as skydiving and the job for person 5 as police-officer.

3. From rule 16, we know that the nigerian is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving (person 5). So, we can fill in the nationality for person 4 as nigerian.

4. From rule 17, we know that the mexican is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we already know the hobby for person 5, we can't place the mexican yet. Let's assume the mexican is in column 1, 2, or 3 for now.

5. From rule 18, we know that the fan of hip-hop is the designer. Since the designer can't be in column 5 (because the designer is to the right of the police-officer, who is in column 5), the designer must be in column 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the designer is in column 1 for now.

6. From rule 19, we know that the designer is on the right of the police-officer. So, the designer must be in column 2, 3, or 4. Since the designer is also the fan of hip-hop, we can fill in the music-genre for person 1 as not hip-hop.

7. From rule 3, we know that the fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we already know the hobby for person 5, the fan of dubstep can't be in column 5. Also, the fan of dubstep can't be in column 1 (because the designer is in column 1 and the designer is not the fan of dubstep). So, the fan of dubstep must be in column 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the fan of dubstep is in column 2 for now.

8. From rule 4, we know that the analyst is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we already know the hobby for person 5, the analyst can't be in column 5. Also, the analyst can't be in column 1 (because the designer is in column 1 and the designer is not the analyst). So, the analyst must be in column 2, 3, or 4. Since the analyst is the argentine (rule 7), we can fill in the nationality for person 2 as argentine.

9. From rule 5, we know that the australian is somewhere to the right of the fan of soul. Since we don't know the music-genre for any person to the right of person 2 (the argentine), we can't place the australian yet. Let's assume the australian is in column 3, 4, or 5 for now.

10. From rule 6, we know that the police-officer is somewhere to the right of the australian. So, the police-officer can't be in column 1 or 2 (because the argentine and the designer are in those columns). Since the police-officer is in column 5 (rule 2), we can fill in the job for person 5 as police-officer.

11. From rule 8, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the accountant. Since the accountant can't be in column 5 (because the police-officer is in column 5), the accountant must be in column 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume the accountant is in column 1 for now.

12. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the designer. Since the designer is in column 1, the person who's hobby is baking must be in column 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the person who's hobby is baking is in column 2 for now.

13. From rule 13, we know that the owner of the bird is somewhere between the person who's hobby is gardening and the analyst. Since the person who's hobby is gardening can't be in column 5 (because the police-officer is in column 5), the person who's hobby is gardening must be in column 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the person who's hobby is gardening is in column 2 for now. So, the owner of the bird can be in column 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the owner of the bird can't be in column 5 (because the police-officer is in column 5), the owner of the bird can't be in column 5. Also, the owner of the bird can't be in column 1 (because the accountant is in column 1). So, the owner of the bird must be in column 2, 3, or 4.

14. From rule 15, we know that the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since we don't know the owner of the guinea-pig yet, we can't place the owner of the turtle yet. Let's assume the owner of the turtle is in column 3, 4, or 5 for now.

15. From rule 10, we know that the owner of the hamster is on the right of the fan of punk. Since the fan of punk can't be in column 5 (because the police-officer is in column 5), the fan of punk must be in column 1, 2, or 3. Since the fan of punk is in an odd position (rule 20), the fan of punk must be in column 1 or 3. Let's assume the fan of punk is in column 1 for now. So, the owner of the hamster can be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5.

16. From rule 9, we know that the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the mexican. Since the mexican can be in column 1, 2, or 3 (rule 4), the owner of the turtle can't be in column 4 or 5. So, the owner of the turtle must be in column 1, 2, or 3. Since the owner of the turtle can't be in column 1 (because the fan of punk is in column 1), the owner of the turtle must be in column 2 or 3.

17. From rule 15, we know that the owner of the turtle can't be in column 1 (because the fan of punk is in column 1). So, the owner of the turtle must be in column 3. Since the owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in column 1 or 2. Let's assume the owner of the guinea-pig is in column 1 for now.

18. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is the police-officer. Since the police-officer is in column 5, the hobby for person 1 must not be skydiving. Also, the hobby for person 1 can't be baking (because the person who's hobby is baking is to the right of the designer, who is in column 1). So, the hobby for person 1 must be either chess, cooking, or gardening. Let's assume the hobby for person 1 is chess for now.

19. From rule 18, we know that the fan of hip-hop is the designer. Since the designer is in column 1, the music-genre for person 5 must not be hip-hop. Also, the music-genre for person 5 can't be dubstep (because the fan of dubstep is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess, who is person 1). So, the music-genre for person 5 must be either folk, punk, or soul. Let's assume the music-genre for person 5 is soul for now.

20. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the designer. Since the designer is in column 1, the person who's hobby is baking must be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person who's hobby is baking can't be in column 5 (because the police-officer is in column 5), the person who's hobby is baking can't be in column 1 (because the designer is in column 1). So, the person who's hobby is baking must be in column 2, 3, or 4. Since the person who's hobby is baking is to the right of the designer, the person who's hobby is baking can't be in column 2 (because the designer is in column 1). So, the person who's hobby is baking must be in column 3 or 4. Since the person who's hobby is baking can't be in column 5 (because the police-officer is in column 5), the person who's hobby is baking must be in column 3. So, the hobby for person 3 must be baking.

21. From rule 19, we know that the music-genre for person 5 is soul. Since the music-genre for person 5 can't be hip-hop (because the designer is the fan of hip-hop), the music-genre for person 5 must be either folk, punk, or soul. Since the music-genre for person 5 is soul, the music-genre for person 1 must not be soul. Also, the music-genre for person 1 can't be dubstep (because the fan of dubstep is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess, who is person 1). So, the music-genre for person 1 must be either folk or punk. Let's assume the music-genre for person 1 is punk for now.

22. From rule 20, we know that the fan of punk is in an odd position. Since the fan of punk is in column 1, the fan of punk must be person 1. So, the music-genre for person 1 is punk.

23. From rule 6, we know that the police-officer is somewhere to the right of the australian. Since the police-officer is in column 5, the australian must be in column 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the australian can't be in column 1 (because the fan of punk is in column 1), the australian can't be in column 5 (because the police-officer is in column 5). So, the australian must be in column 2, 3, or 4. Since the australian is to the right of the fan of soul, the australian can't be in column 2 (because the fan of soul is in column 1). So, the australian must be in column 3 or 4. Since the australian is to the right of the analyst, the australian can't be in column 3 (because the analyst is in column 2). So, the australian must be in column 4. So, the nationality for person 4 is australian.

24. From rule 1, we know that there are 5 different hobbies. Since we have already filled in the hobby for person 1 (punk), person 2 (chess), person 3 (baking), person 4 (australian), and person 5 (police-officer), the hobby for person 5 must be one of the remaining hobbies: cooking, gardening, or skydiving. Since the hobby for person 5 can't be gardening (because the person who's hobby is gardening is to the right of the accountant, who is not yet placed), the hobby for person 5 must be either cooking or skydiving. Since the hobby for person 5 can't be cooking (because the person who's hobby is cooking is to the right of the designer, who is not yet placed), the hobby for person 5 must be skydiving. So, the hobby for person 5 is skydiving.

25. From rule 1, we know that there are 5 different jobs. Since we have already filled in the job for person 1 (accountant), person 2 (analyst), person 3 (designer), person 4 (australian), and person 5 (police-officer), the job for person 1 must be one of the remaining jobs: engineer, engineer, or engineer. Since the job for person 1 can't be engineer (because the engineer is to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening, who is not yet placed), the job for person 1 must be either engineer or engineer. Since the job for person 1 can't be engineer (because the engineer is to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening, who is not yet placed), the job for person 1 must be engineer. So, the job for person 1 is engineer.

26. From rule 1, we know that there are 5 different music-genres. Since we have already filled in the music-genre for person 1 (punk), person 2 (chess), person 3 (baking), person 4 (australian), and person 5 (police-officer), the music-genre for person 1 must be one of the remaining music-genres: folk, hip-hop, or soul. Since the music-genre for person 1 can't be hip-hop (because the designer is the fan of hip-hop), the music-genre for person 1 must be either folk or soul. Since the music-genre for person 1 can't be soul (because the music-genre for person 5 is soul), the music-genre for person 1 must be folk. So, the music-genre for person 1 is folk.

27. From rule 1, we know that there are 5 different nationalities. Since we have already filled in the nationality for person 1 (american), person 2 (argentine), person 3 (american), person 4 (australian), and person 5 (nigerian), the nationality for person 1 must be one of the remaining nationalities: american, argentine, mexican, or nigerian. Since the nationality for person 1 can't be argentine (because person 2 is argentine), the nationality for person 1 must be either american, mexican, or nigerian. Since the nationality for person 1 can't be mexican (because the mexican is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess, who is not yet placed), the nationality for person 1 must be nigerian. So, the nationality for person 1 is nigerian.

28. From rule 1, we know that there are 5 different pets. Since we have already filled in the pet for person 1 (bird), person 2 (guinea-pig), person 3 (hamster), person 4 (turtle), and person 5 (horse), the pet for person 1 must be one of the remaining pets: bird, horse, or turtle. Since the pet for person 1 can't be horse (because the police-officer is the owner of the horse), the pet for person 1 must be either bird or turtle. Since the pet for person 1 can't be turtle (because the owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, who is not yet placed), the pet for person 1 must be bird. So, the pet for person 1 is bird.

Lv7-5x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the quad-bike is on the far left or far right, let's place the quad-bike driver in position 1 (far left) or 5 (far right).

2. The person eating lettuce is on the left of the person watching action movies. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1, the lettuce eater must be in position 2. So, let's place action movies in position 3.

3. The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the fan of gospel. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1, the dog owner cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the dog owner is also to the right of the fan of gospel, so they must be in position 4 or 5. Let's place gospel in position 4.

4. The owner of the pony is the person watching satire movies. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1, the pony owner (and satire watcher) must be in position 5. So, let's place satire in position 5.

5. The person driving the skateboard is somewhere between the fan of electronic and the fan of metal. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1 and the gospel fan is in position 4, the skateboard driver must be in position 2, 3, or 6. But the skateboard driver is also between the fan of electronic and the fan of metal, so they must be in position 2 or 3. Let's place electronic in position 2 and metal in position 3.

6. The owner of the ferret is not the person watching time-travel movies. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1 and the pony owner is in position 5, the ferret owner must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6. But the ferret owner cannot be in position 4 (since the dog owner is there), so they must be in position 2, 3, or 6.

7. The owner of the pony is on the left or right of the fan of metal. Since the pony owner is in position 5, the metal fan must be in position 4 or 6. But the metal fan cannot be in position 4 (since the dog owner is there), so they must be in position 6.

8. The person watching satire movies is on the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the pony owner (and satire watcher) is in position 5, the animation watcher must be in position 3 or 4. But the animation watcher cannot be in position 3 (since the metal fan is there), so they must be in position 4.

9. The owner of the dog is somewhere to the left of the person eating apricot. Since the dog owner is in position 4 and the lettuce eater is in position 2, the apricot eater must be in position 3 or 5. But the apricot eater cannot be in position 5 (since the pony owner is there), so they must be in position 3.

10. The person watching animation movies is on the left of the owner of the dog. Since the animation watcher is in position 4 and the dog owner is in position 4, this condition is already satisfied.

11. The owner of the cat is not the fan of electronic. Since the cat owner cannot be in position 1 (since the quad-bike driver is there), they must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But the cat owner cannot be in position 2 (since the skateboard driver is there), position 4 (since the animation watcher is there), or position 5 (since the pony owner is there), so they must be in position 3 or 6.

12. The person driving the car is the person eating grapefruit. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1, the car driver must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But the car driver cannot be in position 1 (since the quad-bike driver is there), position 3 (since the apricot eater is there), position 4 (since the animation watcher is there), or position 5 (since the pony owner is there), so they must be in position 6.

13. The person driving the skateboard is somewhere between the fan of electronic and the fan of metal. Since the skateboard driver is in position 2 and the electronic fan is in position 2, the metal fan must be in position 4.

14. The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1, this condition is already satisfied.

15. The person driving the car is on the right of the person eating pumpkin. Since the car driver is in position 6 and the pumpkin eater is in position 3, this condition is already satisfied.

16. The fan of trance is not the person driving the car. Since the car driver is in position 6, the trance fan must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the trance fan cannot be in position 1 (since the quad-bike driver is there), position 3 (since the apricot eater is there), position 4 (since the animation watcher is there), or position 5 (since the pony owner is there), so they must be in position 2.

17. The owner of the pony is in an even position. Since the pony owner is in position 5, this condition is already satisfied.

18. The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 1, this condition is already satisfied.

19. The person driving the boat is in an odd position. Since we haven't placed the boat yet, let's place it in position 1. But this would mean the quad-bike driver and the boat driver are in the same position, which is not possible since the quad-bike driver is in an odd position. So, the boat cannot be in position 1. Let's place it in position 3.

20. The owner of the cat is not the fan of electronic. Since the cat owner cannot be in position 1 (since the quad-bike driver is there), they must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But the cat owner cannot be in position 2 (since the skateboard driver is there), so they must be in position 4 or 6. But the cat owner cannot be in position 6 (since the car driver is there), so they must be in position 4.

21. The person watching time-travel movies is on the far left. Since we haven't placed time-travel movies yet, let's place it in position 1. But this would mean the quad-bike driver and the time-travel watcher are in the same position, which is not possible since the quad-bike driver is in an odd position. So, the time-travel movies cannot be in position 1. Let's place it in position 5.

Now, we have a contradiction. The person watching time-travel movies is on the far left, but the quad-bike driver is also on the far left. This puzzle seems to have an inconsistency.

Here is the final table with the information we could determine:

  |               |      1      |     2      |     3      |     4      |    5    |

Lv7-5x5-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the hobbies, beverages, movie-genres, music-genres, and pets. We'll use the same number for each category to make it easier to refer to them.

   Hobby: 1 (sudoku), 2 (chess), 3 (filmmaking), 4 (magic-tricks), 5 (sudoku)
   Beverage: 6 (almond-milk), 7 (lemonade), 8 (milk), 9 (mirinda), 10 (sprite)

   Pet: 21 (cat), 22 (frog), 23 (goldfish), 24 (guinea-pig), 25 (lizard)

2. From rule 1, we know that d&b is to the left of funk. So, let's place d&b first, and funk second.

   Music-Genre: 16 (d&b), 18 (funk)

3. From rule 3, we know that chess is not the fan of funk. So, chess cannot be in the second position. Let's place chess in the third position.

   Hobby: 2 (chess)

4. From rule 4, we know that reggae is between guinea-pig and lizard. Since the position of the guinea-pig is even (rule 18), the lizard must be in an odd position. The only odd position left is the first position. So, let's place the lizard first.

   Pet: 25 (lizard)

5. From rule 5, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the lizard. So, let's place lemonade in the second position.

   Beverage: 7 (lemonade)

6. From rule 6, we know that filmmaking is not the person drinking lemonade. So, filmmaking cannot be in the second position. Let's place filmmaking in the fourth position.

   Hobby: 3 (filmmaking)

7. From rule 7, we know that the person watching family movies is on the far left. Since the lizard is already in the first position, family movies must be in the second position.

   Music-Genre: 20 (reggae)

10. From rule 10, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the lizard is in the first position and the guinea-pig's position is even (rule 18), the person drinking sprite must be in the third position.

    Beverage: 10 (sprite)

    Pet: 23 (goldfish)

12. From rule 12, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is not the owner of the cat. Since the lizard is in the first position and the guinea-pig is in the third position, the cat cannot be in the first or third position. So, let's place the cat in the fifth position.

    Pet: 21 (cat)

13. From rule 13, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the fan of house. Since the person drinking sprite is in the third position and the lizard is in the first position, the fan of house must be in the fourth position.

    Beverage: 9 (mirinda)

16. From rule 16, we know that the fan of funk is not the person who's hobby is camping. Since chess is in the third position, camping cannot be in the first position (where the lizard is) or the third position (where the chess fan is). So, let's place camping in the fifth position.

    Hobby: 4 (camping)

17. From rule 17, we know that the fan of funk is somewhere to the left of the fan of house. Since the fan of house is in the fourth position, the fan of funk must be in the second or third position.

Lv7-5x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The British is to the left of the person who's sport is parkour. Let's place the British in the first position. Since the British can't be the person driving the airplane (rule 4), they can't be in the 5th position. So, the British is in the first position, and the person who's sport is parkour is in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.

2. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the far left or far right. Since the British is already in the first position, the biathlete can't be in the first position. So, the biathlete is in the 5th position.

3. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the person eating grapefruit. Let's place the grapefruit eater in the second position.

4. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train. Since the British is in the first position and the biathlete is in the 5th position, the train driver can't be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 5th position. So, the train driver is in the 4th position.

5. The person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person driving the trike. Since the grapefruit eater is in the 2nd position, the trike driver can't be in the 1st position. So, the trike driver is in the 3rd position.

6. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. Since the grapefruit eater is in the 2nd position, the bus driver can't be in the 4th or 5th position. So, the bus driver is in the 1st position.

7. The person eating pineapple is in an odd position. Since the bus driver is in the 1st position, the pineapple eater can't be in the 1st position. So, the pineapple eater is in the 3rd, 5th, or 7th position.

8. The person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. Since the pineapple eater is in an odd position and can't be in the 1st position, the pineapple eater is in the 3rd position.

9. The person who's sport is rowing is not the person who's hobby is singing. Since the British is in the 1st position and the biathlete is in the 5th position, the rower can't be in the 1st or 5th position. So, the rower is in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 6th position.

10. The person eating pineapple is not the person who's sport is rowing. Since the pineapple eater is in the 3rd position, the rower can't be in the 3rd position. So, the rower is in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position.

11. The person who's hobby is woodworking is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person eating pepper. Since the British is in the 1st position and the biathlete is in the 5th position, the woodworker can't be in the 1st or 5th position. The rower can't be in the 3rd position because the pineapple eater is there. So, the woodworker is in the 2nd or 4th position.

12. The person eating grapefruit is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the grapefruit eater is in the 2nd position, the rower can't be in the 1st or 3rd position. So, the rower is in the 4th or 5th position.

13. The person eating grapefruit is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the rower can't be in the 2nd position, the rower is in the 5th position. So, the woodworker is in the 2nd position.

14. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the grapefruit eater is in the 2nd position and can't be the singer, the singer can't be in the 1st position. So, the singer is in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.

15. The person eating pineapple is not the person who's hobby is singing. Since the pineapple eater is in the 3rd position, the singer can't be in the 3rd position. So, the singer is in the 4th or 5th position.

16. The person who's hobby is video-games is in an odd position. Since the bus driver is in the 1st position, the woodworker is in the 2nd position, and the singer can't be in the 3rd position, the video-games person is in the 5th position.

17. The indian is not the person eating asparagus. Since the British is in the 1st position, the biathlete is in the 5th position, and the rower is in the 5th position, the Indian can't be in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. So, the Indian is in the 2nd position.

Since the British is in the 1st position, the biathlete is in the 5th position, the rower is in the 5th position, the Indian is in the 2nd position, and the woodworker is in the 2nd position, the parkour person can't be in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th position. So, the parkour person is in the 3rd position.

19. The canadian is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the parkour person is in the 3rd position, the Canadian is in the 4th or 5th position.

Since the bus driver is in the 1st position, the woodworker is in the 2nd position, the Indian is in the 2nd position, the parkour person is in the 3rd position, and the Canadian is in the 4th or 5th position, the Thai can't be in the 2nd position. So, the Thai is in the 1st or 5th position.

21. The person who's hobby is singing is not the thai. Since the Thai can't be in the 2nd position, the singer can't be in the 2nd position either. So, the singer is in the 5th position.

22. The thai is in the 1st position.

23. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the singer is in the 5th position, the woodworker is in the 4th position.

24. The indian is the person who's hobby is traveling.

25. The pakistani is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane. Since the bus driver is in the 1st position, the woodworker is in the 4th position, the Indian is in the 2nd position, the parkour person is in the 3rd position, the Canadian is in the 4th position, and the singer is in the 5th position, the pakistani can't be in the 2nd position. So, the pakistani is in the 1st or 5th position.

Since the pakistani can't be in the 1st position (rule 25), the pakistani is in the 5th position.

2. The engineer (E) is to the right of the person eating peas (P), so E can only be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since E can't be in column 5 (as it's occupied by M), E can be in columns 2, 3, or 4. However, E can't be in column 2 because the person watching comedy movies is the person driving the train, and we haven't placed the train driver yet. So, E can only be in columns 3 or 4.

3. The person watching comedy movies is the person driving the train (T), so we place T in column 3. Now, E can only be in column 4.

4. The person drinking lemonade (L) is to the left of the person eating grapes (G), so L can only be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Since L can't be in column 1 (as it's already occupied), L can only be in columns 2 or 3. However, L can't be in column 3 because the person driving the train is in that column. So, L can only be in column 2.

6. The person driving the scooter (S) is somewhere between the person eating apricot (A) and the person driving the van (V). Since S can't be in column 1 (as it's occupied by Q), S can only be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. The person drinking milk (Mk) is somewhere between the person drinking iced-tea (I) and the dancer (D). Since Mk can't be in column 1 (as it's already occupied by L), Mk can only be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, Mk can't be in column 5 (as it's occupied by M), and Mk can't be in column 3 (as it's occupied by T). So, Mk can only be in columns 2 or 4. Since Mk can't be in column 2 (as it's already occupied by S), Mk can only be in column 4.

16. The person driving the roller (R) is not the person eating apricot (A), so R can't be in column 4. So, R can only be in columns 1, 2, 3, or 5. However, R can't be in column 1 (as it's already occupied by L), R can't be in column 2 (as it's already occupied by G), R can't be in column 3 (as it's already occupied by Mk), and R can't be in column 5 (as it's occupied by H). So, R can't be placed. This contradicts the given information, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

The final solution table should be:

However, the information about the roller (R) seems to be incorrect, and the puzzle can't be solved as given."	{'beverage': ['l', 'g', 'mk', 'e', 'h'], 'food': ['lt', '', '', 'v', ''], 'job': ['', '', '', '', ''], 'movie-genre': ['animation', 'comedy', 'sports', 'family', ''], 'transport': ['q', '', '', '', 's']}	True	0	False
