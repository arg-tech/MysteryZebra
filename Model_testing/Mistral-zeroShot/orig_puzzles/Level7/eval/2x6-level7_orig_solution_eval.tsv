Lv7-2x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 people and 6 pets, each person must have a pet.
2. Since the music genres are different, each person must have a different music genre preference.
3. Since there are 6 odd and 6 even positions, there must be 3 people in odd positions (1, 3, 5) and 3 people in even positions (2, 4, 6).

Let's assign music genres to the people in odd positions:
- Position 1: blues (given in rule 13)
- Position 3: r&b (since it's to the left of dubstep and not in position 1, and the fan of blues is in position 1)
- Position 5: dubstep (since it's to the left of soul and not in positions 1, 3, or 4, and the fan of r&b is in position 3)

Now let's assign music genres to the people in even positions:
- Position 2: soul (since it's to the left of dubstep, and the fan of blues and r&b are in odd positions)
- Position 4: reggae (since it's not the owner of the mouse and not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)
- Position 6: Since the fan of blues is in position 1, the fan of soul is in position 2, the fan of r&b is in position 3, and the fan of reggae is in position 4, the only remaining genre is folk. So, position 6 must be folk.

Now let's assign pets to the people:
- Position 1 (blues): cat (given in rule 13)
- Position 2 (soul): hedgehog (given in rule 15)
- Position 3 (r&b): guinea-pig (since it's not the mouse and not to the left of the guinea-pig, and the mouse is not the fan of dubstep)
- Position 4 (reggae): rabbit (since it's not the mouse and to the left of the fan of reggae)
- Position 5 (dubstep): mouse (since it's not the fan of dubstep and to the left of the hedgehog, and the hedgehog is not to the right of the guinea-pig)
- Position 6 (folk): goldfish (since it's not the guinea-pig, rabbit, or mouse, and it's to the right of the guinea-pig)

The final solution table is:

Lv7-2x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies (#1), we can place them in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's place them in column 5 for now.

2. The person watching drama movies cannot be in column 1 (#8), so they can be in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since they are to the right of the person watching horror movies (#6 and #7), they cannot be in column 1 or 2. So, they can be in columns 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's place them in column 4 for now.

3. The owner of the snake cannot be in the first or last position (#2 and #8), so they can be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since they are on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla (#13), they cannot be in column 5. So, they can be in columns 2, 3, or 4. Since they are in an even position (#14), they can only be in columns 2 or 4. Let's place them in column 2 for now.

4. The owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the snake and the owner of the guinea-pig (#10), so they can be in columns 3, 4, or 5. Since the owner of the snake is in column 2 (our current placement), the chinchilla cannot be in column 2. So, they can be in columns 3, 4, or 5. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies (#15), the chinchilla cannot be in column 5. So, they can be in column 3 or 4. Let's place them in column 3 for now.

5. The owner of the guinea-pig is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies (#15), so they can be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Since the chinchilla is in column 3 (our current placement), the guinea-pig cannot be in column 3. So, they can be in columns 1 or 2. Let's place them in column 1 for now.

6. The owner of the dog is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies (#12), so they can be in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the owner of the dog (#12), they cannot be in column 1. So, they can be in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's place them in column 6 for now.

7. The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere between the owner of the dog and the person watching horror movies (#17), so they can be in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the person watching time-travel movies is in column 6 (our current placement), the person watching fantasy movies cannot be in column 6. So, they can be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies (#6 and #7), they cannot be in column 1. So, they can be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 6. Since the person watching horror movies is not the owner of the mouse (#9), they cannot be in column 5. So, they can be in columns 2, 3, or 6. Since the owner of the fish is to the left of the person watching horror movies (#11), the person watching horror movies cannot be in column 6. So, they can be in columns 2 or 3. Let's place them in column 3 for now.

8. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies (#3), but we already placed the person watching horror movies in column 3. Since the person watching horror movies is not the owner of the mouse (#9), the owner of the mouse must be in column 2.

9. The owner of the fish is to the left of the person watching horror movies (#11), so they can be in columns 1 or 2. Since the owner of the mouse is in column 2 (our current placement), the owner of the fish cannot be in column 2. So, they can be in column 1.

10. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the owner of the dog (#12), so they can be in columns 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the person watching fantasy movies is in column 3 (our current placement), the person watching time-travel movies cannot be in column 3. So, they can be in columns 4, 5, or 6. Since the person watching horror movies is in column 3 (our current placement), the person watching time-travel movies cannot be in column 3 either. So, they can be in columns 4, 5, or 6. Since the person watching disaster movies is in column 5 (our initial placement), the person watching time-travel movies cannot be in column 5. So, they can be in column 6.

11. The only remaining position for the person watching drama movies is column 4.

Lv7-2x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking lemonade is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, we can place them in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Let's place lemonade in position 1 and hot-chocolate in position 2.

2. The person drinking cola is in an even position, so it can't be in position 1 or 3. It can be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person drinking cola, and the person who's sport is parkour is to the left of the person who's sport is baseball, cola can't be in position 6. So, cola can be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person drinking cola, and the person who's sport is parkour is to the left of the person who's sport is baseball, cola can't be in position 4. So, cola can only be in position 2.

3. The person who's sport is parkour is to the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since cola is to the left of baseball, parkour must be in position 1.

4. The person who's sport is basketball is not the person drinking soy-milk. Since we know the positions of cola, lemonade, and parkour, basketball can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, basketball can be in position 4, 5, or 6. Since the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person drinking cola, and the person who's sport is parkour is to the left of the person who's sport is baseball, basketball can't be in position 6. So, basketball can be in position 4 or 5.

5. The person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person drinking cola, but we already placed cola in position 2. So, baseball can't be in position 1 or 3. Since the person who's sport is parkour is to the left of the person who's sport is baseball, baseball can't be in position 6. So, baseball can only be in position 4.

6. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since we placed parkour in position 1, swimming must be in position 3.

7. The person who's sport is basketball is on the far left. Since we placed basketball in position 4, the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 5.

8. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. Since we placed swimming in position 3 and basketball in position 4, tea can be in position 1, 2, or 5. Since the person who's sport is surfing is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the person drinking hot-chocolate, tea can't be in position 1. So, tea can be in position 2 or 5. Since the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person drinking cola, and the person who's sport is parkour is to the left of the person who's sport is baseball, tea can't be in position 5. So, tea can only be in position 2.

9. The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we placed tea in position 2 and hot-chocolate in position 3, surfing can be in position 2 or 3. Since the person who's sport is swimming is in position 3, surfing can't be in position 3. So, surfing can only be in position 2.

10. The person who's sport is water is to the right of the person drinking tea. Since we placed tea in position 2, water can only be in position 6.

Lv7-2x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people, so we can label them from A to F (A is the person on the far left, and F is the person on the far right).

2. Let's start with the beverages:
   - Since the person drinking water is on the left of the person watching superhero movies, A cannot drink water. So, A drinks either 7up, almond-milk, hot-chocolate, lemonade, mirinda, or water. Let's assume A drinks 7up (we'll come back to this).
   - Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is between A and the person drinking mirinda, B must drink hot-chocolate.
   - Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is also between the person drinking 7up and the person drinking water, C cannot be A or B, so C drinks water.
   - Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies, D must drink almond-milk (as F is the only one left).
   - Since the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, E drinks mirinda.
   - Since the person drinking lemonade is the person watching fantasy movies (from rule 13), F drinks lemonade.
   - Now, since A drinks 7up and C drinks water, D cannot drink 7up or water, so D drinks almond-milk (which we already know D drinks). This means A must drink water instead of 7up. So, A drinks water, B drinks hot-chocolate, C drinks water, D drinks almond-milk, E drinks mirinda, and F drinks lemonade.

3. Now, let's move on to the movie genres:
   - Since the person watching crime movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up, A or B must watch crime movies. But A drinks water, so B watches crime movies.
   - Since the person watching horror movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade, F watches horror movies.
   - Since the person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies, B or C must watch western movies. But B watches crime movies, so C watches western movies.
   - Since the person watching drama movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda, E or F must watch drama movies. But F watches horror movies, so E watches drama movies.
   - Since the person watching fantasy movies is the person drinking lemonade, this is already solved.
   - Since the person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up, D or E must watch superhero movies. But D drinks almond-milk, so E watches superhero movies.

Lv7-2x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the goat owner is not the fan of punk, so they can't be in position 5. Let's place the goat owner in position 6. Since the cat owner is to the right of the goat owner (rule 2), the cat owner can't be in position 1, so the cat owner is in position 2.

2. Now, the fan of electronic is to the right of the fan of classical (rule 3), so the classical fan must be in position 1 (since there are only 6 positions). This means the classical pet owner is a goldfish (rule 11).

3. The fan of blues is on the far left (rule 4), so they must be in position 1. This means the blues pet owner is not a goldfish (since the goldfish is the classical fan), so the blues pet owner can be either a cat (from rule 10) or a dog (from rule 13). Let's place the blues pet owner as the dog owner in position 3 (since the dog owner is to the left of the goat owner, as per rule 13).

4. The fan of pop is between the goldfish and the fan of punk (rule 5). Since the goldfish is in position 1 and the fan of punk can't be in position 5 (from rule 1), the fan of punk must be in position 6. This means the pop pet owner is in position 2 or 4. Since the cat owner is in position 2 (from step 1), the pop pet owner must be in position 4.

5. The fan of punk is between the fan of gospel and the fan of blues (rule 8). Since the fan of blues is in position 1 (from step 3) and the fan of punk is in position 6 (from step 4), the fan of gospel must be in position 5.

6. The owner of the pony is on the far left or far right (rule 6). Since the blues, classical, and gospel pets are already placed on the left, the pony must be in position 6.

7. The fan of electronic is to the right of the fan of classical (rule 3), so they can't be in position 1. The fan of electronic can't be in position 6 (since the fan of punk is in position 6), so the fan of electronic is in position 2 or 4. Since the pop fan is in position 4 (from step 4), the fan of electronic must be in position 2.

8. The owner of the ferret is not the fan of classical (rule 12), so the ferret can't be a goldfish. Since the blues, classical, gospel, pop, and electronic pets are already placed, the ferret must be a dog or a pony. Since the pony is in position 6, the ferret must be in position 3 (since the dog is to the left of the goat, as per rule 13).

9. The owner of the cat is on the far right (rule 10), so they must be in position 6.

10. The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the goat (rule 13), so the dog owner must be in position 3.

10. The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapefruit. Since we know watermelon is in column 2 and grapefruit is not placed yet, watermelon cannot be in its final position.

11. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere between the paramedic and the doctor. Since we know the doctor is in column 6 and we don't know the position of the paramedic yet, we can't place grapefruit yet.

2. From rule 11, the person driving the scooter is in position 2, 4, or 6 (odd positions). Let's assume it's position 6 for now.

3. From rule 8, the project-manager is to the right of position 6. So, the project-manager can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

4. From rule 13, the designer is to the left or right of the project-manager. If the project-manager is in position 1, then the designer can only be in position 3 or 5. But in that case, the project-manager can't be to the right of the designer (rule 13). So, the project-manager can't be in position 1.

5. Now, let's assume the project-manager is in position 3. Then, the designer can only be in position 1 or 5. But if the designer is in position 1, then the lawyer, who is to the right of the engineer (rule 5), can't be in position 2 (since the engineer can't be in position 6). So, the designer must be in position 5.

6. Now, the lawyer can be in position 2 or 4. If the lawyer is in position 2, then the engineer, who is to the right of the lawyer (rule 5), can't be in position 1 (since the designer is there). So, the lawyer must be in position 4.

7. Now, the engineer can be in position 5 or 6. But if the engineer is in position 5, then the quad-bike driver, who is to the right of the engineer (rule 7), can't be in position 6 (since the engineer can't be there). So, the engineer must be in position 6.

8. Now, the quad-bike driver can be in position 1, 3, or 5. But if the quad-bike driver is in position 1, then the videographer, who is not the quad-bike driver (rule 4), can't be in position 2. So, the quad-bike driver can't be in position 1. If the quad-bike driver is in position 3, then the project-manager, who is to the right of the quad-bike driver (rule 8), can't be in position 1. So, the quad-bike driver can't be in position 3. Therefore, the quad-bike driver must be in position 5.

9. Now, the videographer can be in position 2 or 4. But if the videographer is in position 2, then the person driving the scooter, who is to the left of the videographer (rule 6), can't be in position 6. So, the videographer must be in position 4.

10. Now, the person driving the motorbike can be in position 1, 3, or 5. But if the person driving the motorbike is in position 1, then the person driving the car, who is to the left of the person driving the motorbike (rule 12), can't be in position 6. So, the person driving the motorbike can't be in position 1. If the person driving the motorbike is in position 3, then the designer, who is the person driving the ship (rule 3), can't be in position 5. So, the person driving the motorbike can't be in position 3. Therefore, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 5.

11. Now, the person driving the car can be in position 2, 4, or 6. But if the person driving the car is in position 2, then the person driving the motorbike, who is to the left of the person driving the car (rule 12), can't be in position 5. So, the person driving the car can't be in position 2. If the person driving the car is in position 4, then the lawyer, who is to the left of the videographer (rule 6), can't be in position 2. So, the person driving the car can't be in position 4. Therefore, the person driving the car must be in position 6.

12. Now, the person driving the ship (designer) is the only one left, so they must be in position 1.

13. Finally, the person driving the scooter (position 6) is the project-manager, the person driving the motorbike (position 5) is the lawyer, the person driving the quad-bike (position 5) is the security-guard, the person driving the car (position 6) is the videographer, and the person driving the ship (position 1) is the engineer.

Lv7-2x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating zucchini is watching scientific movies, so we can place them in the table as follows:

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6      |
   | Food          | Zucchini |           |            |           |           |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Scientific|             |            |           |           |            |

2. The person watching sports movies is eating cauliflower, so we can place them next to the zucchini:

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6      |
   | Food          | Zucchini | Cauliflower |            |           |           |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Sports      |            |           |           |            |

3. The person eating artichoke is to the left of the person eating nectarine. Since we have already placed the nectarine, we can place the artichoke to its left:

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3     |     4     |     5     |     6      |
   | Food          | Zucchini | Cauliflower | Artichoke |            |           |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Sports      |           |           |           |            |

4. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since we have already placed the scientific movies, we can place the disaster movies to its right:

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3     |      4     |     5     |     6      |
   | Food          | Zucchini | Cauliflower | Artichoke | Disaster  |           |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Sports      |           |           |           |            |

5. The person watching sports movies is in an even position. Since we have already placed the sports movies in the second position, we don't need to move it.

6. The person eating cauliflower is between the person watching animation movies and the person eating tomato. Since we don't know the positions of animation and tomato yet, we can't place them yet.

7. The person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating watermelon. Since we have already placed the watermelon, we can place the nectarine to its left:

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3     |      4     |      5     |     6      |
   | Food          | Zucchini | Cauliflower | Artichoke | Disaster  | Nectarine | Watermelon |
   | Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Sports      |           |           |           |            |

8. The person watching epic movies is between the person watching sports movies and the person eating watermelon. Since we have already placed the sports movies and watermelon, we can place the epic movies between them:

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3     |      4     |      5     |     6      |
   | Food          | Zucchini | Cauliflower | Artichoke | Disaster  | Nectarine | Watermelon |
   | Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Sports      |           | Epic      |           | Animation  |

9. The person eating watermelon is the person watching animation movies. Since we have already placed the watermelon, we can change its movie genre to animation:

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3     |      4     |      5     |     6      |
   | Food          | Zucchini | Cauliflower | Artichoke | Disaster  | Nectarine | Animation  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Sports      |           | Epic      |           | Animation  |

10. The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since we have already placed the nectarine and disaster movies, we can swap their positions:

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3     |      4     |      5     |     6      |
   | Food          | Zucchini | Cauliflower | Artichoke | Animation  | Disaster  | Nectarine |
   | Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Sports      |           | Epic      |           | Animation  |

11. The person eating watermelon is on the right of the person eating nectarine. Since we have already placed the watermelon to the left of the nectarine, the current arrangement is correct.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-2x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person eating mango is the person driving the skateboard. Let's place the skateboard and mango in the first row and column (1,1).

2. From rule 5, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the skateboard is already placed, let's place the quad-bike and motorbike in the second and third columns (2,3) and (3,3).

3. From rule 6, we know that the person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. This means the mango must be in the first or second column. Since it's already in the first column, the quad-bike must be in the second column (2,3).

4. From rule 8, we know that the person driving the motorbike is not the person eating avocado. Since the motorbike is in the third column (3,3), the avocado cannot be in the third column. Let's place the avocado in the fifth column (5,?).

5. From rule 9, we know that the person eating artichoke is on the left or right of the person eating avocado. Since the avocado is in the fifth column, the artichoke can be in the fourth or fifth column. Let's place the artichoke in the fourth column (4,?).

6. From rule 14, we know that the person eating artichoke is somewhere between the person eating avocado and the person eating mango. Since the avocado is in the fifth column and the mango is in the first column, the artichoke must be in the second or third column. However, it cannot be in the third column because the motorbike is there (3,3). So, the artichoke must be in the second column (2,?).

7. From rule 10, we know that the person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike is in the third column (3,3), the bus cannot be in the third or fourth column. Let's place the bus in the sixth column (6,?).

8. From rule 11, we know that the person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the trike. Since the trike is in the sixth column (6,6), the car cannot be in the sixth column. Let's place the car in the fifth column (5,?).

9. From rule 13, we know that the person driving the trike is on the far right. Since the car is in the fifth column (5,?), the trike must be in the sixth column (6,6).

10. From rule 12, we know that the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person eating mango. Since the mango is in the first column (1,1), the bus cannot be in the first or sixth column. Let's place the bus in the second column (2,?).

11. From rule 4, we know that the person eating avocado is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car. Since the car is in the fifth column (5,?), the avocado must be in the sixth column (6,5).

12. From rule 3, we know that the person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating cucumber. Since the cucumber is not placed yet, let's place it in the fourth column (4,?).

13. From rule 7, we know that the person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the person eating pepper. Since the pepper is in the fourth column (4,?), the pineapple must be in the third column (3,?).

14. From rule 15, we know that the person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the person eating mango. Since the mango is in the first column (1,1), the pineapple must be in the second column (2,2).

Now, let's fill in the missing rows:

- The person driving the car is in the fifth row (5,?). Since the avocado is in the sixth column (6,5), the car must be in the fourth row (4,4).
- The person eating cucumber is in the fourth row (4,?). Since the pepper is in the fourth column (4,4), the cucumber must be in the third column (3,3).

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv7-2x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The French is on the far right, so we can place them in the last column (column 6). Let's assume the French owns a pet X.

2. Since the French is in the last column, the odd-positioned pet (guinea-pig) cannot be in the last column (column 6), so it must be in column 5 or column 4.

3. Now, let's place the Egyptian in the column where the guinea-pig is not. Since the guinea-pig cannot be in column 6, the Egyptian cannot be in column 6 either. Let's place the Egyptian in column 5, owning a pet Y.

4. The Egyptian cannot own the hedgehog (from rule 4), so the hedgehog cannot be in column 5. The hedgehog must be in column 6, as all other columns are occupied. Let's assume the hedgehog is owned by the Colombian (since the Colombian cannot own the pony).

5. The cat cannot be in the last column (column 6) because the Colombian owns the hedgehog there (from rule 4). The cat cannot be in the first column (column 1) because the French is in the last column (from rule 1). So, the cat can be in columns 2, 3, or 4.

6. The cat cannot be in column 2 because the Indonesian is between the guinea-pig and the cat (from rule 11), and the guinea-pig is in column 5 (from rule 2). So, the cat can be in columns 3 or 4.

7. The cat cannot be in column 3 because the Colombian owns the cat and the Colombian is to the right of the cat (from rule 5). So, the cat must be in column 4. Let's assume the cat is owned by the German (since the German is not the Egyptian and is not the Colombian).

8. Now, the snake cannot be in column 6 because the Colombian owns the hedgehog there (from rule 4). The snake cannot be in column 5 because the Egyptian owns the guinea-pig there (from rule 3). The snake cannot be in column 4 because the German owns the cat there (from rule 7). So, the snake can be in columns 1, 2, or 3.

9. The snake cannot be in column 1 because the Indonesian is between the guinea-pig and the cat (from rule 11), and the guinea-pig is in column 5 (from rule 2). So, the snake can be in columns 2 or 3.

10. The snake cannot be in column 2 because the Indonesian is between the guinea-pig and the cat (from rule 11), and the cat is in column 4 (from rule 7). So, the snake must be in column 3. Let's assume the snake is owned by the Russian (since the Russian is not the Colombian and is not the Egyptian).

11. Now, the frog can be in any column except column 6 (because the Colombian owns the hedgehog there), column 5 (because the Egyptian owns the guinea-pig there), column 4 (because the German owns the cat there), and column 3 (because the Russian owns the snake there). So, the frog can be in columns 1, 2, or 4.

12. The frog cannot be in column 1 because the Indonesian is between the guinea-pig and the cat (from rule 11), and the guinea-pig is in column 5 (from rule 2). So, the frog can be in columns 2 or 4.

13. The frog cannot be in column 4 because the Egyptian is somewhere to the right of the frog (from rule 9), and the Egyptian is in column 5. So, the frog must be in column 2. Let's assume the frog is owned by the Indonesian.

14. Finally, the pony cannot be in column 6 because the Colombian owns the hedgehog there (from rule 4). The pony cannot be in column 5 because the Egyptian owns the guinea-pig there (from rule 3). The pony cannot be in column 4 because the German owns the cat there (from rule 7). The pony cannot be in column 3 because the Russian owns the snake there (from rule 8). The pony cannot be in column 2 because the Indonesian owns the frog there (from rule 13). So, the pony must be in column 1. Let's assume the pony is owned by the Colombian.

The final solution table is:
