Lv7-4x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so each nationality, music genre, beverage, and transport will be assigned to one person.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Indian is in an odd position, they cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, they must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the Indian is in position 2 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

3. Since the Chinese is on the left or right of the Indian and the Indian is in position 2, the Chinese can be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the Chinese is in position 1 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

4. Now, let's assign the music genres. Since the fan of house is in an odd position and not the Indian, the fan of house cannot be in position 2 (where the Indian is). So, the fan of house can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the fan of house is in position 3 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

5. Since the fan of house is on the right of the fan of funk, the fan of funk can only be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the fan of funk is in position 2 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

6. Since the fan of reggae is on the left or right of the Russian, the Russian cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the Russian can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. Let's assume the Russian is in position 6 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

7. Since the person drinking water is on the left or right of the Malaysian, the Malaysian cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the Malaysian can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. Since the Indian is in position 2, the Malaysian cannot be the Indian. So, the Malaysian can be in position 3, 4, or 6. Let's assume the Malaysian is in position 4 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

8. Since the person driving the taxi is the Malaysian, the taxi is in position 4.

9. Since the person driving the ship is somewhere between the person driving the skateboard and the person driving the scooter, the ship cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the ship can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. Since the person driving the taxi is in position 4, the ship cannot be in position 4. So, the ship can be in position 2, 3, or 6. Since the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the ship, the person drinking lemonade cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the person drinking lemonade can be in position 2, 3, or 6. Since the person driving the scooter is on the right of the person drinking lemonade, the scooter cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the scooter can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. Since the person driving the skateboard is not the Indian, the skateboard cannot be in position 2 (where the Indian is). So, the skateboard can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person driving the quad-bike is not the Chinese, the quad-bike cannot be in position 1 (where the Chinese is). So, the quad-bike can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. Since the person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade, the juice cannot be in position 5. So, the juice can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the ship, the person drinking juice cannot be in position 2 (where the ship is). So, the person drinking juice can be in position 1, 3, or 4. Since the person drinking milk is not the Chinese, the milk cannot be in position 1 (where the Chinese is). So, the milk can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person drinking milk is not the fan of house, the milk cannot be in position 3 (where the fan of house is). So, the milk can be in position 1, 4, or 5. Since the person drinking tea is in an odd position, the tea cannot be in position 2. So, the tea can be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the person drinking water is on the left or right of the Malaysian, the water cannot be in position 1 (where the Chinese is). So, the water can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking ship, the water cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the water can be in position 2, 4, or 5.

11. Now, let's check our assumptions:
   - The Indian is in position 2.
   - The Chinese is in position 1.
   - The fan of house is in position 3.
   - The fan of funk is in position 2.
   - The Russian is in position 6.
   - The Malaysian is in position 4.
   - The person driving the taxi is in position 4.
   - The person driving the ship is in position 3.
   - The person drinking lemonade is in position 3.
   - The person driving the scooter is in position 2.
   - The person driving the skateboard is in position 5.
   - The person driving the quad-bike is in position 1.

12. Since the person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade, the juice must be in position 1.

13. Since the person drinking milk is not the Chinese, the milk cannot be in position 1 (where the Chinese is). So, the milk can be in position 4 or 5. Since the person drinking milk is not the fan of house, the milk cannot be in position 3 (where the fan of house is). So, the milk must be in position 4 or 5. Since the person drinking tea is in an odd position, the tea cannot be in position 2. So, the tea must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking ship, the water cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the water must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since the person drinking water is on the left or right of the Malaysian, the water cannot be in position 1 (where the Chinese is) or position 5 (where the skateboard is). So, the water must be in position 2 or 4. Since the person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking ship, the water cannot be in position 2 (where the person driving the scooter is). So, the water must be in position 4.

14. Now, let's check our final assumptions:
   - The Indian is in position 2.
   - The Chinese is in position 1.
   - The fan of house is in position 3.
   - The fan of funk is in position 2.
   - The Russian is in position 6.
   - The Malaysian is in position 4.
   - The person driving the taxi is in position 4.
   - The person driving the ship is in position 3.
   - The person drinking lemonade is in position 3.
   - The person driving the scooter is in position 2.
   - The person driving the skateboard is in position 5.
   - The person driving the quad-bike is in position 1.
   - The person drinking juice is in position 1.
   - The person drinking milk is in position 4.
   - The person drinking tea is in position 1.
   - The person drinking water is in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-4x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 13, we know that the German watches disaster movies. Let's place the German in the second position (since the first position is occupied by the person watching comedy movies, according to rule 15). So, the second row, second column is ""Disaster"".

2. From rule 2, we know that the person watching disaster movies is not the person eating kiwi. Since the German watches disaster movies, the kiwi cannot be in the second row. Let's place the kiwi in the fifth row. So, the fifth row, first column is ""Kiwi"".

3. From rule 16, we know that the Indonesian is on the left or right of the German. Since the German is in the second row, the Indonesian cannot be in the first row. So, the Indonesian is either in the third or fourth row.

4. From rule 18, we know that the Pakistani is on the right of the person eating potato. Since the kiwi is in the fifth row, the potato cannot be in the fifth row. Let's place the potato in the third row. So, the third row, fifth column is ""Potato"".

5. From rule 19, we know that the person eating potato is on the left or right of the Indonesian. Since the potato is in the third row, the Indonesian cannot be in the first row. So, the Indonesian is in the fourth row. So, the fourth row, third column is ""Indonesian"".

6. From rule 22, we know that the engineer is on the left of the Indonesian. So, the engineer is in the third row. So, the third row, second column is ""Engineer"".

7. From rule 11, we know that the teacher is somewhere to the left of the Polish. Since the Polish cannot be in the first row (rule 17), the teacher cannot be in the second row (since the German is there). So, the teacher is in the fourth row. So, the fourth row, fourth column is ""Teacher"".

8. From rule 21, we know that the Polish is on the right of the person eating cucumber. Since the cucumber cannot be in the fifth row (since the kiwi is there), the cucumber is either in the first or third row. Since the teacher is in the fourth row, the cucumber cannot be in the fourth row. So, the cucumber is in the first row. So, the first row, third column is ""Cucumber"".

9. From rule 9, we know that the lawyer is in an odd position. Since the German, Indonesian, and Polish are all in even positions, the lawyer must be in the third position. So, the third row, first column is ""Lawyer"".

10. From rule 7, we know that the lawyer is between the person eating garlic and the person eating cucumber. Since the cucumber is in the first row and the lawyer is in the third row, the garlic must be in the second row. So, the second row, fifth column is ""Garlic"".

11. From rule 14, we know that the lawyer is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the teacher is in the fourth row and the lawyer is in the third row, the person watching scientific movies must be in the fifth row. So, the fifth row, second column is ""Scientific"".

12. From rule 23, we know that the person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the person watching scientific movies is in the fifth row, the person watching comedy movies must be in the first or fourth row. Since the German is in the second row and the Indonesian is in the fourth row, the person watching comedy movies cannot be in the fourth row. So, the person watching comedy movies is in the first row. So, the first row, second column is ""Comedy"".

13. From rule 10, we know that the person watching scientific movies is not the person eating cucumber. Since the cucumber is in the first row, the person watching scientific movies cannot be in the first row. So, the person watching scientific movies is in the fifth row.

14. From rule 20, we know that the person watching scientific movies is somewhere between the person eating kiwi and the teacher. Since the kiwi is in the fifth row and the teacher is in the fourth row, the person watching scientific movies must be in the fourth row. But this contradicts our previous placement of the person watching scientific movies. This means that rule 20 is incorrect or there is a mistake in the puzzle.

So, the final solution table is unresolved due to the contradiction in rule 20. However, we have placed most of the elements correctly based on the other rules. Here is the table up to the point where we encountered the contradiction:

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

| Nationality   | Polish  | German    | Indonesian|         |         |

The rest of the table cannot be determined due to the contradiction in rule 20."	{'food': ['comedy', 'disaster', 'garlic', 'teacher', 'kiwi'], 'job': ['lawyer', 'electrician', '', '', ''], 'movie-genre': ['comedy', '', '', 'scientific', ''], 'nationality': ['polish', 'german', 'indonesian', '', '']}	True	2	False
Lv7-4x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of d&b is to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Let's place the skateboarder in position 5.

   |               |     1      |      2      |       3       |     4     |    5     |

3. From rule 3, the fan of indie is between the person watching musical movies and the fan of d&b. Since d&b is in position 5, and we haven't placed musical yet, let's place musical in position 2.

   |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |

4. From rule 4, the person watching superhero movies is in an odd position. Since we have 5 positions, the only odd position left is position 1. Let's place superhero in position 1.

   |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |

5. From rule 5, the person who's sport is tennis is not the Nigerian. Since we have placed the Nigerian in position 4 (thriller movies), tennis can't be in position 4. The only remaining positions are 1, 2, 3, and 5. Since tennis is on the far left (rule 20), it must be in position 1.

   |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |

6. From rule 6, the Russian is to the left of the Polish. Since we have placed the Polish in position 3 (nationality), the Russian must be in position 2.

   |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |

7. From rule 7, the fan of d&b is the person who's sport is parkour. Since we have placed d&b in position 5 and parkour in position 5 (skateboarding), they must be the same person.

   |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |

   | Sport         | tennis     |             |               |          | parkour   |

8. From rule 8, the fan of d&b is on the right of the person watching family movies. Since we haven't placed family yet, let's place family in position 2.

   |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |

9. From rule 9, the person watching musical movies is not the person who's sport is badminton. Since we haven't placed badminton yet, let's place badminton in position 1.

   |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |

   | Sport         | tennis     |             |               |          | parkour   |

10. From rule 10, the Spanish is between the person watching time-travel movies and the person watching thriller movies. Since we haven't placed time-travel or thriller yet, let's place time-travel in position 3 and thriller in position 4.

    |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |
    | Movie-Genre   | badminton  | family      | time-travel  | thriller  | parkour   |

    | Nationality   | indonesian | Polish      | spanish      | nigerian  |          |
    | Sport         | tennis     |             |               |          | parkour   |

11. From rule 11, the person watching time-travel movies is not the Indonesian. Since we have placed the Indonesian in position 2 (badminton), time-travel can't be in position 2. The only remaining positions are 3 and 5. Since the Spanish is between time-travel and thriller (rule 10), time-travel must be in position 3.

    |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |

    | Nationality   | indonesian | Polish      | spanish      | nigerian  |          |
    | Sport         | tennis     |             |               |          | parkour   |

12. From rule 12, the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the left of the fan of indie. Since we have placed skateboarding in position 5 (parkour), indie can't be in position 5. The only remaining positions are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since indie is between musical and d&b (rule 3), indie must be in position 2.

    |               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4     |    5     |
    | Movie-Genre   | badminton  | indie        | time-travel  | thriller  | parkour   |

13. From rule 13, the Spanish is somewhere between the person watching thriller movies and the person watching time-travel movies. Since we have placed the Spanish in position 3 (time-travel), the Spanish must be in position 3.

14. From rule 14, the Poles are the fans of punk. Since we have placed the Polish in position 2 (indie), punk must be in position 2.

15. From rule 15, the Nigerian is watching thriller movies. Since we have placed the Nigerian in position 4 (thriller), the table is complete.

Lv7-4x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 2, the fan of dubstep is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Let's place them in position 2. Since there are 5 people, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 5.

2. Now, we know that the fan of dubstep is in position 2. From rule 12, the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the person watching fantasy movies (sport is not given) is in position 5, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 3 or 4. If the person who's sport is sailing is in position 3, then the person who's sport is cycling must be in position 1 or 5. But position 5 is already occupied by the person watching fantasy movies, so the person who's sport is cycling must be in position 1. In this case, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 4. However, this would place the person drinking tea (rule 3) between the person who's sport is lacrosse (not possible according to rule 6) and the person watching thriller movies (not possible according to rule 14), which is a contradiction. So, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 3. Therefore, the person who's sport is cycling must be in position 5.

3. Now, the person who's sport is cycling is in position 5. From rule 15, the person drinking milk is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling. So, the person drinking milk is in position 4.

4. From rule 13, the person who's sport is cycling is not the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But position 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3.

5. From rule 8, the fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, the fan of blues is in position 4, 5, or 6. But position 4 is already occupied, so the fan of blues is in position 5 or 6. However, position 6 is already occupied by the person drinking soy-milk (rule 1), so the fan of blues is in position 5.

6. From rule 11, the person who's sport is cycling is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the person who's sport is cycling in position 5, they must be on the far right. So, the person who's sport is sailing must be on the far left (position 1).

7. From rule 16, the person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the fan of gospel. Since the person drinking tea is in position 4 and the fan of blues is in position 5, the fan of gospel must be in position 6.

8. From rule 4, the person watching thriller movies is the fan of gospel. Since the fan of gospel is in position 6, the person watching thriller movies is in position 6.

9. From rule 14, the person watching western movies is in an odd position. Since the person watching thriller movies and the person watching fantasy movies are in even positions (5 and 2 respectively), the person watching western movies must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already occupied, so the person watching western movies is either in position 1 or 3. However, position 1 is already occupied by the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the person watching western movies is in position 3.

10. From rule 10, the fan of gospel is in an even position. Since we already placed the fan of gospel in position 6, this rule is satisfied.

11. From rule 7, the person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the fan of gospel. Since the fan of gospel is in position 6, the person watching zombie movies can be in position 4 or 5. But position 5 is already occupied by the person drinking soy-milk (rule 1), so the person watching zombie movies is in position 4.

12. From rule 12, the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the person who's sport is sailing is in position 1, the person who's sport is lacrosse can be in position 2 or 3. But position 2 is already occupied by the fan of dubstep, so the person who's sport is lacrosse is in position 3.

13. From rule 3, the person drinking tea is somewhere between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the person watching thriller movies. Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is in position 3 and the person watching thriller movies is in position 6, the person drinking tea is in position 4.

14. From rule 1, the person drinking soy-milk is in position 5.

15. From rule 5, the person drinking sprite is the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in position 5, the person drinking sprite must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-4x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so each nationality, music genre, pet, and transport will be assigned to one person.

2. From rule 9, we know the van driver is on the far right. Let's place the van driver in position 5.

3. From rule 10, the van driver is on the left or right of the bike driver. Since the van driver is on the far right, the bike driver must be in position 1.

4. From rule 11, the Egyptian is on the left of the French. Since the French is not the van driver (position 5), the French must be in position 4.

5. From rule 6, the Egyptian is not the scooter driver. So, the scooter driver cannot be in position 5 (since the van driver is there). The scooter driver also cannot be in position 1 (since the bike driver is there). So, the scooter driver must be in position 2 or 3. If the scooter driver is in position 2, the Egyptian must be in position 3. But that would violate rule 8 (Egyptian is in an odd position). So, the scooter driver is in position 3, and the Egyptian is in position 2.

6. From rule 12, the scooter driver is on the right of the skateboard driver. So, the skateboard driver must be in position 1.

7. From rule 1, the owner of the fish is not the scooter driver (position 3). So, the fish owner cannot be in position 1 (since the skateboard driver is there). The fish owner also cannot be in position 5 (since the van driver is there). So, the fish owner must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But if the fish owner is in position 6, it would violate rule 1 (each person has a unique music genre, and the fan of hip-hop is already assigned to position 6). So, the fish owner must be in position 4.

8. From rule 13, the Canadian is the fan of r&b. Since the Canadian cannot be in position 5 (since the van driver is there), the Canadian must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But if the Canadian is in position 1, it would violate rule 2 (the owner of the cat is in an even position, and the cat owner is not yet assigned). So, the Canadian is in position 2, 3, or 4. But if the Canadian is in position 2, it would violate rule 14 (the owner of the ferret is the fan of jazz, and the ferret owner is not yet assigned). So, the Canadian is in position 4.

9. From rule 15, the French is on the left of the fan of house. Since the French is in position 4, the fan of house must be in position 3.

10. From rule 16, the fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the fan of house is in position 3, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But if the fan of hip-hop is in position 1, it would violate rule 3 (the punk fan is somewhere to the left of the fan of hip-hop, and the punk fan is not yet assigned). So, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 2 or 4. But if the fan of hip-hop is in position 4, it would violate rule 14 (the owner of the ferret is the fan of jazz, and the ferret owner is not yet assigned). So, the fan of hip-hop is in position 2.

11. From rule 14, the owner of the ferret is the fan of jazz. Since the fan of hip-hop is in position 2, the ferret owner must be in position 1.

12. From rule 5, the American is somewhere between the fan of punk and the owner of the goat. Since the fan of punk is not yet assigned, the American must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But if the American is in position 5, it would violate rule 9 (the van driver is on the far right, and the American cannot be the van driver). So, the American is in position 3 or 4. But if the American is in position 3, it would violate rule 1 (each person has a unique nationality, and the Canadian is already assigned to position 4). So, the American is in position 4.

13. From rule 16, the fan of punk is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the fan of punk is not yet assigned, the fan of punk must be in position 1 or 2. But if the fan of punk is in position 1, it would violate rule 2 (the owner of the cat is in an even position, and the cat owner is not yet assigned). So, the fan of punk is in position 2.

14. From rule 8, the Egyptian is in an odd position. Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the cat owner must be in position 1.

15. From rule 6, the owner of the cat is not the scooter driver. So, the cat owner cannot be in position 3 (since the scooter driver is there). The cat owner also cannot be in position 5 (since the van driver is there). So, the cat owner must be in position 1.

16. From rule 15, the French is on the left of the fan of house. Since the fan of house is in position 3, the French must be in position 2.

17. From rule 7, the Egyptian is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the ferret. Since the fan of hip-hop is in position 2 and the Egyptian is in position 2, the ferret owner must be in position 3.

18. From rule 16, the fan of punk is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the fan of punk is in position 2 and the ferret owner is in position 3, the fan of punk must be in position 1.

19. From rule 1, each person has a unique music genre. We have assigned all music genres to the people. So, the music genres are correct.

20. From rule 2, the owner of the cat is in an even position. We have assigned the cat owner to position 1, which is an even position. So, the pet assignments are correct.

21. From rule 3, the punk fan is somewhere to the left of the fan of hip-hop. We have assigned the punk fan to position 1 and the fan of hip-hop to position 2. So, the nationality assignments are correct.

22. From rule 4, the person driving the bike is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the bike driver is in position 1 and the bird owner is not yet assigned, the bird owner must be in position 2.

23. From rule 6, the owner of the fish is not the scooter driver. Since the scooter driver is in position 3, the fish owner cannot be in position 3. The fish owner also cannot be in position 5 (since the van driver is there). So, the fish owner must be in position 4.

24. From rule 16, the fan of punk is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the fan of punk is in position 1 and the ferret owner is in position 3, the fan of punk must be in position 1.

25. From rule 1, each person has a unique nationality. We have assigned all nationalities to the people. So, the nationality assignments are correct.

26. From rule 5, the American is somewhere between the fan of punk and the owner of the goat. Since the fan of punk is in position 1 and the American is in position 4, the owner of the goat must be in position 2 or 3. But if the owner of the goat is in position 2, it would violate rule 11 (the Egyptian is on the left of the owner of the goat, and the Egyptian is in position 2). So, the owner of the goat is in position 3.

27. From rule 1, each person has a unique pet. We have assigned all pets to the people. So, the pet assignments are correct.

28. From rule 1, each person has a unique transport. We have assigned all transports to the people. So, the transport assignments are correct.

Lv7-4x5-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign odd positions (1, 3, 5) to the jobs and even positions (2, 4) to the pets and music-genres. This is due to conditions 18, 19, and 17.

2. Since the goat owner is on the far right (18), the jobs/pets/genres in positions 1, 3, and 5 are not goat, fish, and snake respectively. So, let's assign goat to position 5, fish to position 1, and snake to position 3.

3. The fan of country is in an odd position (19), so it's not in positions 2, 4, or 5. It's also not the person who's sport is handball (20), so it's not in position 1 (chef) or position 3 (firefighter). Therefore, it must be in position 4.

4. The fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of pop (15), so it's not in positions 1, 3, or 5. Since the fan of country is in position 4, the fan of ambient must be in position 2.

5. The fan of techno is on the right of the fan of ambient (6), so it's not in positions 1, 3, or 4. It's also not the mechanic (16), so it must be in position 5.

6. The fan of dubstep is somewhere between the person who's sport is cricket and the chef (10). Since the chef is on the right of the owner of the fish (14), and the fish is in position 1, the person who's sport is cricket must be in position 2. So, dubstep is in position 3.

7. The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the mechanic (7), and the mechanic is not the fan of techno (16), so the mechanic must be in position 4. Therefore, handball is in position 5.

8. The person who's sport is swimming is the owner of the mouse (4), so the mouse is in position 4.

9. The owner of the rat is on the left of the owner of the mouse (8), so the rat is in position 3.

10. The fan of pop is on the left of the fan of ambient (5), so the fan of pop is in position 1.

11. The paramedic is in an even position (17), so it's either in position 2 or 4. Since the paramedic is not the fan of country (20), it's not in position 4. Therefore, the paramedic is in position 2.

12. The project-manager is somewhere to the left of the firefighter (12), so the project-manager is either in position 1 or 2. Since the project-manager is not the fan of pop (15), it's not in position 1. Therefore, the project-manager is in position 2.

13. The chef is on the right of the owner of the fish (14), so the chef is in position 5.

14. The firefighter is not the person who's sport is biathlon (2), so the firefighter is not in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the firefighter is not the project-manager (12), it's not in position 2. Therefore, the firefighter is in position 4.

15. The person who's sport is biathlon is not the firefighter (2), so it's not in position 4. Since the biathlon is not the person who's sport is swimming (4), it's not in position 3 or 5. Therefore, the biathlon is in position 1.
