Lv7-1x3-1	"Let's break down the information given in the puzzle:

1. There are three music genres: house, jazz, and metal.
2. The fan of metal is to the right of the fan of house (1).
3. The fan of metal is between the fan of house and the fan of jazz (2).

From point 2, we know that the metal fan cannot be in the first column (since there is no genre to its left). So, the house and jazz fans must be in the first two columns, and the metal fan is in the third column.

From point 1, we know that the metal fan is to the right of the house fan. Since the house fan is in the first column, the metal fan must be in the third column.

Now, from point 2, we know that the metal fan is between the house and jazz fans. Since the house fan is in the first column and the metal fan is in the third column, the jazz fan must be in the second column.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   House   | Jazz | Metal |
#############
```

This table represents the arrangement of the music genres according to the given conditions."	{}	False	0	False
Lv7-1x3-2	"Let's break down the information given in the puzzle:

1. The person driving the trike is somewhere between the person driving the train and the person driving the boat. This means that the trike cannot be in the first position (1), as it would leave no space for the train or the boat. Similarly, the trike cannot be in the third position (3), as it would leave no space for the boat. So, the trike must be in the second position (2).

2. The person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat. Since we already know the positions of the train and the trike, this means the boat must be in the first position (1).

Now, let's fill in the table with the final solution:

|             |  1   |   2   |   3   |
| Transport   | Boat | Trike | Train |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|             |  1   |   2   |   3   |
| Transport   | Boat | Trike | Train |

Lv7-1x3-3	"Let's break down the information given in the puzzle:

1. The genres are animation, romance, and zombie.
2. The person watching animation movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching zombie movies.
3. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies.

From point 3, we can deduce that the order of the genres from left to right should be Romance, Animation, Zombie.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1    |     2     |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance | Animation | Zombie |

Since the person watching animation movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching zombie movies, we can't place a specific number for the animation row. However, we know that the animation row is greater than the romance row and less than the zombie row. So, we can represent this information in the table as follows:

|               |    1    |     2     |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   |########| #########|########|

This table represents the solution to the puzzle, where the exact numbers can't be determined due to the given information."	{'movie-genre': ['', '', '']}	True	0	False
Lv7-1x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three types of food: asparagus, nectarine, and peas.

2. The person eating nectarine is somewhere between the person eating peas and the person eating asparagus. This means that the order from left to right must be: Asparagus, Peas, Nectarine.

3. The person eating peas is on the far right. Since we already know the order, this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |
| Food   | Asparagus | Peas     | Nectarine |

Lv7-1x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. From rule 3, we know that the person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking water. This means that neither hot-chocolate nor water can be in the first or the third position. So, the possible arrangements for the first two positions are:
   - Hot-chocolate, Mirinda, Water
   - Mirinda, Hot-chocolate, Water
   - Hot-chocolate, Water, Mirinda (this one is not possible because of rule 2)

2. From rule 2, we know that the person drinking water is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means that the only possible arrangement from the previous step is:
   - Hot-chocolate, Mirinda, Water

3. Now, from rule 1, we know that the person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking water. So, the final arrangement is:
   - Hot-chocolate, Mirinda, Water

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv7-1x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the bus is somewhere between the quad-bike and the tram, it cannot be in the first position (1) because then it would be before the quad-bike, and it cannot be in the third position (3) because then it would be after the tram. So, the bus must be in the second position (2).

2. The bus is on the right of the quad-bike. Since the bus is in the second position, the quad-bike must be in the first position.

3. Now, the only remaining position for the tram is the third position (3).

So, the final solution table is:

  |             |     1     |  2  |  3   |
  | Transport   | Quad-bike | Bus | Tram |

Lv7-1x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the entrepreneur is to the right of the engineer, we can rule out the first column for the engineer. So, the engineer can only be in the second or third column.

2. Now, let's consider the second condition: the engineer is between the entrepreneur and the manager. This means the engineer cannot be in the third column because then there would be no room for the manager to the right of the engineer. So, the engineer must be in the second column.

3. Now we know the engineer is in the second column, and the entrepreneur is to the right of the engineer, so the entrepreneur must be in the third column.

4. Finally, the manager can only be in the first column, as there are no other empty spaces.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Manager  | Entrepreneur | Engineer |
#############
```

This solution satisfies both conditions: the entrepreneur is to the right of the engineer, and the engineer is between the entrepreneur and the manager."	{}	False	0	False
Lv7-1x3-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking Fanta is somewhere between the person drinking Soy-Milk and the person drinking Almond-Milk. This means Fanta cannot be in the first position (1) because then there would be no one to its right. Similarly, Fanta cannot be in the last position (3) because then there would be no one to its left. So, Fanta must be in the middle position (2).

2. The person drinking Soy-Milk is to the left of the person drinking Almond-Milk. Since Fanta is in the middle, Soy-Milk must be in position (1) and Almond-Milk in position (3).

So, the final solution table is:

|            |    1     |   2   |      3      |
| Beverage   | Soy-Milk | Fanta | Almond-Milk |

Lv7-1x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different music-genres: d&b, reggae, and soul.

2. The fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of soul. This means that the order must be either d&b - soul - reggae or reggae - soul - d&b.

3. Since the fan of soul is somewhere between the fan of d&b and the fan of reggae, the order cannot be reggae - soul - d&b because that would place the fan of reggae to the left of the fan of soul, which contradicts the first rule.

4. Therefore, the correct order is d&b - soul - reggae.

5. Now, let's fill in the table:

   |               |   1    |  2   |  3  |
   | Music-Genre   |        |      |     |

6. To follow the given format, we can use the names of the genres for the numbers:

   |               |   d&b  |  soul | reggae |
   | Music-Genre   |        |      |     |

7. To make it more clear, we can add the numbers back in:

   |               |  3    |  2   |  1  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b  |  soul | reggae |

8. To make it look like the original table, we can add the '#############' around the solution:

   | Music-Genre   | d&b  |  soul | reggae |

Lv7-1x3-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the motorbike is to the left of the ship (1), and there are only three options, the motorbike must be in position 1 and the ship in position 3.

2. Now, the motorbike is between the quad-bike and the ship (2). Since the motorbike is already in position 1, the quad-bike must be in position 2.
