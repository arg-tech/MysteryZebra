Lv7-6x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the car driver is in an odd position and there are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), the car driver cannot be in position 1 or 7. So, the car driver is either in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the car driver is in position 3 (we'll see if this assumption holds later).

2. The photographer is on the left or right of the firefighter, and the firefighter is on the far left. So, the photographer must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

3. The person who's hobby is video-games is the coach. Since the coach cannot be in position 1 (as the photographer is there), the coach must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

4. The person driving the van is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the car driver is in position 3, the van driver cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the van driver is in position 2 or 4.

5. The person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking 7up. Since the photographer is in position 1, the person drinking juice cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the person drinking juice is in position 2, 4, or 5.

6. The person driving the car is on the right of the person drinking tea. If the car driver is in position 3, then the person drinking tea must be in position 5.

7. The person driving the car is on the right of the photographer. If the car driver is in position 3, then the photographer must be in position 1.

8. The person who's hobby is reading is in an even position. Since the coach is in position 2, the reader must be in position 4.

9. The person driving the car is somewhere to the right of the photographer. If the car driver is in position 3, then this condition holds.

10. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the coach. If the coach is in position 2, then the card-games person must be in position 3, 5, or 7. But since the car driver is in position 3, the card-games person cannot be in position 3. So, the card-games person is in position 5 or 7.

11. The german is the person driving the car. So, the German is in position 3.

12. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the japanese. Since the photographer is in position 1 and the car driver is in position 3, the person drinking juice cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the person drinking juice is in position 5.

13. The firefighter is somewhere to the left of the fan of funk. Since the firefighter is in position 1, the fan of funk must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

14. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the photographer. Since the photographer is in position 1 and the person drinking juice is in position 5, this condition holds.

15. The fan of gospel is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the fan of punk. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5 and the fan of punk cannot be in position 1 (as the firefighter is there), the fan of gospel must be in position 2 or 4.

16. The japanese is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the photographer is in position 1 and the car driver is in position 3, the person drinking almond-milk cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 2, 4, or 5. But since the person drinking juice is in position 5, the person drinking almond-milk cannot be in position 5. So, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 2.

17. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the left of the fan of punk. Since the fan of punk cannot be in position 1 (as the firefighter is there), the magic-tricks person must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 2, the magic-tricks person cannot be in position 2. So, the magic-tricks person is in position 4 or 6.

18. The firefighter is on the far left. This condition holds as the firefighter is in position 1.

19. The person drinking tea is not the fan of punk. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5 and the fan of punk cannot be in position 1 (as the firefighter is there), this condition holds.

20. The mexican is in an odd position. Since the car driver (german) is in position 3, the mexican cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the mexican is in position 7.

21. The person driving the subway is in an even position. Since the van driver is in position 2 and the car driver is in position 3, the subway driver must be in position 4.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |      1       |      2       |      3      |      4      |      5      |      6      |      7      |

| Job           | firefighter  |             |            |            |             |            |             |

| Nationality   | mexican     | japanese    | german     | argentine  |             |             |             |
| Transport     | subway      | car         |            |            |             |             | van         |

The table is not complete as we don't have the jobs for the other positions. However, we know that the jobs are coach, electrician, and photographer (as the coach is already placed). We also know that the electrician is not the firefighter (as the firefighter is in position 1), not the photographer (as the photographer is on the left or right of the firefighter), and not the person driving the subway (as the subway driver is in an even position and the electrician cannot be in position 4 as the subway driver is there). So, the electrician must be in position 2 or 4. But since the van driver is in position 2, the electrician must be in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-6x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the hobbies, jobs, music-genres, nationalities, pets, and transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From rule 1, we know that the owner of the bird doesn't prefer trance. So, let's assign trance to any of the other three people (2, 3, 4).

3. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is drawing is not the Mexican. So, let's assign drawing to any of the other three people (1, 3, 4).

4. From rule 4, the Australian is on the far left. So, let's assign Australia to the first position.

5. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is fishing is not the architect. So, let's assign fishing to any of the other three people (1, 2, 4).

6. From rule 6, the accountant is on the right of the Canadian. Since the Australian is on the far left, the Canadian must be the second person. So, let's assign Canada to the second position and accounting to the third position.

7. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is baking is the Canadian. So, let's assign baking to the second position.

8. From rule 8, the person driving the boat is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the Australian. Since the Australian is the first person and we've assigned reggae to one of the other three people (2, 3, 4), the boat driver must be one of the remaining two people (3, 4).

9. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since we've assigned drawing to the third person and fishing to one of the other three people (1, 2, 4), the person who fishes must be one of the first two people (1, 2).

10. From rule 10, the Egyptian is the owner of the pony. So, let's assign Egypt to the fourth position and the pony to any of the four people.

11. From rule 11, the owner of the goat is the person driving the motorbike. So, let's assign the goat to the person driving the motorbike.

12. From rule 12, the Egyptian is not the person who's hobby is fishing. Since we've assigned fishing to one of the first two people (1, 2), the Egyptian must be one of the last two people (3, 4).

13. From rule 13, the videographer is between the entrepreneur and the person driving the motorbike. Since the entrepreneur is the third person and we've assigned the motorbike to the second last person, the videographer must be the last person.

14. From rule 14, the person driving the car is on the far left. Since we've assigned the Australian to the first position, the car must be assigned to the first position.

15. From rule 15, the person who's hobby is chess is on the far left. Since we've assigned the car to the first position, chess must be assigned to the first position.

16. From rule 16, the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat. Since we've assigned the goat to the second last person and baking to the second person, the second person must be to the left of the second last person.

17. From rule 17, the person who's hobby is baking is between the fan of r&b and the owner of the hedgehog. Since we've assigned r&b to one of the other three people (1, 3, 4) and the hedgehog to the last person, the second person (baking) must be between the r&b fan and the last person (videographer).

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv7-6x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, we know that the fan of electronic is between the fan of ambient and the person who's hobby is puzzles. Let's place them as follows:

   |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |       4       |

2. From rule 13, we know that the fan of electronic is also between the person drinking almond-milk and the fan of reggae. Since we already placed the fan of electronic, let's place the fan of reggae and the person drinking almond-milk:

3. From rule 11, we know that the fan of reggae is between the fan of electronic and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Let's place the person who's hobby is rock-climbing:

4. From rule 14, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, let's place surfing on the far left:

   |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |       4       |

6. From rule 2, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is not the person eating apple. Since we already placed the person who's sport is skateboarding, let's place baseball somewhere else:

8. From rule 3, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person drinking cola. Since we already placed the person driving the motorbike, let's place the person drinking cola:

11. From rule 6, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the fan of electronic. Since we already placed the person driving the motorbike and the person drinking cola, let's place the person who's sport is baseball:

   |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |       4       |

12. From rule 8, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is not the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we already placed all the people, let's place the person driving the quad-bike:

   |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |       4       |

13. From rule 15, we know that the person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we already placed the person driving the quad-bike, let's place the person driving the ship:

   |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |       4       |

14. From rule 16, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since we already placed the person driving the ship, let's place the person who's hobby is dancing:

   |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |       4       |

Lv7-6x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill in the number of rows in the table.

2. We know that there are 4 different beverages, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and transport. Let's label them A, B, C, D for beverages, 1, 2, 3, 4 for jobs, E, F, G, H for movie-genres, I, J, K, L for music-genres, M, N, O, P for pets, and Q, R, S, T for transport.

3. From point 1.6, we know that the person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. So, we can place water in a position that is to the right of soy-milk (let's say position D). From point 1.17, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is the fan of funk. So, we can place funk in position D as well.

4. From point 1.18, we know that the analyst is somewhere to the left of the fisherman. Since there are only 4 positions, the analyst must be in position 1, 2, or 3. If the analyst were in position 1, the fisherman would have to be in position 4, but the fisherman can't drive the jet-ski (point 9), which is the only available transport for position 4. So, the analyst can't be in position 1. If the analyst were in position 2, the fisherman would have to be in position 3, but the fisherman can't be the fan of classical (point 1.5), which is the only available music-genre for position 3. So, the analyst can't be in position 2 either. Therefore, the analyst must be in position 3.

5. From point 1.4, we know that the pilot is in an even position. Since the analyst is in position 3 (an odd position), the pilot must be in position 4.

6. From point 1.19, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is not the person driving the jet-ski. Since the pilot is driving the jet-ski (point 5), the person drinking iced-tea can't be the pilot. So, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1, 2, or 3. If the person drinking iced-tea were in position 1, the person driving the jet-ski would have to be in position 2, but the owner of the fish is the person driving the jet-ski (point 9), which means the owner of the fish can't be in position 2. So, the person drinking iced-tea can't be in position 1. If the person drinking iced-tea were in position 2, the person driving the jet-ski would have to be in position 3, but the person driving the jet-ski can't be the fan of classical (point 1.5), which is the only available music-genre for position 3. So, the person drinking iced-tea can't be in position 2 either. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3.

7. From point 1.9, we know that the owner of the fish is the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person driving the jet-ski is the person in position 4 (point 5), the owner of the fish must be in position 4.

8. From point 1.7, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 4, the person driving the roller must be in position 5 or 6.

9. From point 1.10, we know that the person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position D (point 3), the person driving the roller can't be in position D or C. So, the person driving the roller must be in position 5 or 6.

10. From point 1.11, we know that the owner of the bird is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (which is in position D). So, the owner of the bird can't be in position D or C. Since the person driving the roller can't be in position D or C either (point 9), the owner of the bird must be in position 5 or 6.

11. From point 1.16, we know that the fan of trance is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking water is in position D (point 3), the person drinking mirinda can't be in position D or C. So, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. If the person drinking mirinda were in position 1, the person driving the roller would have to be in position 2, but the person driving the roller can't be in position 2 (point 9). If the person drinking mirinda were in position 2, the owner of the bird would have to be in position 3, but the owner of the bird can't be in position 3 (point 10). If the person drinking mirinda were in position 4, the person driving the jet-ski would have to be in position 5, but the person driving the jet-ski can't be in position 5 (point 7). Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 5.

12. From point 1.13, we know that the person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (which is in position D). So, the person drinking water can't be in position D or C. Since the person driving the roller can't be in position D or C either (point 9), the person drinking water must be in position 5 or 6. If the person drinking water were in position 5, the person driving the roller would have to be in position 6, but the person driving the roller can't be in position 6 (point 9). Therefore, the person drinking water must be in position 6.

13. From point 1.14, we know that the coach is in an even position. Since the analyst is in position 3 (an odd position), the coach must be in position 2 or 4. If the coach were in position 2, the person driving the jet-ski would have to be in position 3, but the person driving the jet-ski can't be in position 3 (point 7). Therefore, the coach must be in position 4.

14. From point 1.15, we know that the fan of classical is not the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the roller is in position 5 (point 11), the fan of classical can't be in position 5. Since the coach is in position 4 (point 13), the fan of classical can't be in position 4 either. Therefore, the fan of classical must be in position 1 or 2. If the fan of classical were in position 1, the person drinking iced-tea would have to be in position 2, but the person drinking iced-tea can't be in position 2 (point 6). Therefore, the fan of classical must be in position 2.

15. From point 1.2, we know that the person watching satire movies is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 4 (point 5), the person watching satire movies can't be in position 4 either. Since the fan of classical is in position 2 (point 14), the person watching satire movies can't be in position 2 either. Therefore, the person watching satire movies must be in position 1.

16. From point 1.8, we know that the pilot is on the right of the fisherman. Since the pilot is in position 4 (point 5), the fisherman must be in position 3.

17. From point 1.1, we know that there are 4 different beverages. We have already placed funk (soy-milk), water, and iced-tea. The only remaining beverage is mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 5 (point 11), mirinda must be in position 5.

18. From point 1.6, we know that the person watching musical movies is somewhere between the owner of the bird and the pilot. Since the owner of the bird is in position 5 (point 10) and the pilot is in position 4 (point 5), the person watching musical movies can be in position 4 or 5. If the person watching musical movies were in position 4, the coach would have to be in position 3, but the coach can't be in position 3 (point 13). Therefore, the person watching musical movies must be in position 5.

19. From point 1.20, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 4 (point 5) and the person drinking iced-tea is in position 3 (point 6), the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 2.

20. From point 1.12, we know that the owner of the goat is the owner of the goat. Since the owner of the goat can't be in position 1, 2, 4, or 6 (points 9, 10, 13, 19), the owner of the goat must be in position 3.

2. The subway driver is on the left or right of the van driver. Let's assume the order is Subway - Van.

3. The person watching zombie movies is the person eating mango. So, Mango is in position 3 (since we know the reading person is in position 2).

4. The person eating watermelon is not the person watching zombie movies, so watermelon cannot be in position 3. Let's assume the order is Artichoke - Pear - Watermelon.

5. The subway driver is on the right of the person eating mango, so the order is Subway - Van - Mango.

6. The fan of ambient is the person watching time-travel movies, and the person watching time-travel movies is the fan of ambient. So, Time-travel movies are in position 6. Since we know the reading person is in position 2, time-travel movies cannot be in position 2. Let's assume the order is Traveling - Reading - Rock-climbing - Time-travel.

7. The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the person eating artichoke. So, the order is Artichoke - Pear - Watermelon.

8. The person eating mango is in an odd position, so Mango is in position 3.

9. The fan of electronic is in an odd position, but we already know the positions of Mango and Watermelon, so electronic cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the order is Electronic - Ambient - Reggae.

10. The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person eating pear. Since we know the positions of Mango, Watermelon, Artichoke, and Pear, Reggae cannot be in position 1 or 5. Let's assume the order is Reggae - Designer - Analyst - Bus.

11. The fan of electronic is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since we know the positions of Reading and Electronic, the hobby of reading cannot be in position 4. So, the order is Traveling - Reading - Rock-climbing - Time-travel - Electronic.

12. The person watching time-travel movies is the fan of ambient, so Ambient is in position 6.

13. The person who's hobby is photography is in an even position. Since we know the positions of Traveling, Reading, Rock-climbing, Time-travel, and Electronic, Photography can only be in position 2 (Reading) or position 4. But we know that the hobby of photography is not rock-climbing (from 17), so Photography is in position 4.

14. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the videographer. Since we know the positions of Traveling and Videographer, the videographer can only be in position 3 (Mango). So, the hobby of the person in position 3 is rock-climbing (since we know the hobby of position 4 is photography).

15. The analyst is on the left of the fan of ambient. Since we know the positions of Analyst and Ambient, the analyst can only be in position 5 (Reggae).

12. From point 19, we know the malaysian is somewhere between the thai and the indonesian. Since the thai is in position 1 and the indonesian must be in position 3 (as the malaysian is to its right), the hobby1 must be in position 2 (hobby1).

13. From point 4, we know the malaysian is on the left of the person eating orange. Since the malaysian is in position 3, the orange must be in position 2 (orange).

14. From point 6, we know the hobby of the person eating banana is reading. Since the banana is in position 4, the hobby of the person in position 1 must be board-games (as the owner of the snake's hobby is board-games).

15. From point 8, we know the person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the hobby of the person in position 1 is board-games and the hobby of the person in position 2 is reading, the hobby of the person in position 3 must be hiking (hiking).

16. From point 5, we know the lawyer is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the hobby of the person in position 1 is board-games, the hobby of the person in position 2 is reading, and the hobby of the person in position 3 is hiking, the hobby of the person in position 4 must be singing (singing).

17. From point 9, we know the social-worker is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony. Since the lawyer, goat, social-worker, banana, thai, brazilian, malaysian, bird, coffee, and tea are already placed, the pony must be in position 1 (pony).

18. From point 7, we know the accountant is somewhere between the owner of the snake and the person eating banana. Since the snake's owner's hobby is board-games (in position 1), the accountant must be in position 2 (accountant) and the person eating banana is in position 4 (banana).

So, the final solution table is:

| Transport     |            |         |       | Pony    |

11. The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position, and there are 5 odd positions left (1, 3, 5). Since the person watching adventure movies is the person driving the quad-bike, we can place quad-bike in the third row:

| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Lemonade | Milk   | Tea    |

| Transport     |            |         |       | Pony    |

13. The person eating cabbage is not the owner of the hedgehog, so we can place cranberry in the fourth column:

| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Lemonade | Milk   | Tea    |
|--------------|------------|---------|-------|--------|
| Disaster     |            | Adventure| Quad-bike| Nurse  |

Lv7-6x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people with unique characteristics. The mechanic drinks tea and is the mechanic, so we place him in the third row. Since the mechanic is not the American (rule 7), he can't be in the first or fourth column. Let's place him in the second column (2).

2. The Spanish is the fan of disco, so we place him in the fourth row and first column (4,1). Since the Spanish is on the left of the mechanic (rule 19), the mechanic must be in the second or third column.

3. The American is the fan of indie (rule 12), so we place him in the first row. Since the American is on the left or right of the writer (rule 14) and the Spanish is on his right (rule 15), the writer must be in the fourth column.

4. The writer's beverage is not sprite (since the horse owner is between the person drinking sprite and the person watching family movies, and the mechanic is already in the second column, so the writer can't be in the first column). The writer's beverage is also not hot-chocolate (since the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, and the Spanish is already in the first column, so the writer can't be in the fourth column). The writer's beverage is not soy-milk (since the fan of indie is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk, and the American is already in the first column, so the writer can't be in the third column). Therefore, the writer's beverage must be tea, so we place the writer in the first row and fourth column (1,4).

5. The architect is the fan of trance (rule 9), so we place him in the fourth row. Since the architect is not the American (rule 7), he can't be in the first column. Since the architect is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk (rule 17), the person drinking soy-milk can't be in the fourth column. Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk must be in the first or third column. Since the American is the fan of indie and is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (rule 16), the person drinking soy-milk must be in the third column. Therefore, the architect is in the fourth row and second column (4,2).

6. The person drinking soy-milk is the chef (rule 3), so we place the chef in the second row and third column (2,3).

7. The person watching family movies is not the architect (rule 1), so it can't be in the fourth row. Since the mechanic is already in the second column, the person watching family movies can't be in the first or fourth column. Since the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the mechanic (rule 2), it must be in the third column. Since the horse owner is between the person drinking sprite and the person watching family movies (rule 10), the person watching family movies can't be in the first row. Therefore, the person watching family movies must be in the second row.

8. The horse owner is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching family movies (rule 18), so the person watching romance movies must be in the first row. Since the writer is already in the first row and fourth column, the person watching romance movies can't be in the fourth column. Therefore, the person watching romance movies must be in the first column.

9. Since the person watching romance movies is in the first row and first column (1,1), the horse owner must be in the second row and third column (2,3).

10. The person drinking sprite is somewhere between the horse owner and the person watching family movies (rule 10), so the person drinking sprite must be in the second row. Since the mechanic is already in the second column, the person drinking sprite can't be in the first or fourth column. Therefore, the person drinking sprite must be in the third column.

11. The owner of the goldfish is on the far right (rule 8), so we place the goldfish in the fourth column and any row.

Now, let's place the remaining movie-genres, music-genres, and pets:

12. The person watching action movies is not the architect (rule 1), so it can't be in the fourth row. Since the mechanic is already in the second column, the person watching action movies can't be in the first or fourth column. Since the person watching action movies is on the left or right of the fan of indie (rule 6), the fan of indie can't be in the fourth column. Therefore, the fan of indie must be in the first or third column. Since the American is the fan of indie and is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (rule 16), the person drinking soy-milk must be in the third column. Therefore, the person watching action movies must be in the second column.

13. The person watching family movies is in the second row and third column (2,3).

14. The person watching romance movies is in the first row and first column (1,1).

15. The person watching action movies is in the second row and second column (2,2).

16. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (rule 17), so the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be in the first or fourth column. Since the Spanish is already in the first column, the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be in the fourth column. Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the third column. Since the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, the fan of salsa can't be in the first column. Therefore, the fan of salsa must be in the fourth column.

17. The fan of trance is the architect (rule 9), so we already know his position.

18. The remaining movie-genre is spy, so it must be in the fourth row. Since the architect is already in the fourth row and second column, the spy movie-genre can't be in the second column. Therefore, the spy movie-genre must be in the fourth column.

19. The remaining music-genres are disco, indie, salsa, and trance. Since the Spanish is the fan of disco (rule 11), the remaining music-genres must be indie, salsa, and trance. Since the mechanic is the fan of salsa (rule 3), the remaining music-genres are indie and trance. Since the architect is the fan of trance (rule 9), the remaining music-genre is indie.

20. The remaining pets are dog, frog, goldfish, and horse. Since the horse is already placed, the remaining pets are dog, frog, and goldfish. Since the owner of the goldfish is on the far right (rule 8), the remaining pets are dog and frog. Since the owner of the dog is not the British (rule 13), the owner of the dog must be the American or the Spanish. Since the American is already the fan of indie, the owner of the dog must be the Spanish. However, this would place the Spanish in the fourth column, which contradicts rule 11 (the Spanish is the fan of disco). Therefore, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle.

Final solution table:
