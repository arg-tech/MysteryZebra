Lv7-1x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of techno is in the middle, so we can mark it as 'T' in the third row.

2. Since the fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of techno, it can only be in the first or second or sixth row. Let's try placing it in the first row for now (A).

3. The fan of dubstep is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the fan of techno. If ambient is in the first row, then reggae must be in the second row (R). This means dubstep can only be in the fourth row (D).

4. The fan of classical is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient. Since ambient is in the first row, classical can only be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth row. But we already placed classical in the fourth row, so it can't be there. Let's try placing classical in the second row (C).

5. The fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of reggae. Since reggae is in the second row, r&b can only be in the first row (B).

6. The fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of classical. Since we placed ambient in the first row and classical in the second row, this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv7-1x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From points 2 and 7, we know that martial-arts is between western and fantasy, and time-travel is next to or after scientific. Since martial-arts can't be in position 1 (as it's between two other genres), it must be in position 2. This means western is in position 1 and fantasy is in position 3.

2. From point 4, action is to the right of scientific. Since we know martial-arts (which is between western and fantasy) is to the left of scientific, action can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, action is in position 4.

3. From point 5, scientific is between action and thriller. Since we know action is in position 4 and martial-arts is in position 2, scientific must be in position 5.

4. From point 8, time-travel is to the left of scientific. Since we know time-travel can't be in position 1 (as it's after scientific), it must be in position 6.

5. From point 3, fantasy is on the left or right of thriller. Since we know fantasy is in position 3 and time-travel is in position 6, thriller must be in position 4.

6. From point 10, fantasy is on the left or right of thriller. Since we know fantasy is in position 3 and thriller is in position 4, fantasy must be in position 5.

7. From point 9, thriller is to the left of fantasy. Since we know thriller is in position 4 and fantasy is in position 5, this condition is satisfied.

8. From point 6, martial-arts is to the left of thriller. Since we know martial-arts is in position 2 and thriller is in position 4, this condition is satisfied.

Lv7-1x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the helicopter is between the car and the train. Let's place them in that order: [car, helicopter, train].
2. From point 2, we know that the train is between the roller and the helicopter. So, the roller should be to the left of the car: [car, roller, train, helicopter].
3. From point 3, we know that the trike is to the left of the train. But we already placed the trike between the van and the car in point 4. This creates a contradiction, so we need to adjust our initial placement of the trike. Let's place the train, roller, and helicopter as they are, and move the trike to the left of the roller: [car, roller, trike, helicopter, train].
4. From point 4, we know that the trike is between the van and the car. So, the van should be to the right of the trike: [car, roller, trike, van, train, helicopter].
5. From point 5, we know that the helicopter is to the right of the train. So, our current arrangement is correct.
6. From point 6, we know that the roller is between the helicopter and the trike. So, our current arrangement is correct.
7. From point 7, we know that the trike is to the left of the train. So, our current arrangement is correct.
8. From point 8, we know that the snowmobile is on the far right. Since the helicopter is already on the far right, the snowmobile should be placed to its right: [car, roller, trike, van, train, helicopter, snowmobile].

Lv7-1x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the train is in an odd position and there are 7 positions, it can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the train is in position 1 (we'll check other possibilities later).

2. Since the roller is in an odd position and the train is in position 1, the roller can only be in positions 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the roller is in position 3.

3. Now, the train is to the left of the bike, so the bike can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the bike is in position 2.

4. The taxi is to the left of the ship, and the ship is between the quad-bike and the taxi. So, the quad-bike can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5, and the taxi can only be in positions 4, 6, or 7. Let's assume the quad-bike is in position 1 and the taxi is in position 4.

5. Now, the taxi is between the ship and the bike, so the ship can only be in positions 5 or 6. Let's assume the ship is in position 5.

6. The scooter is to the left of the quad-bike, so the scooter can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Since the scooter is not in position 2 (because the bike is there), it must be in position 4 or 6. Let's assume the scooter is in position 4.

7. Now, the quad-bike is in position 1, the bike is in position 2, the scooter is in position 4, the taxi is in position 4, and the ship is in position 5. The only remaining position for the roller is position 7.

8. The train is in position 1, and the roller is in position 7, so the roller is to the right of the train. This contradicts our initial assumption that the train is in position 1.

Let's try another assumption for the train's position:

1. The train is in position 3.
2. The roller is in position 5.
3. The bike is in position 2.
4. The quad-bike is in position 1.
5. The taxi is in position 6.
6. The ship is in position 4.

Lv7-1x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 9, the car is between the trike and the helicopter. Since there are only 7 spots, the car must be in the middle (position 4).

2. From rule 5, the car is on the left or right of the trike. Since the car is in the middle, the trike must be on the left (position 3) and the helicopter on the right (position 6).

3. From rule 3, the quad-bike is on the right of the car (position 5).

4. From rule 4, the subway is on the right of the quad-bike (position 7).

5. From rule 1, the helicopter is on the left or right of the car. Since the car is in the middle, the helicopter must be on the right (position 6).

6. From rule 7, the trike is on the left of the quad-bike (position 3).

7. From rule 8, the skateboard is on the left of the scooter. Since the scooter is to the right of the car (rule 2), the scooter must be in position 5 or 6. But if the scooter was in position 6, the skateboard would be in position 1, which is not possible because the skateboard is to the right of the quad-bike (rule 10). So, the scooter must be in position 5.

8. From rule 6, the subway is on the far left or far right. Since the car is in the middle, the subway cannot be in position 1 or 7. So, the subway must be in position 2.

9. From rule 10, the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike is in position 5, the skateboard must be in position 6.

10. From rule 2, the scooter is somewhere to the right of the car. Since the car is in position 4, the scooter must be in position 5.

11. From rule 3, the trike is on the right of the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike is in position 5, the trike must be in position 3.

12. From rule 8, the skateboard is on the left of the scooter. Since the scooter is in position 5, the skateboard must be in position 3. This is a contradiction because the trike is already in position 3. So, the scooter must be in position 6 and the skateboard in position 5.

3. Now, since ""chess"" is in position 6, ""cooking"" is in position 5. From rule 2, ""gardening"" is to the left of ""cooking."" So, ""gardening"" must be in position 4.

4. From rule 7, ""board-games"" is to the left of ""magic-tricks."" Since ""gardening"" is in position 4 and ""cooking"" is in position 5, ""board-games"" must be in position 3.

5. From rule 4, ""chess"" is on the left or right of ""cooking."" Since ""chess"" is in position 6 and ""cooking"" is in position 5, ""chess"" cannot be in position 4 (as it would violate rule 1). So, ""chess"" must be in position 7, which means ""cooking"" is in position 5 and ""gardening"" is in position 4.

6. From rule 5, ""gardening"" is on the left or right of ""magic-tricks."" Since ""gardening"" is in position 4, ""magic-tricks"" must be in position 3.

7. From rule 9, ""reading"" is between ""cooking"" (position 5) and ""puzzles."" Since ""puzzles"" cannot be in position 1 (rule 8), ""reading"" must be in position 2.

Lv7-1x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Spanish is in an odd position (4), it can't be in the first or last position. So, it's either 3 or 5.

2. If the Spanish was in position 3, the British would have to be in position 1 (since the Spanish is between the Argentine and the Colombian, and the British is to the left of the Spanish). But this would mean the Turkish is in position 2, which is impossible because the Turkish is to the left of the Colombian. So, the Spanish can't be in position 3.

3. Therefore, the Spanish must be in position 5. This means the British is in position 2 and the Argentine is in position 1.

4. Now, the Japanese must be in an even position (since it's to the left of the Colombian, which is in position 4). So, it can be in position 2, 4, or 6. But if it was in position 2, the Spanish would be in position 3, which we've already ruled out. If it was in position 6, the nigerian would have to be in position 7, but the nigerian is to the right of the British, so this is also impossible. So, the Japanese must be in position 4.

5. Now, the Colombian is to the left of the Spanish (position 5), so it must be in position 3.

6. The nigerian is to the right of the Argentine (position 1) and the British (position 2), so it must be in position 6.

Lv7-1x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the police-officer is in an odd position and there are 7 jobs, the police-officer must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, if the police-officer were in position 1, the firefighter would have to be in position 2, which would mean the mechanic (left of the firefighter) would have to be in position 1, which is not possible because the police-officer is in position 1. So, the police-officer cannot be in position 1.

2. Now, the police-officer can only be in positions 3 or 5. If the police-officer were in position 5, the firefighter would have to be in position 6, which would mean the mechanic (left of the firefighter) would have to be in position 4, but that's not possible because the mechanic is between the designer and the scientist (positions 2 and 5). So, the police-officer cannot be in position 5.

3. Therefore, the police-officer must be in position 3. This means the firefighter is in position 4.

4. The mechanic is between the designer and the scientist, so the mechanic can be in positions 2, 5, or 6. If the mechanic were in position 2, the designer would have to be in position 1, but that's not possible because the police-officer is in position 3. If the mechanic were in position 6, the scientist would have to be in position 7, but that's not possible because the security-guard is on the far left or far right (positions 1 or 7). So, the mechanic cannot be in position 2 or 6.

5. Therefore, the mechanic must be in position 5. This means the designer is in position 1 and the scientist is in position 7.

6. The mechanic is to the left of the writer, so the writer can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. If the writer were in position 2, the security-guard would have to be in position 1 (far left), but that's not possible because the mechanic is to the left of the writer. If the writer were in position 6, the security-guard would have to be in position 7 (far right), but that's not possible because the mechanic is to the left of the writer. So, the writer cannot be in position 2 or 6.

7. Therefore, the writer must be in position 4. This means the security-guard is in position 1 (far left).

8. The police-officer is to the right of the writer, so the jobs from left to right are: security-guard, writer, police-officer, firefighter, mechanic, designer, scientist.

9. However, we need to check the position of the mechanic again because it was determined based on the writer's position. Since the mechanic is between the designer and the scientist, and the designer is in position 1, the mechanic cannot be in position 2 (because the firefighter is in position 4). So, the mechanic must be in position 6.

2. From rule 2, the British cannot be in the second position (2) because if it were, the Canadian would have to be in the first position (1), which contradicts rule 6 (Canadian is to the left of Egyptian). So, the British must be in the third or fourth position.

3. From rule 3, the Egyptian cannot be in the seventh position (7) because if it were, the Polish would have to be in the sixth position (6), which contradicts rule 9 (Polish is to the left of Japanese). So, the Egyptian must be in the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth position.

4. From rule 4, the Malaysian cannot be in the first position (1) because if it were, the Mexican would have to be in the second position (2), which contradicts rule 7 (Mexican is to the right of Japanese). So, the Malaysian must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh position.

7. From rule 7, the Mexican cannot be in the first position (1) because if it were, the Japanese would have to be in the second position (2), which contradicts rule 7 (Mexican is to the right of Japanese). So, the Mexican must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh position.

8. From rule 8, the British cannot be in the seventh position (7) because if it were, the Japanese would have to be in the sixth position (6), which contradicts rule 8 (British is to the left of Japanese). So, the British must be in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

9. From rule 9, the Polish cannot be in the first position (1) because if it were, the Japanese would have to be in the second position (2), which contradicts rule 9 (Polish is to the left of Japanese). So, the Polish must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh position.

10. From rule 10, the British cannot be in the first position (1) because if it were, the Polish would have to be in the second position (2), which contradicts rule 10 (British is to the right of Polish). So, the British must be in the third or fourth position.

Now, let's place the nationalities based on the rules we've found:

- The British cannot be in the first position, so it must be in the second, third, or fourth position. Let's place it in the third position (British: 3).

1. We know that the person watching martial-arts movies is either to the left or right of the person watching documentary movies (1), and also that they are somewhere between the person watching documentary movies and the person watching zombie movies (2). This means that martial-arts can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

2. The person watching romance movies is in the middle (4), so it must be in position 3. This means that martial-arts can't be in positions 2, 4, or 6. So, martial-arts can only be in positions 3, 5, or 7.

3. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person watching romance movies (7), so martial-arts can't be in position 5. So, martial-arts can only be in positions 3 or 7.

4. The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies (4), and the person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies (6). This means that documentary, scientific, zombie, and animation must be in positions 1, 2, 5, and 6 in some order.

5. The person watching zombie movies is somewhere between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching disaster movies (5). This means that zombie can't be in position 6. So, zombie can only be in position 5.

6. Now we know that documentary, scientific, zombie, and animation are in positions 1, 2, 5, and 6 in some order. Since zombie is in position 5, scientific must be in position 1, and animation must be in position 6. This leaves documentary in position 2.

7. The person watching disaster movies must be in position 3, 4, or 7. But since we already know that positions 3 and 7 are taken by martial-arts and romance, disaster must be in position 4.

8. Now we have all the genres in their positions:
