Lv7-4x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 people, so we can number them from 1 to 7.

2. Let's start with nationalities:
   - The Egyptian is on the far left (1), so Egyptian is in position 1.
   - The American is in the middle (4), so American is in position 4 (Journalist).
   - The British is somewhere to the left of the fan of reggae (5), so British is either 2 or 3. Since the British can't be in position 2 (discussed later), British is in position 3.
   - The Spanish is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian (5), so Spanish is either 2 or 5. Since the Spanish can't be in position 5 (discussed later), Spanish is in position 2.
   - The Pakistani is the person drinking hot-chocolate (6), so Pakistani is in position 8 (Pilot).
   - The Nigerian is the fan of metal (21), so Nigerian is in position 5.
   - The Russian is in an even position (4), but not in position 4 (American), so Russian is in position 6.

3. Let's move on to jobs:
   - The American is the journalist (17), so Journalist is in position 4.
   - The British is the bartender (since the British is to the left of the fan of reggae and the fan of reggae is on the right of someone, and the only job left for the British is bartender). So, Bartender is in position 3.
   - The Pakistani is the pilot (8), so Pilot is in position 8.
   - The Nigerian is the fan of metal (21), so the person with the job ""videographer"" is in position 5.
   - The Russian is in position 6, but the only job left is freelancer, so Freelancer is in position 6.
   - The Spanish is in position 2, but the only job left is writer, so Writer is in position 2.
   - The dancer is somewhere between the Pakistani and the bartender (7), so Dancer is in position 7.
   - The person drinking juice is on the right of the videographer (1), so the person with the job ""journalist"" (American) can't be drinking juice, and the only remaining job for the person drinking juice is the job of the person in position 1 (Egyptian). So, the Egyptian is drinking juice.

4. Now let's fill in the beverages:
   - The Egyptian is drinking juice (1), so Juice is in position 1.
   - The American is the journalist (4), but the journalist is drinking juice (1), so the person in position 4 is drinking 7up (20). So, 7up is in position 4.
   - The British is the bartender (3), but the bartender is to the left of the fan of reggae (5), so the person in position 3 is drinking something other than water (since the only position left for water is 7 and the fan of reggae is on the right of the person drinking water). Let's say the British is drinking soy-milk (4). So, Soy-milk is in position 3.
   - The Pakistani is the pilot (8), but the pilot is drinking hot-chocolate (8), so the person in position 8 is drinking something other than hot-chocolate. Let's say the Pakistani is drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking iced-tea is between the Egyptian and the Pakistani (7), the only remaining position for iced-tea is position 6. So, Iced-tea is in position 6.
   - The Spanish is in position 2, but the only beverage left is water, so Water is in position 2.
   - The Nigerian is the fan of metal (5), but the Nigerian is drinking something other than iced-tea (since the person drinking iced-tea is between the Egyptian and the Pakistani), so the Nigerian is drinking lemonade. Since the fan of reggae is on the right of the person drinking water (19), the only remaining position for lemonade is position 5. So, Lemonade is in position 5.
   - The Russian is in position 6, but the only beverage left is hot-chocolate (since the Pakistani is drinking iced-tea), so Hot-chocolate is in position 6.

5. Finally, let's fill in the music-genres:
   - The Egyptian is the fan of folk (4), so Folk is in position 1.
   - The British is the bartender (3), but the bartender is drinking soy-milk (4), so the fan of disco is in position 3. So, Disco is in position 3.
   - The Pakistani is the pilot (8), but the pilot is drinking hot-chocolate (8), so the fan of blues is in position 8. So, Blues is in position 8.
   - The American is the journalist (4), but the journalist is drinking 7up (20), so the fan of pop is in position 4. So, Pop is in position 4.
   - The British is in position 3, but the fan of disco is in position 3, so the fan of ambient is in position 2. So, Ambient is in position 2.
   - The Spanish is in position 2, but the only music-genre left is reggae, so Reggae is in position 2.

Here is the final solution table:

```
                 |     1     |     2      |      3       |     4      |    5     |    6     |       7       |
| Beverage      | Juice     | Water     | Soy-milk    | 7up        | Lemonade | Hot-chocolate| Iced-tea |

Lv7-4x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each category a unique number from 1 to 7. For example, we can assign hobbies to numbers 1-7, jobs to numbers 8-14, music-genres to numbers 15-21, and transport to numbers 22-28.

2. Next, let's use the given clues to fill in as much information as possible. For example, we know that the social-worker is to the left of the doctor (#5), so we can place the social-worker in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and the doctor in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6.

3. Continue filling in the table based on the given clues. Some clues will help eliminate possible positions for certain people or items, while others will directly place them in a specific position.

4. Once you've filled in as much as you can, use the remaining clues to further narrow down the possibilities. For example, if a certain job or hobby can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3, and we know that the social-worker is in position 1, then the job or hobby cannot be in position 1.

5. Repeat this process until you've filled in the entire table.

Here's a simplified version of the table after applying some of the clues:

Lv7-4x7-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the people based on their hobbies. For example, we can assign the number 1 to the person who's hobby is reading, 2 to the person who's hobby is video-games (since they are a fan of reggae), and so on.

2. From rule 18 and 17, we know that the person eating mango (hobby number 4) is either to the left or right of the person eating lettuce (an unknown number). Since the person drinking milk is the person eating mango (rule 14), we can deduce that the person eating lettuce is to the left of the person drinking milk (since mango is in an odd position, rule 13).

3. From rule 24 and 23, we know that the person who's hobby is baking (an unknown number) is either to the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing (an unknown number). Since the person eating eggplant is in an odd position (rule 25), the person who's hobby is fishing cannot be the person eating eggplant. Therefore, the person who's hobby is baking is to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.

4. From rule 22 and 26, we know that the person drinking milk (hobby number 4) is to the left of the fan of punk (an unknown number). Since the person drinking milk is the person eating mango, the person who's hobby is fishing (an unknown number) must be to the right of the fan of punk.

5. From rule 29 and 30, we know that the person who's hobby is reading (hobby number 1) is either to the left or right of the fan of punk (an unknown number). Since the person who's hobby is reading is also the fan of rock (rule 30), the fan of punk must be to the right of the person who's hobby is reading.

6. From rule 27 and 18, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games (an unknown number) is either to the left or right of the fan of hip-hop (an unknown number). Since the fan of hip-hop is to the left of the person drinking milk (rule 26), the person who's hobby is card-games is to the left of the fan of hip-hop.

7. From rule 37, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.

8. From rule 36, we know that the person eating watermelon is to the left of the fan of punk.

9. From rule 19, we know that the person drinking cola is in an odd position. Since the person drinking milk is in an even position (rule 14), the person drinking cola must be to the left of the person drinking milk.

10. From rule 38, we know that the person drinking juice is either on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking milk, the person drinking juice must be on the far right.

11. From rule 35, we know that the person drinking tea is to the right of the person drinking cola.

12. From rule 12, we know that the person drinking cola is not the fan of punk. Since the person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking milk, the fan of punk must be to the right of the person drinking milk.

13. From rule 31, we know that the person eating eggplant is to the left of the fan of reggae. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is to the right of the fan of reggae (rule 31), the person eating eggplant is to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.

14. From rule 33, we know that the person drinking sprite is in an odd position. Since the person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking milk, the person drinking sprite must be to the right of the person drinking milk.

15. From rule 34, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is either to the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person drinking milk, the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person drinking sprite.

16. From rule 1, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is not the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person drinking sprite, the person who's hobby is reading is to the right of the person drinking sprite.

17. From rule 5, we know that the person drinking tea is to the right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking milk, the person drinking tea is to the right of the person drinking milk.

18. From rule 6, we know that the person who's hobby is video-games is to the left of the person who's hobby is singing (the fan of soul). Since the person drinking tea is to the right of the person drinking milk, the person who's hobby is singing must be to the right of the person drinking tea.

19. From rule 7, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person who's hobby is reading is to the right of the person drinking sprite, the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person drinking sprite.

20. From rule 8, we know that the person eating tomato is in the middle. Since the person who's hobby is reading is to the right of the person drinking sprite, the person eating tomato is to the right of the person drinking sprite.

Now, let's fill in the table with the corresponding beverages, foods, hobbies, and music-genres:

Lv7-4x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the owner of the turtle. Let's place the hedgehog owner in position 3 (soy-milk on the left, turtle on the right).

2. The owner of the turtle is the person watching horror movies, so we place the turtle owner in position 6 (horror movies).

3. The person drinking soy-milk is not the person watching epic movies, so the epic movies can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's place epic movies in position 2.

4. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the owner of the snake. Since the snake owner can't be in position 6 (turtle), the snake owner must be in position 7. So, iced-tea is in position 4.

5. The person drinking coffee is the one watching epic movies, so we place coffee in position 2.

6. The person driving the van is somewhere to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the turtle (horror movies) is in position 6, the van can't be in position 7. So, the van is in position 5. This means juice is in position 7.

7. The person driving the bike is not the owner of the turtle, so the bike can't be in position 5 (van) or 6 (turtle). The bike can't be in position 1 (coffee) or 3 (hedgehog) because of rule 26. Let's place the bike in position 4 (iced-tea's right).

8. The person driving the motorbike is the owner of the hedgehog, so we place the motorbike in position 1 (left of hedgehog).

9. The person watching documentary movies is not the owner of the hedgehog, so documentary can't be in position 1 (hedgehog). Since documentary can't be in position 6 (turtle), it must be in position 2 (epic).

10. The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Since the boat isn't specified yet, we can't place the horror movies yet.

11. The person driving the van is the person drinking water, so we place water in position 5.

12. The person driving the ship is the owner of the turtle, so we place the ship in position 6.

13. The person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea is in position 4, the skateboard can't be in position 3 (hedgehog) or 5 (water). Let's place the skateboard in position 7 (right of iced-tea).

14. The person watching drama movies is the owner of the horse, so we place drama in position 3 (left of hedgehog).

15. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Since water is in position 5, the bike can't be in position 4 (iced-tea) or 6 (turtle). Let's place the bike in position 7 (right of water).

16. The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. Since the bike is in position 7, scientific movies can't be in position 6 (turtle) or 5 (water). Let's place scientific movies in position 2 (left of epic).

17. The person drinking tea is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret isn't specified yet, we can't place tea yet.

18. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies. Since epic is in position 2, the snake can't be in position 1 (hedgehog) or 3 (drama). Let's place the snake in position 4 (left of iced-tea).

19. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish isn't specified yet, we can't place disaster movies yet.

20. The person driving the train is the person drinking water, but we already placed water in position 5. This contradicts rule 20, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

21. The person driving the ship is the owner of the turtle, but we already placed the ship in position 6. This contradicts rule 22, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

22. The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Since we can't place horror movies yet due to rule 19, we can't place the boat yet.

23. The person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we can't place the skateboard yet due to rule 13, we can't place iced-tea yet.

24. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Since we can't place the bike yet due to rule 15, we can't place water yet.

25. The person drinking soy-milk is not the owner of the hedgehog. Since we can't place soy-milk yet due to rule 26, we can't place the hedgehog yet.

26. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person driving the van. Since we can't place juice yet due to rule 6, we can't place the van yet.

27. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since we can't place disaster movies yet due to rule 19, we can't place the goldfish yet.

28. The person drinking water is not the person driving the van. Since we can't place water yet due to rule 29, we can't place the van yet.

At this point, we have several variables (goldfish, disaster movies, boat, ferret, tea, bike, soy-milk, juice, van, skateboard, horse) that can't be placed due to the given rules. It seems there are inconsistencies in the puzzle, and it's impossible to solve it as it stands.

Since the person drinking sprite is in position 2, the person watching comedy movies cannot be in position 2. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 6, the person watching comedy movies cannot be in position 6. So, the person watching comedy movies is in position 5.

29. The person drinking soy-milk is not the person driving the train (already placed), so soy-milk cannot be in position 3. Since the person drinking lemonade is somewhere between the person watching sports movies and the person drinking cola, soy-milk cannot be in position 1 or 7. Let's say soy-milk is in position 5.

30. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching adventure movies cannot be in position 1 (because the person driving the ship is on the far left), let's say adventure movies are in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 2, the person watching adventure movies cannot be in position 2. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 5, the person watching adventure movies cannot be in position 5. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 6, the person watching adventure movies cannot be in position 6. So, the person watching adventure movies is in position 4.

31. The person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since 7up is in position 3, the person who's hobby is photography is in position 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since the person drinking water is on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies, the person who's hobby is photography cannot be in position 7. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 5, the person who's hobby is photography cannot be in position 5.

Lv7-4x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by assigning nationalities. Since the Colombian is on the far right (position 7), we can place them there. The remaining nationalities must be in the first six positions, and the Colombian must be in an odd position (not 1, 3, 5). So, the nationalities in positions 1, 2, 4, and 6 are British, Canadian, Indonesian, and Polish, respectively. The nationality in position 5 is Nigerian.

2. The Canadian is the person who's hobby is traveling, so they are in position 2.

3. The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis, so they are in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the Indonesian is not in position 1 (as it's already occupied by the British), the Indonesian must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

4. The Polish is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the Polish can't be in position 3, so they must be in position 2 or 1. However, the Polish can't be in position 1 because the Canadian is already there. So, the Polish is in position 2.

5. The Polish is on the left or right of the doctor. Since the Polish is in position 2, the doctor can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the doctor is in position 4, 5, or 6.

6. The electrician is not the person who's sport is climbing, so the electrician can't be in position 6 (as it's the only remaining position for climbing). So, the electrician is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. The electrician is on the left of the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the electrician can't be in position 5 or 6. So, the electrician is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. The indonesian is somewhere to the right of the project-manager. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the project-manager can't be in position 5 or 6. So, the project-manager is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

9. The librarian is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the librarian can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the librarian is in position 5 or 6.

10. The designer is in an odd position. Since the Colombian, Canadian, and Indonesian are already in even positions, the designer must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

11. The designer is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the designer can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the designer is in position 5.

12. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the doctor. Since the doctor is in position 4, the person who's sport is parkour can't be in position 1 or 6. So, the person who's sport is parkour is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

13. The person who's hobby is card-games is not the British or the Polish. Since the British is in position 1 and the Polish is in position 2, the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

14. The person who's hobby is card-games is not the electrician. Since the electrician is in position 1, the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 1. So, the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 but not 1.

15. The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere between the person who's hobby is card-games and the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the person who's sport is basketball can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

16. The electrician is on the left of the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the electrician is in position 1, 2, or 3.

17. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the electrician. Since the electrician is in position 1, 2, or 3, the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 1. So, the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 but not 1.

18. The person who's hobby is card-games is not the polish. Since the Polish is in position 2, the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 2. So, the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6 but not 1 or 2.

19. The person who's sport is rowing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, the person who's sport is rowing can be in position 1, 2, or before position 3.

20. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the right of the librarian. Since the librarian is in position 5 or 6, the person who's sport is badminton can be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

21. The designer is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the person who's sport is parkour is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5, the designer can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the designer is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6 but not 1 or 2.

22. The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the nigerian. Since the nigerian is in position 5, the person who's sport is soccer can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the person who's sport is soccer is in position 6.

23. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the person who's sport is parkour is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5, the person who's sport is basketball can be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

24. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person who's hobby is dancing can be in any position, the person who's hobby is puzzles can be in any position but not in the same position as the person who's hobby is dancing.

25. The colombian is on the far right. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the Colombian can't be in position 4, 5, or 6. So, the Colombian is in position 1, 2, 3, or 7. However, the Colombian is in an odd position, so they can't be in position 2 or 4. So, the Colombian is in position 1, 3, or 7.

26. The nigerian is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, the nigerian can be in position 1, 2, or before position 3.

27. The person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, the person who's hobby is sudoku can be in position 1, 2, or before position 3.

28. The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the right of the indonesian. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the person who's hobby is traveling can be in position 5 or 6. However, the person who's hobby is traveling is the Canadian, who is already in position 2. So, this statement is a contradiction.

29. The person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, the person who's hobby is sudoku can be in position 1 or 2. However, the person who's hobby is sudoku is not the software-developer, and the software-developer can't be in position 1 or 2 because the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3. So, this statement is a contradiction.

30. The person who's sport is climbing is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the person who's sport is rowing can be in position 1, 2, or before position 3, the person who's sport is climbing can be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

31. The doctor is on the left of the polish. Since the Polish is in position 2, the doctor can't be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the doctor is in position 1.

32. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person who's hobby is dancing can be in any position, the person who's hobby is puzzles can be in any position but not in the same position as the person who's hobby is dancing.

33. The person who's hobby is dancing can be in any position.

34. The colombian is on the far right. Since the Colombian is in position 7, this statement is true.

35. The canadian is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the person who's sport is badminton can be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, the Canadian can be in position 1, or before position 2. However, the Canadian is already in position 2. So, this statement is a contradiction.

36. The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the police-officer. Since the police-officer is the person who's hobby is traveling (who is the Canadian in position 2), the person who's hobby is puzzles can't be in position 2. So, the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 but not 2.

37. The designer is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is the Canadian in position 2, the designer can't be in position 2 or 3. So, the designer is in position 1, 4, 5, or 6 but not 2 or 3.

At this point, we have several contradictions, which means the puzzle has an error or is impossible to solve with the given information. However, if we ignore the contradictions and make assumptions to resolve them, we can make some educated guesses:

- The person who's hobby is traveling is the Canadian in position 2.
- The person who's hobby is card-games is the British in position 1.
- The person who's hobby is puzzles is the Polish in position 2.
- The person who's hobby is sudoku is the software-developer in position 6.
- The person who's sport is badminton is the librarian in position 5.
- The person who's sport is soccer is the nigerian in position 5.
- The person who's sport is basketball is the electrician in position 1.
- The person who's sport is parkour is the project-manager in position 3.
- The person who's sport is rowing is the colombian in position 7.
- The person who's sport is climbing is the doctor in position 4.

However, this solution is based on assumptions to resolve contradictions, and it's not guaranteed to be correct. The puzzle as presented seems to have inconsistencies."	{}	False	0	False
Lv7-4x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign a number to each nationality (1-7) and each food (1-7). We'll use the given information to place them in the table.

   - The Malaysian is the person eating peas (4), so Peas = 4.
   - The lacrosse player is on the far left (3), so we can place it in the first column. Since there are 7 sports, the other sports must be in the remaining columns. So, let's assign the sports as follows: Biathlon, Rugby, Cycling, Skiing, Water-polo, Climbing, and Skydiving from left to right in the remaining columns.
   - The Indian is somewhere to the left of the person eating orange (5), so the Indian cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Since the Malaysian is in position 4, the Indian must be in position 3. So, Indian = 3 and Orange = 5.
   - The Egyptian is somewhere to the left of the Indian (5), so the Egyptian must be in positions 1, 2, or 6. Since the Malaysian is in position 4 and the Indian is in position 3, the Egyptian cannot be in position 4. So, let's assign the nationalities as follows: Argentine (1), Egyptian (2), Thai (6), Australian (7), Turkish (5), Indian (3), and Indonesian (4).
   - The Turkish is in an odd position (4), so the Turkish cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Since the Egyptian is in position 2 and the Malaysian is in position 4, the Turkish must be in position 1. So, Turkish = 1.

Since the Turkish is in position 1, the Egyptian is in position 2, the Malaysian is in position 4, the Australian is in position 6, Puzzles is in position 7, and Skydiving is in position 3, Woodworking must be in position 5. So, Woodworking = 5.
   - The person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking (5), so Chess cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, 6, or 7. Since the Turkish is in position 1, the Egyptian is in position 2, the Malaysian is in position 4, the Australian is in position 6, Puzzles is in position 7, and Woodworking is in position 5, Chess must be in position 3.
