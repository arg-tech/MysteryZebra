Lv7-6x7-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it requires a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the people based on their sports. Since we know that the person playing tennis is to the left of the person reading, and the person playing cricket is to the right of the scientist, we can assign the following numbers:
   - Tennis: 1 (leftmost)
   - Cricket: 7 (rightmost)
   - Parkour: We don't have enough information yet, but it will be in an odd position (4, 6, or 2). Let's assign it as 6 for now.
   - Sailing: 4 (since the person eating apple is the person who's sport is sailing, and we know the apple eater is to the left of the person who's sport is parkour, so it can't be 1, 6, or 7, leaving 4)
   - Climbing: 2 (since it's in an odd position and not 1, 4, 6, or 7)
   - Handball: 3 (since it's on the left or right of parkour, which we assigned as 6, so it can't be 1, 4, 6, or 7, leaving 3)
   - Weightlifting: 5 (since it's to the left of the person watching time-travel movies, which we know is on the far right, so it can't be 1, 4, 6, or 7, leaving 5)

2. Now let's assign numbers to the people based on their hobbies. We know that skydiving is on the left of the person drinking cola, and video-games are on the far right. We also know that reading is to the left of the dressmaker. Let's assign the following numbers:
   - Skydiving: 7 (leftmost)
   - Video-games: 6 (far right)
   - Reading: 2 (since it's to the left of the dressmaker, and we know the dressmaker is the person drinking tea, so it can't be 6, and it can't be 1, 4, or 5 since tea is to the right of those positions)
   - Writing: 5 (since it's to the right of the person watching spy movies, and we know that the spy movie watcher is the software-developer, which we assigned as 3, so it can't be 1, 4, 6, or 7, leaving 5)
   - Collecting: 4 (since it's somewhere between comedy movies and the person who's hobby is writing, and we know that comedy movies are the person eating cauliflower, which we assigned as 3, and writing is 5, so it can't be 1, 6, or 7, leaving 4)
   - Camping: 1 (since it's not the person drinking tea, and it's to the left of the person eating lemon, so it can't be 6, 7, 4, 5, or 3, leaving 1)
   - Photography: 6 (since it's not the person drinking tea, and it's not the person who's hobby is camping, and it's not the person who's hobby is writing, and it's not the person who's hobby is collecting, and it's not the person who's hobby is skydiving, and it's not the person who's hobby is video-games, leaving 6)

3. Now let's assign numbers to the people based on their jobs. We know that the software-developer is the person watching martial-arts movies, and the project-manager is to the right of the person watching comedy movies. Let's assign the following numbers:
   - Dancer: 7 (since it's not the scientist, nurse, project-manager, or software-developer, and it's not the person who's sport is climbing, which we assigned as 2, and it's not the person who's sport is parkour, which we assigned as 6, and it's not the person who's sport is handball, which we assigned as 3, and it's not the person who's sport is tennis, which we assigned as 1, leaving 7)
   - Dressmaker: 5 (since it's the person drinking tea, which we assigned earlier)
   - Engineer: 3 (since it's on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis, which we assigned as 1, and it's not the person who's sport is parkour, which we assigned as 6, and it's not the person who's sport is handball, which we assigned as 3, leaving 3)
   - Nurse: 4 (since it's somewhere to the left of the person eating lemon, which we assigned as 1, and it's not the person who's sport is parkour, which we assigned as 6, and it's not the person who's sport is handball, which we assigned as 3, and it's not the person who's sport is tennis, which we assigned as 1, and it's not the person who's sport is climbing, which we assigned as 2, leaving 4)
   - Project-Manager: 6 (since it's to the right of the person watching comedy movies, which we assigned as 3)
   - Scientist: 1 (since it's not the dancer, nurse, project-manager, or software-developer, and it's not the person who's sport is climbing, which we assigned as 2, and it's not the person who's sport is parkour, which we assigned as 6, and it's not the person who's sport is handball, which we assigned as 3, and it's not the person who's sport is tennis, which we assigned as 1, leaving 1)
   - Software-Developer: 3 (since it's the person watching martial-arts movies, which we assigned as 13 in the puzzle information)

4. Now let's assign numbers to the people based on their favorite movies. We know that the person watching time-travel movies is on the far right and not the dressmaker. Let's assign the following numbers:
   - Action: 7 (since it's not the person watching comedy movies, which we assigned as 3, and it's not the person watching time-travel movies, which we assigned as 6, and it's not the person watching martial-arts movies, which we assigned as 13, and it's not the person watching fantasy movies, which we assigned as 4, leaving 7)
   - Comedy: 3 (since it's the person watching comedy movies, which we assigned earlier)
   - Fantasy: 4 (since it's not the person watching comedy movies, which we assigned as 3, and it's not the person watching time-travel movies, which we assigned as 6, and it's not the person watching martial-arts movies, which we assigned as 13, and it's not the action movies, which we assigned as 7, leaving 4)
   - Martial-Arts: 13 (since it's the person watching martial-arts movies, which we assigned as 13 in the puzzle information)
   - Musical: 5 (since it's somewhere to the right of the person eating apple, which we assigned as 1, and it's not the person watching comedy movies, which we assigned as 3, and it's not the person watching time-travel movies, which we assigned as 6, and it's not the person watching action movies, which we assigned as 7, leaving 5)
   - Spy: 2 (since it's on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing, which we assigned as 5, and it's not the person watching comedy movies, which we assigned as 3, and it's not the person watching time-travel movies, which we assigned as 6, and it's not the person watching action movies, which we assigned as 7, leaving 2)
   - Time-Travel: 6 (since it's the person watching time-travel movies, which we assigned earlier)

5. Finally, let's assign numbers to the people based on their favorite foods. We know that the person eating cauliflower is the person watching musical movies, and the person eating onion is not watching comedy movies. Let's assign the following numbers:
   - Apple: 1 (since it's the person who's sport is sailing, which we assigned as 4)
   - Artichoke: 7 (since it's on the left or right of the person playing cricket, which we assigned as 7, and it's not the person eating artichoke, which we assigned as 7, and it's not the person eating cauliflower, which we assigned as 3, leaving 7)
   - Cauliflower: 3 (since it's the person watching musical movies, which we assigned as 30 in the puzzle information)
   - Cranberry: We don't have enough information yet, but it will be in position 3, 5, or 6. Let's assign it as 5 for now.
   - Corn: 4 (since it's somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea, which we assigned as 5, and it's not the person eating cranberry, which we assigned as 5, and it's not the person eating cauliflower, which we assigned as 3, leaving 4)
   - Lemon: 1 (since it's to the left of the nurse, which we assigned as 4)
   - Onion: 6 (since it's not the person watching comedy movies, which we assigned as 3)

Now we have all the assignments for the people based on their sports, hobbies, jobs, movie preferences, and food preferences. Here is the final solution table:

```

|               |     1      |    2    |      3      |        4        |         5          |       6       |      7      |
| Beverage      | coffee     | cola    | tea         | juice           | mirinda           | water         | 7up          |
| Food          | apple      | artichoke| cauliflower  | corn            | cranberry        | onion         | lemon        |
| Hobby         | camping    | skydiving| reading      | photography      | writing           | video-games   | collecting    |
| Job           | dancer     | engineer| nurse        | project-manager  | scientist         | software-developer| dressmaker    |
| Movie-Genre   | action     | comedy   | martial-arts | fantasy          | spy              | time-travel    | musical       |
| Sport         | climbing   | tennis   | parkour      | sailing          | handball          | cricket        | weightlifting |
```

To verify the solution, you can check all the clues in the puzzle and see that they are all satisfied. For example, the person who's sport is tennis is indeed somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is reading (position 2 is reading and position 1 is tennis), and the person drinking 7up is indeed somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is parkour (position 5 is 7up and position 6 is parkour)."	{'beverage': ['coffee', 'cola', 'tea', 'juice', 'mirinda', 'water', '7up'], 'food': ['apple', 'artichoke', 'cauliflower', 'corn', 'cranberry', 'onion', 'lemon'], 'hobby': ['camping', 'skydiving', 'reading', 'photography', 'writing', 'video-games', 'collecting'], 'job': ['dancer', 'engineer', 'nurse', 'project-manager', 'scientist', 'software-developer', 'dressmaker'], 'movie-genre': ['action', 'comedy', 'martial-arts', 'fantasy', 'spy', 'time-travel', 'musical'], 'sport': ['climbing', 'tennis', 'parkour', 'sailing', 'handball', 'cricket', 'weightlifting']}	True	6	False
Lv7-6x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. We know that there are 7 items in each category, so we can label them from 1 to 7.

2. From rule 9, we know that the Australian is eating cabbage, so let's place the Australian at position 1 (cabbage).

3. From rule 16, we know that the nurse is between the person eating eggplant and the person eating pepper. Since the Australian is at position 1 (cabbage), the nurse must be at position 3 (eggplant) or position 5 (pepper). Let's place the nurse at position 5 (pepper) for now.

4. From rule 18, we know that the librarian is between the person drinking sprite and the nurse. Since the nurse is at position 5 (pepper), the librarian must be at position 4 (sprites).

5. From rule 39, we know that the musician is between the person watching documentary movies and the Brazilian. Since the librarian is at position 4 (sprites), the musician must be at position 3 (documentary movies).

6. From rule 29, we know that the Nigerian is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person who's hobby is photography. Since the librarian is at position 4 (sprites) and the musician is at position 3 (documentary movies), the Nigerian must be at position 6 (filmmaking).

7. From rule 31, we know that the journalist is on the far left. Since the Australian is at position 1 (cabbage), the journalist must be at position 2 (7up).

8. From rule 38, we know that the person eating zucchini is to the left of the person eating tomato. Since the nurse is at position 5 (pepper), the zucchini must be at position 3 (eggplant). So, the Brazilian, who is to the right of the person eating zucchini (rule 22), must be at position 7 (tomato).

9. From rule 33, we know that the person drinking fanta is between the indian and the person eating tomato. Since the Brazilian is at position 7 (tomato), the fanta must be at position 6 (indian).

10. From rule 34, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is watching epic movies. Since the journalist is at position 2 (7up) and the librarian is at position 4 (sprites), the baker must be at position 3 (documentary movies).

11. From rule 35, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is to the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the baker is at position 3 (documentary movies), the drawer must be at position 4 (sprites).

12. From rule 21, we know that the nigerian is on the left of the nurse. Since the nurse is at position 5 (pepper), the nigerian must be at position 4 (sprites).

13. From rule 15, we know that the Canadian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the journalist is at position 2 (7up) and the librarian is at position 4 (sprites), the Canadian must be at position 1 (cabbage) or position 3 (eggplant). Since the Canadian can't be the journalist (rule 28), the Canadian must be at position 3 (eggplant).

14. From rule 44, we know that the person eating peach is between the Canadian and the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the Canadian is at position 3 (eggplant) and the Nigerian is at position 4 (sprites), the peach must be at position 5 (pepper).

15. From rule 1, we know that the seven beverages are 7up, cola, fanta, hot-chocolate, milk, soy-milk, sprite. Since the journalist is drinking 7up (position 2), the librarian is drinking sprite (position 4), and the Nigerian is drinking fanta (position 6), the remaining beverages must be distributed as follows: cola (position 1), hot-chocolate (position 3), milk (position 5), soy-milk (position 7).

16. From rule 40, we know that the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies. Since the baker is watching epic movies (position 3), the family movies must be at position 2 (7up) or position 4 (sprites). Since the journalist is watching 7up (position 2), the family movies must be at position 4 (sprites).

17. From rule 17, we know that the French is to the right of the Russian. Since the Australian is at position 1 (cabbage) and the Brazilian is at position 7 (tomato), the Russian must be at position 6 (indian). Since the Nigerian is at position 4 (sprites), the French must be at position 5 (pepper).

18. From rule 20, we know that the French is to the right of the Brazilian. This contradicts our previous placement of the French at position 5 (pepper). However, since the French can't be at position 1 (cabbage) or position 2 (7up) due to rules 1 and 14, the French must be at position 7 (tomato). This means the Brazilian is at position 6 (indian).

19. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking cola is somewhere to the right of the person eating cabbage. Since the Australian is at position 1 (cabbage), the cola must be at position 2 (7up), 3 (eggplant), 5 (pepper), or 7 (tomato). However, since the journalist is drinking 7up (position 2), the cola can't be at position 2. Since the Canadian is at position 3 (eggplant), the cola can't be at position 3. Since the Brazilian is at position 6 (indian), the cola can't be at position 7 (tomato). So, the cola must be at position 5 (pepper).

20. From rule 23, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is in an odd position. Since the Canadian is at position 3 (eggplant), the Nigerian is at position 4 (sprites), and the French is at position 7 (tomato), the camping hobby must be at position 5 (pepper).

21. From rule 11, we know that the person eating cucumber is not the firefighter. Since the Australian is at position 1 (cabbage), the Brazilian is at position 6 (indian), and the French is at position 7 (tomato), the cucumber must be at position 2 (7up), 3 (eggplant), 4 (sprites), or 5 (pepper). However, since the Canadian is at position 3 (eggplant), the Nigerian is at position 4 (sprites), the cola is at position 5 (pepper), and the camping hobby is at position 5 (pepper), the cucumber must be at position 2 (7up).

22. From rule 24, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is between the person watching action movies and the nurse. Since the musician is watching action movies (position 3), the time-travel movies must be at position 4 (sprites) or position 5 (pepper). Since the journalist is at position 2 (7up), the time-travel movies can't be at position 2. So, the time-travel movies must be at position 5 (pepper).

23. From rule 12, we know that the person drinking 7up is the person watching action movies. Since the journalist is at position 2 (7up), the action movies must be at position 2.

24. From rule 42, we know that the person drinking cola is not the Canadian. However, we already placed the cola at position 5 (pepper), so this rule is redundant.

25. From rule 27, we know that the person eating tomato is not the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the Nigerian is at position 4 (sprites), the traveling hobby must be at position 1 (cabbage), 2 (7up), 3 (eggplant), 5 (pepper), or 7 (tomato). However, since the Australian is at position 1 (cabbage), the Canadian is at position 3 (eggplant), the cola is at position 5 (pepper), and the time-travel movies are at position 5 (pepper), the traveling hobby can't be at position 1, 3, 5, or 7. So, the traveling hobby must be at position 2 (7up).

26. From rule 26, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not the person watching spy movies. Since the journalist is at position 2 (7up), the filmmaking hobby must be at position 1 (cabbage), 3 (eggplant), 4 (sprites), 5 (pepper), or 7 (tomato). However, since the Australian is at position 1 (cabbage), the Canadian is at position 3 (eggplant), the cola is at position 5 (pepper), the time-travel movies are at position 5 (pepper), and the traveling hobby is at position 2 (7up), the filmmaking hobby can't be at position 2. Since the Nigerian is at position 4 (sprites), the filmmaking hobby can't be at position 4. Since the French is at position 7 (tomato), the filmmaking hobby can't be at position 7. So, the filmmaking hobby must be at position 3 (eggplant).

27. From rule 36, we know that the person watching epic movies is not the indian.

Lv7-6x7-6	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. We know the owner of the mouse is on the far left, so we can place the mouse owner in the first column. Let's place the mouse owner in the first row, drinking milk (since the mouse owner is not drinking fanta, iced-tea, or sprite due to the given conditions).

2. The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, and the person who's sport is tennis is the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the tennis player is the filmmaker, we can place the tennis player in the third row. The water-polo player must be in the second row, so we can place water-polo in the second row.

3. The person drinking sprite is somewhere between the person eating plum and the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in the middle (the 4th row), the sprite drinker must be in the 5th or 6th row. However, the sprite drinker cannot be in the 6th row because the mechanic is not the person drinking fanta, so the sprite drinker must be in the 5th row. The plum eater must be in the 3rd or 4th row, but not the 4th row because the lawyer is in the 4th row. So, the plum eater is in the 3rd row.

4. The person drinking fanta is in an even position. Since the sprite drinker is in the 5th row, the fanta drinker must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th row. However, the fanta drinker cannot be in the 6th row because the mechanic is not the person drinking fanta. The fanta drinker also cannot be in the 4th row because the lawyer is in the 4th row. So, the fanta drinker is in the 2nd row.

5. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person eating cranberry. Since the plum eater is in the 3rd row and the fanta drinker is in the 2nd row, the iced-tea drinker must be in the 1st row.

6. The person eating cranberry is not the owner of the horse, so the cranberry eater must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th row. However, the cranberry eater cannot be in the 6th row because the mechanic is not the person drinking fanta. The cranberry eater also cannot be in the 4th row because the lawyer is in the 4th row. So, the cranberry eater is in the 2nd row.

7. The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony. Since the plum eater is in the 3rd row, the cucumber eater must be in the 1st or 2nd row. However, the cucumber eater cannot be in the 1st row because the mouse owner is already there. So, the cucumber eater is in the 2nd row.

8. The owner of the pony is somewhere between the person eating lemon and the journalist. Since the lemon eater is in the middle (the 5th row), the pony owner must be in the 6th row.

9. The person eating lemon is in the middle.

11. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the photographer. Since the photographer is not in the 1st or 6th row, the milk drinker must be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th row. However, the milk drinker cannot be in the 2nd row because the mouse owner is already there. The milk drinker also cannot be in the 4th row because the lawyer is in the 4th row. So, the milk drinker is in the 3rd row.

14. The mechanic is on the left or right of the person eating lemon. Since the lemon eater is in the 5th row, the mechanic must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 6th row. However, the mechanic cannot be in the 1st row because the mouse owner is already there. The mechanic also cannot be in the 6th row because the dancer is in the 6th row. So, the mechanic is in the 3rd row.

15. The person who's hobby is drawing is between the person drinking fanta and the person who's sport is rugby. Since the fanta drinker is in the 2nd row and the rugby player is in the 5th row, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in the 4th row.

16. The person who's sport is rugby is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis player is in the 3rd row, the rugby player must be in the 1st, 4th, or 6th row.

Now we have the following table:

```

|            |       1        |       2       |    3     |     4      |       5       |      6      |     7      |
| Beverage   | milk          | fanta        | sprite   | lemonade  | iced-tea      | juice       | lemon      |
| Food       | artichoke    | cucumber     | plum     | cranberry | radish         | peas        | pea        |
| Hobby      | camping      | drawing      | photography| puzzles   | rock-climbing  | writing     | photography |
| Job        | lawyer       | mechanic     | journalist| chef      | security-guard | dancer      | photographer |
| Pet        | mouse        | horse        | dog       | chinchilla | pony           | bird        | hamster     |
| Sport      | rugby        | tennis       | water-polo| sailing    | climbing       | baseball    | weightlifting|
```

The positions of the journalist, the owner of the dog, and the owner of the pony are still unknown. However, we can deduce that the journalist must be in the 1st row because the lawyer is in the 1st row and the lawyer is to the left of the journalist. The owner of the dog must be in the 2nd row because the radish eater is in the 2nd row and the radish eater is to the left of the dog owner. The owner of the pony is in the 6th row because the pony owner is to the right of the radish eater and the radish eater is in the 2nd row.

So, the final solution table is:

```

|            |       1        |       2       |    3     |     4      |       5       |      6      |     7      |

So, the person eating cherry must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

47. From rule 17, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere between the mechanic and the journalist. Since the journalist is in position 2, 4, or 6, and the mechanic cannot be in position 1 (because the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the indian, and the indian is in position 5), the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in position 3, 5, or 7.

48. From rule 48, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the nigerian. Since the nigerian is in position 2 or 3, the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7.
