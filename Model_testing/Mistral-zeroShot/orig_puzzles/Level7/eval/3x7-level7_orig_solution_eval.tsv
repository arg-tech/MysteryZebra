Lv7-3x7-1	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the rat is the person who's hobby is traveling, so let's place the rat owner in the 7th position (Traveling).

2. The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish (not position 7), so let's place the bird owner in position 6 (Photography, since the pilot is the photographer).

3. The owner of the bird is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish (not position 7), so let's place the goldfish owner in position 5 (Fish).

4. The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the firefighter (not position 6), so the firefighter must be in position 4 or higher.

5. The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the videographer (not position 6), so the videographer must be in position 8 or higher.

6. The accountant is the person who's hobby is woodworking, so let's place the accountant in position 3 (Woodworking).

7. The software-developer is the person who's hobby is sudoku, so let's place the software-developer in position 2 (Sudoku).

8. The owner of the snake is between the owner of the pony and the person who's hobby is baking (not position 7), so the pony owner must be in position 9 and the snake owner in position 8 (Snake).

9. The owner of the goldfish is in an even position (not 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), so it must be in position 2 (Goldfish).

10. The pilot is not the owner of the snake (not position 8), so the pilot must be in position 1 (Photography).

11. The owner of the snake is on the right of the coach (not position 3), so the coach must be in position 4 (Coach).

12. The architect is on the right of the owner of the snake (not position 8), so the architect must be in position 5 (Architect).

13. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (not position 2), so the hamster owner must be in position 6 (Hamster).

14. The person who's hobby is photography is the pilot (position 1), so the hobby in position 6 must be something else (let's say Camping for now).

15. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is camping (not position 6), so the fish owner must be in position 4 (Fish).

16. The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the videographer (position 8), so the videographer must be in position 9 (Videographer).

17. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (position 2), so the hobby in position 5 must be something else (let's say Singing for now).

18. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the pilot (position 1), so the hobby in position 2 must be something else (let's say Traveling for now).

19. The coach is not the owner of the goldfish (not position 2), so the hobby in position 3 must be something else (let's say Baking for now).

20. The person who's hobby is photography is the pilot (position 1), so the hobby in position 6 must be Camping.

21. The person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the right of the pilot (position 1), so the hobby in position 2 must be Traveling.

22. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the pilot (position 1), so the hobby in position 7 must be something else (let's say Woodworking for now).

23. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is camping (position 6), so the hobby in position 5 must be Singing.

24. The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the videographer (position 9), so the hobby in position 8 must be something else (let's say Camping for now).

25. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (position 2), so the hobby in position 4 must be something else (let's say Traveling for now).

26. The software-developer is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony (position 9), so the hobby in position 1 must be something else (let's say Photography for now).

Now we have a contradiction: the hobby in position 8 was previously Camping, but now it's also Camping. This means our initial assumption that the hobby in position 6 is Camping was incorrect. Let's try another hobby for position 6, such as Sudoku.

27. With Sudoku in position 6, the hobby in position 8 can be Camping. The hobby in position 1 can be Photography, the hobby in position 3 can be Woodworking, the hobby in position 4 can be Traveling, the hobby in position 5 can be Singing, the hobby in position 7 can be Rat (Traveling), and the hobby in position 9 can be Pony.

So the final solution table is:

Lv7-3x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 people, each with a unique hobby, music-genre, and nationality. Let's assign numbers to the nationalities (1-7) and write them in the Nationality column.

   Nationality: 1-Spanish, 2-Argentine, 3-Brazilian, 4-Colombian, 5-Indonesian, 6-Canadian, 7-Russian

2. From rule 19, we know that the Spanish is the person who's hobby is photography, so we can fill in the Hobby column for the Spanish: 4-Photography.

3. From rule 18, we know that the Brazilian is to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the Spanish is the person who's hobby is photography, and we know the Spanish is the 4th person, the Brazilian must be the 5th person. So, we can fill in the Hobby column for the Brazilian: 3-Dancing.

4. From rule 3, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is the Brazilian, so we can fill in the Hobby column for the Brazilian again: 5-Writing. However, this contradicts our previous conclusion that the Brazilian is the 5th person with hobby 3-Dancing. To resolve this, we can swap the hobbies of the 4th and 5th persons: 4-Writing and 5-Dancing.

5. From rule 17, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is the fan of jazz. Since the Spanish is the person who's hobby is photography, and we know the Spanish is the 4th person, the person who's hobby is camping must be the 1st person. So, we can fill in the Hobby column for the 1st person: 1-Camping.

6. From rule 22, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person who's hobby is camping is the 1st person, the person who's hobby is dancing must be the 2nd or 3rd person. However, the Brazilian is the 4th person with hobby 5-Writing, so the person who's hobby is dancing cannot be the 3rd person. Therefore, the person who's hobby is dancing is the 2nd person. So, we can fill in the Hobby column for the 2nd person: 2-Dancing.

7. From rule 2, we know that the Spanish is somewhere between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the Russian. Since the person who's hobby is camping is the 1st person, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be the 3rd person. So, we can fill in the Hobby column for the 3rd person: 3-Rock-climbing. This means the Russian must be the 6th person.

8. From rule 16, we know that the Indonesian is between the fan of funk and the person who's hobby is writing. Since the Brazilian is the 4th person with hobby 5-Writing, the Indonesian must be between the 2nd and 4th persons. However, the person who's hobby is camping is the 1st person, and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the 3rd person. The only possible position for the Indonesian is the 2nd person. So, we can fill in the Hobby column for the 2nd person again: 2-Collecting.

9. From rule 14, we know that the fan of funk is in an even position. Since the person who's hobby is camping is the 1st person, the fan of funk must be the 2nd, 4th, or 6th person. However, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the 3rd person, and the Indonesian is the 2nd person with hobby 2-Collecting. The only possible nationality for the fan of funk is the 4th person. So, we can fill in the Music-Genre column for the 4th person: 4-Funk.

10. From rule 11, we know that the colombian is not the fan of disco. Since the person who's hobby is camping is the 1st person, the fan of disco must be the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 6th person. However, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the 3rd person, and the Indonesian is the 2nd person with hobby 2-Collecting. The only possible nationality for the fan of disco is the 5th or 6th person.

11. From rule 12, we know that the colombian is not the fan of techno. Since the person who's hobby is camping is the 1st person, the fan of techno must be the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 7th person. However, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the 3rd person, the Indonesian is the 2nd person with hobby 2-Collecting, and the fan of funk is the 4th person. The only possible nationality for the fan of techno is the 7th person.

12. From rule 23, we know that the fan of disco is on the left of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of techno is the 7th person, the fan of r&b must be the 6th person. So, we can fill in the Music-Genre column for the 6th person: 6-R&B.

13. From rule 10, we know that the fan of disco is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the Indonesian is the 2nd person with hobby 2-Collecting, the fan of disco must be the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 7th person. However, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the 3rd person, the fan of funk is the 4th person, and the fan of r&b is the 6th person. The only possible nationality for the fan of disco is the 5th person. So, we can fill in the Music-Genre column for the 5th person: 5-Disco.

14. From rule 6, we know that the fan of techno is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk. Since the fan of funk is the 4th person, the fan of techno must be the 5th, 6th, or 7th person. However, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the 3rd person, the Indonesian is the 2nd person with hobby 2-Collecting, the fan of disco is the 5th person, and the fan of r&b is the 6th person. The only possible nationality for the fan of techno is the 7th person. So, we can fill in the Music-Genre column for the 7th person: 7-Techno.

15. From rule 13, we know that the Spanish is on the left or right of the colombian. Since the colombian is the 4th person, the Spanish must be the 3rd or 5th person. However, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the 3rd person, the Indonesian is the 2nd person with hobby 2-Collecting, and the fan of funk is the 4th person. The only possible nationality for the Spanish is the 5th person. So, we can fill in the Nationality column for the 5th person: 5-Spanish.

16. From rule 15, we know that the Indonesian is in the middle. Since the Indonesian is the 2nd person, the person who's hobby is collecting must be the 1st person, and the person who's hobby is writing must be the 3rd person. So, we can fill in the Hobby column for the 1st and 3rd persons: 1-Collecting and 3-Writing.

17. From rule 1, we know that the people have 7 different hobbies. Since we have filled in the Hobby column for 6 persons, the remaining hobby must be for the 7th person: 7-Rock-climbing.

18. From rule 24, we know that the argentine is in an odd position. Since the Indonesian is the 2nd person, the argentine must be the 1st, 3rd, 5th, or 7th person. However, the person who's hobby is camping is the 1st person, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the 7th person, and the person who's hobby is writing is the 3rd person. The only possible nationality for the argentine is the 5th person. So, we can fill in the Nationality column for the 5th person again: 2-Argentine.

19. From rule 8, we know that the punk is the indonesian. However, we have already filled in the Nationality column for the Indonesian as 5-Spanish. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

The final solution table should look like this, with the error highlighted:

  |               |       1       |      2      |     3     |     4      |     5     |    6     |    7    |
| Hobby         | Collecting   | Dancing     | Rock-climbing| Photography| Writing   | Funk    | Techno  |
| Music-Genre   |               |             |           |            |           |          |         |
| Nationality   |               |             |           |            | Argentine| Spanish | Indonesian|

However, there seems to be an error in the puzzle as the nationality of the punk is inconsistent."	{'hobby': ['collecting', 'dancing', 'rock-climbing', 'photography', 'writing', 'funk', 'techno'], 'music-genre': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'nationality': ['', '', '', '', 'argentine', 'spanish', 'indonesian']}	True	1	False
Lv7-3x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. From rule 11, we know that the person eating kiwi is in position 5.
2. From rule 2, the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person eating kiwi, so iced-tea is in position 4.
3. From rule 5, the owner of the horse is to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the cat is not the person drinking iced-tea (rule 6), the horse must be in position 3.
4. From rule 15, the owner of the lizard is to the left of the person eating banana. Since the banana is not the person drinking lemonade (rule 25), the lizard is in position 6.
5. From rule 18, the person drinking soy-milk is to the right of the person eating lime. Since the lime is on the far left (rule 21), soy-milk must be in position 7.
6. From rule 19, the person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is the owner of the bird (rule 17), and the bird is in position 1 (from rule 16), kiwi must be in position 2 or 6. However, since the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person eating kiwi (rule 2), kiwi cannot be in position 6. So, kiwi is in position 2.
7. From rule 22, the owner of the hedgehog is in an even position. Since the horse is in position 3 and the lizard is in position 6, the hedgehog can only be in position 4 or 2 (since position 0 is not possible). But position 2 is already occupied by kiwi, so the hedgehog is in position 4.
8. From rule 28, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the hedgehog is in position 4, iced-tea can be in position 3 or 5. But since the person drinking fanta is not the owner of the horse (rule 8), and the horse is in position 3, iced-tea cannot be in position 3. So, iced-tea is in position 5.
9. From rule 3, the person eating spinach is not the person drinking sprite. Since sprite is not the person drinking water (rule 17), and the person drinking water is the person eating spinach (rule 17), spinach must be in position 1.
10. From rule 10, the person eating spinach is somewhere between the owner of the bird and the owner of the hedgehog. Since the bird is the person drinking water (rule 17) and the hedgehog is in position 4, spinach must be in position 3.
11. From rule 4, the person drinking water is on the left or right of the person eating spinach. Since spinach is in position 3, water can be in position 2 or 4. But since the person eating banana is on the right of the person eating kiwi (rule 20), and kiwi is in position 2, water cannot be in position 2. So, water is in position 4.
12. From rule 12, the owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Since the lime is on the far left (rule 21), the only possible position for blueberry is 7. So, the turtle is in position 1.
13. From rule 13, the person eating spinach is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since water is in position 4, spinach can be in position 2 or 6. But since the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person eating kiwi (rule 2), and kiwi is in position 2, spinach cannot be in position 2. So, spinach is in position 6.
14. From rule 14, the person eating banana is on the right of the person eating kiwi. Since kiwi is in position 2, banana is in position 3.
15. From rule 16, the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person drinking water. Since water is in position 4, kiwi is in position 5.
16. From rule 18, the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person eating lime. Since the lime is on the far left (rule 21), soy-milk is in position 7.
17. From rule 9, the person drinking water is somewhere between the person eating banana and the owner of the rabbit. Since banana is in position 3 and the rabbit is not the person drinking lemonade (rule 25), the only possible position for the rabbit is 6.
18. From rule 24, the person eating tomato is on the far right. Since the rabbit is in position 6, tomato is in position 7.

Final solution table:

Lv7-3x7-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the movie genres, sports, and pets to the columns and rows. Since there are 7 of each, we can simply number them from 1 to 7.

   |               |     1      |       2       |   3    |    4    |     5      |    6    |   7    |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |               |        |         |            |         |        |
   | Pet           |            |               |        |         |            |         |        |
   | Sport         |            |               |        |         |            |         |        |

2. Now, let's use the clues to fill in the table. I'll use 'X' to represent an unknown value and '?' to represent a possible value that could be any of the options.

   |               |     1      |       2       |   3    |    4    |     5      |    6    |   7    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action    | Crime        | Mystery| Romance | Spy      | Western  | Zombie  |
   | Pet           | Hamster   | ?            | ?      | ?       | ?         | ?       | Turtle  |
   | Sport         | Cycling   | ?            | ?      | ?       | ?         | ?       | ?       |

3. Let's start with the pet clues:
   - The owner of the hamster is not the person watching romance movies##6: This means the hamster can't be in column 6 (Romance).
   - The owner of the hamster is the person watching action movies: This means the hamster is in the same row as Action. Let's mark it as Hamster in row 2.
   - The owner of the snake is the person who's sport is soccer: Since we know the hamster is in row 2, the snake can't be in row 2. Let's assume the snake is in row 1 (Soccer).
   - The owner of the guinea-pig is not the person watching western movies##6: This means the guinea-pig can't be in column 6 (Western).
   - The owner of the hedgehog is in an odd position##4: Since we have 3 filled positions now (Hamster, Snake, and Soccer), the hedgehog must be in an odd position, which means it's either in row 1 or 3.
   - The owner of the mouse can't be in row 1 (since the snake is there), so it must be in row 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7.
   - The owner of the turtle is somewhere between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the owner of the fish##7: Since we know the snake is in row 1 and the hamster is in row 2, the turtle must be in row 3, 4, 5, or 6.

4. Now let's work on the sport clues:

   - The person who's sport is sailing is not the person watching zombie movies##6: This means the sailing person can't be in column 7 (Zombie).
   - The person who's sport is surfing is the owner of the hamster: Since we know the hamster is in row 2, the surfing person must be in row 2 as well.
   - The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person watching western movies##3: Since we know the snake is in row 1 and the hamster is in row 2, the ice-hockey person must be in row 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - The person who's sport is soccer is on the far left or far right##3: Since we know the snake is in row 1, the soccer person can't be in row 1. So, it must be in row 7.

5. Now let's work on the movie genre clues:
   - The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person watching zombie movies: Since we know the hamster is in row 2 (Action), the mystery person must be in row 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. The zombie person must be in row 1, 2, 4, or 5. Let's assume the zombie person is in row 4. Then, the mystery person must be in row 5 or 7.
   - The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hamster##5: Since we know the hamster is in row 2, the crime person must be in row 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
   - The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish: Since we know the hamster is in row 2, the spy person must be in row 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies##5: Since we know the hamster is in row 2 (Action), the crime person can't be in row 2. So, it must be in row 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
   - The person watching spy movies is the person who's sport is skiing: Since we know the skiing person is in row 1, the spy person must be in row 1 as well.

   - The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig##5: Since we know the hamster is in row 2, the guinea-pig can't be in row 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, it must be in row 5, 6, or 7.
   - The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies##5: Since we know the hamster is in row 2 (Action), the crime person can't be in row 2. So, it must be in row 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

Lv7-3x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 7 people, so we can number them from 1 to 7.

2. Let's assign the beverages to the people:
   - Person 1: coffee (not assigned yet)
   - Person 2: 7up (not assigned yet)
   - Person 3: cola
   - Person 4: iced-tea (not assigned yet)
   - Person 5: lemonade (not assigned yet)
   - Person 6: milk (not assigned yet)
   - Person 7: tea

3. Let's assign the music-genres to the people:
   - Person 1: dubstep (not assigned yet)
   - Person 2: pop (not assigned yet)
   - Person 3: punk (not assigned yet)
   - Person 4: r&b (not assigned yet)
   - Person 5: rock (not assigned yet)

   - Person 7: techno

4. Let's assign the nationalities to the people:
   - Person 1: colombian (not assigned yet)
   - Person 2: dutch (not assigned yet)
   - Person 3: mexican
   - Person 4: egyptian (not assigned yet)
   - Person 5: japanese (not assigned yet)
   - Person 6: thai
   - Person 7: polish (not assigned yet)

5. Let's start solving the clues:

   - Clue 6: The fan of techno is on the far right. So, Person 7 is the fan of techno.
   - Clue 10: The person drinking iced-tea is on the far right. Since Person 4 is already assigned to iced-tea, it must be in position 4.
   - Clue 14: The person drinking tea is the fan of pop. Since Person 7 is the fan of techno and Person 4 is the fan of iced-tea, Person 1 must be the person drinking tea and the fan of pop.
   - Clue 16: The fan of punk is on the left of the person drinking cola. Since Person 3 is the person drinking cola, the fan of punk must be in position 2 or 1. But since the colombian is in an even position (Clue 24), the fan of punk cannot be the colombian, so it must be in position 2.
   - Clue 20: The mexican is the fan of pop. Since Person 3 is the mexican and Person 1 is the fan of pop, Person 3 must be in position 7 and Person 1 in position 2.
   - Clue 11: The colombian is on the right of the mexican. So, the colombian must be in position 6.
   - Clue 18: The person drinking milk is not the colombian. So, the person drinking milk cannot be in position 6.

   - Clue 19: The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since the colombian is the person drinking coffee (in position 6), the person drinking lemonade cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 5 or 7. But since the person drinking 7up is already in position 5, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 7.
   - Clue 12: The egyptian is not the person drinking lemonade. So, the egyptian cannot be in position 7.
   - Clue 13: The person drinking lemonade is somewhere between the dutch and the fan of r&b. Since the dutch is not in position 7 (Clue 12), the person drinking lemonade must be to the right of the dutch. The only position left for the dutch is position 2. So, the dutch must be in position 2.
   - Clue 25: The japanese is on the left or right of the dutch. Since the dutch is in position 2, the japanese can be in position 1 or 3. But since the japanese is in an odd position (Clue 15), the japanese must be in position 3.
   - Clue 23: The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 5 and the person drinking cola is not the colombian (Clue 18), the person drinking cola must be in position 3.
   - Clue 26: The fan of punk is somewhere to the right of the fan of pop. Since the fan of pop is in position 2 and the fan of punk is in position 1, the fan of r&b must be in position 4.
   - Clue 21: The fan of punk is on the right of the fan of r&b. So, the fan of r&b must be in position 4.
   - Clue 22: The egyptian is on the right of the fan of punk. Since the fan of punk is in position 1, the egyptian must be in position 5.
   - Clue 5: The thai is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep. Since the fan of dubstep is in position 1 and the thai is not the person drinking lemonade (Clue 12), the thai must be in position 6.
   - Clue 3: The dutch is on the left or right of the thai. Since the dutch is in position 2 and the thai is in position 6, the dutch must be in position 3.
   - Clue 1: The person drinking lemonade is not the fan of techno. Since the fan of techno is in position 7, the person drinking lemonade cannot be in position 7. So, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 5.
   - Clue 4: The thai is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep. Since the fan of dubstep is in position 1 and the thai is in position 6, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2.
   - Clue 9: The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the fan of punk. Since the fan of punk is in position 1 and the person drinking tea is the fan of pop (in position 1), the person drinking coffee must be in position 6.
   - Clue 8: The japanese is in an odd position. Since the japanese is in position 3, the person drinking milk must be in position 4.
   - Clue 2: The fan of dubstep is somewhere between the colombian and the thai. Since the colombian is in position 6 and the thai is in position 6, the fan of dubstep must be in position 5.

Lv7-3x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the sports, nationalities, and beverages are in different columns, so we can focus on each column separately.

2. Let's start with the sports. From rule 22, we know that baseball is in the middle, so it's in position 4. Since the brazilian is in an odd position (rule 8), they can't be the baseball player. So, the brazilian is either 1, 3, 5, or 7.

3. From rule 18, the climber is to the right of the brazilian, so the climber can't be 1, 3, or 5. Therefore, the climber is 7 and the brazilian is 5.

4. From rule 17, the parkour athlete is the german, so the german is 3.

5. From rule 19, the polish is to the right of the german, so the polish is 6.

6. From rule 14, the canadian is to the right of the nigerian, so the nigerian is 1 or 2. Since the brazilian is 5, the nigerian can't be 1, so the nigerian is 2.

7. From rule 15, the person drinking fanta is to the left of the person drinking cola. Since the cola drinker is between the german (3) and the person drinking sprite (6, as we'll see later), the fanta drinker is either 1 or 2. But the fanta drinker can't be the brazilian (5) or the nigerian (2), so the fanta drinker is 1.

8. From rule 13, the sprite drinker is not the lacrosse player. Since the lacrosse player is to the left of the cola drinker (5), the sprite drinker is either 3, 5, or 7. But the sprite drinker can't be the german (3) or the polish (6), so the sprite drinker is 7.

9. From rule 16, the spanish is the soy-milk drinker. Since the spanish is to the right of the cola drinker (5), the soy-milk drinker is either 6 or 7. But the soy-milk drinker can't be the polish (6), so the soy-milk drinker is 7.

10. From rule 4, the skateboarder is the spanish, so the spanish is in position 7.

11. From rule 11, the german is the hot-chocolate drinker.

12. From rule 12, the lacrosse player is to the left of the cola drinker (5). Since the cola drinker is between the german (3) and the person drinking sprite (7), the lacrosse player is either 1 or 2. But the lacrosse player can't be the brazilian (5) or the nigerian (2), so the lacrosse player is 1.

13. From rule 2, the rower is not the brazilian (5). Since the brazilian is 5, the rower can't be 3, 7, or any even position. So, the rower is 1, 4, or 6. But the rower can't be the brazilian (5), the german (3), the polish (6), the fanta drinker (1), the cola drinker (5), the sprite drinker (7), or the soy-milk drinker (7), so the rower is 4.

14. From rule 10, the cola drinker is to the right of the nigerian (2). Since the nigerian is 2, the cola drinker can't be 1 or 3. So, the cola drinker is 5.

15. From rule 7, the person drinking almond-milk is to the left of the skateboarder (7). Since the skateboarder is the spanish (7), the almond-milk drinker is either 1, 2, or 3. But the almond-milk drinker can't be the brazilian (5), the nigerian (2), the fanta drinker (1), the german (3), the polish (6), the cola drinker (5), the sprite drinker (7), or the soy-milk drinker (7), so the almond-milk drinker is 3.

16. From rule 1, the person doing parkour (german) is in an even position (4). But we already placed the parkour athlete (german) in position 3. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Final solution table (with the error):

|               |    1     |      2      |       3       |    4     |     5     |     6     |       7       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| fanta      | hot-chocolate | milk     | cola     | soy-milk   | sprite       |
| Nationality   |          |            |               |          |           |           |               |
| Sport         |          |            |               |          |           |           |               |

The error is in rule 17, which states that the parkour athlete is the german, but the german is already placed in position 3. The correct placement for the parkour athlete should be in position 4, and the german should be in position 3 (hot-chocolate). The rest of the table remains the same."	{'beverage': ['almond-milk', 'fanta', 'hot-chocolate', 'milk', 'cola', 'soy-milk', 'sprite'], 'nationality': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'sport': ['', '', '', '', '', '', '']}	True	1	False
Lv7-3x7-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the food, jobs, and transport to the columns from 1 to 7.

1. Since the person eating apricot is the person driving the car, we can place apricot in column 1 and car in column 1 as well.

2. The architect is somewhere to the right of the person eating peas, so peas cannot be in column 1. Let's place peas in column 2 or higher.

3. The photographer is somewhere to the left of the teacher, so teacher cannot be in column 7. Let's place teacher in column 6 or lower.

4. The teacher is on the far left or far right, so teacher cannot be in columns 2-5. Let's place teacher in column 1 or 7.

5. The person eating peas is not the musician, so peas cannot be in column 6 (since the musician is in the middle). Let's place peas in column 2, 3, or 4.

6. The person eating papaya is somewhere between the teacher and the person eating artichoke. Since the teacher is in column 1 or 7, and artichoke is not in column 1 (as it would conflict with the car), let's place artichoke in column 2 or 3. If artichoke is in column 2, then papaya must be in column 4. If artichoke is in column 3, then papaya can be in column 2, 4, or 5.

7. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person eating pepper. Since pepper cannot be in column 1 (as it would conflict with the car), let's place pepper in column 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If pepper is in column 2, then motorbike must be in column 3. If pepper is in column 3, then motorbike can be in column 2, 4, 5, or 6. If pepper is in column 4, then motorbike can be in column 3, 5, or 6. If pepper is in column 5, then motorbike can be in column 4, 6, or 7. If pepper is in column 6, then motorbike can be in column 5 or 7.

8. The social-worker is the person driving the scooter. Since the social-worker is to the left of the person eating pepper, and pepper is not in column 1, let's place pepper in column 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If pepper is in column 2, then scooter must be in column 3. If pepper is in column 3, then scooter can be in column 2, 4, 5, or 6. If pepper is in column 4, then scooter can be in column 3, 5, or 6. If pepper is in column 5, then scooter can be in column 4, 6, or 7. If pepper is in column 6, then scooter can be in column 5 or 7.

9. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since motorbike is not in column 1, let's place motorbike in column 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If motorbike is in column 2, then roller must be in column 1. If motorbike is in column 3, then roller can be in column 1 or 2. If motorbike is in column 4, then roller can be in column 1, 2, 3, or 5. If motorbike is in column 5, then roller can be in column 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. If motorbike is in column 6, then roller can be in column 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7.

10. The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi. Since kiwi cannot be in column 1 (as it would conflict with the car), let's place kiwi in column 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If kiwi is in column 2, then trike can be in column 1 or 3. If kiwi is in column 3, then trike can be in column 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7. If kiwi is in column 4, then trike can be in column 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7. If kiwi is in column 5, then trike can be in column 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. If kiwi is in column 6, then trike can be in column 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

11. The freelancer is in the middle. Since there are 7 positions, the freelancer must be in column 4.

12. The person eating lettuce is the teacher (from rule 20). Since the teacher is in column 1 or 7, and lettuce cannot be in column 7 (as it would conflict with the teacher), let's place lettuce in column 1.

13. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the person eating papaya. Since papaya is in column 2, 4, or 5, let's place helicopter in column 1, 2, or 3.

14. The photographer is on the left or right of the person eating artichoke. Since artichoke is in column 2 or 3, let's place photographer in column 1, 2, or 3 as well.

15. The person driving the tram is not the person eating artichoke. Since artichoke is in column 2 or 3, let's place tram in column 4, 5, 6, or 7.

16. The person eating artichoke is not the person driving the scooter. Since artichoke is in column 2 or 3, and scooter is in column 3, let's place artichoke in column 2.

17. The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the analyst. Since analyst cannot be in column 1 (as it would conflict with the car), let's place analyst in column 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If analyst is in column 2, then papaya must be in column 1. If analyst is in column 3, then papaya can be in column 1, 4, 5, or 6. If analyst is in column 4, then papaya can be in column 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6. If analyst is in column 5, then papaya can be in column 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7. If analyst is in column 6, then papaya can be in column 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

18. The person driving the trike is between the freelancer and the person driving the scooter. Since the freelancer is in column 4 and the scooter is in column 3, let's place trike in column 3, 4, or 5.

19. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person eating papaya. Since papaya is in column 1, let's place roller in column 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

20. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwi. Since kiwi is in column 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, let's place trike in column 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Now we have enough information to place the remaining items:
- The person driving the helicopter can be in column 1, 2, or 3. Since the photographer is in column 1, let's place helicopter in column 2 or 3.
- The photographer is on the left or right of the person eating artichoke, and the photographer is in column 1, 2, or 3. Since artichoke is in column 2, let's place photographer in column 1.
- The person driving the tram can be in column 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since the person eating artichoke is not the person driving the tram, let's place tram in column 5, 6, or 7.

At this point, we have placed all items except for the jobs of columns 5 and 6. However, we know that the freelancer is in the middle (column 4), so the jobs in columns 5 and 6 must be architect, musician, social-worker, or teacher. Since the architect is to the right of the person eating peas, and the teacher is the person eating lettuce, let's place the architect in column 5 and the teacher in column 6.

The final solution table is:

| Food        |    1     |       2       |      3       |     4      |     5     |    6    |     7     |

Lv7-3x7-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people watching the movies. We know that the person watching thriller movies is drinking milk, so we can place them in position 1 (since there are 7 positions and only one person watches thriller movies). Let's place them in the first row, first column.

5. The person drinking 7up is in an odd position. The only odd positions left are 1, 3, and 5. Since the satire watcher and the thriller watcher are already in positions 1 and 5, the 7up drinker must be in position 3. Let's place them there.

   | Beverage      | 1   | 7up   |      2      |    3    | satire   |     6     |    7     |

8. The person drinking cola is not the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we already placed the cola drinker, the filmmaker must be in a different position. Let's continue.

9. The person watching martial-arts movies is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking water. Since we haven't placed the soy-milk drinker or the water drinker yet, we can't place the martial-arts watcher yet. Let's continue.

10. The person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk. Since we already placed the milk drinker and the hobby, the writer must be in a position to the left of position 1. The only position to the left of position 1 is position 7. Let's place the writer in position 7.

11. The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we already placed the filmmaker in position 6, the puzzler must be in a position to the right of position 6. The only positions to the right of position 6 are positions 7 and 2. However, we already placed the writer in position 7, so the puzzler must be in position 2. Let's place the puzzler in position 2.

13. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we already placed the filmmaker in position 6, the cook must be in a position 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7. However, we already placed the reader, the writer, the puzzler, and the baker, so the cook must be in position 4. Let's place the cook in position 4.

14. The person who's hobby is cooking is not the person drinking cola. Since we already placed the cook, the cola drinker must be in a position other than 4. The only positions left are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. However, we already placed the reader, the writer, the puzzler, the baker, the filmmaker, and the martial-arts watcher, so the cola drinker must be in position 5. Let's place the cola drinker in position 5.

16. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since we already placed the martial-arts watcher, the adventure watcher must be in a position to the right of the martial-arts watcher. The only positions to the right of the martial-arts watcher are positions 6 and 7. However, we already placed the western watcher in position 6, so the adventure watcher must be in position 7. Let's place the adventure watcher in position 7.

17. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person watching western movies. Since we already placed the filmmaker in position 6, the western watcher must be in position 6. However, we already placed the western watcher in position 6. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

The final solution table should be:

   | Beverage      | read | 7up   | almond  | puzzles | satire   | write   | cook    | cola    | water   | martial-arts |
   | Hobby         | bak |       |         |         |          |        |         |         |         |            |

However, there seems to be an error in the puzzle as the person who's hobby is filmmaking is supposed to be the person watching western movies, but we can't place them both in position 6 without a contradiction."	{}	False	0	False
Lv7-3x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right. The far left is position 1, and the far right is position 7.

2. From rule 19, the fan of gospel is on the far left (position 1), and the fan of writing is also on the far left (position 1, according to rule 20). So, position 1 is occupied by the fan of gospel.

3. From rule 21, the fan of dubstep is the person eating lemon. Since we know the fan of gospel is on the far left, the lemon eater must be to the right of the gospel fan, so the lemon eater is in position 2.

4. From rule 22, the fan of ambient is somewhere between the fan of gospel and the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1) and the lemon eater (position 2), the fan of ambient must be in position 3.

5. From rule 5, the fan of ambient is not the person eating lemon, so the fan of ambient is in position 3, and the lemon eater is in position 2.

6. From rule 24, the person who's hobby is woodworking is not the person eating spinach. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1), the lemon eater (position 2), and the fan of ambient (position 3), the person eating spinach must be in position 4.

7. From rule 11, the fan of reggae is the person eating apricot. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1), the lemon eater (position 2), the fan of ambient (position 3), and the person eating spinach (position 4), the person eating apricot must be in position 5.

8. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person eating apricot. So, the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 6.

9. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1), the lemon eater (position 2), the fan of ambient (position 3), the person eating spinach (position 4), the person eating apricot (position 5), and the person who's hobby is collecting (position 6), the person who's hobby is card-games must be in position 7. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks can be in either position 6 or 7, but since the fan of techno is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (rule 15), the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 6 to make sure the fan of techno is in position 7.

10. From rule 18, the person eating cauliflower is in an odd position. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1), the lemon eater (position 2), the fan of ambient (position 3), the person eating spinach (position 4), the person eating apricot (position 5), the person who's hobby is collecting (position 6), the person who's hobby is card-games (position 7), and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (position 6), the person eating cauliflower must be in position 5.

11. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the fan of reggae. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1), the lemon eater (position 2), the fan of ambient (position 3), the person eating spinach (position 4), the person eating apricot (position 5), the person who's hobby is collecting (position 6), the person who's hobby is card-games (position 7), and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (position 6), the fan of reggae must be in position 5.

12. From rule 13, the fan of metal is in an even position. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1), the lemon eater (position 2), the fan of ambient (position 3), the person eating spinach (position 4), the person eating apricot (position 5), the person who's hobby is collecting (position 6), the person who's hobby is card-games (position 7), the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (position 6), and the person eating cauliflower (position 5), the fan of metal must be in position 4.

13. From rule 8, the fan of metal is somewhere to the left of the person eating lemon. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1), the lemon eater (position 2), the fan of ambient (position 3), the person eating spinach (position 4), the person eating apricot (position 5), the person who's hobby is collecting (position 6), the person who's hobby is card-games (position 7), the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (position 6), the person eating cauliflower (position 5), and the fan of metal (position 4), the fan of metal is to the left of the lemon eater.

14. From rule 23, the person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1), the lemon eater (position 2), the fan of ambient (position 3), the person eating spinach (position 4), the person eating apricot (position 5), the person who's hobby is collecting (position 6), the person who's hobby is card-games (position 7), the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (position 6), the fan of metal (position 4), and the person eating cauliflower (position 5), the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 3.

15. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right. Since we know the positions of the fan of gospel (position 1), the lemon eater (position 2), the fan of ambient (position 3), the person eating spinach (position 4), the person eating apricot (position 5), the person who's hobby is collecting (position 6), the person who's hobby is card-games (position 7), the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (position 6), the fan of metal (position 4), the person eating cauliflower (position 5), and the person who's hobby is traveling (position 7), the table is complete.

Here is the final solution table:

```

For the Music-Genre, since we don't have enough information, we can't fill it in. However, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is also a fan of reggae (rule 11), so we can infer that the Music-Genre for position 1 (gospel) is not reggae. Similarly, the Music-Genre for position 2 (lemon) is dubstep (rule 21), and the Music-Genre for position 3 (ambient) is not metal (rule 5) or dubstep (rule 21). The Music-Genre for position 4 (spinach) is also not reggae (since the person eating spinach is to the left of the fan of reggae, who is the person eating apricot). The Music-Genre for position 5 (apricot) is reggae. The Music-Genre for position 6 (collecting) is not reggae (since the person who's hobby is collecting is to the right of the fan of reggae, who is the person eating apricot). The Music-Genre for position 7 (traveling) is not reggae (since the person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right, and we know the person eating apricot is a fan of reggae). So, the Music-Genre for position 7 (traveling) could be any genre except reggae."	{'food': ['gospel', 'lemon', 'ambient', 'spinach', 'apricot', 'collecting', 'traveling'], 'hobby': ['camping', 'card-games', 'magic-tricks', 'woodworking', 'writing', 'traveling', 'writing'], 'music-genre': ['', '', '', '', '', '', '']}	True	0	False
Lv7-3x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobby of board-games is in the middle (position 4). Let's assign hobbies to the first four positions:
   - Position 1: camping (odd position)
   - Position 2: fishing (between horse and board-games)
   - Position 3: traveling (left or right of rat owner)
   - Position 4: board-games

2. The person drinking 7up is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5). Since it's to the left of the person drinking water (position 6), it can't be in position 5. So, it's in position 1.

3. The person drinking milk is the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard owner is the person who's hobby is fishing (from point 19), the person drinking milk must be in position 2 (since fishing is in position 2).

4. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking water (position 6). So, water must be in position 7.

5. The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing (position 2). So, fanta must be in position 3, 5, or 7. Since it's not in position 7 (already assigned to water), it must be in position 3 or 5. But it can't be in position 5 because the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking fanta (point 22). So, fanta is in position 3.

6. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog (position 1, 2, or 3). Since mirinda can't be in position 3 (already assigned to fanta), it must be in position 1 or 2. But it can't be in position 1 because the person drinking 7up is in position 1. So, mirinda is in position 2.

7. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the owner of the rat (position 5, 6, or 7). Since it's not in position 7 (already assigned to water), it must be in position 5 or 6. But it can't be in position 6 because the person drinking water is in position 6. So, traveling is in position 5.

8. The person drinking tea is somewhere between the owner of the pony and the person who's hobby is filmmaking (position 4, 5, or 6). Since it's not in position 4 (already assigned to board-games), it must be in position 5 or 6. But it can't be in position 6 because the person drinking water is in position 6. So, tea is in position 5.

9. The person who's hobby is baking is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the owner of the pony (position 2, 3, or 4). Since baking can't be in position 4 (already assigned to board-games), it must be in position 2 or 3. But it can't be in position 3 because fanta is already assigned there. So, baking is in position 2.

10. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving (position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6). Since it's not in position 1 (already assigned to camping), it can't be in position 2 (already assigned to baking). It can't be in position 3 (already assigned to fanta). It can't be in position 4 (already assigned to board-games). So, the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 6, and the rat owner is in position 7.

11. The owner of the horse is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard (position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7). Since it's not in position 2 (already assigned to lizard), it can't be in position 3 (already assigned to fanta). It can't be in position 4 (already assigned to board-games). It can't be in position 5 (already assigned to tea). So, the horse owner is in position 7, and the lizard owner (who's hobby is fishing) is in position 2.

12. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 6. The owner of the rat is in position 7. So, the person who's hobby is skydiving is not the owner of the rat (point 21 is satisfied).

13. The person drinking 7up is in position 1. The person drinking water is in position 6. So, the person drinking fanta is in position 3.

14. The person who's hobby is traveling is in position 5. The person who's hobby is fishing is in position 2. So, the person drinking mirinda is in position 1.

15. The person drinking tea is in position 5. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person drinking water (point 7). So, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6.

16. The person who's hobby is camping is in position 1. The person who's hobby is board-games is in position 4. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 6. The person who's hobby is traveling is in position 5. The person who's hobby is fishing is in position 2. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6. The person who's hobby is baking is in position 2. The owner of the horse is in position 7. The owner of the lizard (who's hobby is fishing) is in position 2. The person drinking 7up is in position 1. The person drinking fanta is in position 3. The person drinking mirinda is in position 1. The person drinking tea is in position 5. The person drinking water is in position 6. The owner of the rat is in position 7. The owner of the pony is in position 7. The owner of the dog is not specified.

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage   | 7up | fanta | mirinda | tea | water |  |
|-----------|-----|-------|---------|-----|-------|---|
| Hobby      | camping | board-games | fishing | traveling | filmmaking | skydiving |
