Lv7-1x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the quad-bike is in the middle, so we can fill the third column with 'quad-bike'.

|             |  1   |  2   |     3     |  4   |    5    |
|------------|------|------|-----------|------|---------|
| Transport  |     |     | quad-bike |      |         |

2. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the taxi. Since the quad-bike is in the middle, the ship and taxi must be on the left side. Let's place the ship in the first column and the taxi in the second column.

|             |  1   |  2   |     3     |  4   |    5    |
|------------|------|------|-----------|------|---------|
| Transport  | ship| taxi | quad-bike |      |         |

3. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. Since the bike is already placed, the jet-ski must be on the right side.

|             |  1   |  2   |     3     |  4   |    5    |
|------------|------|------|-----------|------|---------|
| Transport  | ship| taxi | quad-bike | jet-ski|         |

4. The person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the ship and the person driving the quad-bike##7. Since the taxi is already placed, this condition is already satisfied.

5. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship##5. Since the bike is already placed, it is already to the right of the ship.

Now we have the final solution:

|             |  1   |  2   |     3     |  4   |    5    |
|------------|------|------|-----------|------|---------|

Lv7-1x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the tennis player is on the left of the weightlifting player (1). Since the positions are even and odd (4), the weightlifting player must be in an odd position. So, the tennis player must be in position 1 or 2 (even positions are taken by other sports). Let's assume the tennis player is in position 1.

2. Now, the weightlifting player must be in an odd position, so they can only be in position 3.

3. The cycling player is on the left or right of the rugby player (3). Since the rugby player is in an even position (4), the cycling player can't be in position 1 or 3 (as they would be on the left of the rugby player). So, the cycling player must be in position 2 or 4. But since the tennis player is in position 1, the cycling player can't be in position 2 (as it would violate rule 1). So, the cycling player must be in position 4.

4. The rugby player is in an even position (4), so they must be in position 2.

5. The rugby player is somewhere between the tennis player and the golf player (7). Since the tennis player is in position 1 and the rugby player is in position 2, the golf player must be in position 5.

6. The weightlifting player is somewhere between the rugby player and the tennis player (7). Since the rugby player is in position 2 and the tennis player is in position 1, the weightlifting player must be in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-1x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the boat is the same person (point 2), so we can fill that in: Boat (1)

2. The person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski (point 1). Since the boat is already filled, we know the jet-ski is to the left of the boat, so Jet-ski (4)

3. The person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the car and the person driving the train (point 3). Since the jet-ski is on the far left (point 4), the taxi cannot be on the far right, so it must be either 2, 3, or 5. Let's try placing it in position 3 for now: Taxi (3)

4. The person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the taxi (point 5). Since the taxi is in position 3, the car must be in position 5: Car (5)

5. Now we are left with position 2. The only remaining transport is the train. Since the taxi is in position 3 and the car is in position 5, the train must be in position 2: Train (2)

So, the final solution table is:

  |             |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |  5  |

1. From point 3, we know the paramedic is on the left of the dressmaker. From point 1, the dressmaker is somewhere between the paramedic and the manager. So, the possible positions for the paramedic, dressmaker, and manager are:

2. From point 4, the bartender is somewhere to the right of the paramedic. So, the bartender can only be in position 4 or 5. But from point 2, the manager is to the left of the bartender, so the bartender can't be in position 5. Therefore, the bartender is in position 4.

   |       |     1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5    |

3. From point 1, the dressmaker is somewhere between the paramedic and the manager. Since the paramedic is in position 1 and the bartender is in position 4, the dressmaker must be in position 2.

2. From point 2, we know that the person who loves reading is to the right of the person who loves card-games. So, the person who loves skydiving must be in position 1, and the person who loves card-games must be in position 2.
3. From point 4, we know that the person who loves skydiving is to the right of the person who loves magic-tricks. Since we already placed skydiving in position 1, magic-tricks must be in position 5.
4. From point 5, we know that the person who loves filmmaking is to the left of the person who loves magic-tricks. So, filmmaking must be in position 4.
5. Now we know the positions of four hobbies, and from point 1, we know that the person who loves card-games is between the person who loves reading and the person who loves filmmaking. Since we already placed card-games in position 2, reading must be in position 3.

Lv7-1x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching sports movies is on the far left, so it must be in the first column (Column 1).

2. Since the person watching horror movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching documentary movies, and the sports person is on the far left, the horror person must be in either Column 2 or Column 3. However, since the horror person is also to the right of the documentary person (who is not yet placed), the horror person cannot be in Column 1. So, the horror person must be in Column 2.

3. Now, the documentary person must be to the right of the horror person (in Column 3).

4. The spy person is somewhere to the right of the documentary person, so the spy person must be in either Column 4 or Column 5. But since the documentary person is already in Column 3, the spy person must be in Column 4.

5. Finally, the romance person is somewhere to the left of the horror person (in Column 1 or Column 2), but not next to the sports person (Column 1) due to the horror person being in Column 2. So, the romance person must be in Column 2.

1. We know that the positions are odd for sports and even for the rest (4, 2, 3, 1, 5).

2. Since the person watching sports movies is in an odd position (4), it can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, it must be in position 4.

3. Now we know that sports is in position 4, so we can mark it as S.

4. The person watching romance movies is to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (5), so Romance can't be in position 1 or 2. It also can't be in position 5 because the person watching comedy is between Romance and Family (7), and we know that Comedy is not in position 1. So, Romance can only be in position 3.

6. The person watching comedy movies is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching family movies (7). Since we know that Romance is in position 3 and Sports is in position 4, Comedy can't be in position 1 or 5. So, Comedy can only be in position 2.

2. From rule 4, we know that mirinda is to the left of almond-milk. Since almond-milk is between mirinda and sprite (from the first step), almond-milk must be to the left of sprite.

3. Now we know that almond-milk is to the left of sprite, and sprite is somewhere between mirinda and iced-tea (rule 1). So, almond-milk is to the left of mirinda and iced-tea.

4. From rule 2, we know that soy-milk is between mirinda and sprite. Since almond-milk is to the left of both mirinda and sprite, soy-milk must be to the right of almond-milk.

5. From rule 1, we know that sprite is somewhere between mirinda and iced-tea. Since almond-milk is to the left of both mirinda and iced-tea, sprite must be to the right of almond-milk.

6. Now we have the order: almond-milk, mirinda, sprite, iced-tea, soy-milk.
