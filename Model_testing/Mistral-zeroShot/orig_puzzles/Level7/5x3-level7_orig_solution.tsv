Lv7-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the onion eater is on the far left or far right, they cannot be in the middle (position 2). So, they must be in either position 1 or 3.

2. The cabbage eater is to the left or right of the manager. Since the project-manager is on the far left (position 1), the cabbage eater cannot be in position 1. So, the cabbage eater must be in position 3.

3. The dancing hobby is to the left of the fan of folk. Since the fan of folk is the American (position 1), the dancing hobby must be in position 1 or 2.

4. The Chinese is in the middle (position 2).

5. The fishing hobby is to the left of the fan of folk. Since the fan of folk is the American (position 1), the fishing hobby must be in position 2 or 3.

6. The cabbage eater is between the fan of dubstep and the American. Since the fan of folk (American) is in position 1 and the cabbage eater is in position 3, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2.

7. The project-manager is on the far left (position 1).

8. The journalist is to the left or right of the manager. Since the project-manager is in position 1, the journalist can be in position 2 or 3.

9. The person eating onion is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the fishing hobby is in position 2, the onion eater must be in position 1.

10. Now we have the following arrangement:

|               |        1        |     2      |      3      |
| Food          | onion          | fishing    | cabbage     |
| Hobby         | dancing        | fishing    | board-games  |
| Job           | project-manager | journalist | manager     |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep        | electronic | folk        |
| Nationality   | american       | chinese    | thai        |

The onion eater is the American (journalist), the cabbage eater is the Thai, and the fishing hobby is Chinese. The rest of the table fills in accordingly.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching horror movies is either to the left or right of the person drinking tea. Let's assume the person watching horror movies is on the left of the person drinking tea (H|T). This leaves us with two possibilities for the person drinking tea: 1 or 3.

2. The American is to the right of the person drinking juice (A>J). This means that the person drinking juice can only be in position 1. So, the nationalities are: 2-American, 3-Japanese, and 1-Mexican.

3. The owner of the mouse is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking tea (M>J, M<T). Since the person drinking juice is 1, the person drinking tea must be 3. So, the pets are: 1-Dog, 2-Ferret, 3-Mouse.

4. The analyst is between the person drinking juice and the engineer (A<E). Since the person drinking juice is 1, the analyst must be 2 and the engineer 3.

5. The person watching thriller movies is the person drinking tea (T-Thriller). This is consistent with our previous assumptions.

6. The librarian is to the left of the Japanese (L<J). Since the Japanese is 3, the librarian must be 2.

7. The owner of the dog is to the right of the person drinking mirinda (D>M). Since the person drinking mirinda is 2, the owner of the dog must be 1 or 3. But the analyst is already at position 2, so the owner of the dog must be 3.

8. The analyst is on the left or right of the owner of the dog (A>D or A<D). Since the analyst is 2 and the dog owner is 3, this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage      |     Juice   |  Mirinda |    Tea   |
| Job           |     Librarian| Analyst  | Engineer |
| Movie-Genre   |             |          | Thriller |
| Nationality   |     Mexican |  American | Japanese |
| Pet           |     Dog     |  Ferret   |   Mouse  |

This solution satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv7-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 6 variables (Beverage, Hobby, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport) with 3 options each. So, there are 3! (3 factorial) = 6 possible arrangements for each variable.

2. Let's assign the variables to the rows and the options to the columns. For simplicity, let's assign the variables to the rows as follows:
   - Row 1: Beverage
   - Row 2: Hobby
   - Row 3: Music-Genre
   - Row 4: Pet
   - Row 5: Sport

3. Now let's assign the options to the columns:
   - Column 1: 7up, Baking, Disco, Ferret, Basketball
   - Column 2: Lemonade, Puzzles, Metal, Lizard, Handball
   - Column 3: Tea, Skydiving, Soul, Turtle, Skiing

4. Let's start solving the clues:

   - From clue 1, the person who's sport is handball is the fan of soul. So, Handball must be in the same row as Soul (Row 5). Let's mark this by putting an 'H' in the intersection of Row 5 and Column 3 (Soul).

   - From clue 2, the person who's hobby is skydiving is in an even position##4. Since there are 6 positions, an even position is either 2, 4, or 6. However, since the hobby is in Row 2, it can't be position 4 or 6. So, the hobby of skydiving is in position 2. Let's mark this by putting an 'S' in the intersection of Row 2 and Column 2 (Puzzles).

   - From clue 3, the person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since we know the position of Handball (Skiing), Basketball must be to its right. But Basketball can't be in position 6 (since it's an even position and we already have an even position occupied by Skydiving). So, Basketball must be in position 5. Let's mark this by putting a 'B' in the intersection of Row 5 and Column 1 (7up).

   - From clue 4, the owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of disco. Since we know the position of Soul (Handball fan), Disco must be to its left. But Disco can't be in position 1 (since it's occupied by 7up). So, Disco must be in position 2. Let's mark this by putting a 'D' in the intersection of Row 3 and Column 2 (Puzzles).

   - From clue 5, the person drinking tea is on the right of the owner of the turtle. Since we know the position of Disco (Turtle owner), Tea must be to its right. But Tea can't be in position 6 (since it's an even position and we already have an even position occupied by Skydiving). So, Tea must be in position 3. Let's mark this by putting a 'T' in the intersection of Row 1 and Column 3 (Tea).

   - From clue 6, the person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we know the position of Basketball (Skiing), Puzzles must be to its right. But Puzzles can't be in position 1 (since it's occupied by Baking). So, Puzzles must be in position 2. Let's mark this by putting a 'P' in the intersection of Row 2 and Column 2 (Puzzles).

   - From clue 7, the person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the fan of soul##3. Since we know the position of Handball (Skiing), Soul must be either in position 1 or 3. But Soul can't be in position 1 (since it's occupied by Disco). So, Soul must be in position 3. Let's mark this by putting a 'S' in the intersection of Row 5 and Column 3 (Soul).

   - From clue 8, the owner of the turtle is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the owner of the lizard##7. Since we know the positions of 7up (Tea drinker), Turtle (Disco fan), and Lizard (unknown), the Turtle must be between 7up and Lizard. But the Turtle is in position 2, so Lizard must be in position 1. Let's mark this by putting an 'L' in the intersection of Row 4 and Column 1 (Lemonade).

5. Now we have the final solution table:

   ```
   Beverage   |    7up     |   Lemonade  |    Tea     |
   Hobby      |     Baking  |   Puzzles   |   Skydiving |

   Sport      |     Basketball| Handball   |   Skiing   |
   ```

   We have solved the puzzle! The final solution table is:

Lv7-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating pear is to the left of the person eating raspberry, we can place pear in the first column and raspberry in the second column.

2. The person eating raspberry is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. So, the sport of the person in the first column can't be rugby. Let's place skateboarding in the third column and soccer in the fourth column (since soccer can't be in the first column due to the previous condition). This leaves rugby for the second row.

3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking milk. So, hot-chocolate goes in the third column and milk in the second column. This leaves iced-tea for the first column.

4. The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate is in the third column, lizard can't be in the first two columns. So, lizard goes in the third row.

5. The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway. Since the subway is in the fourth column (due to it being an odd position), the bus can't be in the fourth column either. So, bus goes in the first row, and subway goes in the second row.

6. The person driving the van is the person eating raspberry. Since raspberry is in the second column, van goes in the second row.

7. The owner of the horse is on the far left. Since the only empty spot on the far left is the first row, horse goes in the first row.

8. The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person driving the subway. Since skateboarding is in the third column and subway is in the second row, soccer must be in the fourth row.

Final solution table:

| Food        | Apple   | Pear          | Raspberry |
| Pet         | Horse   | Lizard       |  |

Lv7-5x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 nationalities, the Spanish must be on the rightmost side because the French is the engineer (1).
2. The Mexican is the owner of the mouse (6), so the mouse must be in the last column.
3. The Mexican is to the left of the person watching horror movies (2), so the horror genre must be in the first or second column. Since the Spanish is on the rightmost side, the horror genre cannot be in the last column. So, the horror genre is in the first column.
4. The person watching action movies is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the person drinking fanta (3). Since the frog is in the last column (from point 2), the action genre cannot be in the last column either. So, the action genre is in the second column.
5. The person drinking fanta is to the right of the Mexican (5), so fanta is in the third column.
6. The person drinking mirinda is the mechanic (4), so mirinda is in the first row.
7. The person drinking sprite is to the left of the engineer (1), so sprite is in the second row.
8. The person watching action movies is to the right of the person drinking mirinda (7), so the action genre is in the second row.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |
| Beverage      | mirinda   | sprite  | fanta    |
| Job           | mechanic  | engineer|         |
| Movie-Genre   | horror    | action  |         |
| Nationality   | mexican   | french  | spanish  |
| Pet           |          |         | mouse    |

The pet for the Spanish is not specified, but since all other pets are taken, the Spanish must not have a pet.

However, there is a small inconsistency in the puzzle as it stands: the person watching action movies is supposed to be between the owner of the frog and the person drinking fanta, but the frog is the pet of the Mexican, who is watching horror movies. To resolve this, we could assume that the person watching action movies is actually the Spanish, who is not specified to have a pet. This would mean that the Spanish is a writer (since the writer is the only job left), and the action genre is not actually being watched by anyone. Here is the final solution table with this assumption:

#############
|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |
| Beverage      | mirinda   | sprite  | fanta    |
| Job           | mechanic  | engineer| writer   |
| Movie-Genre   | horror    | action  |         |
| Nationality   | mexican   | french  | spanish  |
| Pet           |          |         | mouse    |
#############

This solution assumes that the person watching action movies is the Spanish, which is not explicitly stated in the puzzle. If this assumption is not acceptable, then the puzzle has an inconsistency and cannot be solved with the given information."
Lv7-5x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 columns.

| Transport     |          |               |             |

2. From point 1, we know that the person eating onion is on the far right, so we can place onion in the rightmost column (column 3).

|               |    1     |       2       |      3      |

| Transport     |          |               |             |

3. From point 2, we know that the person eating apricot is not the person driving the jet-ski, so apricot cannot be in the same column as jet-ski. Since we already placed onion in the rightmost column, apricot must be in either column 1 or 2.

4. From point 4, the person drinking juice is on the right of the person eating apricot. Since apricot is in either column 1 or 2, juice must be in column 3.

|               |    1     |       2       |      3      |

5. From point 5, the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere between the person who's hobby is drawing and the person drinking juice. Since we already placed juice in column 3, soy-milk must be in either column 1 or 2.

6. From point 6, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person driving the car. Since we already placed juice in column 3, rock-climbing must be in column 1.

|               |    1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      | juice   | soy-milk     |             |

| Transport     |          |               |             |

7. From point 7, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the fan of country. Since we already placed rock-climbing in column 1, the person driving the jet-ski must be in column 2.

| Transport     |          | jet-ski    |             |

8. Now we have only the Music-Genre and Hobby columns left. Since there are 3 different music-genres and 3 different hobbies, we can fill them in randomly. Let's assume the person who's hobby is drawing likes ambient music and the person who's hobby is board-games likes indie music.

Lv7-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can't determine the positions of any elements yet, so let's fill the table with placeholders for now.

|               |    1    |     2      |     3     |
| Food          | cucumber| grapes    | watermelon|
| Hobby         | fishing | dancing   | puzzles   |
| Movie-Genre   | action  | animation | zombie    |
| Music-Genre   | electronic| jazz     | soul      |
| Nationality   | brazilian| indian    | japanese  |

2. From condition 1, the person who's hobby is fishing cannot be in position 3 (left of the fan of electronic). So, the possible positions for fishing are 1 or 2.

3. From condition 2, the person eating cucumber is not the person watching zombie movies. This means cucumber cannot be in position 3 (since it would be between zombie and watermelon). So, the possible positions for cucumber are 1 or 2.

4. From condition 3, the person eating grapes is to the left of the brazilian. This means grapes cannot be in position 3. So, the possible positions for grapes are 1 or 2.

5. From condition 4, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person watching animation movies. Since animation cannot be in position 3 (as it would be to the right of the japanese), puzzles cannot be in position 3 either. So, the possible positions for puzzles are 1 or 2.

6. From condition 5, the japanese is not the person watching animation movies. This means the possible positions for the japanese are 1, 2, or 3.

7. From condition 6, the person eating watermelon is between the person watching zombie movies and the fan of jazz. Since jazz cannot be in position 1 (as it would be to the left of the fan of electronic, which is puzzles), watermelon cannot be in position 1. So, the possible positions for watermelon are 2 or 3.

8. From condition 7, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the indian. Since the possible positions for puzzles are 1 or 2, the possible positions for the indian are 1 or 3.

9. From condition 8, the fan of electronic is the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the possible positions for puzzles are 1 or 2, the fan of electronic must be in position 1. So, the hobby in position 1 is fishing (as fishing cannot be in position 3), and the nationality in position 1 is indian (as the indian is to the left of the fan of electronic).

10. Now we know that the indian is in position 1, so the hobby in position 2 must be either fishing or puzzles (as the other hobbies are already placed). But from condition 1, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the fan of electronic, so the hobby in position 2 cannot be fishing. Therefore, the hobby in position 2 is puzzles.

11. Now we know that the hobby in position 2 is puzzles, so the nationality in position 2 must be either brazilian or japanese (as the other nationalities are already placed). But from condition 5, the japanese is not the person watching animation movies, and animation is in position 3, so the nationality in position 2 cannot be japanese. Therefore, the nationality in position 2 is brazilian.

12. Now we know that the nationality in position 2 is brazilian, so the hobby in position 3 must be either fishing or dancing (as the other hobbies are already placed). But from condition 1, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the fan of electronic, and the fan of electronic is in position 1, so the hobby in position 3 cannot be fishing. Therefore, the hobby in position 3 is dancing.

13. Now we know that the hobby in position 3 is dancing, so the food in position 3 must be either cucumber, grapes, or watermelon (as the other foods are already placed). But from condition 3, the person eating grapes is to the left of the brazilian, and the brazilian is in position 2, so the food in position 3 cannot be grapes. Therefore, the food in position 3 is cucumber.

14. Now we know that the food in position 3 is cucumber, so the food in position 2 must be either grapes or watermelon. But from condition 6, the person eating watermelon is between the person watching zombie movies and the fan of jazz. Since the fan of electronic is in position 1 (as the hobby in position 1 is fishing), and the hobby in position 3 is dancing, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2. So, the food in position 2 is watermelon.

15. Finally, we know that the food in position 2 is watermelon, so the food in position 1 must be either cucumber or grapes. But from condition 4, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person watching animation movies, and the hobby in position 2 is puzzles, so the food in position 1 cannot be watermelon (as it would be between puzzles and animation). Therefore, the food in position 1 is grapes.

The final solution table is:

|               |    1    |     2      |     3     |
| Food          | grapes  | watermelon| cucumber  |
| Hobby         | fishing | puzzles   | dancing   |
| Movie-Genre   | action  | animation | zombie    |
| Music-Genre   | electronic| jazz     | soul      |
| Nationality   | brazilian| indian    | japanese  |

1. Since the person eating pepper is not on the same position as the person eating kiwi (they are either to the left or right), and the person eating kiwi can't be in the last position (because of rule 4 and 5), the person eating kiwi must be in the first position. Let's place kiwi in position 1.

2. Now, the person eating pepper can't be in the first position (because of rule 6), so it must be in position 2 or 3. However, if pepper was in position 2, the person eating watermelon would have to be in position 3 (because of rule 7), but then the person playing basketball would have to be in position 1 (because of rule 2), which contradicts rule 1 (the person eating pepper is not on the same position as the person eating kiwi). So, pepper must be in position 3.

3. Now, the person eating watermelon must be in position 2.

4. The person drinking 7up can't be in the first position (because of rule 4 and 5), so it must be in position 2 or 3. If it was in position 3, the person drinking lemonade would have to be in position 1 (because of rule 5), but then the person playing basketball would have to be in position 2 (because of rule 2), which contradicts rule 1 (the person eating pepper is not on the same position as the person eating kiwi). So, 7up must be in position 2.

5. Now, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3.

6. The person drinking mirinda can't be in the first position (because of rule 2), so it must be in position 2 or 3. If it was in position 3, the person playing basketball would have to be in position 1 (because of rule 2), which contradicts rule 1 (the person eating pepper is not on the same position as the person eating kiwi). So, mirinda must be in position 2.

7. Now, the person playing basketball must be in position 1.

8. The fan of d&b can't be in the first position (because of rule 7), so it must be in position 2 or 3. If it was in position 3, the person playing badminton would have to be in position 1 (because of rule 9), but then the person playing basketball would have to be in position 2 (because of rule 7), which contradicts rule 1 (the person eating pepper is not on the same position as the person eating kiwi). So, d&b must be in position 2.

9. Now, the person playing badminton must be in position 3.

10. The fan of pop can't be in the last position (because of rule 8), so it must be in position 1 or 2. If it was in position 1, the person playing basketball would have to be in position 2 (because of rule 8), which contradicts rule 2 (the person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda). So, pop must be in position 2.

11. The nationality of the person eating kiwi must be nigerian (because there's no other nationality that can be on the right of the person eating pepper).

12. The nationality of the person eating watermelon must be chinese (because there's no other nationality that can be on the right of the person playing basketball).

13. The nationality of the person eating pepper must be japanese.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1       |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | lemonade    |  7up      | mirinda   |
| Food          | kiwi        | watermelon| pepper    |
| Music-Genre   | pop         | d&b       | disco     |

Lv7-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, and sports, and we have 5 variables (columns) and 5 people (rows), each column must have a unique value.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the polish. So, the possible positions for the hobby column (H) are:
   - H1: _____, _____, woodworking
   - H2: woodworking, _____, _____
   - H3: _____, woodworking, _____

3. The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. So, the possible positions for the sport column (S) are:
   - S1: surfing, _____, _____
   - S2: _____, surfing, _____
   - S3: _____, _____, surfing

4. The project-manager is somewhere between the person who's sport is surfing and the australian. Since the nationalities are in even positions, the project-manager can only be in row 2 or 4. If the project-manager is in row 2, the sport in row 1 must be water-polo (rule 8). But this would mean the project-manager is on the left of the surfing, which contradicts rule 3. So, the project-manager must be in row 4. This means the sport in row 3 must be water-polo. So, the possible positions for the sport column (S) are:
   - S1: surfing, _____, water-polo
   - S2: _____, surfing, _____
   - S3: _____, _____, water-polo

5. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the polish (rule 1). Since the nationalities are in even positions, the polish can only be in row 2 or 4. If the polish is in row 2, the hobby in row 1 must be drawing (rule 7). But this would mean the hobby in row 3 is woodworking, which is on the right of the polish, but there's no one to its left. So, the polish must be in row 4. This means the hobby in row 1 must be sudoku (rule 8). So, the possible positions for the hobby column (H) are:
   - H1: sudoku, _____, woodworking
   - H2: _____, _____, woodworking
   - H3: _____, sudoku, _____

6. The photographer is on the right of the person watching superhero movies (rule 4). Since the movie-genres are in even positions, the superhero movies can only be in row 2 or 4. If the superhero movies are in row 2, the photographer must be in row 3. But this would mean the photographer is on the left of the person watching scientific movies (rule 8), which contradicts rule 6. So, the superhero movies must be in row 4. This means the photographer must be in row 3. So, the possible positions for the movie-genre column (M) are:
   - M1: _____, _____, superhero
   - M2: _____, scientific, superhero
   - M3: satire, _____, _____

7. The turkish is in an even position (rule 5). Since the nationalities are in even positions, the turkish can only be in row 2 or 4. If the turkish is in row 2, the person in row 1 must be australian (rule 5). But this would mean the hobby in row 1 is drawing, which contradicts rule 5 (since the hobby in row 3 is woodworking, and there's no one to the left of the drawing). So, the turkish must be in row 4. This means the nationality in row 1 must be australian. So, the possible positions for the nationality column (N) are:
   - N1: australian, _____, _____
   - N2: _____, _____, turkish
   - N3: polish, _____, _____

8. The person who's sport is water-polo is between the person watching scientific movies and the person who's hobby is sudoku (rule 8). Since the sports are in odd positions, the water-polo can only be in row 1 or 3. If the water-polo is in row 1, the person watching scientific movies must be in row 2. But this would mean the movie-genre in row 3 is superhero, which contradicts rule 6 (since the photographer is in row 3). So, the water-polo must be in row 3. This means the person watching scientific movies must be in row 2. So, the possible positions for the movie-genre column (M) are:
   - M1: _____, scientific, _____
   - M2: _____, _____, superhero
   - M3: satire, _____, _____

9. Now we have enough information to fill in the table:

   |               |    1    |        2        |      3       |
   | Hobby         |         |                 |              |
   | Job           |         |                 |              |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |                 |              |
   | Nationality   |         |                 |              |
   | Sport         |         |                 |              |

   |               | doctor  | photographer    | project-manager|
   | Hobby         |         |                |              |
   | Job           |         |                |              |
   | Movie-Genre   | scientific| satire          | superhero     |
   | Nationality   | australian| polish          | turkish       |
   | Sport         | water-polo| surfing         | climbing      |

10. To find the remaining values, we can use the remaining rules:
    - The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking (rule 2). Since the hobbies are in odd positions, the drawing can only be in row 1 or 3. If the drawing is in row 1, the job in row 2 must be a photographer (rule 4). But this would mean the movie-genre in row 3 is superhero, which contradicts rule 6 (since the photographer is in row 3). So, the drawing must be in row 3. This means the job in row 1 must be a doctor. So, the final table is:

   |               |    1    |        2        |      3       |
   | Hobby         | drawing | photographer    | woodworking  |
   | Job           | doctor  |                |              |
   | Movie-Genre   | scientific| satire          | superhero     |
   | Nationality   | australian| polish          | turkish       |
   | Sport         | water-polo| surfing         | climbing      |

11. Now we can fill in the remaining job:
    - The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the polish (rule 1). Since the jobs are in even positions, the job in row 2 must be a project-manager. So, the final table is:

   |               |    1    |        2        |      3       |
   | Hobby         | drawing | photographer    | woodworking  |
   | Job           | doctor  | project-manager  |              |
   | Movie-Genre   | scientific| satire          | superhero     |
   | Nationality   | australian| polish          | turkish       |
   | Sport         | water-polo| surfing         | climbing      |

12. The table is now complete:

   |               |    1    |        2        |      3       |
   | Hobby         | drawing | photographer    | woodworking  |
   | Job           | doctor  | project-manager  |              |
   | Movie-Genre   | scientific| satire          | superhero     |
   | Nationality   | australian| polish          | turkish       |
   | Sport         | water-polo| surfing         | climbing      |

Lv7-5x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating cauliflower is in the middle (row 3), and the person doing skiing is to the left of the person eating cauliflower, the skiing person must be in the first position (column 1). Let's place skiing in the first column and cauliflower in the third column.

2. The bartender is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Since the person driving the airplane is to the right of the person eating cauliflower (in the third column), the bartender must be in the second column. So, we have skiing in the first column, cauliflower in the third column, and bartender in the second column.

3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the bartender. Since the bartender is in the second column, the soy-milk person must be in the fourth column. So, we have skiing in the first column, cauliflower in the third column, bartender in the second column, and soy-milk in the fourth column.

4. The person doing rugby is the person eating cranberry. Since the person eating cauliflower is in the middle (third column), the person eating cranberry must be in the first or second column. However, since the skiing person is already in the first column, the person eating cranberry must be in the second column. So, we have skiing in the first column, cranberry in the second column, cauliflower in the third column, and soy-milk in the fourth column.

5. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike. Since we don't know the position of the bike yet, we can't place the trike yet.

6. The person drinking cola is somewhere between the electrician and the person driving the airplane. Since the bartender is the only person to the left of the person driving the airplane, and the bartender is not drinking cola (we placed the bartender in the second column), the cola person must be in the second or fourth column. However, since the soy-milk person is already in the fourth column, the cola person must be in the second column. But this contradicts the fact that the cola person is between the electrician and the person driving the airplane, as there is no electrician to the left of the second column. This puzzle seems to have a contradiction.

7. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the airplane. Since we placed the person driving the airplane in the third row (column 3), the person driving the trike must be in the first or second row. However, since the skiing person is already in the first row, the person driving the trike must be in the second row. But this contradicts the fact that the cola person is in the second row, as we placed the cola person between the electrician and the person driving the airplane, and there is no electrician to the left of the second row. This puzzle seems to have a contradiction.

The puzzle seems to have a contradiction, and it's not possible to solve it with the given information."
