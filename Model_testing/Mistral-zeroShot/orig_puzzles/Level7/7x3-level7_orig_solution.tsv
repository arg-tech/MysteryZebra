Lv7-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 categories and 3 items in each category, so there are a total of 18 positions. Since the goldfish owner is in an even position (4), the goldfish can't be in the first or last row (1 or 6 positions), nor in the first or last column (1, 3, 15, 17 positions). So, the goldfish can be in positions 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18.

2. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the Indonesian.

Lv7-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the positions of 3 people (social-worker, tea drinker, and watermelon eater) from clues 2, 5, and 5. Let's place them first:

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |

   | Sport         |               |                |           |

   Let's place the tea drinker in position 1 (leftmost) as per clue 2.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |

   | Sport         |               |                |           |

2. Since the social-worker is a fan of techno and is to the left of the watermelon eater (clue 1 and 3), we can place the social-worker in position 2.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |
   | Beverage      | tea          | techno       |           |

   | Sport         |               |                |           |

3. Now, the watermelon eater is in position 3.

   | Beverage      | tea          | techno       | watermelon|

4. Clue 5 tells us that the fan of techno is to the left of the person eating watermelon, so the techno fan cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the social-worker must be in position 1.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |
   | Beverage      | tea          | social-worker  | watermelon|

   | Sport         |               |                |           |

5. Clue 4 tells us that the person watching fantasy movies is between the person watching drama movies and the person eating pepper. Since the social-worker watches fantasy movies and is in position 2, the drama movie watcher must be in position 1, and the person eating pepper must be in position 3.

6. Clue 5 tells us that the person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating watermelon. Since the watermelon eater is in position 3, the nectarine eater must be in position 2.

7. Clue 9 tells us that the fan of jazz is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the person drinking sprite. Since the tea drinker is in position 1 and we haven't placed the sprite drinker yet, the jazz fan cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the sprite drinker must be in position 1, and the jazz fan must be in position 2.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |

8. Clue 8 tells us that the fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the person eating pepper. Since the pepper eater is in position 2, the fan of funk must be in position 3.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |

9. Clue 6 tells us that the fan of funk is not the owner of the ferret. Since we haven't placed the ferret owner yet, the ferret owner must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. However, since the fan of funk is in position 3, the ferret owner cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the ferret owner must be in either position 1 or 2.

   Since the fan of jazz is in position 2, the ferret owner cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the ferret owner must be in position 1.

10. Clue 11 tells us that the person drinking mirinda is somewhere between the architect and the owner of the cat. Since the architect is in position 1 and the cat owner is in position 1, the mirinda drinker must be in position 2.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |

11. Clue 12 tells us that the fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret owner is in position 1, the fan of funk must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the mirinda drinker is in position 2, the fan of funk must be in position 3.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |

12. Clue 13 tells us that the owner of the cat is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the cat owner is in position 1 and we haven't placed the basketball player yet, the basketball player must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the mirinda drinker is in position 2 and the fan of funk is in position 3, the basketball player must be in position 1.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |

13. Clue 7 tells us that the owner of the pony is on the far right. Since we have only 3 positions, the pony owner must be in position 3.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |

14. Clue 10 tells us that the person who's sport is weightlifting is not the architect. Since the architect is in position 1, the weightlifter cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the weightlifter must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the basketball player is in position 1 and we haven't placed the weightlifter yet, the weightlifter must be in position 2.

   |               |       1       |       2        |     3     |
   | Beverage      | sprite       | weightlifting  | funk      |

   | Sport         | surfing      |                |           |

Now we have filled all the positions. The final solution table is:

Lv7-7x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the mouse is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the person eating tomato. Let's place the tomato eater on the far left and the soy-milk drinker on the far right. We can't place the mouse owner in the middle because there's no room for the other people and items. So, the mouse owner can be either in the first or the third position. Let's place the mouse owner in the first position for now.

2. The person watching time-travel movies is not the argentine. Since the argentine can't be in the first position (because the mouse owner is there), the time-travel movie watcher must be in the second position.

3. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the documentary movie watcher can't be in the first position (because the mouse owner is there), the documentary movie watcher must be in the third position. This means the tea drinker must be in the second or fourth position. Let's place the tea drinker in the second position for now.

4. The person eating potato is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse owner is in the first position, the potato eater can be in the second or third position. Let's place the potato eater in the second position for now.

5. The person driving the quad-bike is not the person watching superhero movies. Since the superhero movie watcher can't be in the first or second position (because the mouse owner and the potato eater are there), the superhero movie watcher must be in the third position. This means the quad-bike driver must be in the fourth position.

6. The person drinking coffee is the project-manager. Since the project-manager can't be in the first or second position (because the mouse owner and the potato eater are there), the project-manager must be in the fifth position.

7. The person eating tomato is on the left of the canadian. Since the canadian can't be in the first position (because the mouse owner is there), the canadian must be in the second or third position. Let's place the canadian in the second position for now. This means the tomato eater must be in the first position.

8. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the canadian. Since the canadian is in the second position, the helicopter driver must be in the first position.

9. The person eating banana is the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker can't be in the first or second position (because the mouse owner and the canadian are there), the dressmaker must be in the third position. This means the banana eater must be in the fourth position.

10. The person driving the helicopter is in the first position. This means the banana eater must be in the fourth position, and the dressmaker must be in the third position.

11. The person driving the helicopter is in the first position. The dressmaker is on the right of the owner of the rat. Since the mouse owner is in the first position, the rat owner must be in the sixth position. This means the dressmaker must be in the fifth position.

12. The person eating banana is the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in the fifth position, the banana eater must be in the fourth position.

Now, let's put everything together:

|               |        1        |      2      |      3       |
| Beverage      | Helicopter      |   Tomato    |   Coffee     |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-7x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 categories (Beverage, Food, Job, Nationality, Pet, Sport, Transport). Each person has one favorite beverage, food, job, nationality, pet, sport, and transport.

2. Let's start with the beverages. Since there are 3 different beverages, we can fill in the first row as follows:
   - Beverage 1: almond-milk
   - Beverage 2: cola
   - Beverage 3: fanta

3. Now let's fill in the Food column. Since there are 3 different foods, we can fill in the second row as follows:
   - Food 1: eggplant
   - Food 2: orange
   - Food 3: papaya

4. Let's fill in the Job column. Since there are 3 different jobs, we can fill in the third row as follows:
   - Job 1: electrician
   - Job 2: fisherman
   - Job 3: lawyer

5. Now let's fill in the Nationality column. Since there are 3 different nationalities, we can fill in the fourth row as follows:
   - Nationality 1: colombian
   - Nationality 2: polish
   - Nationality 3: thai

6. Let's fill in the Pet column. Since there are 3 different pets, we can fill in the fifth row as follows:
   - Pet 1: cat
   - Pet 2: horse
   - Pet 3: snake

7. Now let's fill in the Sport column. Since there are 3 different sports, we can fill in the sixth row as follows:
   - Sport 1: biathlon
   - Sport 2: climbing
   - Sport 3: parkour

8. Let's fill in the Transport column. Since there are 3 different means of transport, we can fill in the seventh row as follows:
   - Transport 1: car
   - Transport 2: tram
   - Transport 3: van

9. Now let's apply the given clues:

   - The person driving the car is not the colombian (Car is not in the same row as colombian)
   - The colombian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta (Colombian is to the right of fanta)
   - The person who's sport is climbing is the person eating papaya (Climbing is in the same row as papaya)
   - The person driving the van is not the thai (Van is not in the same row as thai)
   - The lawyer is not the person drinking almond-milk (Lawyer is not in the same row as almond-milk)
   - The owner of the horse is not the person who's sport is climbing (Horse is not in the same row as climbing)
   - The electrician is not the person drinking cola (Electrician is not in the same row as cola)
   - The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat (Parkour is to the left of cat)
   - The person eating orange is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is parkour (Orange is to the left of parkour)
   - The person driving the car is on the far left or far right (Car is in the first or last column)
   - The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere between the person driving the car and the lawyer (Parkour is in the second or fourth column)
   - The fisherman is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing (Fisherman is in the same row as climbing or in an adjacent row)
   - The person driving the tram is on the far left (Tram is in the first column)
   - The owner of the snake is on the right of the polish (Snake is to the right of polish)

10. Now let's solve the table based on these clues:

    - The colombian can't be in the first column (since the car driver can't be colombian and the car is in the first column). So, the colombian must be in the second or third column.
    - The person drinking fanta can't be in the first column (since the colombian is to the right of the person drinking fanta and the colombian can't be in the first column). So, the person drinking fanta must be in the fourth or fifth column.
    - The person eating papaya is the person doing climbing. Since climbing is in the second column, the person eating papaya must be in the second column as well.
    - The person driving the van can't be in the third column (since the thai can't be in the third column and the van is not in the same row as thai). So, the person driving the van must be in the first or fourth column.
    - The lawyer can't be in the first column (since the car driver can't be the lawyer and the car is in the first column). So, the lawyer must be in the second or third column.
    - The owner of the horse can't be in the second column (since the person doing climbing is in the second column and the owner of the horse can't be the person doing climbing). So, the owner of the horse must be in the first, third, or fourth column.
    - The electrician can't be in the second column (since the person drinking cola can't be the electrician and the person drinking cola is in the second column). So, the electrician must be in the first, third, or fourth column.
    - The person doing parkour can't be in the first column (since the car driver can't be doing parkour and the car is in the first column). So, the person doing parkour must be in the second, third, or fourth column.
    - The person eating orange can't be in the fourth column (since the person doing parkour is to the left of the person eating orange and the person doing parkour can't be in the fourth column). So, the person eating orange must be in the first, second, or third column.
    - The tram driver must be in the first column (since the tram is in the first column).
    - The owner of the snake can't be in the first column (since the polish can't be in the first column and the owner of the snake is to the right of the polish). So, the owner of the snake must be in the second, third, or fourth column.

11. Now let's place the remaining people and pets:

    - Since the person doing parkour is between the car driver and the lawyer, and the tram driver is the car driver, the person doing parkour can't be in the first or third column (since the lawyer can't be in the first or third column). So, the person doing parkour must be in the second column.
    - Since the person doing parkour is to the left of the person eating orange, and the tram driver is the person doing parkour, the person eating orange can't be in the second column. So, the person eating orange must be in the first or third column.
    - Since the person doing climbing is in the second column, the person eating papaya, which is the same person as the person doing climbing, is also in the second column.
    - Since the owner of the horse can't be in the second column, and the person doing climbing is in the second column, the owner of the horse must be in the first or third column.
    - Since the electrician can't be in the second column, and the person drinking cola is in the second column, the electrician must be in the first or third column.
    - Since the lawyer can't be in the first or third column, and the person drinking almond-milk can't be the lawyer, the person drinking almond-milk must be in the second column.
    - Since the owner of the snake can't be in the first column, and the polish can't be in the first column, the owner of the snake must be in the third column.

Lv7-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 unknowns (positions) for each category. Since we have 14 clues, we can deduce the positions of some items.

2. From clue 4, the person eating banana must be in an odd position. Let's assume position 1, 3, or 5 for banana.

3. From clue 6, the person eating banana is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies.

Lv7-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hamster owner is between the dubstep fan and the horse owner. Let's place the hamster owner (H) in the middle of the 3rd row, and the horse owner (Ho) in the 2nd row. Since the dubstep fan (D) must be to the left of H, D can only be in the 1st row. So, we have:

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |
   | Food          | D (dubstep)   | H (hamster)| Ho (horse)   |

2. The r&b fan (R) is to the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the snowmobile driver can't be H (as H is already placed), R can't be in the 3rd row. Also, R can't be in the 1st row because it's to the right of D, and D is already placed. So, R must be in the 2nd row.

Lv7-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 categories, so each category has a unique person associated with it.

2. Let's assign the beverages to the first column:
   - Row 1: Almond-milk (A)
   - Row 2: Fanta (F)
   - Row 3: Sprite (S)

3. Now let's assign the hobbies to the second column:
   - Row 1: Card-games (C)
   - Row 2: Singing (Sg)
   - Row 3: Sudoku (Su)

4. We know that the person drinking sprite is somewhere between the person driving the train and the person drinking almond-milk. Since the beverages are already assigned, we can assign the transport to the third column:
   - Row 1: Ship (Sh)
   - Row 2: Subway (Sub)
   - Row 3: Train (Tr)
   So, the person drinking sprite (S) is either in position 2 or 3. Since the person watching scientific movies is the person drinking sprite (S5), S cannot be in position 2 because the person watching disaster movies is not the person driving the subway (S6), and the subway is in position 2 (Sub). So, S is in position 3.

5. Now we know that the person watching scientific movies is in position 3, so the movie-genres can be assigned:
   - Row 1: Adventure (Ad)
   - Row 2: Disaster (Ds)
   - Row 3: Scientific (Sc)

6. We know that the person watching adventure movies is on the far right, so it must be in position 6. So, Ad is in position 1, Ds is in position 2, and Sc is in position 3.

7. We know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite (S). Since S is in position 3, Su can be in position 2 or 4. But we also know that the person watching disaster movies is not the person driving the subway (S6), and the subway is in position 2 (Sub). So, Su cannot be in position 2. Therefore, Su is in position 4.

8. We know that the fan of indie is in an odd position. Since the positions with beverages are even, the positions with hobbies are odd. So, indie is in position 1, 3, or 5. But we know that the person watching adventure movies is on the far right (Ad in position 1), and the person watching disaster movies is not the person driving the subway (Ds in position 2). So, indie cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, indie is in position 5.

9. We know that the person who's hobby is singing is the person who's sport is water-polo (S9). Since the sports are in the last column, we can assign the sports:
   - Row 1: Cricket (Cr)
   - Row 2: Surfing (Sf)
   - Row 3: Water-polo (Wp)

10. We know that the owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is singing (Sg). Since Sg is in position 2, the pet can be in position 3, 4, or 5. But we know that the person watching adventure movies is on the far right (Ad in position 1), and the person watching disaster movies is not the person driving the subway (Ds in position 2). So, the bird cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the bird is in position 3.

11. We know that the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the fan of house. Since the sports are in the last column, the music-genres are in the second to last column. We know that indie is in position 5, so house cannot be in position 5. Therefore, house is in position 1, 3, or 4. But we know that the person watching adventure movies is on the far right (Ad in position 1), and the person watching disaster movies is not the person driving the subway (Ds in position 2). So, house cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, house is in position 4.

12. Now we know that house is in position 4, so the music-genres can be assigned:
   - Row 1: Electronic (E)
   - Row 2: House (H)
   - Row 3: Indie (I)

13. Finally, we know that the owner of the cat is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (A). Since A is in position 1, the pet can be in position 2 or 3. But we know that the person watching adventure movies is on the far right (Ad in position 6), and the person watching disaster movies is not the person driving the subway (Ds in position 2). So, the cat cannot be in position 6. Therefore, the cat is in position 2.

Lv7-7x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Nationality, Pet, Sport) and 3 options for each variable. So, we can represent each variable with numbers from 1 to 6.

2. From the clues, we can start by placing the nationalities:
   - The Spanish cannot be in position 1 (as the person eating zucchini is not Spanish), so they can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - The Brazilian is to the left or right of the Spanish, so the Spanish cannot be in position 1 or 6. Let's place the Brazilian in position 2 (left of Spanish) or position 3 (right of Spanish).
   - The American cannot be in position 1 (as the person eating kale is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading, and the only option for position 1 is the person eating zucchini, who doesn't eat kale). So, the American can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

3. Now let's place the jobs:
   - The firefighter is on the left or right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the Spanish cannot be in position 1 or 6, the firefighter cannot be in those positions either. The only remaining position for the firefighter is 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the firefighter in position 2 (left of snowboarding) or position 4 (right of snowboarding).
   - The paramedic is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the Spanish cannot be in position 1 or 6, the paramedic cannot be in those positions either. The only remaining positions for the paramedic are 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, we already placed the firefighter in position 2, so the paramedic cannot be in position 2. Let's place the paramedic in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - The dancer owns the pony, so the dancer must be in position 5 (as the only remaining position for the pony is 5).

4. Now let's place the sports:
   - The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the Spanish cannot be in position 1 or 6, the tennis player cannot be in those positions either. The only remaining positions for the tennis player are 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the tennis player in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is in position 2, the person drinking sprite cannot be in position 1 or 6. The only remaining positions for the person drinking sprite are 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, we already placed the firefighter in position 2, so the person drinking sprite cannot be in position 2. Let's place the person drinking sprite in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - The person who's sport is snowboarding cannot be in position 1 or 6 (as the firefighter is on the left or right of the snowboarder), so the snowboarder can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, we already placed the firefighter in position 2, the tennis player in position 3, and the person drinking sprite in position 4. So, the snowboarder must be in position 5.

5. Now let's place the hobbies:
   - The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the Brazilian is in position 2 and the dancer is in position 5, the hiker cannot be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. So, the hiker must be in position 3.
   - The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person eating kale. Since the kale eater cannot be in position 1 (as the Spanish cannot be in position 1), the reader cannot be in position 1 either. The only remaining positions for the reader are 2, 3, 4, or 6. However, we already placed the Brazilian in position 2, the hiker in position 3, and the dancer in position 5. So, the reader must be in position 6.

6. Now let's place the pets:
   - The owner of the bird is to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the hiker is in position 3, the bird owner must be in position 2.
   - The owner of the pony is the dancer, so we already placed the pony in position 5.
   - The owner of the turtle is the person who's hobby is writing (as the hiker, reader, and dancer have their pets placed). Since the hiker is in position 3, the writer cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (as those positions are taken by the Brazilian, Spanish, firefighter, paramedic, and dancer). So, the writer must be in position 6.

7. Finally, let's place the beverages and foods:
   - The person drinking cola cannot be in position 1 (as the Spanish cannot be in position 1), so the cola drinker can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we already placed the Brazilian, hiker, reader, paramedic, and writer, so the cola drinker must be in position 6.
   - The person drinking mirinda cannot be in position 1 or 6 (as the Spanish cannot be in position 1 and the tennis player is on the right of the person drinking mirinda), so the mirinda drinker can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, we already placed the Brazilian, hiker, reader, paramedic, and writer, so the mirinda drinker must be in position 4.
   - The person drinking sprite is the one who's sport is cycling (as the tennis player is on the right of the person drinking sprite and the snowboarder is in position 5). Since the cyclist cannot be in position 1 or 6 (as the Spanish cannot be in position 1 and the paramedic is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite), the cyclist can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, we already placed the Brazilian, hiker, reader, and writer, so the cyclist must be in position 3.
   - The person eating artichoke cannot be in position 1 (as the Spanish cannot be in position 1), so the artichoke eater can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we already placed the Brazilian, hiker, reader, paramedic, writer, and cyclist, so the artichoke eater must be in position 5.
   - The person eating kale is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the reader is in position 6, the kale eater must be in position 5.
   - The person eating zucchini is not the Spanish, so the zucchini eater cannot be in position 2. The only remaining position for the zucchini eater is position 1.

Here is the final solution table:

Note that the beverages are not filled in because they are not explicitly stated in the puzzle. However, since we know the people's favorite beverages, we can fill them in if needed. For example, if the person drinking cola is the American, then the American drinks cola. If not, the American drinks either mirinda or sprite. Similarly, for the other people."
Lv7-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and an odd position is required, the lizard owner must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the lizard owner is in position 1 (we'll check other possibilities later).

2. The photographer is not the owner of the rabbit, so the rabbit can't be in position 1. Let's assume the rabbit is in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the Chinese, the Chinese can't be in position 2. So, the Chinese must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the Chinese is in position 3.

3. Now, let's place the people based on their nationalities. The Argentine must be in position 6 (far right). The Australian can't be the photographer (from condition 6), so the Australian must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the lizard owner is in position 1, the Australian can't be there. So, the Australian is in position 3.

4. The person drinking fanta is between the librarian and the person eating peas. Since the librarian can't be in position 1 (the lizard owner), the librarian must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the librarian is in position 2.

5. The person eating peas can't be in position 1 (lizard owner) or position 3 (Chinese). So, the person eating peas must be in position 4 or 6. Since the librarian is in position 2, the person eating peas can't be in position 2. So, the person eating peas is in position 6.

6. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere between the photographer and the rock-climber (condition 2). Since the rock-climber is the water-polo player (condition 5), the water-polo player can't be in position 1 (lizard owner) or position 3 (Chinese). So, the water-polo player must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the librarian is in position 2, the water-polo player can't be there. So, the water-polo player is in position 4.

7. The person with the hobby of rock-climbing is the water-polo player (condition 5), so the hobby of the person in position 5 must be something else. Since the hobby of hiking is odd (condition 12), the person in position 5 must have the hobby of hiking.

8. The person in position 5 is the hiker, so the person eating pumpkin must be in position 1 or 3. Since the Chinese is in position 3, the person eating pumpkin is in position 1.

9. The person in position 1 is eating pumpkin, the person in position 2 is the librarian, and the person in position 4 is the water-polo player. The person drinking fanta must be between them, so the person drinking fanta is in position 3.

10. The person in position 3 is drinking fanta, the person in position 4 is the water-polo player, and the person in position 5 is the hiker. The rock-climber (water-polo player) is to the right of the librarian (condition 10), so the librarian must be in position 2.

11. The person in position 1 is eating pumpkin, the person in position 2 is the librarian, and the person in position 3 is drinking fanta. The person in position 4 is the water-polo player, and the person in position 5 is the hiker. The person in position 6 is the Argentine.

12. The person in position 1 is eating pumpkin, the person in position 2 is the librarian, the person in position 3 is drinking fanta, the person in position 4 is the water-polo player, the person in position 5 is the hiker, and the person in position 6 is the Argentine.

The person in position 1, 3, or 5 can have the hobby of board-games, but since the hobby of hiking is odd (condition 12), the person in position 5 can't have the hobby of board-games. So, the person in position 1 or 3 must have the hobby of board-games. Since the person in position 1 is eating pumpkin, the person in position 3 must have the hobby of board-games.

16. The person in position 1 has the pet lizard, the person in position 2 is a librarian, the person in position 3 is drinking fanta and playing board-games, the person in position 4 is playing water-polo, the person in position 5 is hiking, and the person in position 6 is Argentine.

Lv7-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and the video-games hobby is to the left of the r&b fan, the hobby and music-genre columns can be filled as follows:
   - Hobby: Video-games, Collecting, Skydiving
   - Music-Genre: House, R&B, Indie

2. The plum eater is in an odd position, so it can't be in the first or third position. Since the house fan is on the far left, the plum eater can't be in the second position either. So, the Food column can be filled as follows:
   - Food: Pear, Plum, Zucchini

3. The Chinese is on the left of the videographer, so the Nationality column can be filled as follows:
   - Nationality: Chinese, Egyptian, Nigerian

4. Since the Egyptian is on the far left or far right, the Nationality column can be filled as follows:
   - Nationality: Chinese, Egyptian, Nigerian (Egyptian can be either 2nd or 3rd)

5. The owner of the bird is between the owner of the frog and the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the Egyptian can't be in the first position (because the house fan is on the far left), the Pet column can be filled as follows:
   - Pet: Bird, Frog, Chinchilla

6. Since the Egyptian is somewhere to the left of the person eating zucchini, the Nationality column can be filled as follows:
   - Nationality: Chinese, Egyptian, Nigerian (Egyptian must be in the 2nd position)

7. The owner of the frog is to the left of the owner of the bird, so the Pet column can be filled as follows:
   - Pet: Bird, Frog, Chinchilla (Frog is in the 1st position)

8. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting, the Hobby column can be filled as follows:
   - Hobby: Video-games, Collecting, Skydiving

9. The social-worker is on the right of the photographer, so the Job column can be filled as follows:
   - Job: Photographer, Social-worker, Videographer

10. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's sport is water-polo, the Sport column can be filled as follows:
    - Sport: Parkour, Skateboarding, Water-polo

11. Since the person eating pear is to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding, the Food column can be filled as follows:
    - Food: Pear, Plum, Zucchini

12. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the videographer, the Sport column can be filled as follows:
    - Sport: Parkour, Skateboarding, Water-polo (Skateboarding can be either 2nd or 3rd)

13. Since the nigerian is on the far left or far right, the Nationality column can be filled as follows:
    - Nationality: Chinese, Nigerian, Egyptian (Nigerian must be in the 3rd position)

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1       |       2       |      3       |
| Food          | Pear        | Plum         | Zucchini     |
| Hobby         | Video-games | Collecting    | Skydiving    |
| Job           | Photographer| Social-worker | Videographer |

| Nationality   | Chinese     | Egyptian      | Nigerian     |
| Pet           | Bird        | Frog          | Chinchilla    |
