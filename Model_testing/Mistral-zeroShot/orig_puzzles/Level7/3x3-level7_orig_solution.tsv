Lv7-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different nationalities (Australian, Dutch, Indian) and three different music genres (Classical, Electronic, Gospel). Let's assign them to the rows and columns as follows:

   |               | Australian | Dutch   | Indian  |
   | Food          |            |         |         |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Nationality   |           |         |         |

2. The Indian is the fan of Gospel, so we can fill in the Nationality column:

   |               | Australian | Dutch   | Indian  |
   | Food          |            |         | Gospel  |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Nationality   |           |         | Australian  |

3. The fan of Electronic is the Dutch, so we can fill in the Nationality and Music-Genre columns:

   |               | Australian | Dutch   | Indian  |
   | Food          |            | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Nationality   |           | Dutch    | Australian |

4. The Australian is to the left of the fan of Gospel. Since the Indian (Gospel) is already in the third column, the Australian must be in the first column. Let's fill in the Nationality column:

   |               | Classical  | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Food          | Australian| Dutch    |         |
   | Music-Genre   |           | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Dutch    | Indian  |

5. The person eating tomato is somewhere between the person eating kiwi and the Australian. Since the Australian is in the first column and we don't know the order of the food yet, let's assume the order is Kiwi, Tomato, Apricot. We can fill in the Food column:

   |               | Classical  | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Food          | Kiwi      | Tomato   | Apricot |
   | Music-Genre   |           | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Dutch    | Indian  |

6. The person eating tomato is somewhere between the person eating kiwi and the Australian. Since the Australian is in the first row and the Kiwi is in the second row, the Tomato must be in the third row. We already have the Food column filled, so no changes are needed:

   |               | Classical  | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Food          | Kiwi      | Tomato   | Apricot |
   | Music-Genre   |           | Electronic| Gospel  |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Dutch    | Indian  |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               | Classical  | Electronic| Gospel  |
| Food          | Kiwi      | Tomato   | Apricot |
| Music-Genre   |           | Electronic| Gospel  |
| Nationality   | Australian| Dutch    | Indian  |

Lv7-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different beverages, music-genres, and means of transport. Let's assign them numbers for easier reference:
   - Beverages: 1 (coffee), 2 (lemonade), 3 (sprite)
   - Music-genres: A (electronic), B (house), C (soul)
   - Means of transport: X (helicopter), Y (scooter), Z (subway)

2. From point 1, we know that the fan of house is the person driving the scooter (Y). So, Y = B (house).

3. The fan of soul is on the far left. Since we know Y = B (house), and there are three people, the fan of soul must be in the first position. So, the first row is C (soul).

4. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the fan of electronic. Since A (electronic) is somewhere between X (helicopter) and 2 (lemonade), the person drinking sprite must be in the first two positions. However, we already know the first position is C (soul), so the person drinking sprite must be in the first position, and the fan of electronic must be in the second position. So, the second row is A (electronic).

5. The person driving the subway is the person driving the subway. Since we already know the positions of the first two people, the person driving the subway must be in the third position. Since we know Y = B (house) and A (electronic) is in the second position, the only remaining beverage for the third position is 3 (sprite). So, the third row is X (helicopter) because the fan of electronic is between X and 2 (lemonade), and we already know A (electronic) is in the second position.

6. The only remaining information is the music-genre for the second and third rows. Since the person drinking sprite is on the left of the fan of electronic, the second row must be 2 (lemonade), and the third row must be 1 (coffee). However, we know that the third row is X (helicopter), and the fan of electronic is between X and 2 (lemonade), so the third row must be A (electronic). This contradicts our previous conclusion that the third row is 1 (coffee).

Unfortunately, there seems to be a contradiction in the given information, and it's not possible to solve the puzzle as it stands.

Final solution table:

|               |      C      |      A      |     X     |
| Beverage      | soul       | electronic | helicopter|
| Music-Genre   |            |            |          |
| Transport     |            |            |          |

However, there is a contradiction in the given information, and the puzzle cannot be solved as it stands."
Lv7-3x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 3 positions (1, 2, 3) and 3 categories (Beverage, Movie-Genre, Nationality). We need to fill each position with one item from each category.

2. From the clues:
   - The beverages are different, so each position can only have one type of beverage.
   - The movie genres are different, so each position can only have one movie genre.
   - The nationalities are different, so each position can only have one nationality.

3. Let's start with the nationalities:
   - The Colombian must be in an odd position (position 1, 3). Let's place the Colombian in position 1 (C).
   - The Indian is on the far right (position 3), so the nationality in position 2 must be German (G).
   - The nationality in position 3 is Indian (I).

4. Now let's fill the movie genres:
   - The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the Colombian is in position 1 and the German is in position 2, the romance movie must be in position 1 (R) and the satire movie in position 2 (S).
   - The superhero movie must be in position 3, as it's to the right of the person drinking milk (M).

5. Finally, let's fill the beverages:
   - The person drinking milk is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching superhero movies. Since the romance movie is in position 1 and the superhero movie is in position 3, the milk must be in position 2 (M).
   - The person drinking coffee is on the left of the German. Since the German is in position 2, the coffee must be in position 1 (C).
   - The only beverage left is Fanta (F), so it must be in position 3 (F).

6. The final solution table is:

   | Beverage      |     1     |   2    |     3     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Romance  | Satire | Superhero |
   | Nationality   | Colombian| German | Indian    |

So the final solution is:

#############
| Beverage      | Romance  | Satire | Superhero |
| Movie-Genre   |         |        |           |
| Nationality   | Colombian| German | Indian    |
#############

Now we just need to fill the missing movie genres:
- Since the person watching satire movies is to the right of the person watching romance movies, the remaining movie genre must be the one watching superhero movies. So the movie genre in position 1 is Romantic Comedy (RC) and the movie genre in position 3 is Action (A).

The final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage      | Romance  | Satire | Superhero |
| Movie-Genre   | Romantic Comedy | Satire | Action   |
| Nationality   | Colombian| German | Indian    |

Lv7-3x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 3 people (A, B, C) and 3 beverages (7up, juice, mirinda), 3 jobs (designer, librarian, scientist), and 3 music-genres (d&b, electronic, rock).

2. Let's assign the beverages to the people first. Since the person drinking juice is not to the right of the fan of electronic, and the fan of rock is on the far right, the person drinking juice cannot be the rock fan. So, let's assign juice to person A.

3. Now, the person drinking juice is to the left of the fan of electronic. So, the fan of electronic cannot be person C (since C is on the far right). The fan of electronic can be either person B or A. But since the scientist is between the fan of rock and the fan of d&b, and the fan of rock is on the far right, the fan of electronic cannot be person A (since A is already the juice fan and cannot be the rock fan). So, the fan of electronic is person B.

4. Now, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the designer. Since the fan of electronic is person B, and the fan of rock is on the far right (person C), the designer must be person A. So, the person drinking mirinda is person C.

5. Now, we know the jobs of all three people. The scientist is between the fan of rock and the fan of d&b. Since the fan of rock is person C and the designer is person A, the scientist must be person B.

6. Finally, we need to assign the music-genres. Since the fan of electronic is person B, the fan of d&b must be person A. The fan of rock is person C.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage      | juice    | mirinda   | 7up     |
| Job           | designer | scientist | librarian|
| Music-Genre   | d&b     | electronic| rock    |

Lv7-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the train is on the left of the person driving the ship. Let's place them in the first two spots in the Transport column. So, the Transport column becomes: `[Train, Ship, Van]`

2. Now, the person driving the ship is between the person driving the train and the person driving the van. This means the Van driver must be in the third spot, so the Transport column is now: `[Train, Ship, Van]`

3. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the fan of house. Since we don't know the exact positions of the Pet column yet, let's assume the Pet column is `[A, B, C]`. This means the Pet column is `[Guinea-pig, PetB, PetC]` where PetB is the owner of the house and PetC is the owner of the goldfish.

4. The fan of disco is somewhere between the fan of house and the owner of the goldfish. Since we know the Pet column, this means the Music-Genre column must be `[Disco, House, Ambient]` because Disco is between House and the unknown genre of PetC (the owner of the goldfish).

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |   1   |     2      |    3     |
| Music-Genre   | Disco |    House   | Ambient  |
| Pet           | Guinea-pig | Owner of House | Owner of Goldfish |
| Transport     | Train  |    Ship    |   Van    |
```

This is the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv7-3x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the librarian is to the left of the software-developer, and there are only 3 positions, the librarian must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the librarian is in position 1 for now.

2. The person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person drinking water. Since there are only 3 positions and the librarian (who could be drinking iced-tea) is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 1 or 3. If the person drinking water is in position 1, then the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2 or 3. But this violates rule 3, as the Japanese is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea, and there are only 2 positions left (2 and 3). So, the person drinking water must be in position 3.

3. Now, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2.

4. The librarian is between the Turkish and the Japanese. Since the librarian is in position 1, the Turkish and Japanese must be in positions 2 and 3. But this violates rule 3, as the Japanese is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea, and the Japanese is in position 3. So, the librarian cannot be in position 1. The librarian must be in position 2.

5. Now, the librarian is between the Turkish and the Japanese, so the Turkish is in position 1 and the Japanese is in position 3.

6. The person drinking juice must be in position 1 (as the librarian is between the musician and the person drinking juice), the musician is in position 2, and the software-developer is in position 3.

7. The nationality of the person in position 1 is Turkish, the person in position 2 is a librarian (drinking iced-tea), and the person in position 3 is Japanese (drinking water). The job of the person in position 2 is librarian, the job of the person in position 2 is musician, and the job of the person in position 3 is software-developer. The beverage of the person in position 1 is juice, the beverage of the person in position 2 is iced-tea, and the beverage of the person in position 3 is water.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |     2      |         3          |

Lv7-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the police officer is to the right of the doctor, and the doctor is to the right of the entrepreneur, we can arrange them in the order: Entrepreneur, Doctor, Police Officer.

2. The person driving the bus is on the far right, so it must be the Police Officer (P).

3. Now we know the Police Officer is driving the bus, so the Doctor (D) cannot be driving the bus. Therefore, the Doctor must be driving the trike (T) because the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person driving the trike. So, the table looks like this:

   | Beverage    |      1       |       2       |       3        |
   |------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
   | Job         |              |               |                |
   | Transport   |              |               |                |

   | Job         | Entrepreneur | Doctor       | Police Officer |
   | Transport   |             | Tike         | Bus           |

4. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right. Since the bus driver is the police officer, the iced-tea drinker cannot be on the far right. So, the iced-tea drinker must be on the far left, and the water drinker must be in the middle.

   | Beverage    |      1       |       2       |       3        |
   |------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|

   | Transport   |             | Tike         | Bus           |

   | Beverage    | Water       | Iced-Tea     | Hot-Chocolate |

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere between the person driving the bus and the person driving the bike. Since the bus driver is the police officer and the trike driver is the doctor, the only possible person to drive the bike is the entrepreneur.

   | Beverage    | Water       | Iced-Tea     | Hot-Chocolate |
   |------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
   | Job         | Entrepreneur | Doctor       | Police Officer |
   | Transport   | Bike        | Tike         | Bus           |

6. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. So, the iced-tea drinker must be in the middle, and the water drinker must be on the far left.

   | Beverage    | Water       | Iced-Tea     | Hot-Chocolate |
   |------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
   | Job         | Entrepreneur | Doctor       | Police Officer |
   | Transport   | Bike        | Tike         | Bus           |

   | Beverage    | Water       | Iced-Tea     | Hot-Chocolate |
   |------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
   | Job         | Entrepreneur | Doctor       | Police Officer |
   | Transport   | Bike        | Tike         | Bus           |

   | Job         | Entrepreneur | Doctor       | Police Officer |
   | Transport   | Bike         | Tike         | Bus           |
   | Beverage    | Water        | Iced-Tea     | Hot-Chocolate |

7. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere between the person driving the bus and the person driving the bike. Since the bus driver is the police officer and the trike driver is the doctor, the entrepreneur must be driving the bike. But this contradicts the information that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water, as the entrepreneur is now on the far left.

There seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle, and it's not possible to solve it with the given information.

Lv7-3x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Dutch is driving the airplane (4). Let's place the Dutch in the first column (1) as there are three nationalities.

   | Transport     |           |        |          |

2. Since the Dutch is driving the airplane (4), the snake is the pet of the Dutch (3). Let's place the snake in the first row (1).

   | Nationality   |     1     |   2    |    3     |

   | Transport     |           |        |          |

3. Now, the polish is between the Dutch (1) and the owner of the bird (5). Since there are only three nationalities, the polish must be in the second column (2).

   | Transport     |           |        |          |

4. The owner of the rabbit is to the right of the person driving the motorbike (2). Since the polish is in the second column (2), the motorbike driver must be in the third column (3).

5. The person driving the train is somewhere between the British and the person driving the airplane (1). Since the Dutch (1) is driving the airplane, the British must be in the first column (1) and the train driver in the second column (2).

Lv7-3x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the positions are odd for the milk drinker, they must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, if milk were in position 1, then the almond-milk drinker would have to be in position 3, which would violate rule 3. So, the milk drinker cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if milk were in position 3, the almond-milk drinker would have to be in position 1, which would also violate rule 3. Therefore, the milk drinker must be in position 5.

2. The ice-hockey player cannot be in position 1 because the milk drinker is there, and they cannot be in position 5 because the milk drinker is there. So, the ice-hockey player must be in position 3.

3. Now we know the positions of milk and ice-hockey. Since the juice drinker cannot be to the right of the ice-hockey player (rule 4), the juice drinker must be in position 1 or 2. However, if juice were in position 1, it would violate rule 2 (the ice-hockey player is between the scooter and golf). So, the juice drinker must be in position 2.

4. The almond-milk drinker cannot be in position 1 (rule 4) or position 5 (rule 1). So, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 3.

5. Finally, the person driving the scooter must be in position 1 because they are to the left of the golf player (rule 2), and the milk and juice drinkers are already placed.

6. The person playing golf must be in position 5 because they are to the right of the almond-milk drinker (rule 3), and the milk, juice, and scooter users are already placed.

7. The person driving the bike must be in position 2 because they are to the left of the almond-milk drinker (rule 3), and the milk, juice, scooter, and golf players are already placed.

The final solution table is:

Lv7-3x3-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person watching thriller movies is either on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Let's assume the thriller watcher is on the left (we'll check the other possibility later). This means the order is: Drama, Thriller, and then either Western or another Drama.

2. The Russian is between the person drinking soy-milk and the Australian. Since we assumed the thriller watcher is on the left, the Russian can't be in the first two positions (as the first position is Drama and the second is Thriller). So, the order is: Drama, Thriller, Russian, and then either Western or another Drama.

3. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching western movies. Since we assumed the thriller watcher is on the left, the milk drinker can't be in the first three positions (as the first is Drama, the second is Thriller, and the third is Russian). So, the order is: Drama, Thriller, Russian, Western, and then Milk.

4. The Australian is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since we assumed the thriller watcher is the Russian, the Australian must be in the last two positions. But we already placed the Russian and Western in the third and fourth positions. So, this assumption (that the thriller watcher is on the left) doesn't work.

5. Let's try the other possibility: the thriller watcher is on the right of the person watching drama movies. This means the order is: Drama, Thriller, and then either Western or another Drama, followed by the Russian and then Milk.

6. The Russian is between the person drinking soy-milk and the Australian. In this new order, the Russian can be in the fourth or fifth position. If the Russian is in the fourth position, the order would be: Drama, Thriller, Western, Russian, and then Milk. But this doesn't work because the Russian is not between the soy-milk drinker and the Australian. So, the Russian must be in the fifth position. This means the order is: Drama, Thriller, Western, Milk, and then Russian.

7. The Australian is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. In this new order, the Australian can only be in the last position (as the Russian is already in the fifth position). So, the final order is: Drama, Thriller, Western, Milk, Australian.

The final solution table is:

|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4      |     5      |
| Beverage      | soy-    | milk     |            | western    | australian |
| Movie-Genre   | drama   | thriller |            |            |            |
| Nationality   |        |         |            |            |            |

Now, let's fill in the nationalities and beverages based on the remaining information:

1. The person drinking soy-milk is not the Australian (as the Australian is in the last position), so the soy-milk drinker must be either Russian or someone else. Since the Russian is in the fifth position, the soy-milk drinker must be someone else. Let's say it's the person watching drama movies.

2. The person watching western movies is not the Australian (as the Australian is in the last position), so the western watcher must be either Russian or someone else. Since the Russian is in the fifth position, the western watcher must be someone else. Let's say it's the person drinking milk.

The final solution table is:

|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4      |     5      |
| Beverage      | soy-    | milk     | western    |            | australian |
| Movie-Genre   | drama   | thriller |            | western    |            |
| Nationality   | russian |         |            | russian    | australian |
