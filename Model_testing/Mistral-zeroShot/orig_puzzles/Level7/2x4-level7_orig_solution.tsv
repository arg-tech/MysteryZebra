Lv7-2x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is gardening must be in an even position. Since there are 4 people and an even number, the gardener must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

2. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is gardening is to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. This means the gardener can't be in the 4th position because then there would be no one to the left of them. So, the gardener can be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

3. From rule 1, the person drinking hot-chocolate is between the person drinking cola and the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the gardener is in the 2nd or 3rd position, the hot-chocolate drinker must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.

4. From rule 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the gardener is in the 2nd position and the hot-chocolate drinker is between the gardener and the cola drinker, the hot-chocolate drinker can't be in the 1st position (because there's no one to the right of them who's hobby is board-games). So, the hot-chocolate drinker must be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

5. From rule 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the person drinking cola. Since the hot-chocolate drinker is in the 2nd or 3rd position, the tea drinker must be in the 1st or 4th position, and the cola drinker must be in the 3rd or 4th position.

6. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since the tea drinker is in the 1st or 4th position, the hiker can be in the 2nd or 3rd position, but not the 4th position because the gardener is already there. So, the hiker can be in the 2nd position.

7. Now we know the hiker is in the 2nd position, so the gardener must be in the 3rd position (because the gardener is to the left of the board-games person, and the board-games person can't be in the 2nd position because the hiker is there).

8. Since the gardener is in the 3rd position, the hot-chocolate drinker must be in the 2nd position (because the hot-chocolate drinker is between the cola drinker and the gardener).

9. Finally, the cola drinker must be in the 4th position (because the tea drinker is on the right of the hiker, and the hiker is in the 2nd position).

The final solution table is:

2. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog. So, we place the snake to the left of the dog.

6. We still have the pet and sport for position 1 empty. Since the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the owner of the volleyball, we can place the hedgehog in position 1.

Lv7-2x4-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are four different movie genres (comedy, crime, mystery, scientific) and four different music genres (classical, dubstep, house, indie).

2. From point 1, we can place one genre in each cell. Let's start with the movie genres:

   |               |   1   |     2      |    3    |    4    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy| Crime     | Mystery | Scientific |

3. Now let's place the music genres. We know that the fan of indie is between the fan of dubstep and the fan of classical. Since indie is in the second position, dubstep must be in the first position and classical in the third position:

   |               |   1   |     2      |    3    |    4    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy| Crime     | Classical| Indie   |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep|           | Classical| Indie   |

4. We know that the fan of house is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. Since scientific is in the fourth position, house must be in the third position:

   |               |   1   |     2      |    3    |    4    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy| Crime     | Classical| House   | Indie   |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep|           | Classical| House   | Indie   |

5. Now we know that the fan of classical is somewhere between the fan of indie and the person watching crime movies. Since classical is in the third position, it must be either in the second or third spot between indie and crime. However, since indie is in the second position, classical must be in the third position between them:

   |               |   1   |     2      |    3    |    4    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy| Crime     | Classical| House   | Indie   |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep| Classical|           | House   | Indie   |

6. Now we can place the remaining music genre, which is mystery. Since the fan of house is on the left of the person watching scientific movies, and house is in the third position, mystery must be in the fourth position:

   |               |   1   |     2      |    3    |    4    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy| Crime     | Classical| House   | Mystery | Indie   |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep| Classical| House   |          | Indie   |

7. Finally, we know that the person watching comedy movies is on the right of the fan of indie. Since indie is in the second position, comedy must be in the first position:

   |               |   1   |     2      |    3    |    4    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy| Crime     | Classical| House   | Mystery | Indie   |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep| Classical| House   |          | Indie   |

So the final solution table is:

Lv7-2x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left or far right. Since there are only 4 people and we have already placed some people, the volleyball player must be in the first or the fourth position. Let's assume the volleyball player is in the first position for now.

2. The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's hobby is writing. If the volleyball player is in the first position, then the golf player must be in the second position, and the writing person in the third position. This leaves the fourth position for the collecting person.

3. We also know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we have placed the volleyball player in the first position, the woodworking person is also in the first position.

4. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. If the volleyball player is in the first position, then the skateboarding person must be in the second position.

5. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. If the skateboarding person is in the second position, then the traveling person must be in the first position. But this contradicts our assumption that the volleyball player is in the first position. So, the volleyball player must be in the fourth position.

6. Now, if the volleyball player is in the fourth position, then the skateboarding person must be in the third position. The traveling person can be in the first position, and the golf player can be in the second position. The writing person must be in the third position, and the collecting person in the fourth position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-2x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is reading can be either on the far left or far right. Let's assume it's on the far left for now (we'll check later if it's on the far right).

2. Since the German is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading (rule 3), the German cannot be on the far left (rule 1). So, the German must be on the far right.

3. Now, the American is somewhere to the left of the Brazilian (rule 2). Since the German is on the far right, the Brazilian cannot be on the far right either. So, the Brazilian must be on the far left.

4. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (rule 3). Since the Brazilian is on the far left, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing cannot be on the far left. So, it must be on the far right.

5. Now, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (rule 8). Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far right, the person who's hobby is drawing must be on the far left.

6. The German is on the left of the Chinese (rule 5). Since the German is on the far right, the Chinese must be on the far left.

7. Now, the only place left for the person who's hobby is reading is the far right. But this would violate rule 3 (German is to the right of the person who's hobby is reading). So, the person who's hobby is reading must be on the far left.

8. Finally, the nationalities and hobbies are assigned as follows:

   |               |       1       |     2     |      3      |    4    |

Lv7-2x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 beverages and 4 nationalities, so each row and each column should have a unique value.

2. From rule 1, we know that the beverages are 7up, almond-milk, mirinda, and sprite. Let's assign them to the rows (1, 2, 3, 4) arbitrarily for now.

3. From rule 2, the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the Indonesian. This means that mirinda must be in column 1 or 2. If mirinda is in column 1, then the Indonesian (sprite) must be in column 3 or 4. But if sprite is in column 4, it would violate rule 5 (the nigerian is between the American and the Dutch, and the Dutch is on the right of the person drinking 7up, which means 7up cannot be in column 4). So, mirinda must be in column 2, and the Indonesian (sprite) must be in column 3.

4. From rule 3, the Dutch is on the right of the person drinking 7up. This means that 7up cannot be in column 1 or 3. So, 7up must be in column 2 or 4. But if 7up is in column 4, it would violate rule 4 (the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking mirinda, which means mirinda cannot be in column 4). So, 7up must be in column 2.

5. From rule 4, the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. This means that the person drinking mirinda must be in column 3 or 4. But if mirinda is in column 4, it would violate rule 1 (each column should have a unique beverage). So, mirinda must be in column 3.

6. From rule 5, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the nigerian. Since mirinda and 7up are already in columns 2 and 3, almond-milk must be in column 1 or 4. But if almond-milk is in column 1, it would violate rule 3 (the Dutch is on the right of the person drinking 7up, which means the Dutch cannot be in column 1). So, almond-milk must be in column 4.

7. From rule 6, the nigerian is somewhere between the American and the Dutch. Since the American cannot be in column 4 (because almond-milk is there), the nigerian must be in column 2. This means the Dutch must be in column 1.

8. From rule 7, the Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the Indonesian is in column 3, the only possible position for sprite (mirinda's right) is column 4.

So, the final solution table is:

2. The person eating grapefruit (G) must be in the second or third column, as the chinese (Cn) is in the second column.

3. The person eating pepper (P) can be in any column, but not the first or the fourth, as per the given conditions. Let's place pepper in the third column for now.

4. The spanish (Sp) must be between the person eating cherry (C) and the person eating orange (O). Since the argentine (A) is eating cherry (C), the spanish (Sp) can only be in the second or fourth column. If the spanish (Sp) were in the second column, it would violate rule 6 (Spanish is on the left or right of the nigerian), so the spanish (Sp) must be in the fourth column. The only remaining food for the spanish (Sp) is orange (O).

5. The nigerian (N) must be to the left of the person eating orange (O). The only possible position for the nigerian (N) is the second column.

6. Now, the only remaining food for the second column is grapefruit (G).

7. The person eating pepper (P) can be in any of the remaining columns, but since it's not on the far left or far right, it must be in the third column.

1. We know that the argentine is not the owner of the rabbit, so we can rule out the first column for the rabbit.

2. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the argentine can't own the rabbit, the horse must be in the second, third, or fourth column.

3. The spanish is the owner of the horse, so the second column must have the horse and the spanish.

4. The colombian is somewhere between the spanish and the american. Since the horse and the spanish are in the second column, the colombian must be in the third column.

5. The argentine is on the left of the American. Since the colombian is in the third column, the argentine must be in the first column.

6. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the horse. Since the horse is in the second column, the rabbit must be in the fourth column.

7. The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the dog. Since the rabbit is in the fourth column, the dog must be in the first column.

1. We know that the engineer is not a fan of classical music. So, we can rule out the first column for the engineer.

2. The scientist is to the right of the engineer. Since the engineer is not in the first column, the scientist cannot be in the first row either.

3. The fan of classical music is either to the left or right of the engineer. Since the engineer is not in the first column, the fan of classical music must be in the second, third, or fourth column.

4. The engineer is to the right of the fan of techno. Since the engineer is not in the first row, the fan of techno must be in the first, second, or third row.

5. The scientist is between the fan of techno and the police-officer. If the fan of techno is in the first row, the scientist cannot be in the second row (because of point 2), so the fan of techno must be in the second or third row. If the fan of techno is in the third row, the scientist would have to be in the fourth row, but that would place the police-officer in the first row, which contradicts point 5 (since the fan of pop is to the right of the fan of r&b, and the only position for the fan of r&b in this case is the first column, first row, which would mean the fan of pop is in the second column, first row, but then the fan of pop would be to the left of the fan of r&b, which contradicts point 6). So, the fan of techno must be in the second row.

6. The fan of pop is to the right of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of techno is in the second row, the fan of r&b must be in the first row.

7. Now we know the fan of r&b is in the first row and the fan of techno is in the second row. The only remaining position for the scientist is the third row.

8. The police-officer must be in the fourth row, and the only remaining job for the fourth column is the security-guard.

Lv7-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the genres are family, satire, thriller, and western. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4, with family being 1.

2. From point 5, we know that the person watching family movies is the owner of the dog. So, we can place the dog in the first row and first column (1,1).

3. From point 6, we know that the person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog. So, the western movies can only be in the second, third, or fourth column. Since the western movies are somewhere between the person watching family movies and the owner of the snake (point 1), the western movies cannot be in the fourth column (4). So, the western movies can be in the second or third column (2 or 3).

4. If the western movies are in the second column (2), then the satire movies must be in the fourth column (4), and the thriller movies must be in the third column (3). But this would mean that the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the owner of the snake (point 4), which contradicts point 1. So, the western movies cannot be in the second column (2).

5. Therefore, the western movies must be in the third column (3). This means the satire movies must be in the fourth column (4), and the thriller movies must be in the second column (2).

6. From point 2, we know that the owner of the rat is not the person watching satire movies. Since the satire movies are in the fourth column (4), the rat cannot be in the fourth row (4).

7. From point 3, we know that the owner of the mouse is not the person watching thriller movies. Since the thriller movies are in the second column (2), the mouse cannot be in the second row (2).

8. Since the dog is in the first row (1), the snake cannot be in the first row (1). So, the snake can only be in the second, third, or fourth row. But the western movies are in the third row (3), so the snake cannot be in the third row (3).

9. If the snake is in the second row (2), then the pet in the first row (1) must be the rat or the mouse. But the person watching satire movies is not the owner of the rat (point 2), so the pet in the first row (1) must be the mouse. This means the snake is in the fourth row (4).

10. Since the dog is in the first row (1), the pet in the second row (2) must be the rat.

11. Since the snake is in the fourth row (4), the pet in the third row (3) must be the rat (since the satire movies are in the fourth column (4), and the owner of the rat is not the person watching satire movies (point 2)). But this would mean that the person watching thriller movies is in the first column (1), which contradicts point 3. So, the snake cannot be in the fourth row (4).

12. Therefore, the snake must be in the third row (3). This means the pet in the fourth row (4) must be the rat.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|   Dog      |   Rat   |   Snake |   Mouse  |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
|   1       |   2     |   3     |   4      |
|   Family   | Satire  | Thriller| Western  |
#############

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
