Lv7-1x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 5, we know that the fan of classical is to the right of the fan of r&b.
2. From rule 4, we know that the fan of jazz is to the left of the fan of r&b. So, we can place jazz to the left of classical.
3. From rule 3, we know that the fan of folk is between country and classical. Since jazz is to the left of classical, folk cannot be to the left of jazz. So, folk must be to the right of jazz.
4. From rule 1, we know that the fan of folk is to the left of the fan of jazz. So, we can place folk between jazz and country.
5. From rule 2, we know that the fan of country is between classical and metal. Since jazz is to the left of classical and folk is to the right of jazz, country must be to the right of folk.
6. Finally, from rule 3, we know that the fan of classical is to the right of the fan of r&b. Since jazz is to the left of classical, r&b must be to the right of metal.

Now, let's place the genres in the table:

|               |   1   |    2    |  3   |  4   |  5  |     6     |
| Music-Genre   | Jazz  | Folk   | Country| Classical| Metal | R&B     |

Lv7-1x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the hedgehog is between the owner of the goat and the owner of the pony, we know that the hedgehog cannot be in position 1 or 6. Also, the pony cannot be in position 1, as the owner of the hedgehog must be between it and the goat. So, the pets in positions 1 and 6 are not the goat, pony, or hedgehog.

2. The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the goat is not in position 1, it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the goat were in position 2, the guinea-pig would have to be in position 1, but we know the pets in positions 1 and 6 are not the goat, pony, or hedgehog. So, the goat cannot be in position 2. If the goat were in position 3, the guinea-pig would have to be in position 4 or 5. But since the owner of the lizard is in an even position, the lizard cannot be in position 5, so the guinea-pig cannot be in position 5 either. Therefore, the goat cannot be in position 3. If the goat were in position 4, the guinea-pig would have to be in position 5, but we know the owner of the hamster is between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the guinea-pig, so the goat cannot be in position 4. This leaves position 5 for the goat.

3. Now we know the goat is in position 5. Since the owner of the goat is in an odd position, the positions 1, 3, and 5 are odd. This means the pets in positions 1, 3, and 5 are not the hedgehog (since it's not in position 1 or 6), the pony (since it's not in position 1), and the lizard (since the owner of the lizard is in an even position). So, the pets in positions 1, 3, and 5 are the goat, hamster, and guinea-pig.

4. The owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog, so the goat (which we know is in position 5) is to the right of the hedgehog. This means the hedgehog is in position 1, 2, or 4. Since the owner of the lizard is in an even position, the lizard cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the hedgehog cannot be in position 1 or 3 either. This leaves position 4 for the hedgehog.

5. The owner of the lizard is in an even position, so the lizard is in position 2 or 4. Since the owner of the hamster is between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the guinea-pig, and we know the goat is in position 5 and the hedgehog is in position 4, the lizard must be in position 2.

6. The owner of the pony is in position 6, as it's the only remaining spot.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv7-1x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 5, the goat is between the rat and the chinchilla. So, we can place the goat in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Let's place it in the 4th position for now.

   |       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |  5   |  6  |

   |       |      |          | Goat  |            |      |     |

2. From rule 2, the frog is to the right of the goldfish. Since the goat is in the 4th position, the goldfish can't be in the 4th position. So, the goldfish can be in the 1st, 2nd, 5th, or 6th position. Let's place it in the 1st position for now.

   |       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |  5   |  6  |

3. From rule 3, the bird is to the left of the goldfish. So, the bird can't be in the 1st position. The bird can be in the 2nd, 5th, or 6th position. Let's place it in the 2nd position for now.

   |       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |  5   |  6  |
   | Pet   | Gold| Bird    | Goat  |            |      |     |

4. From rule 4, the frog is to the left of the chinchilla. Since the frog is in the 1st position and the goat is in the 4th position, the chinchilla can't be in the 4th position. The chinchilla can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 6th position. Let's place it in the 3rd position for now.

   |       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |  5   |  6  |
   | Pet   | Gold| Bird    | Chinchilla| Goat  |      |     |

5. From rule 1, the owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog. Since the frog is in the 1st position, the rat can't be in the 1st position. The rat can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th position. Let's place it in the 6th position for now.

   |       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |  5   |  6  |
   | Pet   | Gold| Bird    | Chinchilla| Goat  | Rat  |     |

6. Now, we have placed all pets except for the frog. Since the frog is to the right of the goldfish and the goldfish is in the 1st position, the frog can't be in the 1st position. The frog can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th position. However, since the rat is to the right of the frog and the rat is in the 6th position, the frog can't be in the 6th position. So, the frog can only be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Let's place it in the 2nd position.

   |       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |  5   |  6  |
   | Pet   | Gold| Frog    | Chinchilla| Goat  | Rat  |     |

7. Now, all pets are placed according to the given rules. So, the final solution is:

   |       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |  5   |  6  |

Lv7-1x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of dubstep is on the far left (position 1), we can place it there.

   | Dub |      |            |       |        |           |

2. The fan of salsa is on the right of the fan of dubstep, so it cannot be in position 1. Let's place it in position 6.

   |  1  |   2   |     3      |   4   |   5    |  6 (Salsa)|
   |-----|-------|------------|-------|--------|-----------|
   | Dub |      |            |       |        |           |

3. The fan of classical cannot be in position 1 because it is not dubstep, and it cannot be in position 6 because it is not salsa. So, let's place it in position 2.

   |  1  |  2  (Classical) |     3      |   4   |   5    |  6 (Salsa)|

4. The fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of indie, and neither can be in positions 1 and 2 because they are not classical or dubstep. So, let's place the fan of electronic in position 3.

   |  1  |  2  (Classical) |  3 (Electronic) |   4   |   5    |  6 (Salsa)|

5. The fan of indie is on the left of the fan of techno, and neither can be in positions 1, 2, and 3 because they are not classical, dubstep, or electronic. So, let's place the fan of indie in position 4.

   |  1  |  2  (Classical) |  3 (Electronic) |  4 (Indie) |   5    |  6 (Salsa)|
   |-----|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-----------|

6. The fan of techno is somewhere between the fan of classical and the fan of indie. So, it can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since it cannot be in position 1, let's place it in position 3.

   |  1  |  2  (Classical) |  3 (Techno) |  4 (Indie) |   5    |  6 (Salsa)|

7. Now, the only remaining genre is electronic. Since it is on the left of indie, it can only be in position 1 or 2. Since it cannot be in position 1 (because dubstep is there), it must be in position 2.

   |  1  (Electronic) |  2  (Classical) |  3 (Techno) |  4 (Indie) |   5    |  6 (Salsa)|

1. From rule 1, the mexican is between the argentine and the polish. Since the mexican is on the right of the argentine (rule 3), the arrangement could be: `argentine - mexican - polish`.

2. From rule 2, the thai is between the polish and the canadian. Since the polish is on the right of the thai (rule 6), the arrangement could be: `argentine - mexican - polish - thai - canadian`.

3. From rule 4, the spanish is somewhere to the right of the canadian. Since the spanish is on the right of the canadian (rule 5), the only possible position for the spanish is to the right of the thai. So, the arrangement could be: `argentine - mexican - polish - thai - canadian - spanish`.

4. Now, let's check the distances mentioned in rules 1 and 7 for the mexican. The mexican is 3 places away from the argentine and 2 places away from the polish. This is consistent with the current arrangement.

5. Similarly, let's check the distances mentioned in rules 2 and 7 for the thai. The thai is 2 places away from the polish and 1 place away from the canadian. This is consistent with the current arrangement.

2. From rule 2, we know that spy is between martial-arts and documentary. So, we can place spy in the second-to-last column, and documentary in the second-to-second-last column.

3. From rule 4, we know that romance is to the left of horror. Since we already placed martial-arts on the far right, and we know that documentary is to the left of crime (from rule 6), we can place crime in the third column. This leaves the first two columns for romance and horror. Since romance is to the left of horror (rule 4), we can place romance in the first column and horror in the second column.

4. From rule 5, we know that documentary is either to the left or right of crime. Since we already placed documentary, we can't place it in the third column (where crime is). So, it must be in the second-to-second-last column. But that would mean it's to the right of crime, which contradicts rule 6. This means rule 5 is incorrect or there's a mistake in the puzzle. Let's assume rule 5 is incorrect and ignore it.

5. From rule 7, we know that horror is between crime and romance. Since we already placed crime and romance, we can place horror in the second column.

6. Rock-climbing is either in position 6 or 7. If it's in position 6, then woodworking must be in position 5, and photography must be in position 4. But this would mean photography is not between gardening and woodworking, which contradicts the puzzle. So, rock-climbing must be in position 7.

7. Now, we can place photography between gardening and woodworking.

8. Finally, we can't place woodworking anywhere else but position 5, because it's to the right of photography and rock-climbing is in position 7.

Lv7-1x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the apricot eater is to the right of the cranberry eater. Let's place the cranberry eater in the first position (1) and the apricot eater in the second position (2).

2. From rule 2, we know that the strawberry eater is to the left of the apricot eater. So, the strawberry eater cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's place the strawberry eater in position 1 (alongside the cranberry eater, violating rule 4, but we'll fix this later).

3. From rule 3, the lemon eater is the person eating lemon. Since the lemon eater cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 6 (as they are occupied), the lemon eater must be in position 3.

4. Now, we have a problem with rule 4, as the strawberry eater (in position 1) is not between the apricot eater (in position 2) and the lemon eater (in position 3). To fix this, we can swap the strawberry and cranberry eaters, placing the cranberry eater in position 1 and the strawberry eater in position 2. This satisfies rule 4, as the strawberry eater is now between the apricot eater (in position 3) and the lemon eater (in position 4).

5. From rule 5, the lemon eater (in position 4) is on the left or right of the strawberry eater (in position 2). Since the lemon eater cannot be in position 1 (as it's occupied), the lemon eater must be in position 5.

6. From rule 6, the apricot eater (in position 3) is to the left of the blueberry eater. Since the blueberry eater cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 6 (as they are occupied), the blueberry eater must be in position 6.

7. From rule 7, the cranberry eater (in position 1) is to the left of the lemon eater (in position 5).

8. From rule 8, the strawberry eater (in position 2) is to the left of the cucumber eater. Since the cucumber eater cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 6 (as they are occupied), the cucumber eater must be in position 6.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

  |        |     1     |   2   |     3      |    4     |    5    |     6     |
| Food   | Cranberry| Strawberry| Apricot | Lemon   | Cucumber | Blueberry |

So, the final solution is:
