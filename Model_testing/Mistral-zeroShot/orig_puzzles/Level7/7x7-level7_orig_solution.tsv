Since the fan of folk is in position 8 and the fan of d&b is in position 11, the person who's hobby is camping is in position 9, 10, or 11. However, the person who's hobby is camping is also the owner of the turtle (rule 32), and there's no turtle in positions 9, 10, or 11. This means the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 8.
82. From rule 101, the chef is the owner of the pony. Since the chef is in position 4, the owner of the pony is in position 4.
83. From rule 102, the owner of the ferret is the fan of ambient. Since the fan of ambient is in position 11, the owner of the ferret is in position 11.
84. From rule 103, the chef is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking lemonade is in position 10, the chef is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. However, the chef is also the owner of the pony ("
Lv7-7x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it requires a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 7 items for each category, so we can label them from 1 to 7.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the bike is on the left of the person watching mystery movies (rule 1), and the person watching mystery movies can't be the person drinking hot-chocolate (rule 28), the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1 or 7. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

3. From rule 2, we know that the French is somewhere to the left of the person eating cucumber (position 5). Since the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be French (as it's in position 1), the French must be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the French is in position 2 for now.

4. From rule 3, we know that the person eating plum is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person who's hobby is drawing (positions 6 and 7). Since the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be the person eating plum (as it's in position 1), the person eating plum must be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume the person eating plum is in position 3 for now.

5. From rule 4, we know that the person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (position 6). Since the French is in position 2 and the person eating plum is in position 3, the person eating cucumber must be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume the person eating cucumber is in position 4 for now.

6. From rule 5, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is in an odd position. Since the French is in position 2, the person who's hobby is sudoku can't be in positions 2, 4, or 6. So, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 5 for now.

7. From rule 6, we know that the Argentine is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1 and the French is in position 2, the Argentine can't be in positions 1 or 2. So, the Argentine must be in positions 3, 5, or 7. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 5, the Argentine can't be in position 5. So, the Argentine must be in position 3 or 7. Let's assume the Argentine is in position 7 for now.

8. From rule 7, we know that the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person driving the bike. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1 and the French is in position 2, the owner of the frog can't be in positions 1 or 2. So, the owner of the frog must be in positions 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since the Argentine is in position 7, the owner of the frog can't be in position 7. So, the owner of the frog must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the owner of the frog is in position 4 for now.

9. From rule 8, we know that the owner of the frog is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 5, the person who's hobby is board-games must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. Since the owner of the frog is in position 4, the person who's hobby is board-games can't be in position 4. So, the person who's hobby is board-games must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6. Let's assume the person who's hobby is board-games is in position 1 for now.

10. Continuing this process, we can fill in the rest of the table. However, it's important to note that this is a complex puzzle with many constraints, and it's possible that multiple solutions exist. Here's one possible solution:

Lv7-7x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. We know there are 7 items in each category, so we can label the columns and rows with the items from each category. For example, we can label the first column with the food items, the second column with the hobbies, and so on.

2. Let's start with the given information that the fan of country is in the middle. Since there are 7 items, the middle position is the 4th. So, we can place the fan of country in the 4th row and 2nd column (since the hobbies are in the 2nd column).

3. The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse. Since the horse is in an odd position (5th or 1st), the guinea-pig owner is in an even position (2nd, 4th, or 6th). But the owner of the horse is in an odd position (5th), so the guinea-pig owner is in the 6th position. The horse owner is in the 1st position.

4. The person eating watermelon is on the left of the fan of soul. Since the fan of soul is in the 4th row, the watermelon eater is in the 3rd row.

5. The fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since camping is in the 5th column, the fan of soul is in the 6th column.

6. The owner of the horse is in an odd position. We already know it's in the 1st position.

7. The fan of soul is somewhere to the left of the thai. Since the thai is not in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th column (due to other clues), the fan of soul must be in the 2nd column. But we already placed the fan of soul in the 6th column, which is a contradiction. This means our initial placement of the fan of soul was incorrect. Let's assume the fan of soul is in the 2nd row and 6th column instead.

8. The russian is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since baseball is in the 7th column, the russian is in one of the first 6 columns. But the russian is not the person eating kale (6th column), so the russian is in one of the first 5 columns.

9. The pilot is somewhere between the russian and the person eating pineapple. Since the russian is in one of the first 5 columns and the pineapple eater is in the 5th column, the pilot must be in the 4th column.

10. The lawyer is on the left of the person eating mango. Since the mango eater is in the 6th column, the lawyer is in one of the first 5 columns. But the lawyer is not the person who's hobby is chess (1st column), so the lawyer is in one of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th columns.

11. The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the right of the fan of metal. Since the fan of metal is in the 5th row, the surfer is in the 6th row.

12. We can continue this process to place the remaining items. However, it's important to note that there are multiple possible solutions due to the ambiguity in some clues (e.g., the fan of soul could be in the 2nd or 6th column, the russian could be in any of the first 5 columns, etc.). Here's one possible solution:

Lv7-7x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the positions of some elements based on the given information:
1. The person eating orange is on the far left (position 1) and the person eating artichoke is to the left of the person driving the bike (position 5). So, the person driving the bike is not in positions 1 or 5.
2. The person eating asparagus is in the middle (position 3).
3. The person driving the van is on the far left (position 1).
4. The owner of the hedgehog is the person drinking water (position 6).
5. The owner of the frog is somewhere between the person driving the bus and the person who's sport is biathlon (position 5). Since the van is on the far left, the bus must be in position 2. So, the person driving the bus is in position 2, and the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 6 or 7.
6. The person watching comedy movies is not the fan of ambient (position 4), so comedy movies can't be in position 4.
7. The person who's sport is rowing is the person drinking fanta (position 4).
8. The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person driving the motorbike (position 5).
9. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the motorbike (position 4).
10. The person drinking 7up is not the person who's sport is snowboarding, so 7up can't be in position 6.
11. The fan of r&b is on the left or right of the person eating papaya (position 5).
12. The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the left of the person eating artichoke (position 3).
13. The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the fan of trance (position 4).
14. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the motorbike (position 4).
15. The person drinking 7up is not the person who's sport is biathlon (position 6 or 7), so 7up can't be in position 6.
16. The person eating potato is on the right of the person watching musical movies. Since musical movies can't be in position 4 (the fan of ambient is there), musical movies can't be in position 2 either (as the person driving the bus is there). So, musical movies must be in position 1 or 3. If musical movies are in position 1, then potato is in position 7. If musical movies are in position 3, then potato is in position 5.
17. The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee (position 2 or 4).
18. The fan of disco is on the left or right of the person eating banana (position 2 or 4).
19. The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person driving the bus (position 2).

Step 2: Use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table:

Since we know the positions of some elements, we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table. This process may require multiple iterations and backtracking, but here's a possible solution:

| Beverage      | almond-milk | coffee   | iced-tea | 7up       | fanta      | sprite     | water     |
| Food          | asparagus   | artichoke| potato   | banana    | papaya     | orange     | zucchini  |
| Movie-Genre   | comedy      | romance  | thriller | crime     | musical    | sports     | epic      |
| Music-Genre   | ambient    | disco    | trance   | r&b       | pop        | rock       | house     |
| Pet           | chinchilla  | rat      | turtle   | frog      | hedgehog   | snake      | goldfish  |
| Sport         | rowing     | volleyball| sailing  | biathlon  | water-polo | rugby      | -         |
| Transport     | bike       | car      | motorbike| skateboard| trike      | bus        | van       |

The final solution table is:
