Lv7-2x3-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the rat is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the owner of the ferret. This means that the rat cannot be with the ferret or the drama, so it must be with the mystery or the third (unknown) movie-genre.

2. The owner of the bird is to the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the rat is not the ferret owner, the bird cannot be to the left of the rat. This means the bird must be to the right of the mystery or the third (unknown) movie-genre.

3. The person watching mystery movies is to the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the bird is to the right of the mystery, the ferret cannot be the mystery owner. This means the ferret must be with the drama or the third (unknown) movie-genre.

Now let's put this information into a table:

|               |    1    |    2    |   3   |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama  | Mystery| Western|
| Pet           |         |         |       |

From point 1, the rat cannot be with the drama, so it must be with the western or the third (unknown) movie-genre.

From point 2, the bird cannot be to the left of the ferret, so the ferret cannot be with the western (since the bird is to the right of the mystery and the mystery is to the right of the ferret). This means the ferret must be with the drama.

From point 3, the mystery cannot be with the ferret (since the person watching mystery is to the right of the ferret), so the mystery must be with the western or the third (unknown) movie-genre.

Since we know the rat cannot be with the drama (from point 1), and the ferret is with the drama (from the previous step), the rat must be with the western or the third (unknown) movie-genre.

However, since the bird is to the right of the mystery (from point 2) and the mystery is to the right of the ferret (from point 3), the bird must be to the right of the ferret and the mystery. This means the bird cannot be with the western (since the rat is to the right of the western, and the rat is to the left of the bird).

Therefore, the only possible solution is that the bird is with the third (unknown) movie-genre, the ferret is with the drama, and the rat is with the western.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |    1    |    2    |   3   |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama  | Mystery| Western|
| Pet           | Bird   | Ferret | Rat    |

Lv7-2x3-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and they are in different positions, the positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3 from left to right. The person driving the subway is in an odd position, so it can't be 1 or 2. Therefore, the subway driver is in position 3.

2. The fan of country is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the person driving the tram. Since the subway driver is the third person and is the one driving the subway, the tram driver must be the second person. So, the reggae fan is in position 1 and the tram driver (who is also a fan of a music genre) is in position 2.

3. The person driving the subway is on the far right, which we already know is position 3.

Now, let's put the information into a table:

|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae    | Tram    | Country|
| Transport     |           | Tram    | Subway |

However, we don't know the exact transport for the first person. Since we know the positions of the subway driver and the tram driver, the only way to satisfy the puzzle's conditions is if the first person is using a van. So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae    | Tram    | Country|
| Transport     | Van       | Tram    | Subway |
#############"
Lv7-2x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and 3 items for each category (beverages and transport), we can assign each item in one category to each person in the other category.

2. Let's start with the transport. We know that the subway driver is somewhere between the coffee drinker and the roller driver. This means that the subway driver cannot be in the first or the third position in the transport column. So, the possible positions for the subway driver are 2 (between coffee and roller) or 3 (after roller and before coffee).

3. The train driver is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda is not in the first position, the train driver cannot be in the first position either. So, the possible positions for the train driver are 2 (between roller and coffee) or 3 (after coffee and before mirinda).

4. Now, let's consider the positions for mirinda. Since the train driver is not in the first position, mirinda cannot be in the first position either. So, the possible positions for mirinda are 2 or 3.

5. If mirinda is in the second position, then the only possible position for the subway driver is 3 (after mirinda and before coffee), and the only possible position for the train driver is 2 (between roller and coffee). This results in the following table:

   | Beverage    |   1    |    2    |   3    |
   | Transport   |        |         |        |
   |------------|--------|---------|--------|
   | coffee     |        | mirinda |        |
   | subway     |       X |        | coffee |
   | train      | roller |        |        |

6. If mirinda is in the third position, then the only possible position for the subway driver is 2 (between coffee and roller), and the only possible position for the train driver is 1 (before mirinda). This results in the following table:

   | Beverage    |   1    |    2    |   3    |
   | Transport   |        |         |        |
   |------------|--------|---------|--------|
   | coffee     | roller |        | mirinda|
   | subway     |        | coffee  |        |
   | train      |        |        | train  |

7. Both of these tables satisfy the given conditions, but only one is valid. To determine the valid one, we need more information. However, based on the given conditions, we can't definitively determine the exact positions of each beverage and transport.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage    |   1    |    2    |   3    |
| Transport   |        |         |        |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| coffee     | roller | mirinda |        |
| subway     |        | coffee  | coffee |
| train      |        |        | train  |

This table represents one possible solution based on the given conditions. However, without more information, we can't definitively determine the exact positions of each beverage and transport."
Lv7-2x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three jobs and three movie genres, so each row and each column should have one unique value.

2. From rule 3, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is to the right of the person watching comedy movies. This means that the Comedy and Time-Travel cells cannot be in the first two columns (1 and 2).

3. From rule 1, the project-manager is somewhere between the person watching time-travel movies and the scientist. This means that the Project-Manager cannot be in the first column (1), because if it were, it would have to be the scientist in the second column (2), and that would leave no place for the time-travel movies (3). So, the Project-Manager must be in the third column (3).

4. Now we know the Project-Manager is in the third column (3), and the Comedy and Time-Travel cannot be in the first two columns (1 and 2). The only remaining option for Comedy is the first row (1), and the only remaining option for Time-Travel is the second row (2).

5. From rule 2, the person watching comedy movies is not the project-manager, so the Project-Manager (3, 3) cannot be watching Comedy. This means Comedy must be in the second row (2).

6. Now we know that Comedy is in the second row (2) and the Project-Manager is in the third row (3). The only remaining option for the scientist is the first row (1).

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |     1     |        2        |      3      |

Lv7-2x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 3 different music-genres: disco, hip-hop, salsa, and they use 3 different means of transport: motorbike, quad-bike, skateboard.

2. From point 1.1, we can deduce that each row (Music-Genre and Transport) has one unique item.

3. From point 1.2, we can deduce that each column (Person 1, Person 2, Person 3) has one unique item.

4. Now let's analyze the given information:

   - The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere between the person driving the skateboard and the fan of hip-hop##7. This means that the quad-bike is either to the left or right of both the skateboard and the hip-hop fan, with at least 7 other items in between. Since there are only 3 items in each row, the quad-bike must be in the third column (Person 3).

   - The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the fan of salsa. Since the salsa fan cannot be in the third column (already occupied by the quad-bike), the salsa fan must be in the first column (Person 1). This means the motorbike driver must be in the second column (Person 2).

   - The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike##3. Since the quad-bike is in the third column, the hip-hop fan cannot be in the third column either. The hip-hop fan must be in the first column (Person 1), which means the skateboard driver must be in the second column (Person 2).

5. Now we can fill in the table:

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3     |
   | Music-Genre   | Disco     | Salsa    | Hip-Hop  |

Lv7-2x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three music genres (Blues, Jazz, Reggae) and three nationalities (Colombian, Japanese, Pakistani). We'll use the letters B, J, R for the genres and C, J, P for the nationalities.

2. From point 1, the Colombian is either C1 or C3. If the Colombian is C1, then the Japanese must be J2 (since the Colombian is to the left or right of the Japanese, and the Japanese can't be in C1 due to point 2). In this case, the table would look like this:

   |               |      C1     |     J2     |      R3     |
   | Music-Genre   |   Blues/Jazz/Reggae |   -       |   -        |
   | Nationality   |   Colombian  |   Japanese |   -        |

   But this doesn't satisfy point 4 (Jazz is not between Pakistani and Blues). So, the Colombian must be C3.

3. Now, the Japanese is in C2. The table looks like this:

   |               |      C1     |     C2     |      C3     |
   | Music-Genre   |   Blues/Jazz/Reggae |   -       |   -        |
   | Nationality   |   -          |   Japanese |   Colombian |

4. The fan of Jazz is on the right of the Pakistani, so P must be in either C1 or C2. If P is in C1, then the genre in C1 must be Blues (since it's to the left of Jazz in C2). But this doesn't satisfy point 4 (Jazz is not between Pakistani and Blues). So, P must be in C2.

5. Now, the table looks like this:

   |               |      C1     |     C2     |      C3     |
   | Music-Genre   |   Blues/Jazz/Reggae |   Jazz     |   Reggae   |
   | Nationality   |   -          |   Japanese |   Colombian |

6. The fan of Jazz is somewhere between the Pakistani (C2) and the fan of Blues. Since the genres are in the order Blues, Jazz, Reggae, the only possible arrangement is Blues in C1, Jazz in C2, and Reggae in C3.

7. So, the final solution table is:

  #############
   |               |      C1     |     C2     |      C3     |

Lv7-2x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different pets and three different sports. So, we can assign one pet to each row and one sport to each column. Let's start with the pets.

2. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton, and the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere between the owner of the goat and the person who's sport is badminton, we can deduce that the order of pets from left to right should be: Goat, Badminton, Skateboarding, Rat, Basketball.

3. Now, let's assign sports to the columns. Since the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the rat, the order of pets from top to bottom should be: Rat, Goldfish, Goat, Badminton, Skateboarding.

4. However, we made an assumption about the sports in the second step. Let's check if this assumption is correct. If it is, then the final table will be:

   |         |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Pet     |           |               |            |
   | Sport   | Basketball | Skateboarding  | Badminton   |

   Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton, and the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere between the owner of the goat and the person who's sport is badminton, the order of pets from left to right is correct.

5. Now, let's check the sports. Since the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the rat, the order of pets from top to bottom is correct. Therefore, the final table is correct.

Lv7-2x3-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the western movie watcher is either to the left or right of the doctor. Let's assume the doctor is in the middle for now (since we don't have any other information about their position). This means the western movie watcher could be in positions 1, 3, or both.

2. The mystery movie watcher is between the western movie watcher and the electrician. If the doctor is in the middle, the western movie watcher can't be in position 3 because there's no room for the electrician. So, the western movie watcher must be in position 1. This means the doctor is in position 2.

3. Now, the mystery movie watcher must be to the left of the doctor (since the western movie watcher is to the left of the doctor) and to the right of the western movie watcher. So, the mystery movie watcher must be in position 3.

4. The sports movie watcher is to the right of the doctor. Since the doctor is in position 2 and there's only one position to the right (position 3), the sports movie watcher must be in position 3.

5. Now, the only position left for the electrician is position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv7-2x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the teacher is not the person who's hobby is writing, we can rule out the first row for the teacher. So, the teacher can be either in the second or third row.

2. The manager is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since writing is not in the first row, the manager cannot be in the first row either. So, the manager can be either in the second or third row, and to the right of the person with the hobby of writing.

3. The doctor is somewhere between the manager and the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the manager cannot be in the first row, the doctor also cannot be in the first row. So, the doctor can be either in the second or third row, but below the manager and above the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

4. Now, let's place the doctor. Since the doctor cannot be in the first row, and the manager is to the right of the person with the hobby of writing, the doctor must be in the second row.

5. Now, let's place the manager. The manager is to the right of the person with the hobby of writing, so the manager must be in the third row.

6. Finally, let's place the person with the hobby of writing. Since the manager is in the third row, the person with the hobby of writing must be in the second row.

7. The only hobby left is filmmaking, so it must be in the first row.

2. We also know that the person drinking sprite is somewhere between the person drinking milk and the person who's sport is skiing. This means sprite cannot be in the first column and cannot be in the last column.

3. The person who's sport is tennis is the person drinking milk. So, tennis must be in the row of milk.

4. Now, let's place tennis in the second row (since it can't be in the first row due to sprite's positioning). So, the sport in the first row must be either badminton or skiing.

5. If the first row sport was badminton, then sprite would have to be in the second column, but that would mean coffee is in the first column, which we know is not possible. So, the first row sport must be skiing.

6. Now, we know that the person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking sprite. So, coffee must be in the third column.
