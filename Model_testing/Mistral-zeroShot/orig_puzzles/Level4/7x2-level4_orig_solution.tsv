Lv4-7x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 different items (beverages, hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, sports) and each item has 2 different options. So, there are 6 * 2 = 12 possible positions in the table. However, since we have 7 items and only 6 positions, one item (Transport) will have to be repeated.

2. Let's assign the items to the positions based on the given conditions:

   - We know that the gardener is on the left of the bus driver. So, let's place gardening in the first position and bus in the last position (position 6).
   - The person watching sports movies is on the left of the fan of classical. Since we already placed gardening in the first position, the sports movie fan must be in the second position. So, let's place sports in the second position and sports movie genre in the third position.
   - The person drinking sprite is on the left of the accountant. Since we already placed the sports movie fan in the second position, the sprite drinker must be in the third position. So, let's place sprite in the third position and accountant in the fourth position.
   - The person playing volleyball is in an odd position. Since we already placed the sprite drinker, sports movie fan, gardener, and bus driver, the only odd position left is the fifth position. So, let's place volleyball in the fifth position.
   - We still have 2 items left: classical music and job (engineer). Since we know that the person watching sports movies is on the left of the fan of classical, the classical music fan must be in the sixth position (on the right of the sports movie fan). So, let's place classical in the sixth position.
   - Now, we have only one item left: engineer. Since we have already placed all other items, engineer must be repeated in position 4 (the position of the accountant).

3. Now, let's fill in the remaining items (hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, sports) based on the available positions:

   - Hobby of the person in position 1 (gardener) is gardening. The hobby of the person in position 5 (volleyball player) is camping (since there are only 2 hobbies).
   - Job of the person in position 1 (gardener) is accountant (since the accountant is on the right of the sprite drinker). The job of the person in position 4 (accountant) is engineer (since it's repeated from position 1).
   - Movie-genre of the person in position 2 (sports movie fan) is documentary (since there are only 2 movie genres). The movie-genre of the person in position 3 (bus driver) is sports (since it's the genre of the sports movie fan).
   - Music-genre of the person in position 2 (sports movie fan) is classical (since the classical music fan is on the right of the sports movie fan). The music-genre of the person in position 6 (bus driver) is indie (since it's the genre of the sprite drinker).
   - Sport of the person in position 5 (volleyball player) is swimming (since there are only 2 sports).

4. The final solution table is:

   |               |     1      |       2       |
   | Beverage      | sprite     |   soda       |
   | Hobby         | gardening  |   camping    |
   | Job           | accountant |   engineer   |
   | Movie-Genre   | documentary|   sports     |
   | Music-Genre   | classical  |   indie      |
   | Sport         | swimming   |   volleyball  |
   | Transport     | bus        |   bus        |

   However, since Transport is repeated, the final solution table with unique items is:

   |               |     1      |       2       |
   | Beverage      | sprite     |   soda       |
   | Hobby         | gardening  |   camping    |
   | Job           | accountant |   engineer   |
   | Movie-Genre   | documentary|   sports     |
   | Music-Genre   | classical  |   indie      |
   | Sport         | swimming   |   volleyball  |
   | Transport     | bus        |   taxi       |

   (We replaced the second bus with taxi to make the Transport column unique.)

So, the final solution table is:

   |               |     1      |       2       |
   | Beverage      | sprite     |   soda       |
   | Hobby         | gardening  |   camping    |
   | Job           | accountant |   engineer   |
   | Movie-Genre   | documentary|   sports     |
   | Music-Genre   | classical  |   indie      |
   | Sport         | swimming   |   volleyball  |
   | Transport     | bus        |   taxi       |

   (The solution table with repeated Transport is:

   |               |     1      |       2       |
   | Beverage      | sprite     |   soda       |
   | Hobby         | gardening  |   camping    |
   | Job           | accountant |   engineer   |
   | Movie-Genre   | documentary|   sports     |
   | Music-Genre   | classical  |   indie      |
   | Sport         | swimming   |   volleyball  |
   | Transport     | bus        |   bus        |
   )"
Lv4-7x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 items and we have 2 of each, that means each item will be repeated twice. So, the table will have a symmetry, either horizontal or vertical. Let's assume horizontal symmetry for now.

2. From point 1.##3, the person watching adventure movies is either in position 1 or 6. Since the table has symmetry, if position 1 is adventure, then position 6 will be the other repeated item, which is also adventure. So, let's place adventure in position 1.

3. From point 2, the owner of the rat is to the left of the person eating strawberry. Since we know the position of adventure, we can place strawberry to the right of adventure. Let's place strawberry in position 2. Now, the rat owner must be in position 3.

4. From point 4, the Turkish is to the left of the manager. Since we know the positions of adventure, strawberry, and rat, the Turkish can only be in position 4, and the manager must be in position 5.

5. From point 5, the person drinking cola is in an even position. Since we know the positions of adventure, strawberry, rat, Turkish, and manager, cola can only be in position 6.

6. From point 3.##4, the person watching romance movies is in an odd position. Since we know the positions of adventure, strawberry, rat, Turkish, manager, and cola, romance can only be in position 3.

7. From point 6, the person driving the van is to the left of the person driving the ship. Since we know the positions of adventure, strawberry, rat, Turkish, manager, cola, and romance, the van driver can only be in position 5, and the ship driver must be in position 4.

Now, let's check the consistency of the answers:
- Beverage: Cola, Cola
- Food: Avocado, Strawberry
- Job: Manager, Police-Officer
- Movie-Genre: Adventure, Romance
- Nationality: Thai, Turkish
- Pet: Cat, Rat
- Transport: Ship, Van

The table is consistent, so the final solution is:

```
#############
| Adventure | Avocado | Manager |
| Strawberry|         |         |
|           | Rat     |         |
|           |         | Turkish |
|           |         |         |
| Ship       |         |         |
| Van        | Cola    | Police-Officer |
#############
```

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv4-7x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 items (beverages, hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, pets, sports, and transport) and 2 of each. So, we can fill in the first row with the unique items:

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Coffee     | Water     |

   | Sport         | Cycling    | Rowing    |
   | Transport     | Car        | Snowmobile |

2. From point 1, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. So, Rowing must be in column 2 and Video-games in column 1.

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Coffee     | Water     |

3. The owner of the hamster is in an odd position. The only odd position left is the first row (Beverage). So, Hamster must be in the first row.

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Hamster    | Water     |

   | Sport         | Cycling    | Rowing    |
   | Transport     | Car        | Snowmobile |

4. The paramedic is on the left or right of the journalist. Since the paramedic is already in the second row, the journalist must be in the first row.

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Hamster    | Water     |
   | Hobby         | Reading    | Video-games|
   | Job           | Journalist | Paramedic  |

   | Transport     | Car        | Snowmobile |

5. The paramedic is on the left of the person driving the car. Since the paramedic is in the second row, the car must be in the first row.

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Hamster    | Water     |

   | Sport         | Car        | Rowing    |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile |          |

6. Now we have only one item left (Snowmobile). It must be in the last row.

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Hamster    | Water     |

Lv4-7x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all positions are even or odd, let's assign even numbers to the rows and odd numbers to the columns.

2. The fan of r&b is in position 4 (even), so r&b must be in the even-numbered row (Row 2 or Row 4). Let's assume r&b is in Row 2 for now.

3. The person who's sport is volleyball is in position 4 (even), so volleyball must be in the even-numbered column (Column 2 or Column 4). Let's assume volleyball is in Column 2 for now.

4. The owner of the bird is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since the bird owner is in an even position (from point 1), and the person driving the boat is in an odd position (from point 4), the bird must be in Row 1 or Row 3, and the boat must be in Row 2 or Row 4. Let's assume the bird is in Row 1 and the boat is in Row 4 for now.

5. The person who's sport is volleyball is the person watching action movies (point 6). Since volleyball is in Column 2, action movies must be in Column 1 or Column 3. Let's assume action movies are in Column 1 for now.

6. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since video-games is in Column 2 (from point 3), card-games must be in Column 3 or Column 4. Let's assume card-games are in Column 3 for now.

7. We know that there are 2 different beverages: lemonade, soy-milk. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in an odd position (from point 4), the only remaining odd position is Row 1. So, lemonade must be in Row 2 or Row 4. Since the fan of r&b is in Row 2 (from point 2), lemonade must be in Row 4.

8. The only remaining music-genre is soul, so it must be in Column 4.

9. The only remaining pet is guinea-pig, so it must be in Row 3.

10. The only remaining sport is swimming, so it must be in Column 2.

11. The only remaining means of transport is a van, so it must be in Row 3.

Final solution table:

Lv4-7x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 jobs, 2 movie-genres, 2 music-genres, 2 nationalities, 2 pets, 2 sports, and 2 types of transport, we can place one of each in each row.

2. From point 1, we have the following possibilities for each row:

   | Job | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Sport | Transport |
   |-----|------------|------------|------------|-----|--------|-----------|
   | A  | M1         | M2          | N1         | P1  | S1     | T1        |
   | B  | M3         | M4          | N2         | P2  | S2     | T2        |

   (A and B represent the two jobs, M1, M2, M3, M4 are the movie-genres, N1, N2 are the nationalities, P1, P2 are the pets, S1, S2 are the sports, and T1, T2 are the types of transport.)

3. From point 2, we know that the lizard owner is on the right of the Russian. So, the pet column can't have the following arrangement: P1-P2 or P2-P1. Let's assume P1 is on the right of P2.

   | Job | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Sport | Transport |
   |-----|------------|------------|------------|-----|--------|-----------|
   | A  | M1         | M2          | N1         | P2  | S1     | T1        |
   | B  | M3         | M4          | N2         | P1  | S2     | T2        |

4. From point 3, the person watching romance movies is in an odd position. Since there are 6 positions and the first and sixth are already filled, the romance movie-genre must be in the 3rd or 5th position. However, if it's in the 3rd position, it would violate point 6 (the fisherman is on the far right), so it must be in the 5th position.

   | Job | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Sport | Transport |

5. From point 4, the person driving the car is the person watching mystery movies. So, the car is in the row of the person watching mystery movies.

   | Job | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Sport | Transport |
   |-----|------------|------------|------------|-----|--------|-----------|
   | A  | M1         | M2          | N1         | P2  | S1     | T1 (X)    |

   (X denotes the car.)

6. From point 5, the fisherman is on the far right. Since the car is already on the far right of the table, the fisherman must be in the first position.

   | Job | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Sport | Transport |
   |-----|------------|------------|------------|-----|--------|-----------|

   (X denotes the helicopter.)

7. From point 6, the British is the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the first position is already filled, the British must be in the second position.

   | Job | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Sport | Transport |
   |-----|------------|------------|------------|-----|--------|-----------|
   | A  | M1         | M2          | N1         | P2  | S1     | T1        |

8. From point 5, the fan of rock is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the British is in the second position and his sport is volleyball, the fan of rock must be in the first or sixth position. However, if it's in the first position, it would violate point 3 (the lizard owner is on the right of the Russian), so it must be in the sixth position.

   (R denotes rock.)

9. From point 8, the only remaining sport is skateboarding. Since the fan of rock is in the sixth position, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in the fifth position.

   (C denotes the job of the person who's sport is skateboarding, and H denotes the helicopter.)

10. From point 5, the fisherman is on the far right. Since all positions are already filled, the fisherman must be in the third position.

    (F denotes the job of the person who is left.)

11. From point 5, the fan of gospel is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is in the fifth position, the fan of gospel must be in the first or sixth position. However, if it's in the first position, it would violate point 3 (the lizard owner is on the right of the Russian), so it must be in the sixth position.

12. From point 3, the lizard owner is on the right of the Russian. Since the Russian is in the second position and the lizard owner is in the sixth position, the Russian must be in the fourth position.

Lv4-7x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different types of food, 2 jobs, 2 movie-genres, 2 music-genres, 2 nationalities, 2 sports, and 2 means of transport, we can place one of each in each row.

2. From the given conditions, we know that the firefighter is not in the first position (because the firefighter is on the right of the fan of pop, and the first position is on the left). So, the firefighter must be in the second row.

3. Since the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person watching action movies, the spy movie can't be in the first column (because the first row is on the left). So, the spy movie must be in the second column. This means the action movie is in the first column.

4. Now, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is in an even position. Since the first row is odd and the second row is even, the jet-ski must be in the second row.

5. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the first column has the action movie (which doesn't help us because we don't know the sport yet), the kiwi must be in the second column. This means the avocado is in the first column.

6. The spanish is on the left of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is in the second row, the spanish must be in the first row.

7. Now, we know the nationality of the first row, so we can place the sport and the food there. Since the spanish can't eat avocado (because the avocado is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing, and the spanish is on the left), the spanish must eat kiwi. Since the spanish can't do climbing (because the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing, and the spanish is on the left), the spanish must do skateboarding.

8. Now, we know the food and the sport of the first row, so we can place the movie-genre and the music-genre there. Since the spanish can't watch action movies (because the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person watching action movies, and the spanish is on the left), the spanish must watch spy movies. Since the spanish can't listen to pop (because the firefighter is on the right of the fan of pop, and the firefighter is in the second row), the spanish must listen to salsa.

9. Now, we know the movie-genre and the music-genre of the first row, so we can place the sport and the means of transport there. Since the spanish can't do skateboarding (because the person driving the jet-ski is in an even position, and the first row is odd), the spanish must drive the jet-ski. Since the spanish can't do climbing (because the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing, and the spanish is on the left), the first row must have a different sport. Let's say the first row has climbing.

10. Now, we know the sport of the first row, so we can place the food and the means of transport there. Since the first row has climbing, the first row must have avocado (because the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing, and the spanish is on the left). Since the first row has the jet-ski, the second row must have skateboard (because the person driving the jet-ski is in an even position, and the second row is even).

Here is the final solution table:

|               |      Avocado      |        Kiwi       |

Lv4-7x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 items (beverage, food, hobby, movie-genre, nationality, pet, transport) and 2 of each. So, we can fill in the first row with the repeated items:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Juice        |  Milk     |
   | Food          | Corn         |  Pear     |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing|  Traveling |
   | Movie-Genre   | Animation    |  Satire   |
   | Nationality   | American     |  Dutch    |
   | Pet           | Frog         |  Guinea-pig|
   | Transport     | Snowmobile   |  Tram     |

2. From rule 1, the person watching animation movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. So, Animation must be in column 2 and Satire in column 1.

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Juice        |  Milk     |
   | Food          | Corn         |  Pear     |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing|  Traveling |
   | Movie-Genre   | Satire      |  Animation |
   | Nationality   | American     |  Dutch    |
   | Pet           | Frog         |  Guinea-pig|
   | Transport     | Snowmobile   |  Tram     |

3. From rule 2, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person drinking juice. Since we already know the position of the guinea-pig, we can deduce that the person drinking juice must be in column 1. So, Juice must be in row 1 and Milk in row 2.

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Juice        |  Milk     |
   | Food          | Corn         |  Pear     |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing|  Traveling |
   | Movie-Genre   | Satire      |  Animation |
   | Nationality   | American     |  Dutch    |
   | Pet           | Frog         |  Guinea-pig|
   | Transport     | Snowmobile   |  Tram     |

4. From rule 4, the person eating pear is in an odd position. Since we already know the positions of Juice, Satire, American, and Guinea-pig, the only remaining odd position is the position of Pear. So, Pear must be in row 3.

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Juice        |  Milk     |
   | Food          | Corn         | Pear      |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing|  Traveling |
   | Movie-Genre   | Satire      |  Animation |
   | Nationality   | American     |  Dutch    |
   | Pet           | Frog         |  Guinea-pig|
   | Transport     | Snowmobile   |  Tram     |

5. From rule 5, the person driving the tram is in an odd position. Since we already know the positions of Juice, Satire, American, Pear, and Guinea-pig, the only remaining odd position is the position of the tram. So, the tram must be in row 3.

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Juice        |  Milk     |
   | Food          | Corn         | Pear      |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing|  Traveling |
   | Movie-Genre   | Satire      |  Animation |
   | Nationality   | American     |  Dutch    |
   | Pet           | Frog         |  Guinea-pig|
   | Transport     | Tram         | Snowmobile|

Now, we have filled all the positions according to the given rules. The final solution table is:

Lv4-7x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different hobbies, 2 different jobs, 2 different movie-genres, 2 different music-genres, and 2 different pets, we know that each row and each column will have exactly one unique item.

2. Let's start with the Beverage column. Since there are 2 different beverages, we can fill the first row with 7up and the second row with juice.

3. Now let's fill the Food column. Since the person eating broccoli is on the right of the librarian, the librarian cannot be in the first column. So, let's place the librarian in the second column, and the broccoli in the first row (since the person eating broccoli must be in the first or second row due to the odd position rule for mystery movies). Now, the only remaining food is pepper, so it goes in the second row, first column.

4. Let's fill the Hobby column. The person with the hobby of sudoku is on the left of the person drinking 7up, so the 7up cannot be in the second row. Therefore, 7up goes in the first row, and sudoku goes in the first column. The only remaining hobby is singing, so it goes in the second column, second row.

5. Now let's fill the Job column. Since the electrician cannot be in the second row (because the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku, and 7up is in the first row), the electrician goes in the first row, first column. The only remaining job is librarian, so it goes in the second row, second column.

6. Let's fill the Movie-Genre column. Since the person watching mystery movies is in an odd position, it must be in the first row or the third column. However, the first row is filled, so the mystery movies are in the third column, first row. The only remaining movie-genre is fantasy, so it goes in the second row, second column.

7. Now let's fill the Music-Genre column. Since the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the fan of soul, the chinchilla cannot be in the second column. Therefore, the chinchilla goes in the first column, first row. The only remaining music-genre is rock, so it goes in the second column, second row.

8. Finally, let's fill the Pet column. The only remaining pet is a pony, so it goes in the second column, first row.

The final solution table is:

```

Lv4-7x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different types of food, 2 different hobbies, 2 different jobs, 2 different music-genres, 2 different nationalities, 2 different pets, and 2 different sports, we can fill the first row with the unique items for each category. Let's start with the Food column:

   |               |      1      |      2      |
   | Food          | Tomato     | Zucchini   |

2. Now let's fill the second row with the unique items for the Hobby column:

   |               |      1      |      2      |
   | Food          | Tomato     | Zucchini   |
   | Hobby         | Card-games | Video-games|

3. Next, let's fill the third row with the unique items for the Job column:

   |               |      1      |      2      |
   | Food          | Tomato     | Zucchini   |
   | Hobby         | Card-games | Video-games|
   | Job           | Dressmaker  | Electrician |

4. Now we know the Dutch is in an odd position, so the Dutch cannot be in the first row (position 1) or the third row (position 3). Since there are only two nationalities, the Dutch must be in the second row. However, the second row is already filled, so the Dutch must be in the first row, which contradicts the given information. There seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently stated.

Assuming the puzzle is corrected, we can continue:

5. The fan of r&b is on the left of the dressmaker, so the r&b must be in the first column (position 1). Since there are only two music-genres, the other music-genre (dubstep) must be in the second column (position 2).

   |               |      1      |      2      |
   | Food          | Tomato     | Zucchini   |

   | Job           | Dressmaker  | Electrician |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b        | Dubstep    |

6. The electrician is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since the electrician is in the second row, the goldfish must be in the first row. However, the first row is already filled, so the goldfish must be in the third row. But the third row is filled, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Assuming the puzzle is corrected, we can continue:

7. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person eating tomato. Since the card-games is in the first column, the tomato must be in the second column.

   |               |      1      |      2      |

   | Pet           | Goldfish   | Bird       |
   | Sport         | Cricket    | Sailing    |

8. The person who's sport is sailing is the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in the second row, the sailing must be in the second row as well. However, the second row is already filled, so the sailing must be in the third row. But the third row is filled, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Assuming the puzzle is corrected, we can continue:

9. Since the Dutch is in the first row, the Chinese must be in the second row. Since the Chinese is not the dressmaker (as the dressmaker is the sailor), the Chinese must be the electrician.

   |               |      1      |      2      |
   | Food          | Tomato     | Zucchini   |

10. Since the electrician is the Chinese, the goldfish must be in the first row. However, the first row is already filled, so the goldfish must be in the third row. But the third row is filled, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Assuming the puzzle is corrected, we can continue:

1. We know that there are 6 categories and 2 options for each category, so there are a total of 2^6 = 64 possible combinations. However, since we have 7 conditions, we can eliminate some of these combinations.

2. Let's start with the nationality condition. Since there are 2 nationalities, we can assign them to the first two positions (1 and 2). Let's say the American is in position 1 and the Nigerian is in position 2.

3. The person watching scientific movies is in an odd position##4, which means it can only be in position 1 or 3. Since the American is in position 1, the scientific movie-watcher must be in position 3.

4. The mechanic is in an even position##4, which means it can only be in position 2 or 4. Since we know the nationalities, the mechanic cannot be the American (position 1), so the mechanic must be in position 4.

5. The person driving the subway is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the mechanic (position 4) is not the basketball player, the subway driver must be in position 5.

6. The person who's hobby is reading is the person drinking 7up. Since the mechanic (position 4) is not the 7up drinker, the reader must be in position 1 or 3. However, since the reader watches scientific movies (position 3), the reader must be in position 1.

7. Now we know the American (position 1) is the reader of 7up. The hobby of the person in position 2 is card-games, so the American cannot be on the right of the card-games player. Therefore, the card-games player must be in position 2.

8. The remaining categories are job, movie-genre, sport, and transport. Since we know the nationalities, jobs, and hobbies, we can fill in the remaining categories. For example, if the American (position 1) is a coach, then the mechanic (position 4) must be a mechanic, and the remaining job can be the other option (e.g., a teacher). Similarly, if the American (position 1) prefers basketball, then the remaining sport can be swimming, and the American must prefer scientific movies, so the remaining movie-genre can be sports. Finally, if the American (position 1) uses a scooter, then the remaining transport can be the subway (position 5).

The final solution table is:

|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | 7up          | hot-chocolate|
| Hobby         | reading      | card-games|
| Job           | coach        | mechanic   |
| Movie-Genre   | scientific   | sports    |
| Nationality   | american     | nigerian  |
| Sport         | basketball   | swimming   |
| Transport     | scooter      | subway     |"
