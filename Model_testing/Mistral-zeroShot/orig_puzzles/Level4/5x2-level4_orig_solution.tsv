Lv4-5x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different movie-genres (epic, family) and they are preferred by different people, we can place them in the first and second columns. Let's assume that epic is in the first column and family is in the second column.

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Family    |

2. Similarly, since there are 2 different music-genres (electronic, rock), we can place them in the next two empty rows. Let's assume that electronic is in the third row and rock is in the fourth row.

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   |         |           |
   |             | Electronic| Rock      |

3. Since there are 2 different nationalities (nigerian, pakistani), we can place them in the next two empty rows. Since the pakistani is on the right of the person watching epic movies, the nationality of the person watching epic movies must be nigerian. So, let's place nigerian in the fifth row and pakistani in the sixth row.

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   |         |           |
   | Nationality  | Nigerian| Pakistani |

4. The owner of the horse is on the far left. Since the nationalities are already placed, the owner of the horse must be in the first row. So, let's place horse in the third row (since the first row is already occupied by the movie genre, we'll place it in the second column).

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   |         | Horse     |
   | Nationality  | Nigerian| Pakistani |

5. Now, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is in an odd position. Since the nationalities and the horse are already placed, the person who's sport is skiing must be in the fifth row. So, let's place skiing in the fifth row (since the fifth row is already occupied by the nationality, we'll place it in the second column).

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   |         | Horse     |
   | Nationality  | Nigerian| Pakistani |
   | Sport        |         | Skiing    |

6. Finally, the fan of electronic is in an even position. Since the nationalities, the horse, and skiing are already placed, the fan of electronic must be in the sixth row. So, let's place electronic in the sixth row (since the sixth row is already occupied by the nationality, we'll place it in the second column).

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Horse     |
   | Nationality  | Nigerian| Pakistani |
   | Sport        |         | Skiing    |
   | Pet          |         |           |

7. We still have one empty row for the pet. Since there are 2 different pets (chinchilla, horse), we can place them in the last two empty rows. Let's place chinchilla in the seventh row and horse in the eighth row (since the seventh row is already occupied by the music genre, we'll place it in the second column).

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Horse     |
   | Nationality  | Nigerian| Pakistani |
   | Sport        |         | Skiing    |
   | Pet          | Chinchilla| Horse     |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Family    |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic| Horse     |
| Nationality  | Nigerian| Pakistani |
| Sport        |         | Skiing    |
| Pet          | Chinchilla| Horse     |

Lv4-5x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different beverages, jobs, movie-genres, pets, and sports. So, each row and each column should have only one unique item.

2. Let's start with the Beverage column. Since there are two different beverages, they must be in different rows. Let's assume Almond-Milk is in row 1 and Mirinda is in row 2.

3. Now, let's fill the Job column. Since the manager watches action movies (point 2), and the manager must be in an even position (point 3), the manager must be in either the first or the second row. If the manager is in the first row, the job in the second row must be scientist. But this would mean the scientist is watching action movies, which contradicts the fact that there are two different movie-genres (point 1). So, the manager must be in the second row. Therefore, the job in the first row is scientist.

4. Now, let's fill the Movie-Genre column. Since the manager watches action movies (point 2), the other genre must be epic. So, Action goes in the second row and Epic goes in the first row.

5. Let's fill the Pet column. Since the person with the dog is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (point 1), and the almond-milk is in the second row, the dog must be in the second column. The other pet, lizard, must be in the first column.

6. Finally, let's fill the Sport column. Since the scientist is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing (point 4), and the scientist is in the second row (point 3), the surfing must be in the first row. The other sport, volleyball, must be in the second row.

The final solution table is:

|               | Almond-Milk | Mirinda      |
| Beverage      | Scientist   | Manager      |
| Job           | Epic        | Action       |
| Movie-Genre   | Dog         | Lizard       |
| Pet           | Surfing     | Volleyball    |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               | Almond-Milk | Mirinda      |
| Beverage      | Scientist   | Manager      |
| Job           | Epic        | Action       |
| Movie-Genre   | Dog         | Lizard       |
| Pet           | Surfing     | Volleyball    |

Lv4-5x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different hobbies, jobs, nationalities, sports, and means of transport. So, each category will have one unique item.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Mexican is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse, and the Mexican can't be in the middle (because of the odd position rule for the Sudoku hobby), the Mexican must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the Mexican is in position 1 (Mexican, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___,

Lv4-5x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different types of food, 2 different movie-genres, 2 different music-genres, 2 different nationalities, and 2 different sports, we can place one of each in the first row and column. Let's start with the Food column:

   |               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
   | Food          |          |       |
   | Movie-Genre   |          |       |
   | Music-Genre   |          |       |
   | Nationality   |          |       |
   | Sport         |          |       |

2. Since the person eating cranberry is on the right of the person watching action movies, we can place action in the second row and column:

   |               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
   | Food          |          | Action |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action   |       |
   | Music-Genre   |          |       |
   | Nationality   |          |       |
   | Sport         |          |       |

3. Since the fan of blues is on the right of the person whose sport is cycling, we can place cycling in the third row and an even position (since the nationality will be in the fourth row and must be in an odd position):

   |               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
   | Food          |          | Action |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action   |       |
   | Music-Genre   |          | Blues  |
   | Nationality   |          |       |
   | Sport         | Cycling  |       |

4. Since the nationality must be in an odd position, it can only go in the first or third row. If we place it in the first row, it would violate the rule that the person eating cranberry is on the right of the person watching action movies. So, the nationality must be in the third row:

   |               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
   | Food          |          | Action |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action   | Blues  |
   | Nationality   | Nigerian |       |
   | Sport         | Cycling  |       |

5. Since the person watching horror movies is to the left of the person eating kiwi, we can place horror in the second row:

   |               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
   | Food          |          | Action |
   | Movie-Genre   | Horror   | Blues  |
   | Nationality   | Nigerian |       |
   | Sport         | Cycling  |       |

6. Since the remaining sport is skateboarding and it must be in an even position, it can only go in the fourth row:

   |               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
   | Food          |          | Action |
   | Movie-Genre   | Horror   | Blues  |
   | Nationality   | Nigerian |       |
   | Sport         |         | Skateboarding |

7. Since the remaining food is kiwi, it must be in the second column:

   |               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
   | Food          |         | Kiwi   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Horror   | Blues  |
   | Nationality   | Nigerian |       |
   | Sport         |         | Skateboarding |

8. Since the remaining movie-genre is pop, it must be in the first row:

   |               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
   | Food          | Pop      | Kiwi   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Horror   | Blues  |
   | Nationality   | Nigerian |       |
   | Sport         |         | Skateboarding |

9. Since the remaining music-genre is pop, it must be in the second row:

   |               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
   | Food          | Pop      | Kiwi   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Pop      | Blues  |
   | Nationality   | Nigerian |       |
   | Sport         |         | Skateboarding |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               | Cranberry | Kiwi   |
| Food          | Pop      | Kiwi   |
| Movie-Genre   | Pop      | Blues  |
| Music-Genre   | Pop      | Blues  |
| Nationality   | Nigerian |       |
| Sport         |         | Skateboarding |

Lv4-5x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two nationalities (Malaysian and Pakistani), and the Malaysian cannot be in the middle position (due to point 3), the Malaysian must be in either the first or the third position. Let's assume the Malaysian is in the first position.

2. Since there are two odd and two even positions, and the person watching romance movies is in an odd position (due to point 2), the romance movie-genre must be in the first or the third position. Let's assume the romance movie-genre is in the first position.

3. Since the teacher is on the right of the Malaysian (due to point 3), the teacher must be in the second position.

4. Since there are two types of food (pomegranate and strawberry), and the Malaysian is eating one of them (due to point 1), the other food must be in the second position. So, the food in the second position is strawberry, and the person eating pomegranate must be in the third position.

5. Since there are two means of transport (helicopter and motorbike), and the person driving the motorbike is on the far right (due to point 4), the helicopter must be in the first position.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          | Helicopter | Strawberry |
| Job           | Pilot     | Teacher    |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance   |            |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Pakistani   |
| Transport     |           | Motorbike  |

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv4-5x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the hamster is in an odd position, which means it can't be in the first row or the first column. So, the hamster can only be in the second row or the second column.

2. The fisherman is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the fisherman drinks fanta (from rule 3), he must be in the second row. So, the satire movie-genre must be in the first column.

3. Now, we know that the fisherman is in the second row, first column is occupied, so the hamster can't be in the second row. Therefore, the hamster must be in the second column.

4. The musician is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the surfing sport is in the second row (as the fisherman is a fisherman and drinks fanta), the musician must be in the first row.

5. The only job left is the job of the person in the second row, which is the owner of the pet in the second column (hamster). So, the job of the person in the second row is a fisherman.

6. The only job left is the job of the person in the first row, which is the job of the person watching satire movies.

7. The only movie-genre left is horror. So, the person watching horror movies is in the first row.

8. The only sport left is ice-hockey. So, the person who plays ice-hockey is in the first row.

9. The only pet left is a rabbit. So, the person keeping a rabbit is in the first column.

Here is the final solution table:

```
               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      |   tea      |   fanta   |
| Job           |   musician |   fisherman |
| Movie-Genre   |   horror   |   satire   |
| Pet           |   rabbit   |   hamster  |
| Sport         |   ice-hockey|   surfing  |
```

#############
| Beverage      |   tea      |   fanta   |
| Job           |   musician |   fisherman |
| Movie-Genre   |   horror   |   satire   |
| Pet           |   rabbit   |   hamster  |
| Sport         |   ice-hockey|   surfing  |
#############"
Lv4-5x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 5 categories and 2 options for each category, so we have a total of 2^5 = 32 possible arrangements. However, we have 5 constraints that will help us reduce the number of possibilities.

2. Let's start with the transport (Transport). Since there are 2 options (roller and van), and we know that the rock fan is on the right of the person driving the van, this means the person driving the van cannot be a rock fan. So, the van driver must be a disco fan. Let's mark this in our table:

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | cola/sprite | disco/rock  |
   | Food          | cucumber/grapefruit |  |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure/romance |  |
   | Music-Genre   | disco/rock |  |
   | Transport     | roller | van  |

   Now we have 16 possibilities left (half of the total).

3. The person watching adventure movies is in an even position. Since there are 5 positions, the only even positions are 2 and 4. However, position 4 is already occupied by the van, so the adventure movie fan must be in position 2. Let's mark this in our table:

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | cola/sprite | disco/rock  |
   | Food          | cucumber/grapefruit |  |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure |  |
   | Music-Genre   | disco/rock |  |
   | Transport     | roller | van  |

   Now we have 8 possibilities left.

4. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person eating cucumber. Since the food positions are 1 and 2, the sprite drinker cannot be in position 1. So, the sprite drinker must be in position 2. Let's mark this in our table:

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | cola | sprite  |
   | Food          | cucumber | grapefruit |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure |  |
   | Music-Genre   | disco/rock |  |
   | Transport     | roller | van  |

   Now we have 4 possibilities left.

5. Since we have only 4 possibilities left, we can check each one by one. Let's try the first possibility:

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | cola | sprite  |
   | Food          | cucumber | grapefruit |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure | romance  |
   | Music-Genre   | disco | rock  |
   | Transport     | roller | van  |

   This arrangement doesn't satisfy the condition that the rock fan is on the right of the person driving the van, so we can eliminate this arrangement.

6. Let's try the second possibility:

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | cola | sprite  |
   | Food          | cucumber | grapefruit |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure | romance  |
   | Music-Genre   | rock | disco  |
   | Transport     | roller | van  |

   This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, so it must be the correct one.

7. Let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | cola | sprite  |
   | Food          | cucumber | grapefruit |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure | romance  |
   | Music-Genre   | rock | disco  |
   | Transport     | roller | van  |

   This is the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv4-5x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different hobbies, 2 jobs, 2 nationalities, 2 pets, and 2 means of transport, we can assume that the table is a 2x5 matrix.

2. From point 1, we know that the hobbies, jobs, nationalities, pets, and transport are distributed evenly across the two rows. So, each row will have one hobby, one job, one nationality, one pet, and one transport.

3. From point 2, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the nurse. This means that the board-games hobby cannot be in the first column because the nurse cannot be in the first column (since there's only one nurse and the hobbies are different). So, the board-games hobby must be in the second column or the fourth column.

4. From point 3, we know that the person driving the subway is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means that the subway cannot be in the first row because the hobbies are different. So, the subway must be in the second row. Therefore, the sudoku hobby must be in the first row.

5. From point 4, we know that the indonesian is the owner of the rabbit. Since the nationalities are different, the Italian cannot be in the same row as the Indonesian. So, the Italian must be in the second row.

6. Now we know that the first row has the sudoku hobby, the Indonesian nationality, and the owner of the rabbit. Since the pets are different, the rat cannot be in the first row. So, the rat must be in the second row.

7. Since the jobs are different, the dressmaker cannot be in the same row as the nurse. So, the dressmaker must be in the second row.

8. Now we know that the second row has the board-games hobby, the Italian nationality, the dressmaker, the rat, and the subway. Since the transport is different, the taxi cannot be in the second row. So, the taxi must be in the first row.

9. Since the hobbies are different, the board-games hobby cannot be in the same column as the sudoku hobby. So, the board-games hobby must be in the second column and the nurse must be in the fourth column.

10. Now we can place the remaining items: the nurse is in the fourth column and the fifth row (since the jobs are different), and the taxi is in the first row and the first column (since the transport is different).

Here is the final solution table:

```
               |    1    |      2      |
| Hobby         | Taxi    | Board-games |
| Job           |         |             |
| Nationality   | Indonesian| Italian     |
| Pet           |         |             |
| Transport     | Subway  |             |

| Hobby         |             | Sudoku     |
| Job           | Dressmaker  |             |
| Nationality   |             |             |
| Pet           | Rat         |             |
| Transport     |             |             |
```

Now we just need to fill in the missing information. Since the jobs are different, the dressmaker cannot be in the first row. So, the dressmaker must be in the second row. Since the pets are different, the rat cannot be in the first column. So, the rat must be in the second column. Since the nationalities are different, the Italian cannot be in the first row. So, the Italian must be in the second row. Since the hobbies are different, the board-games hobby cannot be in the second row. So, the board-games hobby must be in the first row. Since the transport is different, the subway cannot be in the second column. So, the subway must be in the first column.

Here is the final solution table:

```
               |    1    |      2      |
| Hobby         | Taxi    | Board-games |
| Job           | Dressmaker| Nurse      |
| Nationality   | Indonesian| Italian    |
| Pet           | Rat      | Rabbit     |
| Transport     | Subway  |             |
```

So, the final solution is:

Lv4-5x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different jobs, and the electrician is in an odd position (position 1 or 3), the writer must be in position 2.

2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person watching spy movies. So, the person watching spy movies must be in position 1, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2.

3. The person who's hobby is collecting is the writer. So, the person with the hobby of collecting is in position 2.

4. The fan of house is on the far left. Since the writer (who has the hobby of collecting) is in position 2, the fan of house must be in position 1.

5. The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of indie. Since the fan of house is in position 1, the fan of indie must be in position 3.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      |   House      |   Hot-chocolate|
| Hobby         |   Collecting  |   Rock-climbing|
| Job           |   Electrician|   Writer      |
| Movie-Genre   |   Sports    |   Spy         |
| Music-Genre   |   Indie     |   -          |

Since we know the beverage of the person in position 2 (hot-chocolate), and there are only 2 different beverages, the beverage of the person in position 3 must be iced-tea. So, let's fill in the table:

|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      |   House      |   Hot-chocolate|
| Hobby         |   Collecting  |   Rock-climbing|
| Job           |   Electrician|   Writer      |
| Movie-Genre   |   Sports    |   Spy         |
| Music-Genre   |   Indie     |   -          |
| Beverage      |   -         |   Iced-tea   |

Now, we need to find the movie genre of the person in position 3. Since there are only 2 different movie genres, the person in position 3 must prefer sports. So, let's fill in the table:

|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      |   House      |   Hot-chocolate|
| Hobby         |   Collecting  |   Rock-climbing|
| Job           |   Electrician|   Writer      |
| Movie-Genre   |   Sports    |   Spy         |
| Music-Genre   |   Indie     |   -          |
| Beverage      |   Iced-tea  |   -          |
| Movie-Genre   |   -         |   -          |

Finally, since there are only 2 different music genres, the person in position 3 must prefer indie. So, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      |   House      |   Hot-chocolate|

Lv4-5x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two types of food, and the person eating cabbage is in an odd position, the cabbage eater must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the cabbage eater is in position 1 (we'll see if this assumption is correct later).

2. The fan of house is on the far left or far right. If the cabbage eater is in position 1, then the house fan cannot be in position 1 (as per rule 3, the person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the fan of soul, and we haven't placed the camping hobby yet). So, the house fan must be in position 2.

3. Now, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 1 (as per rule 3, the person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the fan of soul, and we have placed the house fan in position 2).

4. The soul fan must be in position 3 (as per rule 2, the fan of house is in position 2, and the fan of soul must be on the opposite side, which is position 3).

5. The nationality of the person in position 1 is Polish (as per rule 4, the polish is on the left of the person driving the bus, and we haven't placed the nationality of the person in position 2 yet).

6. The person in position 2 is Pakistani (as there is only one nationality left, and we have placed the Polish in position 1).

7. The transport of the person in position 1 is bus (as per rule 4, the polish is on the left of the person driving the bus, and we have placed the Polish in position 1).

8. The transport of the person in position 2 is train (as there is only one transport left, and we have placed the bus in position 1).

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |    1    |     2      |
