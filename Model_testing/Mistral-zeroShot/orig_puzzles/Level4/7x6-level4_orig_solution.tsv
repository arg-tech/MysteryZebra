Lv4-7x6-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's assign variables to each category and person:

- Beverage: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Hobby: G, H, I, J, K, L
- Movie-Genre: M, N, O, P, Q, R
- Nationality: X, Y, Z, A1, A2, A3
- Pet: a, b, c, d, e, f
- Sport: g, h, i, j, k, l
- Transport: m, n, o, p, q, r

Now let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that parkour (j) is on the left of dog (a). So, j < a.
2. From rule 2, we know that the dutch (X) is the person who's hobby is chess (H).
3. From rule 3, we know that the person driving the scooter (r) is on the right of the person driving the boat (m). So, r > m.
4. From rule 4, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling (L) is the owner of the goat (d). So, L = d.
5. From rule 5, we know that the person driving the quad-bike (q) is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike (n). So, q ≤ n or q ≥ n.
6. From rule 6, we know that the person drinking sprite (E) is the person driving the quad-bike (q). So, E = q.
7. From rule 8, we know that the person driving the scooter (r) is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta (B). So, r ≤ B or r ≥ B.
8. From rule 9, we know that the mexican (A3) is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike (q). So, A3 < q.
9. From rule 10, we know that the mexican (A3) is the person driving the jet-ski (o). So, A3 = o.
10. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is reading (K) is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike (q). So, K > q.
11. From rule 13, we know that the owner of the mouse (e) is the person who's hobby is reading (K). So, e = K.
12. From rule 12, we already know that X = H.
13. From rule 15, we know that the person watching adventure movies (M) is on the far left or far right. Since X is on the far left (rule 23), M cannot be X. So, M ≠ X.
14. From rule 16, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding (k) is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour (j). So, k > j.
15. From rule 17, we know that the person drinking water (F) is on the left of the person driving the car (A). So, F < A.
16. From rule 18, we know that the person drinking mirinda (B) is the person driving the car (A). So, B = A.
17. From rule 19, we know that the person who's hobby is photography (I) is on the left or right of the owner of the goat (d). So, I ≤ d or I ≥ d.
18. From rule 20, we know that the person drinking soy-milk (D) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby (i). So, D ≤ i or D ≥ i.
19. From rule 21, we know that the owner of the dog (a) is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies (N). So, a ≤ N or a ≥ N.
20. From rule 22, we know that the person watching zombie movies (S) is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse (e). So, S ≤ e or S ≥ e.
21. From rule 23, we know that the thai (Z) is on the far left. So, Z is N or X.
22. From rule 24, we know that the person who's hobby is photography (I) is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski (o). So, I < o.
23. From rule 25, we know that the person who's sport is soccer (g) is on the right of the japanese (Y). So, g > Y.
24. From rule 26, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball (l) is on the left or right of the indonesian (A2). So, l ≤ A2 or l ≥ A2.
25. From rule 27, we know that the person watching zombie movies (S) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling (L). So, S ≤ L or S ≥ L.
26. From rule 28, we know that the person watching adventure movies (M) is on the far left or far right. Since Z is on the far left (rule 23), M cannot be Z. So, M ≠ Z.
27. From rule 29, we know that the owner of the frog (c) is on the right of the person drinking coffee (C). So, c > C.
28. From rule 30, we know that the owner of the hamster (b) is the person who's hobby is chess (H). So, b = H.
29. From rule 31, we know that the person drinking mirinda (B) is on the left of the person watching spy movies (T). So, B < T.
30. From rule 32, we know that the dutch (X) is on the left or right of the japanese (Y). So, X ≤ Y or X ≥ Y.
31. From rule 33, we know that the person drinking coffee (C) is on the left or right of the japanese (Y). So, C ≤ Y or C ≥ Y.
32. From rule 34, we know that the person watching crime movies (U) is on the right of the owner of the hamster (b). So, U > b.
33. From rule 35, we know that the person watching horror movies (V) is in an odd position. Since there are 6 people, the odd positions are 1, 3, 5.
34. From rule 36, we know that the dutch (X) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (J). So, X ≤ J or X ≥ J.
35. From rules 1, 5, 6, and 16, we can deduce that j < a < d < q < k > e > b > C < B < A < M < Z < o < I < U < V < Y < C < T < N.
36. From rules 2, 12, 15, 21, 23, and 30, we can deduce that X = H, M ≠ X, a ≤ N or a ≥ N, Z = N or X, and X ≤ Y or X ≥ Y.

Now, let's fill in the final solution table:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           | Sport         | Transport     |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|

| B            |               | T            |              |               |              | A            |
| A            | G             |               |              | a             | k            |              |
| D            |               |               | Z            | c             | i            |              |

|               |    1     |     2     |     3      |      4      |     5      |      6      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | fanta | iced-tea | lemonade | milk | water |
| Food          | banana | eggplant | grapefruit | lime | potato | zucchini |
| Hobby         | board-games | dancing | gardening | hiking | singing | sudoku |
| Music-Genre   | ambient | r&b | reggae | salsa | soul | trance |
| Nationality   | british | french | indian | italian | japanese | malaysian |
| Pet           | ferret | fish | goldfish | guinea-pig | mouse | turtle |
| Transport     | airplane | boat | motorbike | taxi | train | trike |

2. From point 1, we know the position of fanta. Let's use that to find the position of the goldfish owner.

3. Now we can use the information about the position of fanta to find the position of the salsa fan and the milk drinker.

4. We can now find the position of the trance fan using the information about its position being odd.

5. Using the position of the trance fan, we can find the position of the motorbike driver.

6. With the position of the motorbike driver, we can find the position of the guinea-pig owner using the information about its position.

7. Now we can find the position of the person driving the airplane and the person eating grapefruit using the given information.

8. We can find the position of the person drinking water (indian) using the given information.

9. Using the position of the indian, we can find the position of the person eating zucchini.

10. We can find the position of the person eating banana using the given information.

11. Using the position of the banana eater, we can find the position of the person driving the boat.

12. Now we can find the position of the person eating lime (lemonade drinker) using the given information.

13. Using the position of the lemonade drinker, we can find the position of the person drinking iced-tea.

14. We can find the position of the person eating potato using the given information.

15. Using the position of the potato eater, we can find the position of the person driving the taxi.

16. Now we can find the position of the person who's hobby is singing using the given information.

17. Using the position of the person who's hobby is singing, we can find the position of the italian.

18. Now we can find the position of the person who's hobby is board-games using the given information.

19. Using the position of the person who's hobby is board-games, we can find the position of the owner of the guinea-pig.

20. We can find the position of the owner of the turtle using the given information.

21. Now we can find the position of the trance fan again using the information about its position being odd. This should match our previous placement of trance fan.

22. Using the position of the fanta drinker, we can find the position of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

23. Now we can find the position of the person who's hobby is dancing using the given information. This should match our previous placement of the fanta drinker.

24. Using the position of the person drinking fanta, we can find the position of the person who's hobby is hiking.

25. We can find the position of the person drinking almond-milk using the given information. This should match our previous placement of the italian.

26. Now we can find the position of the person eating banana again using the information about its position. This should match our previous placement of the banana eater.

27. Using the position of the person driving the boat, we can find the position of the malaysian.

28. We can find the position of the person who's hobby is singing again using the information about its position. This should match our previous placement of the person who's hobby is singing.

29. Using the position of the reggae fan, we can find its position. Since it's in an even position, it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, we already have items in those positions, so reggae must be in position 1.

30. Since the person driving the trike is in an even position, it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, we already have items in those positions, so the trike driver must be in position 1. This means the reggae fan and the trike driver swap positions.

31. Using the position of the reggae fan, we can find the position of the trike driver.

Now the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |     2     |     3      |      4      |     5      |      6      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | reggae | iced-tea | lemonade | milk | water |
| Food          | banana | eggplant | grapefruit | lime | potato | zucchini |
| Hobby         | board-games | dancing | gardening | hiking | singing | sudoku |
| Music-Genre   | ambient | r&b | trance | salsa | soul | trike |
| Nationality   | british | french | indian | italian | japanese | malaysian |
| Pet           | ferret | fish | goldfish | guinea-pig | mouse | turtle |
| Transport     | trike | boat | motorbike | taxi | airplane |  |

However, there seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as the table only has 6 columns but we have placed 7 items in the Transport category. The last transport (trike) seems to be missing a corresponding position. I'll leave the table as it is for now, but please note that there seems to be a mistake in the puzzle.

Lv4-7x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Assign nationalities
- The German is in an odd position (20) and drinks lemonade (16), so they are in position 1 or 5. Since the German is driving the ship (37), they must be in position 1 (odd) and drink lemonade.
- The Italian is driving the quad-bike (15), so they must be in position 6.
- The Egyptian is on the left of the person who drinks cola (23), so they must be in position 2.
- The Spanish is drinking 7up (22), so they must be in position 3.
- The Japanese is on the left of the gardener (24), so they must be in position 4.
- The Mexican is playing tennis (3), so they must be in position 5 (odd).

Step 2: Assign hobbies
- The gardener is in an odd position (5) and is between the bus driver and the electronic music fan (13, 22), so they must be in position 3.
- The hobby in position 1 must be card-games (18) because the lacrosse player is on the left or right of the card-games player (18). Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the card-games player cannot be in position 2, so they must be in position 1.
- The hobby in position 6 must be chess (6) because the dog owner is in an odd position (11) and is on the right of the chess player. Since the Italian is in position 6, the chess player cannot be in position 6, so they must be in position 4.
- The hobby in position 5 is baking (10) because the skateboard driver is on the left of the baker. Since the Mexican is in position 5, the baker must be in position 4.
- The hobby in position 2 is collecting (26) because the dog owner is on the right of the collector. Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the collector must be in position 2.
- The hobby in position 4 is gardening (3), so it's already assigned.
- The hobby in position 1 is card-games (1), so it's already assigned.
- The hobby in position 6 is chess (6), so it's already assigned.

Lv4-7x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the nationalities, jobs, music genres, pets, beverages, and food. Let's assign them to the rows and columns. For simplicity, let's start with the rows and then fill the columns.

   Rows: Nationality, Job, Music-Genre, Pet, Transport, Beverage, Food
   Columns: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

2. We know that the Malaysian is drinking juice, so let's place them in the Juice column. Since there are 6 nationalities, the others must be in the remaining columns. Let's place the Canadian in column 3 (since the Malaysian is in column 1).

   Nationality: 1-Malaysian, 2-?, 3-Canadian, 4-?, 5-?, 6-?

3. The owner of the goat is in an odd position 4, so it must be in column 2 or 4. Since the Malaysian is in column 1, the goat owner must be in column 4. The goat owner's music genre is classical (from point 25), so let's place it in the Classical row.

   Nationality: 1-Malaysian, 2-?, 3-Canadian, 4-Goat-owner (Classical), 5-?, 6-?
   Music-Genre: 1-?, 2-?, 3-?, 4-Classical, 5-?, 6-?

4. The person drinking milk is in an even position 4, so it must be in column 2 or 6. Since the goat owner is in column 4, the person drinking milk must be in column 6.

6. The person drinking iced-tea is between the person drinking coffee and the person driving the jet-ski (point 5). Since the Malaysian is in column 1, the iced-tea drinker must be in column 2 or 3. The only possible position is column 2, and the only person left in that column is the dressmaker (from point 19).

   Nationality: 1-Malaysian, 2-Dressmaker (Iced-tea), 3-Canadian, 4-Goat-owner (Classical), 5-?, 6-Milk-drinker
   Music-Genre: 1-?, 2-Iced-tea, 3-?, 4-Classical, 5-?, 6-?

   Food: 1-?, 2-?, 3-?, 4-?, 5-?, 6-?

8. The person eating orange is on the left of the fan of house (point 7). Since the skateboard driver is in column 3, the person eating orange must be in column 2.

   Nationality: 1-Malaysian, 2-Orange-eater, 3-Skateboard-driver, 4-Goat-owner (Classical), 5-?, 6-Milk-drinker
   Music-Genre: 1-?, 2-Iced-tea, 3-?, 4-Classical, 5-?, 6-?

10. The person driving the skateboard is between the Canadian and the person eating pear (point 7), so we already know that.

11. The person eating orange is on the left of the fan of house (point 8), so we already know that.

12. We can't solve more with the given information, so let's fill the remaining positions with the remaining items.

Lv4-7x6-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step will help us find the solution. I'll break it down into several steps:

Step 1: Assigning variables
Let's assign variables to each category and person:

|               |       1       |      2       |      3       |      4       |       5       |      6       |
| Beverage      | A            | B            | C            | D            | E            | F            |
| Food          | G            | H            | I            | J            | K            | L            |
| Hobby         | M            | N            | O            | P            | Q            | R            |
| Job           | S            | T            | U            | V            | W            | X            |
| Movie-Genre   | Y            | Z            | AA           | BB           | CC           | DD           |
| Nationality   | EG           | CN           | NL           | EG2          | MX           | PK           |
| Sport         | HB           | PK          | RU           | SF           | VB           | WL           |

Step 2: Solving clues
Now, let's solve the clues one by one:

1. M is in an even position##4
   - Since there are 6 people, an even position is 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume M = B (position 2) for now.

2. EG = VB
   - The Egyptian is the person who's sport is volleyball. Since M is baking and we already assigned EG to position 2, VB must be position 6.

3. G < H
   - The person eating cucumber is on the left of the person eating eggplant. So, G = CN (Chinese) and H = NL (Dutch).

4. O > I
   - The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. So, I = WL and O = P (someone else).

5. SF is adjacent to M##3
   - Since M = B, SF must be either A or C. But since SF is surfing and we already assigned VB to position 6, SF can't be F. So, SF = A.

6. A is adjacent to U##3
   - The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the freelancer. Since F is already assigned to position 6, A must be either 1 or 5. But since A = SF (surfing), A can't be 1. So, A = 5.

7. S = A
   - The analyst is the person drinking fanta. Since A = 5, S = 5.

8. N > HB
   - The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since HB = VB (position 6), N must be either 1, 3, or 4.

9. Q = HC
   - The person who's hobby is cooking is the person drinking hot-chocolate.

10. B = QK
   - The person eating blueberry is the person who's sport is volleyball (since EG = VB). Since Q = HC, B must be either G or L. But since B = EG (position 2), B can't be L. So, B = G.

11. L = J
   - The person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Since B = G, L = J.

12. Y is on the far left or far right##3
   - Let's assume Y = AA (action) is on the far left.

13. S = AA
   - The person drinking iced-tea is the analyst (since S = 5). But since AA is already assigned to position 1, the analyst can't drink iced-tea. So, let's assume Y = DD (different genre).

14. T = M
   - The entrepreneur is the person who's hobby is fishing. Since M = B (position 2), T = B.

15. R is between Q and M##2
   - The person who's hobby is singing is between the person who's hobby is puzzles (Q) and the person who's hobby is baking (M). Since Q = HC and M = B, R must be either I or O. But since R = S (singing), R can't be I (weightlifting). So, R = O (puzzles).

16. W is on the left or right of X##3
   - The photographer is on the left or right of the videographer. Since X = V (videographer), W can't be 1 or 6 (since they are already assigned). So, W = 3 or 4.

17. SF is on the right of J
   - The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person eating onion. Since SF = A (position 5) and J = L (position 3), A must be on the right of L.

18. O is on the left of S
   - The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the analyst. Since O = P (position 4) and S = 5, O must be on the left of S.

19. C is on the far left or far right##3
   - Let's assume C = F (milk) is on the far right.

20. BB is in an odd position##4
   - The person watching fantasy movies is in an odd position. Since BB = CC (fantasy) and we already assigned Y = DD (different genre), BB must be CC. Since CC is in an odd position, BB can't be 2, 4, or 6. So, BB = 1 or 3.

21. B is on the left or right of L##3
   - The person eating blueberry is on the left or right of the person eating strawberry. Since B = G (position 2) and L = J (position 3), B can't be 1 or 6. So, B = 4 or 5. But since BB = CC (fantasy) and BB is in an odd position, BB = 1. So, B = 1 and L = 6.

22. HB is in an even position##4
   - The person who's sport is handball is in an even position. Since HB = VB (position 6), HB is already in an even position.

23. O is on the left or right of S##3
   - The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the analyst. Since O = P (position 4) and S = 5, O can't be 1 or 6. So, O = 2 or 3. But since O is already on the left of S, O = 2.

24. RU is on the far left or far right##3
   - The person who's sport is rugby is on the far left or far right. Since RU = 4, RU can't be 1, 2, or 3 (since they are already assigned). So, RU = 5 or 6.

25. N is on the left or right of B##3
