Lv4-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person eating papaya is not in the middle (since the person eating spinach is not in the middle, and they are either to the left or right of the person eating papaya). Let's place the person eating papaya in the first or third position.

2. The person driving the boat is not in the middle (odd position) and is not next to the skateboarder (since the boat driver is on the left or right of the skateboarder). Let's place the boat driver in the first or third position. Since the boat driver is not the skateboarder, the skateboarder must be in the second position.

3. The dressmaker is on the right of the rock fan. Since the rock fan cannot be in the first position (because the dressmaker must be on her right), the rock fan must be in the second or third position. If the rock fan is in the third position, the dressmaker must be in the first position. But then, the skateboarder (in the second position) is not on the right of the dressmaker, which contradicts the given information. So, the rock fan must be in the second position, and the dressmaker must be in the third position.

4. The person eating papaya is a fan of r&b. Since the person eating papaya is in the first or third position, r&b must be in the first, second, or third row. Since the rock fan is in the second row, r&b cannot be in the second row. So, r&b must be in the first or third row. Since the accountant is the broccoli eater (given in point 7), and the accountant cannot be in the first position (because the skateboarder is there), r&b must be in the third row. So, papaya is in the first position, r&b is in the third row, and spinach is in the second position.

5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is not in the first position (because the skateboarder is there), the tennis player must be in the second or third position. If the tennis player is in the third position, the chinchilla owner must be in the second position. But then, the dressmaker (in the third position) is not on the right of the chinchilla owner, which contradicts the given information. So, the tennis player must be in the second position, and the chinchilla owner must be in the first position.

6. The dressmaker is on the far left or far right. Since the dressmaker is in the third position, she must be on the far right.

7. The accountant is the owner of the rat. Since the accountant is the broccoli eater and is in the first position, the broccoli must be in the first row.

8. The person driving the boat is the owner of the goldfish. Since the boat driver is in the first position, the goldfish must be in the first row.

9. The person eating spinach is between the owner of the goldfish and the person driving the van. Since the goldfish is in the first row and the van cannot be in the first row (because the boat driver is there), the van must be in the second or third row. If the van is in the second row, the person eating spinach must be in the first position, which contradicts the given information that the person eating papaya is not in the middle. So, the van must be in the third row. Since the goldfish is in the first row, the person eating spinach must be in the second row.

10. The accountant is the owner of the rat, and the rat is in the first row. So, the accountant is in the first position.

11. The software-developer is the person driving the train. Since the boat driver is in the first position, the train must be in the second or third row. If the train is in the second row, the software-developer must be in the third position, which contradicts the given information that the dressmaker is on the far right. So, the train must be in the third row. Since the accountant is in the first position, the software-developer must be in the second position.

12. The only remaining position for the skateboarder is the second position.

13. The only remaining position for the person driving the van is the third position.

14. The only remaining position for the person eating broccoli (spinach) is the second position.

15. The only remaining position for the person eating spinach (broccoli) is the first position.

16. The only remaining position for the person eating papaya is the third position.

So, the final solution table is:

| Transport     |          |          |           |

4. From point 1.3, we know there are 3 different movie-genres, so we can fill in the names of the movie-genres in the Movie-Genre column. Let's assume the order is Crime, Disaster, Documentary from left to right.

| Transport     |         |         |           |

5. From point 1.4, we know there are 3 different music-genres, so we can fill in the names of the music-genres in the Music-Genre column. Let's assume the order is Ambient, R&B, Trance from left to right.

|               | Iced-Tea | Lemonade | Milk      |

| Transport     |         |         |           |

6. From point 2, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the left, so the person eating kiwi must be the one drinking iced-tea.

| Transport     |         |         |           |

7. From point 3, we know the person eating kiwi is the person watching documentary movies, so the person eating kiwi must be in the Documentary row. Since the person drinking iced-tea is already in the Documentary row, the person eating kiwi must be in the second position of the Documentary row.

| Transport     |         |         |           |

8. From point 4, we know the person drinking milk is the owner of the mouse. Since we don't know the position of the mouse yet, we can't place the milk yet.

9. From point 5, we know the person driving the trike is between the person eating kiwi and the person watching crime movies. Since the person eating kiwi is in the second position of the Documentary row, the person driving the trike must be in the third position of the Crime row.

| Transport     |         |         | Trike     |

11. From point 7, we know the person drinking milk is the owner of the mouse, so the person drinking milk must be in the Mouse row. Since the person eating peach is already in the first position of the Ambient row, the person drinking milk must be in the second position of the Ambient row.

|               | Iced-Tea | Lemonade | Milk      |
| Beverage      | Kiwi     | Orange   | Peach     |

| Transport     |         |         |           |

12. From point 8, we know the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating peach, so the person eating kiwi must be in the third position of the Ambient row.

|               | Iced-Tea | Lemonade | Milk      |
| Beverage      | Kiwi     | Orange   | Peach     |

| Transport     |         |         |           |

13. From point 9, we know the person eating orange is on the far left or far right. Since the person eating kiwi is already in the third position of the Ambient row, the person eating orange must be in the first position of the Orange row.

|               | Iced-Tea | Lemonade | Milk      |

| Transport     | Skateboard|         |           |

14. From point 10, we know the person watching crime movies is the fan of trance, so the person watching crime movies must be in the Trance row. Since the person eating orange is already in the first position of the Orange row, the person watching crime movies must be in the second position of the Crime row.

|               | Iced-Tea | Lemonade | Milk      |

| Transport     | Skateboard|         |           |

15. From point 5, we know the person driving the trike is between the person eating kiwi and the person watching crime movies. Since the person eating kiwi is in the third position of the Ambient row and the person watching crime movies is in the second position of the Crime row, the person driving the trike must be in the first position of the Crime row.

|               | Iced-Tea | Lemonade | Milk      |

| Transport     | Skateboard| Trike    |           |

16. From point 6, we know the person owning the hedgehog is between the person eating orange and the person driving the skateboard. Since the person eating orange is already in the first position of the Orange row and the person driving the skateboard is already in the third position of the Transport row, the person owning the hedgehog must be in the second position of the Transport row.

|               | Iced-Tea | Lemonade | Milk      |

Lv4-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 rows.

2. We know that the chef is either on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Let's assume the chef is on the left (C1). This means the juice drinker is not the chef, so it must be C2 or C3. Since the scientist is eating raspberry (R), we know R cannot be C2 or C3 because the scientist is on the far right (R3). So, the juice drinker is C1.

3. Now we know that the scientist is eating raspberry (R3), so the raspberry eater cannot be the chef (C1) or the person watching mystery movies (M). Since the person watching mystery movies is drinking juice (J), we know M cannot be C2 or C3. So, the raspberry eater is C2.

4. The person watching mystery movies is drinking juice (J1), so we know M1.

5. The person eating apricot (A) is between the gardener (G) and the owner of the pony (P). Since G and P are not in positions 1 and 3 (G1 or P1 would violate rule 4 or 12), A must be in position 2. So, A2.

6. The owner of the pony (P) cannot be the chef (C1) or the person watching mystery movies (M1), so P must be C2 or C3. Since the scientist is on the far right (R3), P cannot be C3. So, P1.

7. The person who's hobby is gardening is the entrepreneur (E). Since E cannot be in position 1 (G1 would violate rule 5), E must be C2 or C3. Since P1, E cannot be C1. So, E3.

8. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in an odd position (T). Since T cannot be in position 1 (C1 is taken), T must be C3.

9. The person watching western movies (W) is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies (M1). Since M1 is in position 1, W can only be in position 2 or 3. Since T3, W cannot be in position 3. So, W2.

10. The person watching fantasy movies (F) is not in position 1 (C1 is taken), not in position 3 (T3 is taken), and not to the left of M1 (W2 is taken). So, F2.

11. The pet owner is on the far left (L) or far right (R). Since P1, the pet owner cannot be in position 3 (T3 is on the far right). So, the pet owner is L1.

12. The pet is either a cat (C), pony (P), or rat (R). Since P1 is the pet owner, the pet cannot be a pony (P). So, the pet is either C or R. Since the pet owner is on the far left (L1), the pet cannot be a cat (C). So, the pet is R1.

Lv4-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and we have 6 constraints about their positions, we can deduce that each person has 2 constraints related to them.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Mexican is on the far right and the British is in an odd position, the Spanish must be in an even position. So, the order of nationalities is: Mexican (far right), Spanish (even position), British (odd position).

3. The person watching adventure movies is the person who's sport is baseball. Since the baseball player is the British (odd position), the adventure movies are in the middle.

4. The person drinking iced-tea is the person who's hobby is reading. Since the reader is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite, and the Mexican is on the far right, the iced-tea drinker must be on the far left. So, the hobbies are: Reading (far left), Cooking (middle), Magic-tricks (right).

5. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the cook is in the middle, the fanta drinker is on the right. So, the beverages are: Sprite (left), Iced-tea (far left), Fanta (right).

6. The fan of soul is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's hobby is reading. Since the reader is on the far left and the golf player is on the right, the soul fan must be in the middle. So, the music genres are: D&B (left), Gospel (middle), Soul (right).

7. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the documentary is in the middle (adventure movies), the disaster movies are on the right. So, the movie genres are: Documentary (middle), Adventure (left), Disaster (right).

8. The mexican is on the far right, so the sport of golf must be on the left.

9. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (since the reader is on the far left), so the sprite drinker is on the left.

10. Putting it all together, the final solution table is:

1. We know that each row represents a different person and each column represents a different category (Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality, Sport). We have 6 people and 6 categories, so each cell will be filled with one of the six options.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Argentine is on the far left or far right, they can only be in the first or the sixth position. Let's assume the Argentine is in the first position (A1). This means the Australian (A2) and the German (A3) are in the second and third positions, respectively.

3. The German is between the person watching fantasy movies and the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the Argentine watches fantasy movies (A1), the German cannot be in the first position (A2). So, the German must be in the third position (A3), and the person who's hobby is cooking must be in the second position (A2).

4. The lawyer is the fan of techno. Since we know the nationalities, the lawyer can only be in positions A2, A3, or A6. However, since the person who's hobby is cooking is a lawyer (A2), the lawyer cannot be in the second position. So, the lawyer must be in the third position (A3), and the person who's hobby is cooking is a lawyer. This means the architect (A1) must have a different hobby, job, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, and sport.

5. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the Australian (A2) and the photographer. Since the Argentine (A1) and the German (A3) are already placed, the only possible position for the Australian is A2. The person who's hobby is fishing cannot be in the first position (A1) because the Argentine is on the far left, and the Australian is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. So, the person who's hobby is fishing must be in the third position (A3). This means the photographer must be in the sixth position (A6).

6. The architect is on the left of the Argentine (A1). Since the Argentine is in the first position (A1), the architect must be in the second position (A2).

7. The person who's sport is tennis is in the middle. Since we know the nationalities, the only possible positions for the tennis player are A2, A4, or A6. However, since the architect (A2) and the person who's hobby is fishing (A3) are already placed, the tennis player cannot be in the second position. Since the person who's hobby is photography (A6) is already placed, the tennis player cannot be in the sixth position. So, the tennis player must be in the fourth position (A4).

8. The fan of funk is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the photographer is in the sixth position (A6), the fan of funk must be in the fifth position (A5).

9. The person who's sport is rowing is on the far left. Since the Argentine (A1) and the tennis player (A4) are already placed, the rower must be in the first position (A1). This means the Argentine is not on the far left, so they must be in the sixth position (A6).

10. Now we have a contradiction: the Argentine (A6) is supposed to be on the far right, but we just placed them in the sixth position (A6), which is the far left. This means our initial assumption that the Argentine is on the far left was incorrect. So, the Argentine must be on the far right (A1). This means the rower must be in the first position (A1), the Argentine in the sixth position (A6), and the rower's hobby, job, movie-genre, music-genre, and sport are all unknown at this point.

11. Since we have placed all the other people, the rower's hobby must be one of the remaining three (cooking, fishing, photography). Let's assume the rower's hobby is cooking. This means the rower is a lawyer (since the architect and the photographer are already placed), watches fantasy movies, prefers funk music, is Australian (since the Argentine and the German are already placed), and plays tennis (since the positions A2, A4, and A6 are already filled). However, this contradicts the fact that the lawyer is the fan of techno, not funk.

12. So, our assumption that the rower's hobby is cooking is incorrect. Let's try the other two possibilities: fishing and photography. If the rower's hobby is fishing, they cannot be a lawyer (since the architect and the photographer are already placed), so they must be an architect. This means the architect is a rower, watches fantasy movies, prefers funk music, is Australian, and plays tennis. This is consistent with the given conditions. If the rower's hobby is photography, they cannot be a lawyer (since the architect and the photographer are already placed), so they must be a lawyer. This means the lawyer is a rower, watches fantasy movies, prefers funk music, is Australian, and plays tennis. This is also consistent with the given conditions.

13. Since both possibilities are consistent with the given conditions, we cannot determine the exact hobby of the rower based on the given information. However, we can determine the rest of the table:

   |               |      1       |     2     |      3      |
   | Hobby         | Rowing      | Cooking   | Fishing     |
   | Job           | Architect   | Lawyer    | Lawyer      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy     | Drama     | Martial-Arts|
   | Music-Genre   | Funk        | Techno    | Electronic   |
   | Nationality   | Argentine   | Australian | German      |
   | Sport         | Tennis      | Basketball | Rowing      |

   The exact hobby of the rower (Architect or Lawyer) cannot be determined based on the given information.

Final solution:

Lv4-6x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, pets, and transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 3 for each category.

2. From point 1.2, the fan of electronic is in the middle (between the person driving the airplane and the person driving the motorbike). So, let's assign the fan of electronic to job 2, and the person driving the airplane to job 3 (far left or far right as per point 8.11), and the person driving the motorbike to job 1.

3. From point 2.3, the American is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since the fan of electronic (American's right as per point 6) is in the middle, the person watching animation movies must be on the left. So, let's assign the animation movie-genre to job 1, and the person watching animation movies to nationality 2 (American's left as per point 2.2).

4. From point 3.3, the person watching time-travel movies is the fan of dubstep. Since the fan of electronic is dubstep's left (as per point 1.3), the person watching time-travel movies must be on the right. So, let's assign the time-travel movie-genre to job 3, and the person watching time-travel movies to music-genre 1 (dubstep).

5. From point 4.4, the owner of the rat is the fan of jazz. Since the fan of electronic is on the right of the person watching animation movies (as per point 1.2), and the person watching time-travel movies is on the right (as per point 4), the owner of the rat must be on the left. So, let's assign the jazz music-genre to job 2, and the owner of the rat to pet 1 (rat).

6. From point 5.5, the Thai is on the left of the freelancer. Since the American is on the left of the person watching animation movies (as per point 3), and the person watching animation movies is job 1, the freelancer must be job 3. So, let's assign the Thai nationality to job 2.

7. From point 7.7, the owner of the snake is in an odd position. Since the American is on the left (even position as per point 3), the Thai is on the left of the freelancer (even position as per point 6), and the fan of electronic is in the middle (odd position), the owner of the snake must be on the right of the fan of electronic (odd position as per point 6). So, let's assign the snake pet to job 1.

8. From point 9.9, the owner of the snake is on the right of the American. Since the American is on the left (as per point 3), the owner of the snake must be job 3. So, we already know that the snake is job 1's right (as per point 7), so the airplane driver (job 3) must be on the right of the snake owner (job 1).

9. From point 10.10, the owner of the rat is on the far left. Since the American is on the left (as per point 3), and the owner of the rat is the leftmost pet (as per point 10), the American must be the far left person. So, the airplane driver (job 3) must be on the far right (as per point 8.11).

10. From point 11.11, the person driving the airplane is on the far right. Since the American is on the far left (as per point 9), the motorbike driver (job 1) must be on the far left.

11. From point 12.12, the fan of electronic is on the right of the person watching animation movies. Since the American is on the far left (as per point 9), and the motorbike driver (job 1) is the leftmost person (as per point 11), the fan of electronic (job 2) must be on the right of the motorbike driver (job 1).

Lv4-6x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person eating pepper, we can place them in the same row (let's say row 1). So, Hot-Chocolate is in column 1 or 3, and Pepper is in column 2.

2. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the owner of the horse. Since the horse is one of the pets, it must be in row 3. So, the person collecting is in column 1, 2, or 3 of row 3. Let's say they are in column 1 (to avoid having them in the same column as the person drinking hot-chocolate).

3. The person eating zucchini is the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter is one of the transports, it must be in row 3. So, Zucchini is in column 2 or 3 of row 3. Let's say they are in column 3.

4. The person driving the boat is on the right of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of r&b is in an even position (row 1 or 3), the boat driver must be in row 2. So, Boat is in column 1, 2, or 3 of row 2.

5. The fan of techno is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since we know the positions of hot-chocolate, coffee, and milk, we can check the possibilities. If techno is in row 1, it would violate rule 10. So, techno must be in row 3. This means Milk is in column 2 of row 3.

6. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the lizard. Since we know the position of hot-chocolate, we can place the lizard in the same row and the opposite column (column 3).

7. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we know the position of hot-chocolate, we can check the possibilities. If card-games is in column 1 of row 3, it would violate rule 2. So, card-games must be in column 2 of row 3.

8. The fan of r&b is in an even position. Since we know the position of r&b, it is in an even column (column 2).

9. The fan of disco is on the right of the fan of r&b. Since we know the position of r&b, Disco must be in column 3 of row 1 or 3. Since Disco can't be in row 1 (it would violate rule 9), it must be in row 3.

10. The fan of r&b is on the left of the person drinking coffee. Since we know the position of r&b, Coffee must be in column 1 of row 1.

11. The person eating apricot is the remaining food. Since the remaining transports are boat and scooter, they must be in row 2. Since the boat is already placed, the scooter must be in column 3 of row 2. This means Apricot is in column 1 of row 2.

Lv4-6x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of jazz is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile, and the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left, the fan of jazz cannot be in the first position. So, the fan of jazz must be in either the second or third position. Let's assume the fan of jazz is in the second position.

2. The dancer is the person eating plum, so the dancer must be in the third position.

3. The person who's sport is golf is in an even position. Since the first position is occupied, the golf player must be in the second, fourth, or sixth position. Let's assume the golf player is in the fourth position.

4. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the fan of jazz is in the second position and the fan of blues cannot be in the first position (as the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left), the fan of blues must be in the third position.

5. The person driving the train is the person eating kiwi, so the person eating kiwi must be in the first position.

6. The person who's sport is surfing must be in an odd position, so the surfing person can only be in the third or fifth position. Let's assume the surfing person is in the fifth position.

7. The security-guard is on the right of the fan of blues, so the security-guard must be in the fourth or sixth position. Since the golf player is in the fourth position, the security-guard must be in the sixth position.

8. The person who's sport is golf is between the person who's sport is surfing and the security-guard. Given our assumptions, the golf player is in the fourth position, the surfing person is in the fifth position, and the security-guard is in the sixth position. This condition is satisfied.

9. The fan of jazz is on the far right, so the fan of reggae must be in the first position.

10. The person eating lime is in an even position. Given our assumptions, the lime eater can only be in the second, fourth, or sixth position. Since the fan of jazz is in the second position and the fan of blues is in the third position, the lime eater must be in the sixth position.

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill the table with 3 different symbols (let's use A, B, and C).

2. From point 1, the gospel fan is in an even position, so it can't be in position 1 or 3. So, gospel is either B or C. Let's assume B is gospel for now.

|               |      1      |      2      |        3        |

3. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker can't be in position 1 (as the gospel fan can't be in position 1), the dressmaker must be in position 2 or 3. If the dressmaker is in position 2, then the epic fan must be in position 3. But that would mean the gospel fan is in position 1, which contradicts our assumption. So, the dressmaker must be in position 3.

4. The person who's hobby is gardening is the person watching zombie movies. Since the gardener can't be in position 1 or 3 (as the dressmaker and the gospel fan are already there), the gardener must be in position 2.

5. The person drinking juice is between the person drinking almond-milk and the project-manager. Since the project-manager is in position 3 and the almond-milk drinker can't be in position 3 (as the dressmaker is there), the almond-milk drinker must be in position 1. So, juice must be in position 2.

7. The project-manager is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the techno fan is in position 1 and the project-manager is driving the motorbike, the project-manager can't be in position 3. So, the project-manager must be in position 2.

Lv4-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the journalist is on the far left or far right, let's assume the journalist is on the far right for now (we'll check later if it's consistent). This means the journalist is in position 3.

2. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the far left, so it's in position 1.

3. The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the entrepreneur. Since the journalist is in position 3, the entrepreneur must be in position 2. So, the sport of basketball is in position 4.

4. The person watching romance movies is in an even position. Since we've placed the journalist, entrepreneur, and basketball player, the only even position left is position 2. So, the person watching romance movies is in position 2.

5. The person watching action movies is in an odd position. Since we've placed the journalist, entrepreneur, fisherman, basketball player, and romance movie watcher, the only odd positions left are positions 1 and 3. Let's place the action movie watcher in position 1 for now.

6. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the fisherman is in position 1 and the basketball player is in position 4, the roller driver must be in position 3. So, the hobby of card-games is in position 2.

7. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the basketball player is in position 4 and the roller driver is in position 3, the tennis player must be in position 5.

8. The person watching family movies is in an odd position. Since we've placed the journalist, entrepreneur, fisherman, basketball player, romance movie watcher, action movie watcher, and tennis player, the only odd positions left are positions 1 and 3. However, position 1 is already taken by the action movie watcher. So, the person watching family movies is in position 3.

9. The fan of pop is in an even position. Since we've placed the journalist, entrepreneur, fisherman, basketball player, romance movie watcher, action movie watcher, tennis player, and family movie watcher, the only even position left is position 2. So, the fan of pop is in position 2.

10. The fan of blues is the person watching family movies (from rule 14).

11. The person driving the train is the fan of ambient (from rule 11).

12. The fan of pop is on the left of the person driving the car. Since the pop fan is in position 2 and the train driver (ambient fan) is in position 6, the car driver must be in position 5.

13. The entrepreneur is on the left or right of the fan of blues (from rule 13). Since the entrepreneur is in position 2 and the blues fan (family movie watcher) is in position 3, the entrepreneur is in position 2 (left of the blues fan).

Now let's check our assumptions:
- The journalist is on the far right, which is consistent with our initial assumption.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
| Hobby         | fishing  | card-games  |   pop      |
| Job           | entrepreneur | journalist  |           |
| Movie-Genre   | family   |           | romance   |
| Music-Genre   | blues    |           |   ambient |
| Sport         | basketball| rowing     |   tennis  |
| Transport     | roller   | car        |   train   |

This table satisfies all the given rules."
