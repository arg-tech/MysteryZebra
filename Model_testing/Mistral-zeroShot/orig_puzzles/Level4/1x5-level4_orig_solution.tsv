Lv4-1x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 different music genres, and one of them (house) is in the middle. So, the middle cell should contain 'house'.

2. The fan of disco is on the left of the fan of pop. Since we know the house is in the middle, the leftmost cell cannot contain house, so it must be either disco or pop. Let's assume it's disco for now.

3. The fan of hip-hop is in an odd position. Since we have already filled the middle position with house, the odd positions are 1, 3, and 5. However, since the fan of disco is on the left of pop, the leftmost cell cannot be hip-hop. So, the third position must contain house, and the fifth position must contain hip-hop.

4. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of d&b. Since we have already placed hip-hop in the fifth position, the fourth position must contain d&b.

5. Now, we are left with the second position. Since the fan of disco is on the left of pop, and we have already placed disco in the first position, the second position must contain pop.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| disco     | pop | house | d&b  | hip-hop |

Lv4-1x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard is on the far right (rule 4), the motorbike cannot be on the far left (rule 2). So, the motorbike must be on the right of the skateboard.

2. The person driving the train is on the far left (rule 2).

3. The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position (rule 3). Since the train is on the far left (rule 2), the quad-bike cannot be in the first position. Also, the skateboard is on the far right (rule 4), so the quad-bike cannot be in the last position. So, the quad-bike can only be in the third position.

4. The person driving the skateboard is on the far right (rule 4).

5. The person driving the quad-bike is in the middle (rule 5). Since the quad-bike is in the third position, the skateboard must be in the fifth position.

Now, let's put the final solution:

Since we don't have information about the van, we can't place it in the table. However, we know that it's not in the first, second, third, or fifth positions. So, the van can be in the fourth position.

Lv4-1x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the positions are odd for both the helicopter and the bike, they cannot be in the same position. So, let's place the helicopter in position 1 (odd) and the bike in position 3 (odd).

2. The skateboard is to the left or right of the bike. Since the bike is in position 3, the skateboard can be in position 2 or 4. Let's place it in position 2 for now.

3. Now, the train must be in position 5 (far right).

4. The person driving the bike is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. The bike is in position 3, so the jet-ski must be in position 1 or 5. Since the helicopter is already in position 1, the jet-ski must be in position 5.

5. Now, we have the skateboard in position 2, the bike in position 3, the jet-ski in position 5, and the train in position 4. But this leaves position 1 empty. Since the helicopter is already placed, the only remaining transport is the jet-ski, which cannot be in position 1 due to rule 5. This means our initial placement of the skateboard in position 2 was incorrect. So, let's try placing the skateboard in position 4 instead.

Now, the final solution table is:

  |             |     1      |    2    |  3   |     4      |   5   |

Lv4-1x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the social worker is on the far left, we know that the social worker is in position 1.

2. Now, we know that the bartender is either to the left or right of the social worker. If the bartender were in position 2, then the architect (who is in an odd position and not the social worker) would have to be in position 3, which would mean the police officer (who is to the right of the bartender) would have to be in position 4, but that would leave position 5 empty, which is not possible since there are 5 different jobs. So, the bartender cannot be in position 2.

3. Therefore, the bartender must be in position 3, and the social worker is in position 1. This means the architect is in position 5 (since it's an odd position and not the social worker or bartender).

4. Now, the police officer must be to the right of the bartender, so the police officer is in position 4.

5. Finally, we have filled all the positions, so the final solution table is:

2. Since the taxi is on the left of the quad-bike, the quad-bike must be in position 3.

3. Now, the motorbike is to the right of the quad-bike (position 4), and the jet-ski is to the right of the motorbike. So, the motorbike is in position 2 and the jet-ski is in position 5.

4. The only remaining position for the scooter is position 1.

Lv4-1x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Egyptian is not on the leftmost position (as the Canadian is in an odd position and the table is numbered from 1), the Egyptian cannot be in the first position.

2. The Canadian is in an odd position and not the first position, so the Canadian must be in the third position.

3. The German is between the Canadian and the Russian, so the German must be in the second position.

4. The Russian is on the right of the German, so the Russian must be in the fourth position.

5. The Egyptian is on the right of the Russian, so the Egyptian must be in the fifth position.

6. The only nationality left is Thai, and since there are only 5 positions, the Thai must be in the first position.

The final solution table is:

Lv4-1x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The owner of the guinea-pig is between the owner of the fish and the owner of the horse. This means the guinea-pig cannot be in position 1 (leftmost) or 5 (rightmost), as the fish is already in position 1 and the horse cannot be in position 5 (since there are only 5 pets). So, the possible positions for the guinea-pig are 2, 3, or 4.

2. The owner of the goldfish is in an even position. Since the fish is already in position 1 (which is odd), the goldfish cannot be in position 1. So, the goldfish can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6 (which is not given, but we'll consider it for now).

3. The owner of the fish is on the far left. This means the fish is in position 1.

Now, let's see if we can place the goldfish and the guinea-pig based on the information we have:

- If the goldfish is in position 2, then the guinea-pig must be in position 3 (since the guinea-pig is between the fish and the horse). But this would mean the horse is in position 4 or 5, which contradicts the given information that the guinea-pig is between the owner of the fish and the owner of the horse. So, the goldfish cannot be in position 2.

- If the goldfish is in position 4, then the guinea-pig can be in position 2 or 3. If the guinea-pig is in position 2, then the horse must be in position 5 (since the guinea-pig is between the fish and the horse). If the guinea-pig is in position 3, then the horse can be in position 2 or 4. In both cases, the conditions are met.

So, the possible arrangement is:

|       |  1   |     2      |   3   |    4     |    5    |
| Pet   | fish | goldfish  | guinea-pig | horse | hamster |

However, the puzzle does not provide information about the position of the hamster. Since there are only 5 pets and all other positions are filled, the hamster must be in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|       |  1   |     2      |   3   |    4     |    5    |
| Pet   | fish | goldfish  | guinea-pig | horse | hamster |

Lv4-1x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of classical is either to the left or right of the fan of country. Let's assume that classical is to the right of country for now. This means the arrangement could be: [Classical, Country, ...].

2. The fan of soul is to the right of the fan of rock. Since we assumed classical is to the right of country, the only possible position for rock is to the left of classical, making the arrangement [Country, Rock, Classical, ...].

3. Now, the fan of soul must be to the left of the fan of classical. This means soul can only be in the first or second position. However, if soul were in the first position, it would be to the left of country, which contradicts rule 1. So, soul must be in the second position, making the arrangement [Country, Soul, Rock, Classical, ...].

4. The fan of classical is in an even position. Since we have already placed classical in the fourth position, this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Country  | Soul | Rock | Classical |

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv4-1x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

2. From rule 1, the person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon. Since the kiwi is in an even position, it can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the watermelon must be in position 1 or 5.

3. From rule 2, the person eating zucchini is on the far left or far right. Since the watermelon is not in position 1, the zucchini must be in position 1.

4. From rule 3, the person eating lemon is on the right of the person eating peach. So, the peach must be in position 2 or 4.

5. From rule 4, the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating lemon. Since the kiwi is in position 3 or 5, the lemon must be in position 2.

6. From rule 5, the person eating lemon is on the left or right of the person eating peach. Since the lemon is in position 2, the peach must be in position 4.

Lv4-1x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 5 people and the fan of pop is in an even position (4th or 5th), and the fan of jazz is in the middle (3rd position), we can deduce that the fan of pop is in the 5th position.

2. Now we know the positions of the fans of pop and jazz. Since the fan of classical is on the right of the fan of hip-hop, and the fan of classical is on the far right, the only possible position for the fan of hip-hop is the 1st position.

3. The fan of jazz is in the middle, so the positions are: 1 (hip-hop), 3 (jazz), and 5 (pop).

4. Since the fan of classical is on the right of the fan of hip-hop, the only remaining position for classical is the 2nd position.

5. The remaining genre is gospel. Since there are no restrictions on its position, it can be placed in any of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since we have already placed the other genres, gospel must be in the 4th position.
