Lv4-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is writing is in an odd position (4, 1, 3, or 2 from left). Let's assume for now that the person driving the airplane (writing) is in position 4.

2. The person driving the bus is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the writing person is in position 4, the drama person must be in position 3.

3. Now, we know that the writing person is in position 4, and the drama person is in position 3. This means the hobby of the person in position 1 must be one of the remaining three (hiking, skydiving, or reading). Let's assume the person in position 1 is hiking for now.

4. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person driving the ship (3 or 5). Since the bus and drama are in positions 3 and 2, the boat can't be in position 1 (as it would be on the left of the bus, violating rule 2). So, the boat must be in position 5. This means the ship is in position 1.

5. The person driving the ship is between the person watching satire movies and the person who's hobby is hiking (2 or 4). Since the ship is in position 1, the satire person must be in position 2, and the hiking person must be in position 3.

6. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking (2 or 4). Since the satire person is in position 2, the martial-arts person must be in position 4.

7. The person driving the boat is on the far left or far right (1 or 4). Since the boat is in position 5, it's not on the far left or far right. So, the boat must be in position 2. This means the writing person is not in position 4 (as the boat is in position 2), so the writing person must be in position 1.

8. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving (position 6). Since the ship is in position 1, the skydiving person must be in position 6.

9. Now, the only hobby left is reading. Since the writing person is in position 1, the reading person must be in position 3.

10. The last remaining position (position 5) is for the boat.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1       |   2    |    3    |     4     |
| Hobby         | Writing     | Boat   | Reading | Skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   |            |        |         |           |
| Transport     | Airplane   |        |         | Ship      |

Now, let's fill in the missing movie genres and transport:

1. The person driving the airplane (writing) can't have a movie genre that is on the left of the person driving the boat (reading), so the writing person can't watch crime, drama, or martial-arts movies. The only remaining genre is satire.

2. The person driving the boat (reading) can't watch satire movies (as it's on the left of the writing person), so the reading person can't watch crime, drama, or martial-arts movies either. The only remaining genre for the reading person is crime.

3. The person watching satire movies (writing) can't watch crime or martial-arts movies (as they are on the left of the reading person), so the satire person must watch drama.

4. The person watching drama movies (bus) can't watch martial-arts movies (as they are on the left or right of the hiking person, who is the writing person), so the drama person can't watch martial-arts movies. The only remaining genre for the drama person is martial-arts.

5. The person watching martial-arts movies (hiking) can't watch crime or satire movies (as they are on the left or right of the writing person), so the martial-arts person can't watch crime or satire movies. The only remaining genre for the martial-arts person is crime.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1       |   2    |    3    |     4     |
| Hobby         | Writing     | Boat   | Reading | Skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire     | Crime  | Crime   | Martial-Arts |
| Transport     | Airplane   |        |         | Ship      |

Now, let's fill in the missing transport for the remaining people:

1. The person driving the boat (reading) can't use the airplane or ship (as they are on the left of the writing person or on the left of the hiking person), so the boat person can't use the airplane or ship. The only remaining transport for the boat person is the bus.

2. The person driving the ship (skydiving) can't use the airplane (as it's driven by the writing person), so the ship person can't use the airplane. The only remaining transport for the ship person is the bus.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1       |   2    |    3    |     4     |
| Hobby         | Writing     | Boat   | Reading | Skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire     | Crime  | Crime   | Martial-Arts |
| Transport     | Airplane   | Bus    | Bus     | Bus       |

Now, let's check the puzzle constraints:

1. The person driving the airplane is the person who's hobby is writing (1st row, 1st column).
2. The person driving the bus is on the left of the person watching drama movies (2nd row, 2nd column is on the left of 3rd row, 3rd column).
3. The person who's hobby is writing is in an odd position (1st row, 1st column is odd).
4. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person driving the ship (2nd row, 2nd column is on the left or right of 1st row, 1st column).
5. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking (4th row, 4th column is on the left or right of 3rd row, 3rd column).
6. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving (1st row, 1st column is on the left of 4th row, 4th column).
7. The person driving the boat is on the far left or far right (2nd row, 2nd column is on the far left or far right).
8. The person driving the ship is between the person watching satire movies and the person who's hobby is hiking (1st row, 1st column is between 2nd row, 2nd column and 3rd row, 3rd column).

All the constraints are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

Lv4-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku, and the person driving the airplane is on the far right, the person who's hobby is sudoku cannot be in the first or fourth position. Also, the person who's hobby is sudoku is in an even position, so it can't be in the third position either. So, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in the second position.

2. The person who's hobby is video-games is the mexican, so the mexican must be in the third position.

3. The American is between the person who's hobby is video-games and the person who's hobby is singing. Since the mexican is in the third position, the American must be in the second or fourth position. However, the American cannot be in the fourth position because the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the Japanese, and the Japanese must be in the first position (as we will see later). So, the American must be in the second position.

4. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the Japanese. Since the American is in the second position and cannot be the person who's hobby is singing, the Japanese must be in the first position.

5. The polish is between the Japanese and the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the Japanese is in the first position and the person who's hobby is sudoku is in the second position, the polish must be in the fourth position.

6. Now we know the positions of the Japanese, American, Polish, and the person who's hobby is sudoku. The person who's hobby is singing must be in the fifth position, as it is on the left of the Japanese.

7. The only hobby left is dancing. Since the person who's hobby is dancing cannot be in the first or fourth position (as the first is occupied by the Japanese and the fourth by the polish), and cannot be in the second position (as it is occupied by the American), the person who's hobby is dancing must be in the third position.

8. The person driving the taxi is on the far left. Since the positions are already filled, the person driving the taxi must be the person who's hobby is dancing. The person driving the boat must be the person who's hobby is singing, as it is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. The person driving the jet-ski is the only one left, so it must be the person who's hobby is video-games.

Final solution table:

|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |    4     |
| Hobby         | Japanese    | American | Mexican | Polish   |

| Transport     |             | Taxi    | Boat    | Jet-ski  |

Now, let's fill the missing nationalities and hobbies:

|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |    4     |

| Nationality   | Japanese    | American | Mexican | Polish   |
| Transport     | Taxi        | Boat     | Jet-ski | Airplane |

Since the Japanese is in the first position, the nationality in the first position is Japanese. Since the American is in the second position, the nationality in the second position is American. Since the Mexican is in the third position, the nationality in the third position is Mexican. Since the Polish is in the fourth position, the nationality in the fourth position is Polish.

Since the Japanese is in the first position, the hobby in the first position is singing (as it is on the left of the Japanese). Since the American is in the second position, the hobby in the second position is dancing (as it is the only hobby left). Since the Mexican is in the third position, the hobby in the third position is video-games. Since the Polish is in the fourth position, the hobby in the fourth position is sudoku (as it is in an even position).

Final solution table:

Lv4-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the German is between the person eating grapefruit and the person eating tomato. Let's place the German in the middle (position 3) for now. This means the person eating grapefruit is in position 1 and the person eating tomato is in position 4.

2. The Argentine is the person driving the train, so the train is in position 2.

3. The person driving the motorbike is the person eating lemon. Since the motorbike driver is on the right of the person eating tomato (position 4), and the German (who is eating grapefruit) is in position 3, the motorbike driver must be in position 1. So, the lemon is in position 1.

4. The person driving the snowmobile is not specified yet, but we know the German is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the German is in position 3, the snowmobile must be in position 5.

5. The canadian is between the person eating kiwi and the American. Since the American is not placed yet, let's place the Kiwi in position 2 (on the left of the train, which is the Argentine). This means the Canadian is in position 3 (to the right of the Kiwi and to the left of the American, who we will place in position 4).

6. Now, we know the positions of all the foods. The nationalities and transports can be filled in based on the remaining clues:

   - The person driving the roller is not specified yet, but since the person eating tomato is in an odd position (4), the roller must be driven by the American (in position 1, 3, or 5). However, since the American is already placed, the roller must be driven by the Canadian (in position 5).

   - The person driving the snowmobile is the German (in position 5).

   - The final table is:

     |               |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4     |
     | Food          | Lemon      | Kiwi   | Canadian   | Tomato    |
     | Nationality   | German     | Argentine| Canadian   | American   |
     | Transport     | Motorbike  | Train   | Roller     | Snowmobile |

   - However, the positions of the nationalities and transports are not important in this puzzle, so we can rearrange the table to have the nationalities in the first column and the transports in the second column:

     |               | German     | Argentine| Canadian   | American   |
     | Food          | Lemon      | Kiwi     | Roller     | Tomato     |
     | Transport     | Motorbike  | Train    | Snowmobile  | None       |

   - But since the puzzle asks for the final solution table with all the information, we should include the transport information for all the foods:

     |               | German     | Argentine| Canadian   | American   |
     | Food          | Lemon      | Kiwi     | Roller     | Tomato     |
     | Transport     | Motorbike  | Train    | None       | None       |

   - However, the puzzle does not provide information about the transport of the tomato, so we cannot definitively fill in that information.

   - So, the final table with all the information we can deduce is:

    #############
     |               | German     | Argentine| Canadian   | American   |
     | Food          | Lemon      | Kiwi     | Roller     | Tomato     |
     | Transport     | Motorbike  | Train    | None       | None       |
    #############

   - The exact transport for the tomato is unknown based on the given information."
Lv4-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and each prefers a unique genre in each category, we can label the people as A, B, C, and D.

2. From point 1, we know that A prefers soul, so we can fill in the first row and first column with 'Soul' and 'A'.

3. From point 5, we know that A prefers badminton, so we can fill in the second row and first column with 'Badminton' and 'A'.

4. From point 2, the person watching disaster movies is the person who's sport is rowing. Since we know A is the person who prefers badminton, the person watching disaster movies must be B. So, we can fill in the third row and second column with 'Disaster' and 'B'.

5. From point 3, the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since B is the person who prefers rowing (disaster movies), C must prefer water-polo. So, we can fill in the third row and third column with 'Water-polo' and 'C'.

6. From point 6, the person watching horror movies is the fan of pop. Since we know C prefers water-polo, D must prefer pop. So, we can fill in the fourth row and second column with 'Horror' and 'D'.

7. From point 7, the fan of salsa is the person watching crime movies. Since we know D prefers pop (horror movies), A cannot prefer salsa (as it was already filled in the first row). So, B must prefer salsa. So, we can fill in the first row and third column with 'Crime' and 'B'.

8. Now, we are left with the second column. Since the positions are even, the person who prefers punk cannot be in the first or third position (as they are filled with A and B). So, the person who prefers punk must be C, and the person who prefers punk's music genre must be in the second row. But we already know that D prefers pop (horror movies), so the second row must be 'Punk'.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Soul     |   Badminton | Crime |   Pop   |
#############
|   A        |     A       | B     |   C     |
#############
|   Badminton| Disaster   |   Crime| Water-polo|
#############
|   A        |     B       | C     |   D     |
#############
```

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv4-3x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different nationalities and 4 sports, so each nationality must have a unique sport. Similarly, each means of transport must be associated with a unique nationality.

2. From point 1, we can assign each sport and transport to a nationality. Let's start with the sports:
   - Volleyball: Japanese (from point 1)
   - Rugby: Let's assign this to Colombian for now (we'll check later if it's valid)
   - Swimming: Canadian (since the Colombian is in an odd position and the Canadian must be on the far right, so we'll place the Colombian in position 4)
   - Golf: Let's assign this to American for now

3. Now let's assign the transports:
   - Bus: The bus driver is the person who does volleyball (from point 3), so the Japanese is driving the bus. Since the bus driver is in an even position (from point 5), the Japanese is in position 2.
   - Helicopter: The person in the helicopter is on the left of the volleyball player (from point 4), so the helicopter driver must be in position 1. Since the helicopter driver is not the Japanese (as the Japanese is driving the bus), the helicopter driver must be either American or Canadian. Let's assume it's American for now.
   - Jet-ski: From point 8, the Colombian is on the left or right of the jet-ski driver. Since the Colombian is in position 4, the jet-ski driver must be in position 3. Since the jet-ski driver is not the Japanese (as the Japanese is driving the bus) or American (as we assumed the American is driving the helicopter), the jet-ski driver must be Colombian.

4. Now let's check our assumptions about the sports:
   - The Colombian is doing rugby (from our initial assumption). This is valid because the Colombian is in position 4, which is an odd position (from point 5), and rugby is not golf or swimming (from our initial assignment), so it can be in an odd position.
   - The American is doing golf (from our initial assumption). This is valid because golf is not volleyball, rugby, or swimming, so it can be in an odd position (from point 9).
   - The Canadian is doing swimming (from our initial assumption). This is valid because swimming is not volleyball, rugby, or golf, so it can be in an even position (from point 5).

5. Now let's check our assumptions about the transports:
   - The American is driving the helicopter (from our initial assumption). This is valid because the American is not driving the bus or the jet-ski (since the Japanese and Colombian are driving those), and the American is not on the far left (since the sport of rugby is on the far left).

6. Finally, let's check the remaining clues:
   - The sport of rugby is on the far left (from point 6). This is valid because the Colombian is doing rugby and is in position 4, which is the far right, so rugby must be in position 1.
   - The person who's sport is golf is in an odd position (from point 9). This is valid because the American is doing golf and is in position 3, which is an odd position.

The final solution table is:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |    4     |
| Nationality   | American   | Japanese   | Colombian | Canadian |
| Sport         | Rugby      | Volleyball | Golf      | Swimming  |
| Transport     | Helicopter | Bus       | Jet-ski   | Van      |

| Sport         | Rugby      | Volleyball | Golf      | Swimming  |

Lv4-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the kiwi eater is in an odd position and there are 4 positions, the kiwi eater must be in position 1 or 3. However, since the chinchilla owner (who is the kiwi eater) is also the kiwi eater's left neighbor (point 6), the kiwi eater cannot be in position 1. So, the kiwi eater is in position 3.

2. The hamster owner is to the right of the sudoku person. Since the sudoku person cannot be in position 1 (as the kiwi eater is there), the sudoku person must be in position 2. This means the hamster owner is in position 4.

3. The chinchilla owner (kiwi eater) is in position 3.

4. The lemon eater is to the left of the guinea-pig owner. Since the hamster owner is in position 4, the guinea-pig owner must be in position 2 or 3. However, if the guinea-pig owner was in position 2, the lemon eater would have to be in position 1, which is occupied by the kiwi eater. So, the guinea-pig owner is in position 3. This means the lemon eater is in position 1.

5. The fishing person is on the far right, so they are in position 4.

6. The woodworking person is to the right of the camping person. Since the sudoku person is in position 2 and the fishing person is in position 4, the camping person must be in position 1. This means the woodworking person is in position 3.

7. The pepper eater is to the left of the kiwi eater (who is in position 3), so the pepper eater must be in position 2.

8. Now we have filled all the positions:

|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |

Lv4-3x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the guinea-pig watches comedy movies, so let's place the guinea-pig owner in the first column (Column 1) and the comedy genre in the corresponding row (Row 1). Let's assume the beverage for the guinea-pig owner is Beverage 1 (7up). So, we have:

   | Beverage 1 (7up) | Comedy | Pet 1 (Guinea-pig) |

2. The owner of the goat is between the person watching time-travel movies and the owner of the chinchilla. Since we already placed the guinea-pig owner and the time-travel movies, let's place the chinchilla owner in the third column (Column 3) and the chinchilla in the corresponding row (Row 3). Now, the goat owner must be between Row 1 (time-travel movies) and Row 3 (chinchilla owner). Since Row 2 is empty, the goat owner must be in Row 2. Let's assume the beverage for the goat owner is Beverage 2 (hot-chocolate). So, we have:

   | Beverage 1 (7up) | Comedy | Pet 1 (Guinea-pig) |
   | Beverage 2 (hot-chocolate) | Time-travel | Pet 2 (Goat) |
   | Beverage 3 | Martial-arts | Pet 3 (Chinchilla) |

3. The person watching time-travel movies is the person drinking hot-chocolate, so we have confirmed that.

4. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the martial-arts genre is not in the first or third column, it must be in the second column. Let's assume the beverage for the martial-arts watcher is Beverage 4 (tea). So, we have:

   | Beverage 1 (7up) | Comedy | Pet 1 (Guinea-pig) |
   | Beverage 2 (hot-chocolate) | Time-travel | Pet 2 (Goat) |
   | Beverage 4 (tea) | Martial-arts | Pet 3 (Chinchilla) |
   | Beverage 3 | Satire | Pet 4 (Horse) |

5. The person drinking 7up is in an even position. Since we have already placed 3 beverages, the 7up must be in the fourth column (Column 4). But we have already placed the satire genre in the second row, so the satire must be in the first row. This contradicts our initial assumption that the guinea-pig owner drinks 7up.

However, if we assume that the guinea-pig owner drinks tea instead of 7up, then the satire can be in the second row, and the 7up can be in the fourth column. So, the corrected table is:

   | Beverage 4 (tea) | Comedy | Pet 1 (Guinea-pig) |
   | Beverage 2 (hot-chocolate) | Time-travel | Pet 2 (Goat) |
   | Beverage 1 (7up) | Satire | Pet 3 (Chinchilla) |
   | Beverage 3 | Martial-arts | Pet 4 (Horse) |

6. The person watching comedy movies is the person drinking 7up. This is already confirmed.

7. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the far left or far right. Since the guinea-pig is in the first column, it is on the far left.

8. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person drinking tea. This is already confirmed.

So, the final solution table is:

   | Beverage 4 (tea) | Comedy | Pet 1 (Guinea-pig) |
   | Beverage 2 (hot-chocolate) | Time-travel | Pet 2 (Goat) |
   | Beverage 1 (7up) | Satire | Pet 3 (Chinchilla) |

1. We know that the hobbies, jobs, and music-genres are different for each person, so we can fill in the first row with unique hobbies (let's say H1, H2, H3, H4). Similarly, we can fill in the second row with unique jobs (J1, J2, J3, J4) and the third row with unique music-genres (M1, M2, M3, M4).

2. From point 7, we know that the person with hobby H3 (chess) is in an even position. Since there are 4 people, the even positions are 2 and 4. However, from point 8, we know that H3 is between H2 and H4, so H3 cannot be in position 4. Therefore, H3 is in position 2.

3. From point 8, we also know that H3 (chess) is between H2 and H4. Since H3 is in position 2, H2 must be in position 1 and H4 in position 3.

4. From point 4, we know that the person with hobby H4 (drawing) is on the right of the fan of electronic. Since H4 is in position 3, the fan of electronic must be in position 1, 2, or 4. However, from point 3, we know that the fan of electronic cannot be in position 1 (because it would be on the left of H3, which violates point 3). So, the fan of electronic must be in position 4.

5. From point 5, we know that the fan of disco is between J1 and H3. Since H3 is in position 2 and J1 must be in an odd position (because H3 is in an even position), the fan of disco can only be in position 1 or 3. However, from point 4, we know that the fan of electronic is in position 4, so the fan of disco must be in position 1.

6. From point 6, we know that the fan of house is on the left or right of the scientist. Since the scientist is H3 (chess) and is in position 2, the fan of house can only be in position 1 or 3. However, from point 5, we know that the fan of disco is in position 1, so the fan of house must be in position 3.

7. Now we know the positions of all hobbies, so we can fill in the third row with the corresponding music-genres (M1, M2, M3, M4).

8. Finally, we can fill in the second row with the corresponding jobs (J1, J2, J3, J4).

The final solution table is:

Lv4-3x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the entrepreneur is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5), and the social-worker is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5), they cannot be in the same position. So, the entrepreneur cannot be in position 1 or 5. Therefore, the entrepreneur must be in position 3.

2. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the entrepreneur (position 3). Since the entrepreneur is in position 3, the person drinking coffee can be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the person drinking coffee is in position 1.

3. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the entrepreneur (position 3). Since the person drinking coffee is in position 1, the person drinking water can be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the person drinking water is in position 2.

4. The person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person drinking coffee (position 1). So, rugby can be in position 4.

5. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing (position not determined yet). Since the person drinking water is in position 2, the person who's sport is skiing can be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the person who's sport is skiing is in position 1. This means the person drinking fanta is in position 3.

6. The manager is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking water is in position 2, the person drinking iced-tea can be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the person drinking iced-tea is in position 5. This means the manager is in position 4.

7. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the entrepreneur (position 3). So, weightlifting can be in position 4 or 5. Since the manager is in position 5, weightlifting cannot be in position 5. Therefore, weightlifting is in position 4.

8. Now, the only position left for the person who's sport is skiing is position 1. This means the person who's sport is skiing is in position 1.

9. The final table is:

|            |       1       |    2    |      3       |       4       |
| Beverage   | coffee       | water   | fanta       | iced-tea     |
| Job        |             |         |             | manager      |
| Sport      | skiing       | rugby   |             | weightlifting|

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|            |       1       |    2    |      3       |       4       |
| Beverage   | coffee       | water   | fanta       | iced-tea     |
| Job        |             |         |             | manager      |

Lv4-3x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The lizard owner is on the left or right of the indie fan in position 3. Let's assume the lizard owner is in position 3 (L). Since there are only 4 positions, the indie fan must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the indie fan is in position 1 (I). This means the lizard owner is in position 3.

2. The Canadian is on the far left or far right. Since the lizard owner is in position 3, the Canadian cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the Canadian must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the Canadian is in position 4 (C).

3. The owner of the horse is on the right of the electronic fan. Since the indie fan is in position 1 and the lizard owner is in position 3, the electronic fan must be in position 2. The horse owner must be in position 4 (H).

4. The nigerian is between the electronic fan and the country fan. Since the electronic fan is in position 2 and the country fan must be in an odd position (not position 1 or 3), the nigerian must be in position 3 (N).

5. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the electronic fan. Since the electronic fan is in position 2, the mouse owner must be in position 1 or 4. However, we already know the mouse owner is the indie fan (from point 6), so the mouse must be in position 1 (M).

6. The owner of the mouse is the fan of indie. This is already confirmed in the previous point.

7. The turkish is on the far right. Since the nigerian is in position 3, the turkish must be in position 4 (T).

8. The fan of country is in an odd position. Since the country fan cannot be in position 1 (already taken by the mouse), the country fan must be in position 5 (C).

9. The malaysian is between the punk fan and the indie fan. Since the indie fan is in position 1 and the malaysian cannot be in position 4 (already taken by the Canadian), the malaysian must be in position 2 (Ml). The punk fan must be in position 3 (P).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |  Indie   |  Malay   |   Nigerian|   Turkish|
| Nationality   |          |          |            |         |
| Pet           |  Mouse   |          |   Lizard   |   Horse  |

Since we don't have information about the nationality and pet for positions 1, 3, and 5, they remain blank. However, we know the music genres for these positions: country, punk, and country again (since the country fan is repeated). So, the final table should look like this:

#############
|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |  Country |  Malay   |   Nigerian|   Turkish|
| Nationality   |          |          |            |         |
| Pet           |  Country |          |   Lizard   |   Horse  |
#############

We can't determine the nationality and pet for positions 1, 3, and 5 with the given information."
