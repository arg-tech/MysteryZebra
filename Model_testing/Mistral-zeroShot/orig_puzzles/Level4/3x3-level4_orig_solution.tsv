Lv4-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 music-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 sports, each category will have one item in each row.

2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is in an even position##4. This means the skateboarder is either in position 2 or 4.

3. The thai is on the left of the indian. This means the thai must be in position 1 and the indian in position 3.

4. The fan of classical is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the thai is in position 1 and we don't know the sport of the thai yet, we can't determine the position of classical yet. But we know it's not in position 1 or 3.

5. The fan of pop is on the far left. This means pop is in position 1.

6. Now we know the thai is in position 1, the indian in position 3, and pop in position 1. We also know that the skateboarder is in an even position##4, so the skateboarder must be in position 4.

7. The only genre left is classical, and it must be in position 2.

8. The thai's nationality is known, but we don't have specific sports associated with each nationality yet. However, we know that the person who plays badminton is to the left of the classical fan, so the badminton player must be in position 3.

9. The only sport left is climbing, so it must be in position 2.

Here is the final solution table:

```
                 | Pop     | Classical | Skateboarding |
Music-Genre     |         |           |               |
Nationality     | Thai    |           |               |
Sport          | Climbing|           | Badminton     |
```

Now we have filled all the positions with the given conditions."
Lv4-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the teacher is eating nectarine, let's place the nectarine in one of the positions (1, 2, or 3). Let's place it in position 1 for now.

| Job     |           |           |          |

2. Since the teacher is in an even position, the teacher cannot be in position 3. So, the teacher must be in position 2.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |

3. The teacher is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the teacher is in position 2, the person with video-games must be in position 1 or 3. Let's place the person with video-games in position 1 for now.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |

| Job     |           |           |          |

5. The musician is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person with video-games is in position 1, the person with collecting must be in position 2. The only remaining hobby is chess, so it must be in position 1.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |

6. The person with video-games is on the left or right of the teacher. Since the teacher is in position 2, the person with video-games cannot be in position 1. So, the person with video-games must be in position 3.

7. The person eating cabbage is in position 2. So, the person eating avocado must be in position 1 and the person eating cabbage must be in position 3.

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |

Lv4-3x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is in an even position (4), it can't be in the first or third position. So, it must be in the second position. Let's assign the sports as follows:
   - First position: Skiing
   - Second position: Lacrosse
   - Third position: Weightlifting

2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person eating apple. So, the apple must be in the third position.

3. The fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of funk. Since funk can't be in the third position (because it's not a sport), it must be in the first position. So, reggae must be in the second or third position. But we know that the person eating plum is on the right of the person eating apple (who is weightlifting), so reggae can't be in the third position. Therefore, reggae must be in the second position.

4. The person eating plum is on the right of the person eating apple. So, plum must be in the first position.

5. The person eating plum is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since reggae is in the second position, plum can't be in the first position (because it's already on the right of reggae). So, plum must be in the third position.

Final solution table:

|               |        Plum      |     Reggae     |    Apple    |
| Food          |               |          |        |

| Sport         |               |          |        |

Now, let's fill in the missing information:

- Music-Genre: Funk (in the first position) and Hip-Hop (remaining genre)
- Since the person eating plum is on the left or right of the fan of reggae, and reggae is in the second position, the only remaining position for hip-hop is the first position.
- So, the final solution table is:

| Food          |               Apple |          Hip-Hop |        Plum |

Lv4-3x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the owner of the snake. This means mirinda cannot be in the far left position (as coffee is there), so it must be in the second or third position. Let's assume mirinda is in the second position for now.

2. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the writer. Since the writer cannot be in the far left position (as coffee is there), the writer must be in the third position. This means the goldfish owner must be in the first position. So, goldfish is in the first column and the writer is in the third column.

3. The social-worker is in an odd position. Since the social-worker cannot be in the far left position (as coffee is there), the social-worker must be in the first or third position. However, if the social-worker was in the first position, the writer would not be on the far left or far right, which contradicts rule 5. Therefore, the social-worker must be in the third position, which means the social-worker is a teacher (as teacher is on the right of the writer).

4. The person drinking coffee is on the far left. So, coffee is in the first column.

5. The writer is on the far left or far right. Since the writer is in the third column, the writer must be on the far right.

6. The teacher is on the right of the writer. This means the teacher is in the second position.

7. The only beverage left is hot-chocolate. It must be in the third column, as mirinda and coffee are already placed.

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage   | Coffee | Hot-Chocolate | Mirinda |
|-----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Job        | Social-Worker (Teacher) | Writer | Teacher (Social-Worker) |
| Pet        | Ferret | Snake | Goldfish |

However, there seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as the teacher is placed as a social-worker in the final position, which contradicts the given jobs. I would suggest rechecking the given jobs."
Lv4-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the American is on the left or right of the owner of the bird, and the owner of the bird is in an odd position, the American cannot be in the first position. So, the American must be in the third position.

2. The Australian is on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the American is in the third position and the American is not the owner of the mouse (as the American is not on the far left), the Australian must be in the first position.

3. The owner of the bird is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the American is the owner of the bird and cannot be in the first position, the person watching romance movies must be in the second position.

4. The person watching time-travel movies is on the far left. Since the Australian is in the first position and cannot be watching time-travel movies (as per condition 5), the person watching time-travel movies must be in the third position.

5. The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in the second position, the person watching satire movies can be in the first or third position. However, since the American is in the third position and cannot be the owner of the chinchilla (as per condition 1), the person watching satire movies must be in the first position.

6. Now we know the positions of all the nationalities. The owner of the mouse must be in the second position.

7. Since there are only three pets and we have placed all the nationalities, the pet for the second position must be the mouse.

8. The remaining pets are bird and chinchilla. Since the American is the owner of the bird and cannot be in the first position, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the first position. So, the pet for the first position is the chinchilla.

9. Finally, the pet for the third position is the bird.

The final solution table is:

Lv4-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking cola is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person who's hobby is singing. Let's assume the order is Cola, Quad-bike, Singing.

2. The person who's hobby is board-games is the person drinking milk. So, the order for hobbies is Board-games, ___, Singing.

3. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. So, the order for beverages is Cola, ___, Milk.

4. The person driving the car is in an even position. Since we have 3 positions and the car is not in the first position (as it's not cola), it must be in the second position. So, the order for transport is Boat, Car, ___, Quad-bike, ___, Singing.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Beverage    | Cola  | Milk | Sprite |
|------------|-------|------|--------|
| Hobby       |       | Board-games | Singing |
| Transport   | Boat | Car | Quad-bike |

Since we don't have any information about the first and last positions, we can't fill them in definitively. However, we can say that the first position can't be Cola, Milk, or Sprite, and the last position can't be Boat, Car, or Quad-bike.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage    | Cola  | Milk | Sprite |

Lv4-3x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person watching sports movies is between the owner of the frog and the person watching western movies. Let's denote the positions as follows:
   - F: Frog owner
   - W: Western movie watcher
   - S: Sports movie watcher
   - T: Tennis movie watcher
   - G: Golf movie watcher
   - K: Skateboarding movie watcher

   From this, we can deduce that the arrangement must be either F-S-W or S-F-W.

2. The owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. This means K must be to the left of R (Rat owner). So, the arrangement can't be F-S-W because that would place R to the left of S, not K. Therefore, the arrangement must be S-F-W.

3. The person who's sport is skateboarding is in an even position. Since we know the arrangement is S-F-W, K must be in the second position.

4. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis. This means T must be to the left of S. But we already know that K is to the left of S, so T must be to the left of K. However, K is in the second position, so T must be in the first position.

5. Now we know the first three positions: T-K-S. The only movie genre left is golf, so G must be in the fourth position, and W must be in the fifth position. The pets are frog, goldfish, and rat, so the last position must be the goldfish or rat owner. Since the rat owner is to the right of skateboarding, the goldfish owner must be in the last position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-3x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating corn, we can place them in columns 2 and 3, with corn in column 1. Let's assume corn is in column 1, pineapple in column 2, and potato in column 3 (for now).

2. The person who's sport is lacrosse is between the pilot and the person eating potato. Since we don't know the positions of the pilot and the person eating potato yet, we can't place lacrosse yet.

3. The photographer is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. If lacrosse is in column 2, then the photographer must be in column 3. If lacrosse is in column 3, then the photographer must be in column 2. Let's assume lacrosse is in column 2 for now. This means the photographer is in column 3.

4. The person eating potato is in an odd position. Since we have already placed the other two people, the only odd position left is column 1. However, this contradicts our initial assumption that pineapple is in column 2 and potato in column 3. So, our initial assumption was incorrect. Let's try placing potato in column 2 and pineapple in column 3.

5. The person who's sport is tennis is the person eating potato. This is now correct since we have placed potato in column 2 and tennis in row 3.

6. Now, the person who's sport is lacrosse is between the pilot and the person eating potato. Since we have placed potato in column 2 and pilot can't be in column 1 (because the person eating corn is in column 1), the only option left for the pilot is column 3. This means lacrosse must be in column 1.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |   1    |     2     |      3       |
  | Food    | Corn   | Pineapple | Potato (Tennis) |

However, we still don't know the job of the person eating corn and the job of the person in column 1 who plays lacrosse. We can't determine these without more information. So, the final solution table with unknowns is:

2. We know that the Pakistani is in an odd position, so they cannot be in the first or third position. Therefore, the nationalities must be in the order: Polish, Pakistani, Thai from left to right.

3. The Polish is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the Pakistani is in the second position (odd), the Polish must be in the first position. So, the nationalities are now Polish, Pakistani, Thai from left to right, and the rabbit cannot be in the first position.

4. The Pakistani is on the right of the Polish, so the nationalities are now Polish, Thai, Pakistani from left to right.

5. The person who's hobby is camping is between the owner of the goat and the person who's hobby is collecting. Since camping is in the second position, the goat cannot be in the first position (as it would mean camping is not between goat and collecting). So, the pets must be in the order: rabbit, goat, rat from left to right.

6. Now, we know that the Polish is in the first position, the Thai is in the third position, and the rabbit is not in the first position. The only possible arrangement for nationalities and pets is:

Lv4-3x3-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three jobs, movie-genres, and nationalities, so each row and each column should have one unique element.

2. The nurse is on the far right, so we can place her in the rightmost column, say column 3. Let's assume her job is J1, movie-genre is M3, and nationality is N3.

3. The person watching martial-arts movies is the person watching martial-arts movies, so M1 and M2 must be different from M3. Let's assume M1 is martial-arts, so M2 must be either epic or time-travel.

4. The german is on the left or right of the thai. Since the nurse is on the rightmost column, the thai cannot be in the rightmost column. So, the thai can only be in column 1 or 2. If the thai is in column 1, the german must be in column 3. If the thai is in column 2, the german can be in either column 1 or 3. Let's assume the thai is in column 1, so the german is in column 3.

5. The chef is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the nurse is the person watching martial-arts movies, the chef cannot be in column 3. So, the chef can only be in column 1 or 2. Since the german is in column 3, the chef cannot be in column 3 either. So, the chef must be in column 1.

6. The thai is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the thai is in column 1, the person watching time-travel movies must be in column 2 or 3. Since the chef is in column 1, the person watching time-travel movies cannot be in column 1. So, the person watching time-travel movies must be in column 3.

7. Now we know that M1 is martial-arts, M2 is time-travel, M3 is epic. Since the chef is in column 1, J1 must be chef. Since the person watching time-travel movies is in column 3, J3 must be the job of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the nurse is in column 3, J2 must be the job of the person in column 2.

8. Since the german is in column 3, N3 must be german. Since the thai is in column 1, N1 must be thai. Since the chef is in column 1, N2 must be the nationality of the person in column 2.
