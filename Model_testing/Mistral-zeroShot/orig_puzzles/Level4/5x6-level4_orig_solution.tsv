Lv4-5x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating raspberry is on the far left or far right, and there are no other raspberry eaters on the far left or right (as per points 16, 22, and 11), the raspberry eater must be in the middle. Let's place the raspberry eater in position 4.

2. The person eating lettuce is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the security-guard can't be in the middle (as per point 4), the security-guard must be in position 2 or 6. If the security-guard is in position 2, the lettuce eater must be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is already occupied by the raspberry eater, so the lettuce eater must be in position 3. If the security-guard is in position 6, the lettuce eater must be in position 5 or 6. But position 6 is already occupied by the raspberry eater, so the lettuce eater must be in position 5.

3. The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon (who we know is in position 4). Since the mystery watcher can't be in position 3 (as per point 2), the mystery watcher must be in position 2 or 6. But position 6 is already occupied by the raspberry eater, so the mystery watcher must be in position 2.

4. Now we know the positions of the raspberry eater, lettuce eater, and mystery watcher. The project-manager must be in an odd position (as per point 4), so the project-manager can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 1 is already occupied by the raspberry eater, so the project-manager must be in position 3 (eating banana as per point 15).

5. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the security-guard (as per point 14) and in an odd position (as per point 5). The only odd position left is position 1, so the martial-arts watcher must be in position 1.

6. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person eating avocado (as per point 7). Since the bus driver can't be in position 6 (as per point 11), the bus driver must be in position 5. The only position left for the avocado eater is position 1, so the avocado eater must be in position 1.

7. The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile (as per point 8). Since the snowmobile user can't be in position 6 (as per point 11), the snowmobile user must be in position 5. The only position left for the thriller watcher is position 6.

8. The scientist is on the right of the person watching thriller movies (as per point 10), so the scientist must be in position 7.

9. The person driving the van is on the far right (as per point 11), so the van driver must be in position 6.

10. The person eating papaya must be in an odd position (as per point 12), so the papaya eater must be in position 3.

11. The person watching adventure movies must be on the left of the person driving the trike (as per point 17). Since the trike driver can't be in position 1 (as per point 1), the trike driver must be in position 2. The only position left for the adventure movie watcher is position 1.

12. The person who's hobby is cooking must be on the far left (as per point 16), so the cook must be in position 1.

13. The person watching drama movies must be on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing (as per point 6). Since the dancer is in position 1, the drama watcher must be in position 3.

14. The person who's hobby is woodworking must be on the far left or far right (as per point 18). Since the cook is on the far left and the dancer is on the far right, the woodworker must be in position 5.

15. The journalist must be on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (as per point 23), so the journalist must be in position 2.

16. The security-guard must be in position 6.

17. The person driving the train must be on the left of the person watching mystery movies (as per point 20), so the train driver must be in position 5.

18. The nurse must be on the far right (as per point 22), so the nurse must be in position 6.

Lv4-5x6-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each food, hobby, job, movie-genre, and nationality. Let's start by assigning variables to each category and using the clues to make deductions.

1. Let F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6 represent the 6 different foods.
2. Let H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 represent the 6 different hobbies.
3. Let J1, J2, J3, J4, J5, J6 represent the 6 different jobs.
4. Let M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6 represent the 6 different movie-genres.
5. Let N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6 represent the 6 different nationalities.

Now let's use the clues to make deductions:

1. H1 = H1 (trivial)
2. N6 is in an even position (12, 4, 6)
3. N3 is on the left or right of N6 (13) => N3 is either N2 or N4
4. N4 is in an even position (11)
5. N5 is on the left or right of J3 (4) => N5 is either N1 or N2 or N4
6. N1 is on the far left (5) => N1 = apricot (since F1 is the only food on the far left)
7. M8 = N1 (8) => M8 = action (since M8 is the genre for the canadian)
8. H3 = H9 (9) => H3 = card-games (since H3 is the hobby for the person watching satire movies, and H9 is the hobby for the person who eats apricot)
9. M10 is in an even position (10) => M10 = adventure
10. N11 is in an even position (11) => N11 = australian
11. F2 is on the left or right of F3 (12) => F2 = cherry (since F1 is apricot and F6 is zucchini, which is on the far left)
12. N12 is on the left or right of H6 (4) => N12 = N3 or N5 (since N1 and N6 are already assigned)
13. F4 is between F5 and N13 (13) => F4 = pepper (since F1 is apricot, F2 is cherry, F3 is garlic, F5 is peas, and F6 is zucchini)
14. N14 is on the far left or far right (14) => N14 = american or malaysian
15. J3 is on the left or right of H4 (4) => J3 = J5 or J6 (since J1, J2, and J4 are already assigned)
16. H6 is on the far left or far right (16) => H6 = collecting or singing (since H1, H2, H3, and H5 are already assigned)
17. H7 is on the left of H8 (17) => H7 = singing (since H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 are already assigned)
18. J6 is on the far right (18) => J6 = photographer
19. F6 is on the far left (19) => F6 = zucchini
20. M20 is on the right of M21 (22) => M20 = disaster
21. J2 is in an odd position (23) => J2 = J4 (since J1, J3, J5, and J6 are already assigned)
22. F5 is on the left of H7 (27) => F5 = peas
23. H2 is on the left of H3 (17) => H2 = collecting
24. J1 is in an odd position (23) => J1 = J3 (since J2, J4, J5, and J6 are already assigned)
25. N15 is on the left or right of N3 (25) => N15 = N2 or N4 (since N1 and N6 are already assigned)
26. F3 is in an even position (26) => F3 = garlic
27. N16 is on the left of N17 (27) => N16 = indonesian (since N14 is already assigned, and N17 is the only remaining nationality)

15. The software-developer is the person watching sports movies (4). This is already known from rule 15.

16. The teacher is on the left of the photographer (2). Since the teacher cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 16), the teacher must be in position 3, 4, or 6.

17. The person watching martial-arts movies is the person eating cranberry (5). Since the cranberry eater cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 6), the cranberry eater must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6.

Lv4-5x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the police-officer is between snowboarding and reggae. Let's assume the police-officer is in position 3. So, the sport in position 1 is snowboarding, and the music-genre in position 3 is reggae.

2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person driving the airplane. Let's assume weightlifting is in position 6. So, the transport in position 6 is airplane.

3. The pilot is the person driving the bus. Since the pilot is not snowboarding or a fan of reggae, the pilot can't be in positions 1, 3, or 6. Let's assume the pilot is in position 2. So, the job in position 2 is pilot, and the transport in position 2 is bus.

4. The librarian is on the right of the person eating corn. Since corn is in position 10 (as per point 12), the librarian can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11. Let's assume the librarian is in position 4. So, the job in position 4 is librarian.

5. The nurse is the fan of trance. Since the nurse is not the librarian, she can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11. Let's assume the nurse is in position 5. So, the job in position 5 is nurse, and the music-genre in position 5 is trance.

6. The fan of soul is on the left of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is not in position 1 (as per point 12), the fan of soul can't be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 8. Let's assume the fan of soul is in position 8. So, the music-genre in position 8 is soul.

7. The person eating pear is in an even position. Since we have already placed pear in position 7, it stays there.

8. The person who's sport is cycling is the person eating corn. Since cycling is not snowboarding, swimming, or weightlifting, it can't be in positions 1, 3, 6. Let's assume cycling is in position 10. So, the sport in position 10 is cycling, and the food in position 1 is corn.

9. The person who's sport is biathlon is in an even position. Since biathlon is not cycling, swimming, or weightlifting, it can't be in positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Let's assume biathlon is in position 2. So, the sport in position 2 is biathlon.

10. The person who's sport is swimming is the police-officer. Since swimming is not cycling, biathlon, or weightlifting, it can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11. Let's assume swimming is in position 9. So, the sport in position 9 is swimming, and the job in position 9 is police-officer.

11. The person eating onion is between the fan of rock and the person eating pear. Since pear is in position 7 and the fan of rock is in position 11 (as per point 11), the person eating onion is in position 8. So, the food in position 8 is onion.

12. The person driving the boat is the person who's sport is biathlon. Since biathlon is in position 2, the person driving the boat is in position 2. So, the transport in position 2 is boat.

13. The person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the person driving the bus is in position 2 and the person driving the airplane is in position 6, the person driving the van can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, 7. Let's assume the person driving the van is in position 4. So, the transport in position 4 is van.

14. The person eating kale is on the left or right of the nurse. Since the nurse is in position 5, the person eating kale can't be in position 4 (as the van is there). So, the person eating kale is in position 6. So, the food in position 6 is kale.

15. The person eating radish is on the left of the person eating kale. Since the person eating kale is in position 6, the person eating radish is in position 5. So, the food in position 5 is radish.

16. The fan of d&b is on the left of the person eating kale. Since the person eating kale is in position 6, the fan of d&b is in position 4. So, the music-genre in position 4 is d&b.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv4-5x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the blueberry eater is on the far left or far right, let's assume the blueberry eater is in position 1 or 6.

2. The filmmaker is in an odd position, so they can't be in position 2 (since it's even). If the blueberry eater is in position 1, then the filmmaker can be in position 3, 5, or 6. If the blueberry eater is in position 6, then the filmmaker can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. The Russian is on the left of the coach. Since the coach can't be in position 1 (because the blueberry eater is there), the coach can be in position 2, 4, or 6. If the blueberry eater is in position 1, then the Russian can be in position 2 or 5. If the blueberry eater is in position 6, then the Russian can be in position 3 or 4.

4. The hamster owner is on the left or right of the gardener. Since the gardener can't be in position 1 (because the blueberry eater is there), the gardener can be in position 2, 4, or 6. If the blueberry eater is in position 1, then the hamster owner can be in position 3 or 5. If the blueberry eater is in position 6, then the hamster owner can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

5. The frog owner is on the far left or far right. Since the blueberry eater is in position 1 or 6, the frog owner can't be in position 1 or 6. So, the frog owner can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

6. The Egyptian is on the far left. Since the blueberry eater can't be in position 1, the Egyptian must be in position 2.

7. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the Egyptian. So, the zucchini eater can be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

8. The person eating peas is the owner of the rat. So, the peas eater can be in position 1, 3, 5, or 6.

9. The owner of the goat is on the far left or far right. Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the goat owner can't be in position 2. So, the goat owner can be in position 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

10. The teacher is between the card-games person and the cauliflower eater. Since the card-games person can't be in position 1 (because the teacher needs to be on the right of them), the card-games person can be in position 2, 4, or 6. If the blueberry eater is in position 1, then the cauliflower eater can be in position 3, 5, or 6. If the blueberry eater is in position 6, then the cauliflower eater can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

11. The cauliflower eater is on the left or right of the blueberry eater. So, if the blueberry eater is in position 1, then the cauliflower eater can be in position 2 or 6. If the blueberry eater is in position 6, then the cauliflower eater can be in position 1 or 5.

12. Continuing from the previous step, if the blueberry eater is in position 1, then the cauliflower eater can't be in position 6 (because the teacher is between the card-games person and the cauliflower eater). So, the cauliflower eater must be in position 2. This means the blueberry eater is in position 6.

13. Now we know the positions of the blueberry eater, the cauliflower eater, and the Egyptian. We can fill in the other positions based on the remaining clues.

This table satisfies all the given clues."
Lv4-5x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Japanese is the designer (1), we can place them in position 1 (as positions are numbered from 1 to 6).

2. The person eating kiwi is in an even position (4), so they can't be in position 1 (already occupied by the Japanese). They can be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since they are on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies (3), they can't be in position 6 (as there's no one to their right). So, they must be in position 4.

3. Now we know the person eating kiwi is the designer (1, 4), so we can place the designer in position 4.

4. The dancer is in an odd position (4), so they can't be in position 4 (already occupied by the designer). They can be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the dancer can't be to the left of the person eating kiwi (5), they can't be in position 1 or 3. So, they must be in position 5.

5. The argentine is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi (3), so they can't be in position 1 or 6. They can be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since the argentine can't be to the left of the designer (5), they can't be in position 4. So, they must be in position 2.

6. The person eating cucumber is watching satire movies (7), so they can't be in position 1 (as there's no one watching satire movies to their right). They can be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the argentine (who is eating tomato) is between the fan of techno and the person watching satire movies (15), the person eating cucumber can't be in position 6 (as there's no one to their left). So, they must be in position 2.

7. Now we know the person eating cucumber is watching satire movies (2, 2), so we can place the satire movies in position 2.

8. The electrician is on the left or right of the designer (8), so they can't be in position 1 (as the designer is already in position 4). They can be in position 3, 5, or 6. Since the electrician is on the left of the person eating kiwi (11), they can't be in position 6. So, they must be in position 3.

9. Now we know the electrician is in position 3, so we can place the electrician in position 3.

10. The french is on the far left (9), so they must be in position 1.

11. The colombian is on the far left or far right (10), but the french is on the far left (9), so the colombian must be in position 6.

12. The person eating tomato is the argentine (14), so we already know their position (2).

13. The person eating tomato is between the fan of techno and the person watching satire movies (15), so the fan of techno must be in position 4 and the person watching satire movies is in position 2.

14. The fan of techno is on the left or right of the person eating tomato (17), so they can't be in position 4 (as the person eating tomato is already in position 2). They must be in position 6.

15. The fan of folk is in an even position (18), so they can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (odd positions). They can be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the fan of techno is in position 6, the fan of folk must be in position 4.

16. The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the doctor (16), but we haven't placed the doctor yet. Let's place the doctor in position 5 for now.

17. Now the person eating pomegranate can be in position 1, 3, or 6. Since the person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the doctor (16), they can't be in position 5 (as the doctor is already in position 5). They can't be in position 1 (as the french is already in position 1). So, they must be in position 6.

18. The person eating eggplant is between the bartender and the person watching fantasy movies (23), but we haven't placed the bartender yet. Let's place the bartender in position 3 for now.

19. Now the person eating eggplant can be in position 1, 4, or 5. Since the person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the designer (19), they can't be in position 4 (as the designer is already in position 4). They can't be in position 1 (as the french is already in position 1). So, they must be in position 5.

20. Now we know the person eating eggplant is in position 5, so we can place the person watching fantasy movies in position 5.

21. The bartender is on the left or right of the argentine (26), but we already know the argentine is in position 2. The only positions left for the bartender are 1 and 3. Since the fan of dubstep is on the right of the bartender (25), the bartender must be in position 3.

22. Now we know the bartender is in position 3, so we can place the bartender in position 3.

23. The fan of dubstep is on the right of the bartender (25), so they must be in position 4.

24. The person watching time-travel movies is the person eating lime (24), but we haven't placed the lime yet. Let's place the lime in position 6 for now.

25. Now the person watching time-travel movies is in position 6, so we can place the time-travel movies in position 6.

26. The fan of reggae is in position 4 (6), so we already know their position.

27. The person watching western movies is on the left of the mexican (21), but we haven't placed the mexican yet. Let's place the mexican in position 5 for now.

28. Now the person watching western movies can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. Since the mexican is in position 5, the person watching western movies can't be in position 5 (as they must be on the left of the mexican). They can't be in position 1 (as the french is already in position 1). They can't be in position 6 (as the person watching time-travel movies is already in position 6). So, they must be in position 2.

29. Now we know the person watching western movies is in position 2, so we can place the western movies in position 2.

30. The polish is on the right of the person watching satire movies (22), but we already know the person watching satire movies is in position 2. The only positions left for the polish are 1, 3, 4, and 6. Since the polish can't be in position 1 (as the french is already in position 1), they can't be in position 3 (as the electrician is already in position 3), they can't be in position 4 (as the fan of reggae is already in position 4), and they can't be in position 6 (as the person watching time-travel movies is already in position 6). This is a contradiction, which means our initial placement of the mexican in position 5 was incorrect. The mexican must be in position 6 instead.

31. Now the person watching western movies is in position 2, so we can place the western movies in position 2.

32. The polish is on the right of the person watching satire movies (22), so they must be in position 3.

Lv4-5x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the positions are odd for grapefruit and even for mexican, we can place the mexican in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's place the mexican in position 4 for now.

2. The Pakistani is on the left of the person drinking fanta, so fanta cannot be in position 4. Let's place fanta in position 1, 3, or 6. Since fanta cannot be in position 4 (because the mexican is there), it cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 8). So, fanta must be in position 6.

3. The Italian is on the left of the person eating onion. Since the mexican is in position 4, the Italian cannot be in position 4. Let's place the Italian in position 2.

4. The person driving the skateboard is the person eating tomato. Since fanta is in position 6, the skateboard cannot be in position 6. So, the skateboard must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the Italian is in position 2, the skateboard cannot be in position 2. So, the skateboard must be in position 1 or 5. Let's place the skateboard in position 1 for now.

Let's place the motorbike in position 3 for now.

12. The iced-tea is on the right of the paramedic. Since the motorbike is in position 3, the iced-tea must be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the iced-tea in position 2 for now.

13. The firefighter is on the far right. Since the iced-tea is in position 2, the firefighter must be in position 6.

14. The person eating plum is on the left of the person eating banana. Since the banana is in position 1, the plum must be in position 3.

15. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person eating banana. Since the banana is in position 1, the taxi must be in position 2.

Lv4-5x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the Spanish (S) on the far left (position 1) due to rule 24. The Lemonade (L) drinker cannot be in position 1 because the Spanish is on their left (rule 6), so L must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the Lemonade drinker is in an even position (rule 7), they must be in position 4.

2. The Indonesian (I) cannot be in position 1 (left of Spanish) or position 6 (right of Spanish) due to rule 8, so I must be in position 2 or 5. Since the Indonesian is on the left of the Ferret owner (rule 26), the Ferret owner (F) must be in position 3. The Goldfish owner (G) is to the right of the Ferret owner (rule 2), so G must be in position 5.

3. The Goldfish owner (G) is also the Pop fan (P) due to rule 13. Since P is in an odd position (rule 12), G/P must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, G/P cannot be in position 1 (left of Spanish) or position 5 (right of Spanish), so G/P must be in position 3.

4. The Jazz fan (J) cannot be in position 1 (left of Juice drinker) or position 6 (right of Juice drinker), so J must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since J is on the left or right of the Juice drinker (rule 1), the Juice drinker (Ju) must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, Ju cannot be in position 1 (left of Spanish) or position 5 (right of Spanish), so Ju must be in position 3.

5. The Cola drinker (C) cannot be in position 1 (left of Indonesian) or position 6 (right of Indonesian), so C must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since C is on the left or right of the Rabbit owner (rule 21), the Rabbit owner (R) must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, R cannot be in position 1 (left of Spanish), so R must be in position 5. Since the Rabbit owner is the Turkish (T), T is in position 5.

6. The Tea drinker (Te) cannot be in position 1 (left of Spanish) or position 6 (right of Spanish), so Te must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since Te is on the right of the Soul fan (rule 27), the Soul fan (So) must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, So cannot be in position 1 (left of Lemonade), so So must be in position 3.

7. The Ambient fan (A) cannot be in position 1 (left of Lemonade) or position 6 (right of Lemonade), so A must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since A is on the left or right of the Goldfish owner (rule 4), the Goldfish owner (G) must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, G is already placed in position 5, so A must be in position 2.

8. The Paramedic (Pa) cannot be in position 1 (left of Indonesian) or position 6 (right of Indonesian), so Pa must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since Pa is the Disco fan (rule 18), the Disco fan must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, the Disco fan is already placed as the Paramedic, so the Mouse owner (M) must be in position 2.

9. The Entrepreneur (En) is in an even position (rule 10), so En must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since En is on the left or right of the American (rule 19), the American (Am) must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, Am is already placed as the Spanish's left neighbor, so En must be in position 6.

10. The Videographer (V) is the Soul fan (rule 16), so V must be in position 3. Since V is on the left or right of the Paramedic (rule 20), the Fisherman (Fish) must be in position 1.

11. The Goat owner (Go) is the Spanish (rule 11), so Go is already placed in position 5.

12. The Chinchilla owner (Ch) cannot be in position 1 (left of Spanish) or position 6 (right of Spanish), so Ch must be in position 2, 4, or 5. However, Ch cannot be in position 2 (left of Indonesian), so Ch must be in position 4.

Here is the final solution table:

The missing values are filled with '#' because we don't have enough information to determine them."
Lv4-5x6-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the positions (1 being the far left, 6 being the far right, and odd numbers for the right side, even numbers for the left side).

2. From rule 14, the fan of house (H) is drinking cola, so let's place H in position 1 (since there are 6 people, and H is in an odd position).

3. From rule 1, the fan of house is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving (S). Since H is in position 1, S must be in position 2 (even).

4. From rule 2, the Australian (A) is between the writer (W) and S. Since H is in position 1 and S in position 2, W must be in position 3 (odd).

5. From rule 18, the fan of funk (F) is in an even position. Since H is in position 1 (odd), F cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, F must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But F cannot be in position 6 because H is in position 1 and they are not neighbors (rule 1). So, F must be in position 2 or 4. Since F is in an even position, S must be in position 3 (odd). So, F is in position 4.

6. From rule 19, the gardener (G) is in an odd position. Since H is in position 1, G cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, G must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But G cannot be in position 6 because H is in position 1 and they are not neighbors (rule 1). So, G must be in position 2 or 4. But G cannot be in position 2 because F is in position 4. So, G must be in position 6.

7. From rule 16, the person drinking water (W) is on the far left or far right. Since G is in position 6, W cannot be in position 6. So, W must be in position 1.

8. From rule 17, the person drinking sprite (S) is on the left of the russian (R). Since R cannot be in position 6 (rule 6), R cannot be in position 1 either (because W is in position 1). So, R must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But R cannot be in position 2 because S is in position 3 (rule 3). So, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But R cannot be in position 4 because G is in position 6 (rule 7). So, R must be in position 5.

9. From rule 13, the person drinking tea (T) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games (C). Since C is not in position 1 (rule 11), T cannot be in position 1 either. So, T must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But T cannot be in position 2 because W is in position 2 (rule 7). So, T must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. But T cannot be in position 4 because G is in position 6 (rule 7). So, T must be in position 3 or 5. But T cannot be in position 3 because C is in position 4 (rule 11). So, T must be in position 5.

10. From rule 15, T is between the fan of blues (B) and the police-officer (P). Since T is in position 5, B must be in position 3 and P must be in position 4.

11. From rule 22, B is the architect (A).

12. From rule 12, the canadian (C) is on the left of the fan of soul (So). Since So cannot be in position 1 (because W is in position 1), So must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But So cannot be in position 2 because W is in position 2 (rule 7). So, So must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. But So cannot be in position 4 because P is in position 4 (rule 10). So, So must be in position 5 or 6. But So cannot be in position 6 because W is in position 1 (rule 7). So, So must be in position 5.

13. From rule 20, the accountant (Ac) is on the left or right of the designer (D). Since D is not in position 1 (because W is in position 1), Ac cannot be in position 1 either. So, Ac must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But Ac cannot be in position 2 because W is in position 2 (rule 7). So, Ac must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. But Ac cannot be in position 4 because P is in position 4 (rule 10). So, Ac must be in position 3 or 5. But Ac cannot be in position 3 because D is in position 6 (rule 3). So, Ac must be in position 5.

14. From rule 21, the writer (W) is on the left or right of the Australian (A). Since A is in position 3, W cannot be in position 1 (because W is to the left of A). So, W must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But W cannot be in position 4 because P is in position 4 (rule 10). So, W must be in position 2 or 6. But W cannot be in position 6 because W is to the right of A (rule 4). So, W must be in position 2.

15. From rule 23, the person drinking mirinda (M) is on the left or right of the police-officer (P). Since P is in position 4, M cannot be in position 1 (because W is in position 1). So, M must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But M cannot be in position 2 because W is in position 2 (rule 14). So, M must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. But M cannot be in position 4 because P is in position 4 (rule 10). So, M must be in position 3 or 5. But M cannot be in position 3 because G is in position 6 (rule 6). So, M must be in position 5.

16. From rule 24, the coach (C) is the fan of hip-hop (HH).

Now, let's place the remaining information:
- The hobby of the person in position 1 is board-games (since all other hobbies are assigned).
- The job of the person in position 2 is accountant (Ac).
- The music-genre of the person in position 2 is funk (F).
- The nationality of the person in position 2 is Canadian (C).

This table satisfies all the given rules."
Lv4-5x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the food, hobbies, music-genres, pets, and transport to the positions in the table.

1. We know that the owner of the cat is on the left of the owner of the turtle, so let's place the cat owner in position 1 and the turtle owner in position 3 or 5 (since there are only odd positions left).

2. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle owner is in position 3 or 5, the writer can be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the writer in position 2 for now.

3. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of indie. Since the turtle owner is in position 3, the indie fan must be in position 1 or 5. However, the indie fan is also the person driving the scooter (point 6), and the scooter driver must be in an odd position (point 20). So, the indie fan (and scooter driver) must be in position 1.

4. Now we know that the cat owner is the fan of soul (point 15), and the soul fan is on the right of the owner of the rat (point 16). Since the cat owner is in position 1, the rat owner must be in position 3 or 5. Let's place the rat owner in position 3 for now.

5. The person eating raspberry is between the owner of the cat and the fan of blues (point 8). Since the cat owner is in position 1 and the blues fan must be in an even position (we'll find out why later), the raspberry eater must be in position 2.

6. The person eating garlic is on the right of the person eating watermelon (point 9). Since the raspberry eater is in position 2, the watermelon eater must be in position 4.

7. The person who's hobby is card-games is the fan of indie (point 14). Since the indie fan is in position 1, the card-games person must be in position 6.

8. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left or far right (point 26). Since we have already placed the indie fan, writer, cat owner, and raspberry eater, the drawing person must be in position 5 (far right).

9. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person eating garlic (point 24). Since the garlic eater is in position 6, the chinchilla owner must be in position 5.

10. The person who's hobby is cooking is in an even position (points 19 and 22). Since we have already placed the cat owner, writer, indie fan, raspberry eater, watermelon eater, card-games person, and drawing person, the cooking person must be in position 4.

11. The fan of ambient is on the left of the person driving the ship (point 7). Since the ship driver is the person eating peas (point 21), the ambient fan must be in position 2 or 4. However, the ambient fan cannot be in position 2 because the writer is already there (point 2). So, the ambient fan must be in position 4.

12. The person driving the bus is in an odd position (point 20). Since we have already placed the indie fan, cat owner, raspberry eater, watermelon eater, card-games person, drawing person, and cooking person, the bus driver must be in position 1.

13. The person driving the subway is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games (point 27). Since the card-games person is in position 6, the subway driver must be in position 5.

14. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person driving the scooter (point 23). Since the scooter driver is in position 1, the board-games person must be in position 2.

15. The person eating eggplant is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games (point 17). Since the card-games person is in position 6, the eggplant eater must be in position 5.

16. The owner of the rat is in position 3.

17. The person eating peas is in position 1 (ship driver).

18. The owner of the mouse is in position 4 (watermelon eater).

19. The snake owner is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane (point 4). Since the airplane driver is not yet determined, we can't place the snake owner yet.

20. The person driving the airplane is not yet determined.

21. The turtle owner is in position 3.

22. The person driving the train is not yet determined.

Now, let's rearrange the table to fit the given information:

|               |    1    |      2      |    3    |     4      |     5      |      6      |
| Food          | Bus     | Raspberry   | Turtle  | Peas       | Eggplant   | Watermelon  |
| Hobby         | Board-games| Writing    |       | Cooking    | Card-games | Drawing     |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient |            |       |            | Indie      |            |
| Pet           | Cat     | Chinchilla  | Rat    |            |           |            |
| Transport     | Airplane|             |       | Ship       | Subway     | Train       |

Since we don't have enough information to place the snake owner, airplane driver, and train driver, we can't complete the table. However, we have placed all the other elements according to the given clues.
