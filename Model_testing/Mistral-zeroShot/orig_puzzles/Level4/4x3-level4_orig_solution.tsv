Lv4-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating pepper is between the person who's hobby is drawing and the person who's sport is baseball. Let's place the person who's hobby is drawing in position 1 (odd position as per rule 6). So, the person eating pepper is in position 2 or 3. Let's place the person who's sport is baseball in position 3. Now, the person eating pepper must be in position 2. So, the food column can be filled as follows:

   |               |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Food          | corn     | pepper      | potato    |

2. The person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the person eating corn. Since we already placed the person eating pepper to the left of the person watching scientific movies (rule 5), the person watching musical movies must be in position 1. So, the movie-genre column can be filled as follows:

   |               |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Food          | corn     | pepper      | potato    |
   | Hobby         | drawing  |             |           |
   | Movie-Genre   | musical  |             |           |

3. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. So, the person playing climbing must be in position 3.

   |               |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Food          | corn     | pepper      | potato    |
   | Hobby         | drawing  |             | climbing  |

   | Sport         | baseball|             | climbing  |

4. The person eating potato is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since we already placed the person playing climbing in position 3, the person eating potato must be in position 3.

   |               |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Food          | corn     | pepper      | potato    |
   | Hobby         | drawing  |             | climbing  |
   | Movie-Genre   | musical  |             |           |
   | Sport         | baseball|             | climbing  |

5. Now, we have only one hobby left, which is rock-climbing. Since the person playing rock-climbing is in position 3, the person with the remaining hobby, skydiving, must be in position 1.

   |               |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Food          | corn     | pepper      | potato    |

   | Sport         | baseball|             | climbing  |

6. Finally, we have only one movie-genre left, which is mystery. Since the person watching musical movies is in position 1, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2.

   |               |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Food          | corn     | pepper      | potato    |

Lv4-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching action movies is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Let's place the action movie-watcher in the first column and the baseball player in the third column.

   | Sport         |          |              |            |

2. The person watching disaster movies is the coach. Since the coach is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, the coach must be in the second column. So, the disaster movie-watcher is the coach.

   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
   | Job           | Accountant| Coach       | Photographer|

   | Sport         |         |            |            |

3. The person watching action movies is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the action movie-watcher is already in the first column, the ferret owner must be in the first column as well. So, the ferret owner is the accountant.

   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |

4. The photographer is in an even position. Since the accountant and coach are already in the first two positions, the photographer must be in the third position.

5. The person who's sport is tennis is between the person watching disaster movies (coach) and the accountant. Since the coach is in the second position and the accountant is in the first position, the tennis player must be in the third position.

   | Sport         | Tennis   |            |            |

6. The person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the photographer. Since the photographer is already in the third position, the thriller movie-watcher can be in either the first or second position. However, since the person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching thriller movies, the thriller movie-watcher must be in the second position.

   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |

   | Sport         | Tennis   |            |            |

7. The coach is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the coach is already in the second position, the guinea-pig owner must be in the first position.

   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |

8. The only pet left is the hamster. Since the guinea-pig owner is already in the first position, the hamster owner must be in the third position.

   | Sport         |         |            |            |

9. The person watching action movies is on the left of the owner of the ferret, which we already know is the accountant. Since the accountant is already in the first position, the sport of the person watching action movies must be on the left of the accountant. The only sport left is baseball, so the baseball player is in the first position.

   | Sport         | Baseball  |         |            |

10. The only sport left is lacrosse. Since the tennis player is already between the coach and the accountant, the lacrosse player must be in the second position.

   |               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
   | Job           | Baseball player| Lacrosse player| Coach       |

Lv4-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the turtle is on the right of the person driving the bike. Let's place the turtle owner and bike driver in the second and third columns, respectively. Since the turtle owner eats cranberry (from point 6), we can place cranberry in the second row, second column. The bike driver eats carrot (from point 4, as they are not the train driver and not next to the bird owner), so we can place carrot in the first row, third column.

2. The person eating watermelon is the person driving the train (from point 2). So, we can place watermelon in the third row, first column.

3. Now, the person watching action movies is in an even position (from point 5). Since we have already placed three items in the first and third columns, the action movie person must be in the second column. Action movies can't be next to the bird owner (from point 3), so it must be in the first row.

4. The person watching adventure movies is not the carrot eater (from point 4), so it can't be in the first row or third column. Since we have already placed three items in the second column, the adventure movie person must be in the third row.

5. The person owning the bird is either to the left or right of the cranberry eater (from point 3). Since the cranberry eater is already placed, the bird owner must be in the first row or third column. However, the bird owner can't be in the first row (as the action movie person is there), so the bird owner must be in the third column. The bird can't be next to the watermelon eater (from point 3), so the bird must be in the first row.

6. Now, the only remaining position for the adventure movie person is the third row, second column.

7. The only remaining pet is the pony, which must be in the third column (as the bird and turtle are already placed).

8. The only remaining transport is the quad-bike, which must be in the third row, third column.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the engineer is watching martial-arts movies, we know that the engineer is in the second or third row. Let's assume the engineer is in the second row (Job). This means the martial-arts movies are in the second column (Movie-Genre).

2. Now, since the person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking, the documentary movies are in the first column (Movie-Genre). This means the person with the hobby of photography is in the first row (Hobby).

3. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the martial-arts movies are in the second column, the person with the hobby of chess is in the first column (Hobby). This means the person with the hobby of woodworking is in the third column (Hobby).

4. The Italian is on the far right (Nationality). Since the martial-arts movies are in the second column, the Italian cannot be in the second row (Job). So, the Italian is in the third row (Job).

5. The bartender is on the right of the Pakistani (Job). Since the Italian is on the far right, the Pakistani must be in the second row (Job). This means the bartender is in the first row (Job).

6. The Italian is on the right of the Pakistani (Nationality). Since the Pakistani is in the second row (Job), the Italian is in the third row (Job).

7. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in an odd position (Hobby). Since the hobbies are in the first, second, and third columns, the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in the third row (Hobby).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

```
|               | Photography | Martial-Arts | Woodworking |
| Hobby         |            |              |             |

Since we don't have specific information about the first and third columns (Hobby and Nationality), the table is not fully filled. However, the positions of the jobs, hobbies, and movie-genres are correctly placed."
Lv4-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the polish is in the middle, we know that positions 2 and 3 are occupied by the other two nationalities (German and Mexican).

2. The manager is on the left of the German, so the manager must be in position 1, and the German is in position 2.

3. The person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since the German is not drinking water or juice (as the manager is not drinking water), the person drinking water must be in position 3, and the person drinking juice must be in position 2.

4. The bartender is in an odd position. Since the manager and the German are in positions 1 and 2, the bartender must be in position 3.

5. The manager is on the left of the fan of pop. Since the manager is in position 1, the fan of pop must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the police-officer is on the right of the person drinking juice (who is in position 2), the fan of pop cannot be in position 2. So, the fan of pop must be in position 3.

6. The police-officer is on the left or right of the fan of salsa. Since the police-officer is on the right of the person drinking juice (who is in position 2), the police-officer cannot be in position 1. So, the police-officer must be in position 3.

7. This means the fan of salsa is in position 1.

8. Now, we know the nationalities, jobs, music-genres, and beverages for all positions. The final solution table is:

Lv4-4x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Dutch is eating asparagus (Dutch is in an even position and on the right of the person eating raspberry), we can place the Dutch in the second position of the Nationality column and the raspberry in the third position. So, the Nationality column is:

   | Nationality   | 2 (Italian) | 1 (Dutch) | 3 (Mexican) |

2. Since the Dutch is watching mystery movies and is between the photographer and the person eating cauliflower, the Dutch cannot be in the first position (as the first column is already filled with the Nationality). So, the Dutch must be in the second or third position.

   If the Dutch was in the second position, the first person would be watching mystery movies, which contradicts the fact that the person watching mystery movies is between the photographer and the person eating cauliflower. So, the Dutch must be in the third position. This means the first person is Italian (as the Italian is watching western movies).

   So, the Movie-Genre column is:

   | Movie-Genre | 1 (disaster) | 2 (mystery) | 3 (western) |

3. Since the Italian is on the left of the social-worker, the Italian cannot be in the first position (as the first column is already filled with the Movie-Genre). So, the Italian must be in the second position. This means the first person is Dutch (as the Dutch is watching mystery movies).

   So, the Nationality column is:

   | Nationality   | 1 (Dutch) | 2 (Italian) | 3 (Mexican) |

4. Since the Italian is on the right of the person eating raspberry, the Italian cannot be in the third position (as the third column is already filled with the Nationality). So, the Italian must be in the second position. This means the first person is Mexican (as the Mexican is eating cauliflower).

   So, the Food column is:

   | Food          | 1 (asparagus) | 2 (cauliflower) | 3 (raspberry) |

5. Since the person watching western movies is the Italian, the Italian is in the second position. The first person is Mexican, so the photographer must be in the first position.

   So, the Job column is:

1. The person eating blueberry is in the middle, so Blueberry goes in the center column (column 3).

2. The fan of metal is on the left of the person eating blueberry, so Metal goes in the first column (column 1).

3. The person watching zombie movies is the person driving the roller. Since the roller is a means of transport, it must be in the last row. Zombie movies are in the second column (column 2), and since the person driving the roller is in the middle row (row 2), Roller goes in the third column (column 3).

4. The person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching action movies must be on the right of the person eating orange (rule 5), and the person watching crime movies cannot be in the middle (because the blueberry eater is there), the person watching crime movies must be in the first column (column 1). Action movies are in the second column (column 2).

5. The person eating orange is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching action movies is in the second column (column 2), Orange goes in the third column (column 3).

6. The fan of ambient is between the person driving the roller (which is the person watching zombie movies) and the person eating garlic. Since the person driving the roller is in the middle row (row 2) and the person eating garlic is in the first row (row 1), Ambient goes in the first column (column 1).

7. The person driving the taxi is in an odd position. Since there are 3 positions, the taxi driver must be in the first row (row 1). Since Food, Movie-Genre, and Music-Genre are filled in the first row, Transport must be in the last row (row 3), so Taxi goes in the third column (column 3).

Lv4-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and an odd number of positions, the middle position is an odd position.

2. The Russian cannot be in the middle position (since it's odd and the rule 1 states the Russian is on the far left or far right). So, the Russian must be on the far right.

3. Since the Russian is on the far right, the nationality in the middle position must be either German or Pakistani. Let's assume it's German for now.

4. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the German cannot be the dancer (because the dancer must be in an odd position and the German is in the middle), the dancer must be on the right. So, the quad-bike driver is on the left of the dancer, which means the quad-bike driver is either in position 1 or 3. However, the quad-bike driver cannot be in position 1 because the person driving the car is in an odd position and the only odd position left is position 1, which contradicts the fact that the quad-bike driver is on the left of the dancer. So, the quad-bike driver is in position 3. This means the dancer is in position 2.

5. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the Pakistani. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 3, the Pakistani must be in position 1.

6. The person who's hobby is camping is between the Pakistani and the person driving the tram. Since the Pakistani is in position 1 and the tram driver must be in an even position (because the car driver is in an odd position and the quad-bike driver is in position 3), the tram driver must be in position 4. So, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 2.

7. The only beverage left for the person in position 1 is coffee (since soy-milk is on the far right and hot-chocolate is in an odd position). The only hobby left for the person in position 1 is camping. The only nationality left for the person in position 1 is Pakistani. The only transport left for the person in position 1 is car (since the quad-bike driver is in position 3 and the tram driver is in position 4).

8. The only beverage left for the person in position 2 is hot-chocolate (since soy-milk is on the far right and coffee is in position 1). The only hobby left for the person in position 2 is sudoku. The only nationality left for the person in position 2 is German. The only transport left for the person in position 2 is tram.

9. The only beverage left for the person in position 3 is soy-milk. The only hobby left for the person in position 3 is dancing. The only nationality left for the person in position 3 is Russian. The only transport left for the person in position 3 is quad-bike.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |       1       |     2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | Pakistani (Car) | Hot-Chocolate (Tram) | Soy-Milk (Quad-bike) |
| Hobby         | Camping       | Sudoku      | Dancing    |
| Nationality   | Pakistani     | German     | Russian   |
| Transport     | Car          | Tram       | Quad-bike |

Lv4-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so each person can be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3.

2. Let's assign nationalities to the positions:
   - Position 1: Canadian (since the even positions are taken by the music genres)
   - Position 2: Colombian (as per condition 1)
   - Position 3: Turkish (since the odd positions are left)

3. Now let's assign music genres to the even positions:
   - Position 2: Blues (since the Colombian is a fan of punk in an even position 4, which is already taken)
   - Position 4: Punk (as per condition 2)
   - Position 6: Disco (since the remaining genre is blues, and the owner of blues is in position 1, which is odd)

4. Now let's assign food to the positions:
   - Position 1: Lemon (since the Canadian is on the left of the person eating apricot, and the only remaining food is cabbage and lemon)
   - Position 3: Apricot (as per condition 1)
   - Position 5: Cabbage (since the owner of the lizard is on the left of the person eating cabbage, and the only remaining food is cabbage)

5. Now let's assign pets to the positions:
   - Position 3: Chinchilla (as per condition 3)
   - Position 5: Lizard (as per condition 4)
   - Position 6: Horse (since the owner of the horse is on the left of the fan of blues, and the only remaining pet is horse)

The final solution table is:

|               |    1     |     2     |     3      |
| Food          | Lemon    | Cabbage   | Apricot    |
| Music-Genre   | Blues    | Disco     | Punk       |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Colombian | Turkish    |
| Pet           | Horse    | Chinchilla | Lizard     |

Lv4-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 jobs, 3 music-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 means of transport, we can assign each category to a unique position (1, 2, 3).

2. From point 1, we know that the jobs, music-genres, nationalities, and transport are in the same order. So, we can label the columns and rows with the corresponding categories.

3. From point 2, we know that the Japanese is on the left of the person driving the roller. Since the nationalities are in order, the Japanese must be in position 1. So, the Nationality column is: `[Japanese, Chinese, Thai]`.

4. From point 4, the fan of classical is the Thai. Since the music-genres are in order, Classical must be in the last position. So, the Music-Genre column is: `[Electronic, Classical, Indie]`.

5. From point 1, we know that the dancer is a job. From point 4, we know that the fan of classical is the Thai. Since the dancer is the Thai (from point 4), the dancer must be in the last position. So, the Job column is: `[Freelancer, Dancer, Teacher]`.

6. From point 3, the teacher is on the left of the fan of indie. Since the jobs are in order, the teacher must be in the first position. So, the Teacher is in position 1, and the Freelancer is in position 3.

7. From point 6, we know the positions of the Teacher and Dancer. Since the Dancer is on the left or right of the Teacher (point 7), the Dancer must be in position 2. So, the Job column is now: `[Teacher, Dancer, Freelancer]`.

8. From point 5, we know the order of the music-genres. Since the Classical is in the last position, the Electronic must be in the first position, and Indie must be in the middle. So, the Music-Genre column is: `[Electronic, Classical, Indie]`.

9. From point 1, we know the order of the nationalities. Since the Japanese is in the first position, the Chinese must be in the second position, and the Thai must be in the third position. So, the Nationality column is: `[Japanese, Chinese, Thai]`.

10. From point 6, we know the positions of the Teacher and Dancer. Since the Dancer is in an odd position (point 6), the Dancer is in position 1. The Teacher is in position 3. So, the Job column is: `[Teacher, Dancer, Freelancer]`.

11. From point 5, we know the order of the music-genres. Since Electronic is in the first position, the person who prefers Electronic must be in the first row. Since the Dancer prefers Classical (from point 4), the Freelancer must prefer Electronic. So, the Music-Genre row is: `[Freelancer, Dancer, ?]`.

12. From point 1, we know the order of the transport. Since the Japanese is in the first position, the person driving the roller must be the Japanese. Since the Dancer is in the second position, the person driving the van must be the Dancer. Since the Teacher is in the third position, the person driving the snowmobile must be the Teacher. So, the Transport row is: `[Roller, Van, Snowmobile]`.

The final solution table is:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |
| Job           | Teacher   | Dancer    | Freelancer |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic| Classical  | Indie      |
| Nationality   | Japanese  | Chinese    | Thai       |
| Transport     | Roller    | Van        | Snowmobile |
```

So, the final solution is:

```
