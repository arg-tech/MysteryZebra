Lv4-2x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The fan of soul is in the middle (position 3). So, Soul is in the third column.
2. The fan of soul is in an odd position (position 4 is not possible because it's the middle, so it must be position 1 or 5). Since the fan of soul is already in the middle, position 1 is not possible. So, Soul is in the 5th row.

Now we know that Soul is in the 5th row and 3rd column.

3. The person eating radish is on the left or right of the fan of pop (position 2 or 4). Since the fan of soul is already in the middle, the fan of pop cannot be in the middle. So, Pop is either in the 1st or 5th row.

Let's assume Pop is in the 1st row. Then, Radish must be in the 2nd or 4th column. But if Radish is in the 2nd column, it would violate rule 6 (Radish is in the middle). So, Radish must be in the 4th column.

Now we know that Radish is in the 2nd row and 4th column.

4. The person eating lettuce is on the right of the person eating pumpkin. Since we know the position of Radish, we can place Pumpkin in the left of Radish. Let's place Pumpkin in the 1st column of the 2nd row. Now, Lettuce must be in the 3rd column of the 2nd row.

Now we know that Pumpkin is in the 2nd row and 1st column, and Lettuce is in the 2nd row and 3rd column.

5. The person eating cauliflower is between the fan of soul and the fan of salsa. Since we know the position of Soul and there are only 5 rows, the fan of salsa can only be in the 4th row. So, Cauliflower must be in the 3rd row. But we don't know yet where.

6. The person eating radish is in the middle (position 3). Since we know the position of Radish, we can place Trance in the 5th row and 1st, 2nd, or 4th column (since it's not on the left or right of the fan of soul or the fan of pop). Let's place Trance in the 5th row and 1st column.

Now we know that Trance is in the 5th row and 1st column.

7. The person eating cauliflower is between the fan of soul and the fan of salsa. Since we know the position of Soul and Trance, Cauliflower must be in the 3rd row and 2nd or 4th column. But if Cauliflower is in the 4th column, it would violate rule 5 (Cauliflower is between Soul and Salsa). So, Cauliflower must be in the 3rd row and 2nd column.

Now we know that Cauliflower is in the 3rd row and 2nd column.

8. The person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the person eating radish (position 1 or 4). Since we know the position of Radish, Pumpkin must be in the 1st column of the 2nd row.

Now we know that Pumpkin is in the 2nd row and 1st column, Lettuce is in the 2nd row and 3rd column, and Radish is in the 2nd row and 4th column.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Pumpkin  | Lettuce | Radish | Soul   | Trance |
|   Music    | Food    |        | Genre  |        |
#############
```

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv4-2x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person drinking almond-milk is in an even position, so it can't be in the first or third spot. So, it must be in either the second or fourth position.

2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since swimming can't be in the first position (as almond-milk can't be in the first), swimming must be in the second, third, or fourth position. If swimming is in the second position, almond-milk must be in the fourth position. If swimming is in the third position, almond-milk must be in the second position. If swimming is in the fourth position, almond-milk must be in the second position. However, this would violate rule 5 (badminton is between iced-tea and swimming), so swimming can't be in the fourth position. So, swimming is either in the second or third position, and almond-milk is in the second position.

3. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since water is in the middle (rule 3), tennis can't be in the first or third position. So, tennis is either in the second or fourth position.

4. The person who's sport is badminton is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person who's sport is swimming (rule 5). Since swimming is in the second position and almond-milk is in the second position (rule 2), iced-tea must be in the first position. So, badminton is in the third position.

5. Now we know that swimming is in the third position, almond-milk is in the second position, badminton is in the third position, and iced-tea is in the first position. Since water is in the middle (rule 3), it must be in the fifth position.

6. The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (rule 6). So, surfing is in the fourth position.

7. The person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 7). So, tea is in the fourth position.

The final solution table is:

   | Music | Reggae     | ... | ... | ... | ... |

2. The fan of electronic is in an even position (4), so it can't be in the first row (position 1). Since the fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of metal, and the fan of metal can't be in the first row, the fan of electronic can't be in the second row either. So, the fan of electronic must be in the third, fourth, or fifth row.

3. The fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of metal. Since the fan of metal can't be in the first row, the fan of electronic can't be in the first column either. So, the fan of electronic can't be in the first row and first column.

4. The fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of metal, and the fan of metal is on the left or right of the fan of blues. Since the fan of electronic can't be in the first row, the fan of metal can't be in the second row either. So, the fan of blues can't be in the second row.

5. Now, let's place the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues can't be in the second row, it must be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth row. The fan of blues can't be in the first row because the fan of electronic can't be in the first row, and the fan of blues can't be on the left of the fan of metal (as per point 5). So, the fan of blues can't be in the first or second row.

6. Now, let's place the fan of metal. Since the fan of metal can't be in the second row, it must be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth row. The fan of metal can't be in the first row because the fan of electronic can't be in the first row, and the fan of metal can't be on the left of the fan of blues (as per point 5). So, the fan of metal can't be in the first or second row.

7. Now, let's place the fan of electronic. Since the fan of electronic can't be in the first row, it must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth row. The fan of electronic can't be in the second row because the fan of metal can't be in the second row, and the fan of electronic can't be on the left of the fan of metal (as per point 3). So, the fan of electronic can't be in the second row.

8. Now, let's place the fan of electronic. Since the fan of electronic can't be in the first or second row, it must be in the third, fourth, or fifth row. The fan of electronic can't be in the third row because the fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of metal, and the fan of metal can't be in the third row. So, the fan of electronic can't be in the third row.

9. Now, let's place the fan of electronic. Since the fan of electronic can't be in the first, second, or third row, it must be in the fourth or fifth row. The fan of electronic can't be in the fifth row because the fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of metal, and the fan of metal can't be in the fifth row. So, the fan of electronic must be in the fourth row.

10. Now, let's place the fan of metal. Since the fan of metal can't be in the first, second, or third row, it must be in the fourth or fifth row. The fan of metal can't be in the fifth row because the fan of metal is on the left or right of the fan of blues, and the fan of blues can't be in the fifth row. So, the fan of metal must be in the fourth row.

11. Now, let's place the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues can't be in the second row, it must be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth row. The fan of blues can't be in the first row because the fan of electronic can't be in the first row, and the fan of blues can't be on the left of the fan of metal (as per point 5). So, the fan of blues can't be in the first row.

12. Now, let's place the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues can't be in the second row, it must be in the third, fourth, or fifth row. The fan of blues can't be in the fifth row because the fan of blues is on the left or right of the fan of metal, and the fan of metal can't be in the fifth row. So, the fan of blues must be in the third row.

13. Now, let's place the remaining hobbies and music-genres. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the fan of blues, it can't be in the first or third row. So, it must be in the second, fourth, or fifth row. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the fan of blues, it can't be in the fifth row. So, it must be in the second or fourth row. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the fan of blues, it can't be in the second row because the fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of metal, and the fan of metal is in the fourth row. So, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in the fourth row.

14. Now, let's place the remaining hobbies and music-genres. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games, it can't be in the first column. So, it must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games, it can't be in the second column because the fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of metal, and the fan of metal is in the fourth row. So, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games, it can't be in the fifth column because the person who's hobby is video-games is on the far left or far right, and the fan of blues is in the third row. So, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in the fourth column.

15. Now, let's place the remaining hobbies and music-genres. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is on the far left or far right, it can't be in the second, third, or fourth column. So, it must be in the first or fifth column. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is on the far left or far right, it can't be in the first column because the fan of reggae is in the first row. So, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in the fifth column.

16. Now, let's place the remaining music-genres. Since the fan of trance is on the left or right of the fan of electronic, it can't be in the fourth column because the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in the fourth column. So, the fan of trance must be in the fifth column.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-2x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in the middle, so it must be in position 3.
2. The person watching adventure movies is in an even position, and since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 3, the person watching adventure movies cannot be in position 3. So, the adventure movies person must be in position 2 or 4. Since the rock-climbing person is on the right of the spy movies person, the adventure movies person cannot be in position 4. So, the adventure movies person is in position 2.
3. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far right, so it must be in position 5.
4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person watching martial-arts movies, so it must be in position 5.
5. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the rock-climbing person is in position 3 and the spy movies person is not on the far right (as martial-arts is), the spy movies person must be in position 4.
6. The person who's hobby is puzzles is between the person watching satire movies and the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the woodworking person is in position 5 and the satire movies person cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 2), the satire movies person must be in position 2. So, the puzzles person must be in position 4.
7. The person watching spy movies is the person who's hobby is sudoku, so it must be in position 4.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |   2    |       3       |     4     |      5       |

| Movie-Genre   |            |        |               | Spy      |              |

However, we don't have information about the movie genre for positions 1 and 3. Since the hobbies are unique, we can deduce the movie genres for these positions. Since the person watching satire movies is in position 2, the person in position 1 cannot watch satire movies. The only remaining genre is adventure, so the person in position 1 must watch adventure movies. Since the person in position 3 is not the person watching martial-arts movies, the person in position 3 must watch scientific movies (as the only remaining genre).

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-2x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the iced-tea drinker is in an odd position (4), and the brazilian is in an even position (4), the iced-tea drinker cannot be brazilian.

2. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the australian. This means that the australian cannot be in position 1, as there is no one to the left of them. So, the australian can be either in position 2, 3, or 5.

3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the japanese. This means that the japanese cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5, as there is no one to their left. So, the japanese must be in position 2.

4. Now we know that the australian is not in position 1, and the japanese is in position 2. Since the japanese is on the far right, the australian must be in position 1.

5. The canadian is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the australian is in position 1 and the japanese is in position 2, the lemonade drinker must be in position 3. This means the canadian can be in position 4 or 5.

6. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the egyptian. Since the japanese is in position 2 and the australian is in position 1, the egyptian can only be in position 5.

7. The brazilian is in an even position (4). Since the australian is in position 1, the brazilian cannot be in position 2 (as the japanese is there). So, the brazilian must be in position 4.

8. The person drinking mirinda is on the far right. Since the japanese is in position 2 and the egyptian is in position 5, the mirinda drinker must be in position 1.

3. Now, the engineer is between the software-developer and the lemonade drinker. Since the lemonade drinker (paramedic) is in an even position, the engineer must be in the third column. Let's place the engineer in the third column.

Lv4-2x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the sprite drinker is on the left or right of the electrician, and the paramedic is also on the left or right of the electrician, they cannot be each other's neighbors. So, the electrician cannot be in the middle (position 3).

2. The lemonade drinker is in the middle (position 3).

3. Now, we know the electrician is not in position 3. So, the electrician can be either 1 or 5. If the electrician is in position 1, then the sprite drinker and paramedic cannot be in positions 2 and 4, respectively, because of rule 1 and 2. In this case, the only possible arrangement is:

   | Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---------|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Job     | E | L | P | D | S |

   But this violates rule 8 (paramedic on the right of the electrician). So, the electrician must be in position 5.

4. Now, the sprite drinker cannot be in position 2 because of rule 1. So, the sprite drinker must be in position 1.

5. The paramedic cannot be in position 2 either because of rule 1. So, the paramedic must be in position 4.

6. The doctor cannot be in position 1 because of rule 7 (doctor is on the left or right of the person drinking water). So, the doctor must be in position 5.

7. The firefighter must be in an odd position, so it can be either 1 or 3. If the firefighter is in position 1, then the water drinker must be in position 2. But this violates rule 7 (doctor is on the left or right of the person drinking water). So, the firefighter must be in position 3.

8. Now, the only position left for the water drinker is position 2.

9. The librarian must be in position 5 (far right) because of rule 9.

Lv4-2x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching mystery movies is on the far right, so we can place them in the last column (column 5). Let's assume they are drinking water (W). So, the entry in the intersection of row 5 and column 5 is W.

2. Since the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies, the person watching musical movies must be in column 4.

3. Now, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. So, the person watching superhero movies must be in column 3.

4. The person watching martial-arts movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching superhero movies. Since we have already placed the superhero movies in column 3, the martial-arts movies must be in column 2.

5. The person drinking sprite is in an even position. Since we have placed the superhero movies (3rd position) and martial-arts movies (2nd position), the sprite must be in the 4th position. So, the person drinking sprite is in the intersection of row 4 and column 3 (since positions are numbered from 1 to 5).

6. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. Since we have placed the scientific movies in column 3, the coffee must be in column 1.

7. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since we have placed the martial-arts movies in column 2, the lemonade must be in column 1.

8. Now, we know that the person drinking coffee is in column 1, and the person drinking lemonade is also in column 1. Since there are only 5 positions, and we know that the person drinking water is in column 5, the only remaining beverages for columns 2 and 3 are juice and soda (since we have placed sprite in column 4). However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact order of juice and soda in columns 2 and 3.

We cannot determine the exact order of juice and soda in columns 2 and 3 due to the lack of information."
Lv4-2x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The owner of the fish is in an even position, so it can't be in position 1 or 5.
2. The Indonesian owns the horse, so the horse can't be in position 1, 2, or 5 because those are the only positions left for the Indonesian.
3. The Indonesian is on the far right, so the horse must be in position 5.
4. Now we know the Indonesian is in position 5, so the fish can't be in position 5 because the Indonesian owns the fish. The fish can't be in position 1 either because the Indonesian is in position 5 and there are only 5 nationalities. So, the fish must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
5. The Egyptian owns the fish, so the fish can't be in position 4 because the Indonesian is in position 5 and there are only 5 nationalities. So, the fish must be in position 2 or 3.
6. The Indian is between the Egyptian and the Chinese, so the Indian can't be in position 1 or 5. The Indian can't be in position 2 because the fish is there and there are only 5 nationalities. So, the Indian must be in position 3 or 4.
7. The owner of the pony is on the right of the Indian, so the pony can't be in position 1 or 2. The pony can't be in position 5 because the Indonesian is there. So, the pony must be in position 3 or 4.
8. The owner of the goat is on the far left or far right. Since the Indonesian and the Egyptian are on the right, the goat can't be in position 5. The goat can't be in position 1 because the Indonesian is there. So, the goat must be in position 2 or 4.
9. Since the goat can't be in position 2 (because the fish is there), the goat must be in position 4.
10. Now we know the goat is in position 4, so the pony can't be in position 4 because the goat is there. The pony can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the pony must be in position 3.
11. The Indian is between the Egyptian and the Chinese, so the Chinese must be in position 1.

Final solution:

|               |  1   |    2     |     3      |    4    |     5      |
| Nationality   | Chinese| Fish (Egyptian) | Pony | Goat (Indonesian) | Horse (Indonesian) |

Lv4-2x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the lawyer is not in the middle because the firefighter is in the middle, so the lawyer must be on the left or the right. Let's assume the lawyer is on the right for now.

2. Since the lawyer is on the right, the tennis player (who is to the right of the lawyer) cannot be the firefighter (as the firefighter is in the middle). So, the tennis player must be one of the remaining four (accountant, analyst, dancer, or swimmer).

3. The soccer player is on the far left or far right. If the soccer player is on the far left, then the lawyer cannot be on the right, which contradicts our assumption. So, the soccer player must be on the far right.

4. Now, the soccer player is on the far right, so the lawyer cannot be there. Therefore, the lawyer must be on the left.

5. Since the lawyer is on the left, the tennis player must be one of the four on the right (accountant, analyst, dancer, or swimmer). But the tennis player cannot be the accountant (because the accountant is the sailor, and we haven't placed anyone yet), so the tennis player must be one of the three (analyst, dancer, or swimmer). Let's place the tennis player as the fifth person for now.

6. Now, the firefighter is in the middle, so the accountant (who is the sailor) must be on the left of the firefighter. This means the accountant is the first person.

7. The accountant is the sailor, so the second person cannot be the rower (because the rower must be to the right of the accountant). The second person can be the analyst (if the tennis player is the swimmer) or the dancer (if the tennis player is the analyst). Let's place the analyst as the second person for now.

8. The third person must be the rower, so the fourth person must be the dancer (because the lawyer is on the left of the dancer).

9. Now, the fifth person is the tennis player, and the sixth person must be the swimmer (because the tennis player is in an odd position).

10. Finally, the seventh person is the firefighter, who is in the middle.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| Sailor    | Analyst | Rower   | Dancer  | Tennis  | Swimmer | Firefighter |
| Sport: Sailing | Sport: Soccer | Sport: Rowing | Sport: Dance | Sport: Tennis | Sport: Swimming | Job: Firefighter |
#############
```

This solution assumes that the tennis player is the analyst's neighbor. If the tennis player is the swimmer's neighbor, then the analyst and dancer would switch places, and the solution would be:

```
#############
| Sailor    | Analyst | Rower   | Swimmer | Tennis  | Dancer   | Firefighter |
| Sport: Sailing | Sport: Soccer | Sport: Rowing | Sport: Swimming | Sport: Tennis | Sport: Dance | Job: Firefighter |
#############
```"
