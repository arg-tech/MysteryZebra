Lv4-4x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess (1), and the person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (4), the person driving the ship cannot be the person who's hobby is chess. Let's place the person who's hobby is chess in position 1, and the person driving the ship in position 2.

2. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the cat (2), and in an even position (3). So, the owner of the cat must be in an odd position. Let's place the owner of the cat in position 3.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is in an even position (4). Since we already placed the owner of the cat in an odd position, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 4.

4. Now we know the positions of the person who's hobby is chess, the owner of the cat, and the owner of the chinchilla. The person driving the ship is in position 2.

5. The owner of the pony is the polish (5). Since we already placed the owner of the cat and the owner of the chinchilla, the owner of the pony must be in position 6.

6. The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard (7), and in an odd position (8). Since we already placed the owner of the cat, the owner of the chinchilla, and the owner of the pony, the owner of the lizard must be in position 5. So, the person driving the roller must be in position 3 or 5. Let's place the person driving the roller in position 3 for now.

7. The person driving the skateboard is between the person driving the car and the person who's hobby is chess (8), and the person driving the skateboard is the american (9).

8. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving (6), and the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in an odd position (since we already placed the person who's hobby is chess, the person driving the ship, the person driving the car, and the person driving the skateboard). Let's place the person who's hobby is skydiving in position 5. So, the person who's hobby is gardening is in position 4.

9. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the far left or far right (11), and the person who's hobby is collecting is the brazilian (16). Since we already placed the person who's hobby is chess, the person driving the ship, the person driving the car, the person driving the skateboard, the person who's hobby is gardening, and the person who's hobby is skydiving, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 1 or 6. Let's place the person who's hobby is collecting in position 1.

10. The person driving the snowmobile is in an odd position (14). Since we already placed the person who's hobby is chess, the person driving the ship, the person driving the car, the person driving the skateboard, the person who's hobby is gardening, the person who's hobby is skydiving, and the person who's hobby is collecting, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 3.

11. The thai is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking (15).

Lv4-4x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the Thai in the 6th position (since they watch western movies and are on the far left or far right, so they must be at an end) and the American in the 1st position (since they are the fan of punk and are on the left or right of the person eating banana, so they must be on the left, and the person eating banana is on the right of the fan of punk, so the banana must be in the 2nd position).

2. The Australian is on the left of the person watching musical movies, so they must be in the 5th position (since the American is in the 1st position and the Thai is in the 6th position, the only remaining position for the Australian is the 5th).

3. The German is on the left of the person eating grapes, so the German must be in the 4th position (since the American is in the 1st position, the Australian is in the 5th position, and the Thai is in the 6th position, the only remaining position for the German is the 4th).

4. The person eating grapes is on the far left or far right, so they must be in the 1st or 6th position. Since the American and the Thai are already placed, the only remaining position for the grapes is the 6th.

5. The person eating cherry is on the left of the fan of metal, so the cherry must be in the 3rd position (since the American is in the 1st position, the Australian is in the 5th position, the Thai is in the 6th position, and the German is in the 4th position, the only remaining position for the cherry is the 3rd).

6. The person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating banana, so the papaya must be in the 2nd position.

7. The person eating lemon is on the left or right of the fan of gospel, so the lemon must be in the 5th position (since the American is in the 1st position, the Australian is in the 5th position, the Thai is in the 6th position, the German is in the 4th position, the cherry is in the 3rd position, and the papaya is in the 2nd position, the only remaining position for the lemon is the 5th).

8. The fan of gospel is on the left or right of the person eating lemon, so the fan of gospel must be in the 1st or 6th position. Since the American, the Australian, the Thai, the German, the cherry, the papaya, and the lemon are already placed, the only remaining position for the fan of gospel is the 6th.

9. The person watching action movies is the fan of punk, so the action movies must be in the 1st position (since the American is the fan of punk and is in the 1st position).

10. The person watching musical movies is the person eating apricot, so the musical movies must be in the 1st position (since the American is the person eating apricot and is in the 1st position).

11. The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the fan of gospel, so the scientific movies must be in the 6th position (since the American is the fan of gospel and is in the 6th position).

12. The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the American, so the fantasy movies must be in the 2nd position (since the American is in the 1st position).

13. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the person eating apricot, so the folk music must be in the 3rd position (since the American is the person eating apricot and is in the 1st position, and the musical movies are in the 1st position, the only remaining position for the folk music is the 3rd).

14. The person eating banana is on the right of the fan of punk, so the banana must be in the 2nd position (since the American is the fan of punk and is in the 1st position).

15. The person eating cherry is between the fan of rock and the person watching scientific movies, so the rock music must be in the 4th position (since the American is the fan of punk and is in the 1st position, the Australian is in the 5th position, the Thai is in the 6th position, the German is in the 4th position, the cherry is in the 3rd position, the papaya is in the 2nd position, and the scientific movies are in the 6th position, the only remaining position for the rock music is the 4th).

16. The Pakistani is in an odd position, so the Pakistani must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. Since the American is already in the 1st position, the Pakistani cannot be in the 1st position. The Pakistani is also not the fan of punk (since the fan of punk is the American), not the fan of gospel (since the fan of gospel is the 6th person), not the fan of folk (since the fan of folk is the 3rd person), not the person eating apricot (since the person eating apricot is the American), not the person eating banana (since the person eating banana is to the right of the fan of punk, and the American is the fan of punk), not the person eating cherry (since the person eating cherry is to the left of the fan of metal and the Pakistani is not the fan of metal), and not the person eating grapes (since the person eating grapes is in the 6th position and the Pakistani is not in an even position). Therefore, the Pakistani must be in the 5th position.

17. The person eating grapes is in the 6th position, so the grapes must be in the 6th position.

18. The person eating lemon is in the 5th position, so the lemon must be in the 5th position.

19. The person watching western movies is on the far left or far right, so the western movies must be in the 1st or 6th position. Since the American is in the 1st position, the Thai is in the 6th position, and the western movies are not action movies (since the American watches action movies), the western movies must be in the 6th position.

20. The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the American, so the fantasy movies must be in the 2nd position.

21. The person eating apricot is in the 1st position (since the American is the person eating apricot and is in the 1st position), and the person watching musical movies is also in the 1st position (since the American is the person watching musical movies), so the apricot and the musical movies must be swapped.

22. The fan of rock is in the 4th position (since the American is the fan of punk and is in the 1st position, the Australian is in the 5th position, the Thai is in the 6th position, the German is in the 4th position, the cherry is in the 3rd position, the papaya is in the 2nd position, and the scientific movies are in the 6th position, the only remaining position for the rock music is the 4th).

23. The fan of metal is not the person eating cherry (since the person eating cherry is to the left of the fan of metal), not the person eating grapes (since the person eating grapes is in the 6th position), not the person eating lemon (since the person eating lemon is on the left or right of the fan of gospel and the fan of metal is not the fan of gospel), not the person eating papaya (since the person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating banana and the fan of metal is not the person eating banana), not the person eating banana (since the person eating banana is on the right of the fan of punk and the fan of metal is not the fan of punk), not the person watching action movies (since the person watching action movies is the fan of punk), not the person watching musical movies (since the person watching musical movies is the American), not the person watching scientific movies (since the person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the fan of gospel and the fan of metal is not the fan of gospel), not the person watching fantasy movies (since the person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the American and the fan of metal is not the American), not the person watching western movies (since the person watching western movies is the Thai and the fan of metal is not the Thai), and not the person eating apricot (since the person eating apricot is the American and the fan of metal is not the American). Therefore, the fan of metal must be the Pakistani (since the Pakistani is in the 5th position and is not the fan of any other genre).

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1    |   2    |     3      |    4     |     5      |    6     |

The table is not complete because the positions for the movies and music genres are not specified. However, we have determined the nationalities and the foods for each person."
Lv4-4x6-3	"To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the hobbies, music-genres, pets, and sports to the columns and rows.

1. We know that there are 6 different hobbies, so we can label the columns with hobbies.
2. Similarly, we know that there are 6 different music-genres, pets, and sports, so we can label the rows with them.

Now let's start solving the clues:

1. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the sport of biathlon is in an even position (clue 7), the fan of hip-hop must be in the first or third column. Let's place the fan of hip-hop in the first column (column 1).

   |               |      1      |    2    |      3       |     4     |       5       |       6       |
   | Hobby         | hip-hop    |         |              |           |               |               |
   | Music-Genre   |           |         |              |           |               |               |
   | Pet           |           |         |              |           |               |               |
   | Sport         | biathlon  |         |              |           |               |               |

2. The owner of the fish is the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the hobby of video-games is in the second column (clue 2), the owner of the fish must be in the second row.

   |               |      1      |    2    |      3       |     4     |       5       |       6       |

   | Sport         | biathlon  |         |              |           |               |               |

3. The fan of country is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing (clue 3). Since the sport of climbing is in the third row (clue 12), the fan of country must be in the first, third, or fifth column. However, the fan of country cannot be in the first column (clue 1), so it must be in the third or fifth column. Let's place the fan of country in the fifth column (column 5).

   |               |      1      |    2    |      3       |     4     |       5       |       6       |

4. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving (clue 4). Since the hobby of skydiving is in the fourth column (clue 5), the hobby of magic-tricks must be in the second column.

5. The person who's hobby is skydiving is the owner of the goat (clue 5). Since the hobby of skydiving is in the fourth column and the pet of goat is in the third row (clue 5), the pet of goat must be in the third column.

   |               |      1      |    2    |      3       |     4     |       5       |       6       |

6. The fan of country is on the far left or far right (clue 6). Since the fan of country is already in the fifth column, it cannot be on the far left. Therefore, it must be in the sixth column.

   |               |      1      |    2    |      3       |     4     |       5       |       6       |

7. The person who's sport is biathlon is in an even position (clue 7). Since the sport of biathlon is already in the second row, it must be in the second column.

   |               |      1      |    2    |      3       |     4     |       5       |       6       |

8. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the owner of the chinchilla (clue 8). Since the hobby of rock-climbing is not yet assigned, let's place it in the third column.

   |               |      1      |    2    |      3       |     4     |       5       |       6       |

10. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the owner of the goat (clue 11). Since the hobby of magic-tricks is already in the second column, it cannot be on the far right. Therefore, it must be in the first column.

14. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the fan of country (clue 14). Since the hobby of rock-climbing is already assigned to the owner of the chinchilla and the fan of country is already in the sixth column, the fan of country must be in the fifth column.

    |               |      1      |    2    |      3       |     4     |       5       |       6       |

15. The owner of the chinchilla is in an odd position (clue 14). Since the hobby of rock-climbing is already assigned to the owner of the chinchilla, it must be in an odd column. However, we already know that it is in the fourth column, which is an even column. This contradicts the clue, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Without resolving this contradiction, we cannot complete the table. However, we have filled in as much as we can based on the given clues.

Lv4-4x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the trike is next to the person eating cucumber, so we can place the cucumber eater in the second, fourth, or sixth position. Let's place the cucumber eater in the second position for now.

2. The person eating nectarine is in an odd position, so it can't be in the first, second, or sixth position. Let's place the nectarine eater in the third position for now.

3. The person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the cucumber eater is in the second position and golf can't be in the first position (because the subway driver can't be in the first position), the golf player can only be in the fourth or sixth position. Let's place the golf player in the fourth position for now.

4. The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage. Since the cucumber eater is in the second position and the raspberry eater can't be in the first position (because the raspberry eater is on the left of the German, and the German can't be in the first position), the cabbage eater can only be in the fifth position. So, let's place the cabbage eater in the fifth position and the raspberry eater in the third position.

5. The person eating raspberry is on the left of the German. Since the raspberry eater is in the third position, the German must be in the fifth position.

6. The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person eating lemon. So, let's place the lemon eater in the sixth position.

7. The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the nectarine eater is in the third position, the biathlon player can only be in the first or fifth position. Let's place the biathlon player in the first position.

8. The person eating cucumber is on the left of the person eating raspberry. Since the cucumber eater is in the second position and the raspberry eater is in the third position, the cucumber eater must be in the first position. So, we need to swap the cucumber and the biathlon.

9. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the german. Since the German is in the fifth position and the cycling player can't be in the first position (because the cycling player is on the left or right of the German), the cycling player can only be in the sixth position.

10. The spanish is on the left of the person driving the train. Since the train driver can't be in the first position (because the Spanish is on its left), the train driver must be in the second position. So, let's place the Spanish in the first position.

11. The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the surfing player is in the sixth position (because they are the person driving the trike), the motorbike driver can only be in the fifth position.

12. The person driving the airplane is the indian. Since the airplane driver can't be in the first position (because the Indian is in the first position), the airplane driver must be in the sixth position.

13. The russian is in an even position. Since the Russian can't be in the first position (because the even positions are the second, fourth, and sixth), the Russian must be in the sixth position.

14. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the cycling player is in the sixth position and the golf player is in the fourth position, the cycling player must be in the fifth position.

15. The person eating cabbage is the person who's sport is badminton. Since the cabbage eater is in the fifth position, the badminton player is also in the fifth position.

16. The british is on the right of the person eating nectarine. Since the nectarine eater is in the third position, the British can only be in the fourth position.

17. The spanish is on the left of the german. Since the Spanish is in the first position and the German is in the fifth position, this condition is already satisfied.

18. The person who's sport is surfing is the person driving the trike. Since the surfing player is in the sixth position, the trike driver is also in the sixth position.

19. The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. Since the nectarine eater is in the third position, the zucchini eater can only be in the first or fifth position. Let's place the zucchini eater in the first position.

20. The german is on the far left or far right. Since the German is in the fifth position, the German is on the far right.

Lv4-4x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start with the positions of the pets. Since the owner of the goat is on the far left or far right (17), and the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the person eating cherry (12), we can place the goat on the far left and the guinea-pig on the far right. The owner of the cat and the owner of the hedgehog can't be on the far left or far right because the goat and guinea-pig are already there, so they must be in the middle positions. Let's place the cat first, then the hedgehog.

2. The owner of the rabbit is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is collecting (3), and the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the owner of the rabbit (5). So, the person who's hobby is fishing must be on the left of the rabbit, and the person who's hobby is collecting must be on the far left.

3. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in an odd position (13), so it can't be in the first, third, or fifth position. Since we've placed the rabbit, cat, and hedgehog, the only odd position left is the sixth position. So, the person who's hobby is skydiving is in the sixth position.

4. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person eating radish (6), and the person eating radish can't be in the first position because the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person eating radish. So, the person eating radish is in the second position.

5. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the far right (8), so it must be in the sixth position.

6. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit (21), and the owner of the rabbit is in the fourth position. So, the person drinking sprite can be in the third or fifth position. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in the sixth position, the person drinking sprite must be in the fifth position.

7. The person drinking mirinda is the person eating lime (2), and the person eating lime is on the left or right of the person eating tomato (4). Since the person eating lime is the person drinking mirinda, the person eating lime can't be in the first position because the person eating tomato can't be in the second position (since the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person eating radish). So, the person eating lime is in the third position.

8. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the owner of the goat (20), and the owner of the goat is on the far left. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the second position.

9. The person eating banana can't be in the first position because the person eating watermelon is on the far left (11), and the person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the person eating banana (16). So, the person eating banana is in the fourth position.

10. The person eating cherry is on the far right (19), so it must be in the sixth position.

11. The person eating tomato can't be in the second position because the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the owner of the goat (20), and the owner of the goat is in the second position. So, the person eating tomato is in the fifth position.

12. The person drinking juice can't be in the first position because the person eating watermelon is on the far left (11), and the person drinking juice can't be in the second position because the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the owner of the goat (20). So, the person drinking juice is in the third position.

13. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the owner of the goat (20), and the owner of the goat is in the second position. So, the person drinking milk is in the fourth position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|            |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |       5       |      6       |

| Pet        | cat       | guinea-pig | rabbit   | hedgehog | goat        | cat         |

The table is not complete because we don't know the exact positions of the beverages, foods, hobbies, and pets. However, we know their relative positions based on the given clues. The final solution table would have the exact positions filled in, but the given clues don't provide enough information to determine the exact positions.

Lv4-4x6-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the far left and 6 being the far right).

2. From rule 11, we know that the owner of the mouse is on the far right (position 6).

3. From rule 10, we know that the owner of the lizard is the person eating cucumber. So, cucumber must be in position 5 (left of the mouse).

4. From rule 13, we know that the person eating cucumber is on the left of the owner of the fish. So, fish must be in position 4.

5. From rule 14, we know that the person eating cucumber is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. So, volleyball must be in position 3.

6. From rule 16, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the far right (position 6).

7. From rule 19, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far right (position 6). So, rock-climbing must be the hobby of the person in position 6.

8. From rule 18, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since sailing is in position 3, writing must be in position 4 or 5. But from rule 17, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. Since the mouse is already on the right, the snake must be in position 4, so writing cannot be in position 4. Therefore, writing must be in position 5.

9. From rule 15, we know that the person eating avocado is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber (position 5). Since we already have other elements on the left of position 5, avocado must be in position 6 (right of cucumber).

10. From rule 12, we know that the person eating broccoli is between the person eating radish and the person who's hobby is writing. Since writing is in position 5 and radish cannot be in position 1 (rule 6), broccoli must be in position 2.

11. From rule 4, we know that the person eating garlic is on the left of the person eating cucumber (position 5). Since broccoli is in position 2, garlic must be in position 1.

12. From rule 8, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person eating avocado (position 6).

13. From rule 15, we know that the person eating avocado is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber (position 5). Since we already have elements on the left of position 5, the person eating avocado must be in position 6 (right of cucumber).

14. From rule 12, we know that the person eating broccoli is between the person eating radish and the person who's hobby is writing (position 5). Since we already have elements on the left of position 1, the person eating radish must be in position 1.

15. From rule 3, we know that the person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since volleyball is in position 3 and parkour is in position 6, badminton must be in position 2.

16. From rule 2, we know that the owner of the mouse is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the mouse is in position 6, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in position 5.

17. From rule 5, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is the person who's hobby is sudoku. So, cycling must be the sport of the person in position 5.

18. From rule 1, we know that there are 6 different types of food, 6 different hobbies, 6 different pets, and 6 different sports. So, we know that the food in position 1 is avocado, the hobby in position 2 is chess, the pet in position 3 is the goat (since it's not listed yet), and the sport in position 4 is sailing (since it's in an odd position and we already know the other sports).

19. From rule 7, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the owner of the goat. Since the goat is in position 3, traveling must be in position 2 or 4. But from rule 9, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the owner of the goat. So, traveling must be in position 2.

20. From rule 16, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the far right (position 6). Since we already know the sport in position 4 is sailing (an odd position), the sport in position 2 must be badminton (an even position).

21. From rule 1, we know that there are 6 different types of food. Since we already know the food in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, the food in position 4 must be grapefruit.

22. From rule 1, we know that there are 6 different hobbies. Since we already know the hobbies in positions 2, 5, and 6, the hobby in position 4 must be traveling.

23. From rule 1, we know that there are 6 different pets. Since we already know the pets in positions 3 and 6, the pet in position 4 must be the goat.

24. From rule 1, we know that there are 6 different sports. Since we already know the sports in positions 2, 4, and 6, the sport in position 3 must be cycling.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |     1      |      2       |    3     |     4     |    5     |       6       |

Lv4-4x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the bus driver is in an even position and there are 6 people, the bus driver can be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the bus driver is in position 2 (the owner of the snake is in position 3 or 5).

2. The person driving the scooter is the person who plays cricket (from rule 7). Since the scooter driver is between the fan of electronic and the owner of the goat (rule 4), the fan of electronic must be in position 1, and the owner of the goat must be in position 5 or 6 (not position 3 because the bus driver is there).

3. The owner of the dog plays cycling (rule 11), so the owner of the dog must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since the owner of the dog can't be in position 1 (because the fan of electronic is there), and can't be in position 5 (because the owner of the goat is there), the owner of the dog must be in position 3.

4. The person who plays rugby is between the person who plays skiing and the owner of the ferret (rule 12). Since the owner of the dog is in position 3, the person who plays rugby can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the person who plays rugby must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the person who plays rugby is in position 4.

5. The person who plays swimming is on the left of the person who plays baseball (rule 3). Since the owner of the dog is in position 3, the person who plays swimming must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the person who plays swimming is in position 1.

6. The person who plays baseball is on the right of the fan of salsa (rule 6). Since the owner of the dog is in position 3, the fan of salsa must be in position 5 or 6. Let's assume the fan of salsa is in position 6.

7. The fan of dubstep is on the left or right of the person who plays baseball (rule 9). Since the person who plays baseball is in position 2, the fan of dubstep can't be in position 1 (because the fan of salsa is there). So, the fan of dubstep must be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the fan of dubstep is in position 3.

8. The person driving the snowmobile is the owner of the goat (rule 8). Since the owner of the goat is in position 5, the person driving the snowmobile is in position 5.

9. The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep (rule 13). Since the fan of dubstep is in position 3, the person driving the helicopter can't be in position 1 (because the fan of electronic is there). So, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the person driving the helicopter is in position 4.

10. The person driving the bike is on the far left or far right (rule 15). Since the person driving the bus is in position 2, the person driving the bike can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the person driving the bike must be in position 3, 5, or 6. Let's assume the person driving the bike is in position 6.

11. The person who plays skiing is between the person who plays rugby and the owner of the ferret (rule 12). Since the person who plays rugby is in position 4 and the owner of the ferret can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the fan of electronic, the owner of the dog, and the fan of dubstep are there), the person who plays skiing must be in position 2.

12. The owner of the ferret is between the person who plays skiing and the person who plays trance (rule 2). Since the person who plays skiing is in position 2, the owner of the ferret must be in position 3.

13. The fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of dubstep (rule 16). Since the fan of dubstep is in position 3, the fan of reggae must be in position 4 or 5. Let's assume the fan of reggae is in position 4.

14. The person who plays trance is in the remaining position 5.

8. The person eating banana is in an even position. Since we have already placed 4 items, the person eating banana must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, since we know that the person driving the taxi is the person eating banana, and the taxi is in position 3, banana can't be in position 2 or 4. So, banana must be in position 6.

14. The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 6. Let's place handball:

17. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is in position 3 (because the person driving the car is the person who's sport is skateboarding), the person driving the taxi is in position 2 or 4. However, since we know that the person eating banana is in position 6 and the person driving the taxi is the person eating banana, the person driving the taxi must be in position 2.

Lv4-4x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people, so we can label them from 1 to 6.

2. Let's start with the hobbies. Since the hobby of card-games is on the left of house, and the hobby of folk is in an odd position, we can place card-games in position 1 (odd) and folk in position 3 (odd). This leaves us with cooking, photography, skydiving, video-games, and fishing for the remaining positions.

3. Since the hobby of skydiving is on the left or right of fishing, and it's also on the left of hip-hop, we can place skydiving in position 2 (left of fishing and right of hip-hop). This leaves us with fishing in position 4, video-games in position 5, and photography in position 6.

4. Now let's place the beverages. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography, we can place hot-chocolate in position 1 (left of photography in position 6). This leaves us with fanta, iced-tea, juice, milk, and sprite for the remaining positions.

5. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking juice. So, we can place iced-tea in position 3 (right of juice in position 2) and juice in position 2 (left of iced-tea in position 3). This leaves us with fanta, milk, and sprite for the remaining positions.

6. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the fan of dubstep is the person watching disaster movies and is in an even position, milk cannot be in position 1 (left of dubstep) or position 3 (right of dubstep). So, milk must be in position 2 (left of iced-tea). This leaves us with fanta and sprite for the remaining positions.

7. The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person drinking fanta. So, we can place zombie movies in position 4 (left of fanta in position 5). This leaves us with sprite for position 6.

8. The person watching satire movies is on the far left. Since we have already placed the hobbies and beverages, satire movies must be in position 1.

9. The person drinking fanta is not watching disaster movies (as it's already assigned to zombie movies), so fanta must be in position 5. This leaves us with sprite for position 6.

10. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since we have already placed the hobbies and beverages, martial-arts movies must be in position 4 (left of hip-hop in position 2).

11. The fan of soul is on the far right. Since we have already placed the hobbies and beverages, soul must be in position 6.

12. The person watching spy movies is on the left of the fan of hip-hop. Since we have already placed the hobbies and beverages, spy movies must be in position 3 (left of hip-hop in position 2).

13. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since we have already placed the hobbies and beverages, disaster movies must be in position 2 (left of milk in position 1).

14. The final table is as follows:

   |               |    1    |       2       |      3       |     4     |    5     |      6      |
   | Beverage      | satire  | disaster     | martial-arts | hip-hop   | fanta    |   soul     |
   | Hobby         | card-games| skydiving   | photography  | fishing   | video-games| cooking    |
   | Movie-Genre   |        |      zombie  |      spy     |   folk    |   fanta   |   sy       |

   However, we still need to place the music-genres. Since the fan of dubstep is the person watching disaster movies, dubstep must be in position 2. The fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games, so house must be in position 1. The fan of pop is not specified to be in a specific position, so it can be in any of the remaining positions. The fan of soul is in position 6, so the remaining music-genres are dubstep in position 2, house in position 1, and pop in position 3, 4, or 5. Since pop is not in an even position (as it's not specified to be in an even position), it cannot be in position 2 or 4. So, pop must be in position 3, 5, or 6. Since soul is in position 6, pop cannot be in position 6. So, pop must be in position 3 or 5. Since house is in position 1, pop cannot be in position 1. So, pop must be in position 5.

   The final table is:

   |               |    1    |       2       |      3       |     4     |    5     |      6      |
   | Beverage      | satire  | disaster     | martial-arts | hip-hop   | fanta    |   soul     |
   | Hobby         | card-games| skydiving   | photography  | fishing   | video-games| cooking    |

1. Place the snowboarder on the far left (1st position). Let's say it's the Russian (R).
2. Place the Turkish (T) next to the snowboarder (2nd position) since the Turkish plays tennis.
3. The Turkish cannot be in position 4, 6, or 8 because the car driver is in an even position and the Turkish is on the left or right of the software-developer, who cannot be in position 4, 6, or 8 either. So, the Turkish is in position 3.
4. The Dutch (D) cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 because the Dutch drives the bus and the Turkish is in position 3. Also, the Dutch cannot be in position 6 because the thai is on the left or right of the Dutch and the thai is the ice-hockey player, which we will place later. So, the Dutch is in position 2.
5. The car driver cannot be the Dutch, so it must be the project-manager (PM). Since the Dutch is in position 2, the project-manager is in position 4.
6. The thai (Th) cannot be in position 1 or 3 because the thai is on the left or right of the Dutch, and the Dutch is in position 2. Also, the thai cannot be in position 6 because the thai is the ice-hockey player, and the ice-hockey player cannot be on the far right. So, the thai is in position 5.
7. The ice-hockey player (IH) is the thai, so we know that.
8. The coach (C) cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 because the coach is on the right of the project-manager, and the project-manager is in position 4. So, the coach is in position 6.
9. The designer (Dsg) cannot be in position 1 or 3 because the designer is on the left or right of the surfer, and the surfer is not placed yet. So, the designer is in position 2.
10. The surfer (S) cannot be in position 6 because the surfer is on the left or right of the designer, and the designer is in position 2. Also, the surfer cannot be in position 4 because the project-manager is in position 4. So, the surfer is in position 3.
11. The russian (R) cannot be in position 1 or 3 because the russian is on the left or right of the surfer, and the surfer is in position 3. Also, the russian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing, and the surfer is the russian's neighbor. So, the russian is in position 5.
12. The person driving the roller (Rl) cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 because the russian is in position 5. Also, the russian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing, and the surfer is the russian's neighbor. So, the person driving the roller is in position 6.
13. The person driving the van (V) cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 because the russian is in position 5. Also, the person driving the van is on the left or right of the bartender, and the bartender is not placed yet. So, the person driving the van is in position 2.
14. The bartender (B) cannot be in position 6 because the person driving the van is on the left or right of the bartender, and the person driving the van is in position 2. So, the bartender is in position 4.
15. The software-developer (SD) cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 because the Turkish is in position 3, and the Turkish is on the left of the software-developer. Also, the software-developer is on the left of the Turkish, so the software-developer is in position 6.
16. The person driving the boat (Bt) cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 because the Turkish is in position 3, and the Turkish is on the left or right of the software-developer, who is in position 6. Also, the person driving the boat is on the left of the scientist, and the scientist is not placed yet. So, the person driving the boat is in position 4.
17. The scientist (Sc) cannot be in position 6 because the person driving the boat is on the left of the scientist, and the person driving the boat is in position 4. Also, the scientist cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5 because the scientist is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo, and the person who's sport is water-polo is not placed yet. So, the scientist is in position 2.
18. The person who's sport is water-polo (WP) cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 because the scientist is in position 2, and the scientist is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Also, the person who's sport is water-polo is on the far right, so the person who's sport is water-polo is in position 6.
19. The Malaysian (M) is the only nationality left, so the Malaysian is the designer (Dsg).
20. The Japanese (J) is the only nationality left, so the Japanese is the coach (C).
