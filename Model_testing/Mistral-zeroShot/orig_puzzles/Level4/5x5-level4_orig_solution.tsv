Lv4-5x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the paramedic is the Russian. Let's place the Russian in position 3 (since there are 5 positions and we need to place 5 people).

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3      |     4      |     5      |
   | Job           |            |         |   Paramedic|            |            |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |         |            |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   |            |         |            |            |            |
   | Nationality   |            |         |   Russian  |            |            |
   | Transport     |            |         |            |            |            |

2. From point 2, we know that the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person driving the trike. Since the paramedic (who watches family movies) is in position 3, the trike driver must be in an even position (4 or 5). Let's place the trike driver in position 4 for now.

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3      |     4      |     5      |

   | Transport     |            |         |            |   Trike    |            |

3. From point 3, we know that the fan of jazz is between the Colombian and the person driving the motorbike. Since the Colombian (who we will place later) is not yet placed, let's place the motorbike driver for now. The motorbike driver can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 because the trike driver is in position 4 and the paramedic is in position 3. So, the motorbike driver can only be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the motorbike driver in position 2 for now.

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3      |     4      |     5      |

   | Nationality   |            |   Colombian|   Russian  |            |            |
   | Transport     |            |   Motorbike|            |   Trike    |            |

4. From point 4, we know that the person driving the trike is in an even position. We already placed the trike driver in position 4, so this condition is satisfied.

5. From point 5, we know that the bartender is on the right of the Malaysian. Since the Malaysian (who watches action movies) is not yet placed, let's place the Malaysian in position 1 for now.

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3      |     4      |     5      |

   | Transport     |            |   Motorbike|            |   Trike    |            |

6. From point 6, we know that the bartender is the Colombian. So, we swap the positions of the Accountant and the Bartender.

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3      |     4      |     5      |

7. From point 7, we know that the fan of reggae is on the right of the writer. Since the writer is in position 1, the fan of reggae must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Let's place the fan of reggae in position 5 for now.

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3      |     4      |     5      |

8. From point 8, we know that the pakistani is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since the person watching western movies is not yet placed, let's place the pakistani in position 1 for now.

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3      |     4      |     5      |

9. From point 9, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position. Since the quad-bike driver can't be in position 1 (because the pakistani is there), the quad-bike driver can only be in position 3 or 5. Let's place the quad-bike driver in position 3 for now.

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3      |     4      |     5      |

10. From point 10, we know that the fan of electronic is on the left or right of the person driving the trike. Since the trike driver is in position 4, the fan of electronic can't be in position 5 (because the fan of reggae is there). So, the fan of electronic must be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the fan of electronic in position 2 for now.

    |               |     1      |    2    |     3      |     4      |     5      |

Since the writer is in position 3 and the Spanish is not yet placed, the person watching satire movies can't be in position 3. So, the person watching satire movies must be in position 1 or 5. Let's place the person watching satire movies in position 1 for now.

20. From point 20, we know that the writer is the person driving the trike. Since the writer is in position 3, the trike driver is in position 4. So, we swap the positions of the writer and the person driving the trike.

Lv4-5x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking iced-tea is the owner of the turtle, let's place the turtle owner in the 5th position (column 4).

2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since we know the position of the turtle owner (iced-tea), we can place the ice-hockey person to the left of the hot-chocolate person in column 3.

3. The person drinking coffee is between the person driving the quad-bike and the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish owner is on the far left or far right (odd position), the quad-bike driver must be in an even position. Let's place the quad-bike driver in column 2. The coffee person will be in column 3 or 4.

4. The person driving the ship is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since the fish owner is in an even position (nurse), the ship driver must be in column 5.

5. The person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position. Since we know the positions of the fish owner (nurse) and the ship driver, the swimmer must be in column 1, 3, or 5. However, since the swimmer can't be next to the ice-hockey person (due to the hot-chocolate person being to the right of the ice-hockey person), the swimmer can only be in column 1 or 5. Let's place the swimmer in column 1 for now.

6. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the swimmer is in column 1, the cyclist can't be in column 2 (next to the quad-bike driver). So, the cyclist must be in column 3 or 5. Let's place the cyclist in column 3 for now.

7. The mechanic is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the mechanic can't be next to the quad-bike driver (due to the coffee person being between the quad-bike driver and the goldfish owner), the mechanic can't be in column 2. So, the mechanic must be in column 1, 4, or 5. However, since the mechanic can't be next to the cyclist (due to the coffee person being between the quad-bike driver and the goldfish owner), the mechanic can't be in column 3. So, the mechanic must be in column 1 or 5. Since the mechanic can't be next to the swimmer (due to the coffee person being between the quad-bike driver and the goldfish owner), the mechanic must be in column 5. The almond-milk person will be in column 1, 2, or 4.

8. The nurse is in an even position. Since we know the positions of the fish owner (nurse) and the ship driver, the nurse must be in column 2.

9. The lawyer is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the swimmer is in column 1, the rower must be in column 2 or 3. However, since the lawyer is on the right of the rower, the rower can't be in column 2 (next to the nurse). So, the rower must be in column 3.

10. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left or right of the nurse. Since the nurse is in column 2, the quad-bike driver can be in column 1 or 3. However, since the coffee person is between the quad-bike driver and the goldfish owner, the quad-bike driver can't be in column 1. So, the quad-bike driver must be in column 3.

11. The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the rabbit owner is the person drinking iced-tea (in column 4), the tennis player can be in column 5.

12. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person driving the roller. Since the roller driver can't be in column 1 (next to the swimmer), the roller driver must be in column 2 or 3. However, since the mechanic is on the left or right of the person driving the roller, the roller driver can't be in column 3 (next to the mechanic). So, the roller driver must be in column 2. The hedgehog owner will be in column 1.

13. The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since the roller driver is in column 2, the mechanic must be in column 1.

14. The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the cyclist. Since the cyclist is in column 3, the motorbike driver can be in column 2 or 4. However, since the mechanic is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk, the motorbike driver can't be in column 4 (next to the mechanic). So, the motorbike driver must be in column 2.

15. The person drinking almond-milk is in column 1, 2, or 4. However, since the mechanic is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk, the almond-milk person can't be in column 1 (next to the mechanic). So, the almond-milk person must be in column 2 or 4. However, since the rower is in column 3, the almond-milk person can't be in column 4 (next to the rower). So, the almond-milk person must be in column 2.

Now, let's put the beverages, jobs, pets, sports, and transports in their respective positions:

| Beverage    |     1      |      2      |     3     |     4      |       5       |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Job        |            |             |           |            |               |
| Pet        |            |             |           |            | gold          |
| Sport      | swimming    | ice-hockey  | rowing    |             | tennis         |
| Transport  | motorbike   | quad-bike   | roller    | ship       |               |

Since the almond-milk person is in column 2, the jobs, pets, and the remaining sport and transport can be filled based on the given information:

| Beverage    |     1      |      2      |     3     |     4      |       5       |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Job        | dancer     | mechanic    | nurse    | lawyer     | photographer   |
| Pet        | hedgehog   | goldfish    | fish     | turtle     | rabbit         |
| Sport      | swimming    | ice-hockey  | rowing    | cycling     | tennis         |
| Transport  | motorbike   | quad-bike   | roller    | ship       |               |

However, we don't have enough information to determine the order of the jobs, pets, and the remaining sport and transport within the columns.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage    |     1      |      2      |     3     |     4      |       5       |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Job        | dancer     | mechanic    | nurse    | lawyer     | photographer   |
| Pet        | hedgehog   | goldfish    | fish     | turtle     | rabbit         |
| Sport      | swimming    | ice-hockey  | rowing    | cycling     | tennis         |
| Transport  | motorbike   | quad-bike   | roller    | ship       |               |
#############

The order of the jobs, pets, and the remaining sport and transport within the columns can't be determined with the given information."
Lv4-5x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can label them A to E from left to right.

2. Let's start with the positions of the pets. Since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the owner of the pony (P), T must be either A or B. If T is A, then P must be C, D, or E. But since the owner of the turtle is also driving the van, T cannot be A. So, T must be B, and P must be C.

3. Now, the owner of the chinchilla (Ch) is between the bartender (B) and the person eating lemon (L). Since B is snowboarding (Sb) and L is not on the far right (Pomegranate), L cannot be E. So, L must be A or B. If L is A, then Ch must be C or D. But since Ch is between B and L, Ch cannot be D. So, Ch must be C. This means B is the bartender and B is snowboarding.

4. The owner of the lizard (Li) is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber (Cu). Since Cu is not on the far right (Pomegranate), Cu cannot be E. So, Cu must be A, B, or D. If Cu is A, then Li must be B or C. But since Li is not the owner of the turtle (T), Li cannot be B. So, Li must be C. This means the person eating cucumber is D.

5. The person driving the airplane (Ai) is on the right of the owner of the pony (P). Since P is C, Ai must be D or E. But since Ai is not the owner of the turtle (T), Ai cannot be E. So, Ai must be D.

6. The owner of the snake (S) is between the owner of the pony (P) and the person who's sport is parkour (Pk). Since P is C and Ai is D, S must be B.

7. The person who's sport is golf (G) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is handball (H). Since the bartender (B) is snowboarding (Sb), B cannot be G or H. So, G or H must be A, C, D, or E. If G is A, then H must be C, D, or E. But since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch), T cannot be E. So, H must be E. This means G is A, C, or D. If G is C, then H must be A or E. But since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch), T cannot be A. So, G must be D.

8. The person eating pomegranate (Pom) is on the far right. Since G is D, Pom must be E.

9. The person driving the bus (Bu) is on the left of the person eating lemon (L). Since L is A or B, Bu must be C or D. But since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch), T cannot be D. So, Bu must be C.

10. The owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch). Since Bu is C, T must be A.

11. The musician (M) is in an odd position. Since we have already placed 4 people (T, B, L, Bu), M must be E.

12. The owner of the turtle (T) is in an odd position. Since we have already placed 4 people (T, B, L, Bu), this condition is already satisfied.

13. The person eating cucumber (Cu) is on the right of the person who's sport is handball (H). Since H is E, Cu must be D.

14. The person who's sport is water-polo (Wp) is on the left of the owner of the pony (P). Since P is C, Wp must be A or B. But since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch), T cannot be A. So, Wp must be B.

15. The owner of the snake (S) is on the right of the person driving the train (Tr). Since S is B, Tr must be A or D. But since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch), T cannot be D. So, Tr must be A.

16. The owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the person driving the bus (Bu). But we already placed T and Bu, which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption that T is B was incorrect. T must be D, and P must be E. This means Ai is C, Bu is A, and Tr is D.

17. Now, the owner of the chinchilla (Ch) is between the bartender (B) and the person eating lemon (L). Since B is snowboarding (Sb) and L is A, Ch must be C or E. But since Ch is between B and L, Ch cannot be E. So, Ch must be C.

18. The owner of the lizard (Li) is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber (Cu). Since Cu is D, Li must be A or C. But since Li is not the owner of the turtle (T), Li cannot be A. So, Li must be C.

19. The person eating pomegranate (Pom) is on the far right. Since we already placed Pom as E, this condition is already satisfied.

20. The person who's sport is golf (G) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is handball (H). Since H is E, G must be A, C, or D. If G is C, then H must be A or E. But since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch), T cannot be A. So, G must be D.

21. The person driving the bus (Bu) is on the left of the person eating lemon (L). Since L is A or B, Bu must be C or D. But since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch), T cannot be D. So, Bu must be C.

22. The owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch). Since Bu is C, T must be A.

23. The musician (M) is in an odd position. Since we have already placed 4 people (T, B, L, Bu), M must be E.

24. The owner of the lizard (Li) is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber (Cu). Since Cu is D, Li must be A or C. But since Li is not the owner of the turtle (T), Li cannot be A. So, Li must be C.

25. The person eating pomegranate (Pom) is on the far right. Since we already placed Pom as E, this condition is already satisfied.

26. The person who's sport is water-polo (Wp) is on the left of the owner of the pony (P). Since P is E, Wp must be A or B. But since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch), T cannot be A. So, Wp must be B.

27. The owner of the snake (S) is on the right of the person driving the train (Tr). Since Tr is D, S must be C.

28. The teacher (Tch) is not the owner of the turtle (T), so Tch cannot be A or C. Tch must be B or E. But since the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the teacher (Tch), T must be D. This means Tch is E.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-5x5-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the jobs to the people. We know the teacher is not on the far left or right (12, 11), so they can't be the first or last person. Let's place the teacher in the middle (position 3). The remaining jobs can be distributed among the other positions.

2. The teacher is on the left of the Malaysian (2). So, the Malaysian can't be in position 3, and must be either 1 or 5. Let's place the Malaysian in position 1 for now.

3. The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig (3). The guinea-pig owner can't be in position 1 (since the Malaysian is there), so they must be in position 5.

4. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the Malaysian (13). Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the person watching family movies can't be in position 2 or 3. Let's place them in position 4 for now.

5. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies (15). Since the person watching mystery movies is in position 5, the person watching family movies can't be in position 1 or 3. So, they must be in position 2.

6. The person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies (7). Since the person watching adventure movies is in position 10 (from 18 and 10), the person watching spy movies can't be in position 9 or 11. Let's place them in position 8 for now.

7. The person watching spy movies is the owner of the goat (8). So, the goat owner must be in position 8.

8. The turkish is on the right of the owner of the goat (16). So, the turkian must be in position 4 or 5. Since the person watching family movies is in position 2, the turkish can't be in position 5. So, the turkish is in position 4.

9. The pakistani is on the left of the egyptian (6). Since the teacher is in position 3, the pakistani can't be in position 1 or 3. Let's place the pakistani in position 5 for now.

10. The person watching adventure movies is the person who's sport is tennis (10 and 18). So, the person playing tennis must be in position 1.

11. The person playing tennis is the architect (18). So, the architect is in position 1.

12. The person watching mystery movies is the person watching mystery movies (20). So, the person watching mystery movies is in position 5.

13. The person watching spy movies is in the middle (17). So, the person watching spy movies is in position 3.

14. The owner of the hamster is in an odd position (14). Since the positions 1, 3, and 5 are filled, the hamster owner must be in position 2.

15. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the malaysian (13). Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the person watching family movies can't be in position 2. So, the person watching family movies is in position 3.

16. The pilot is on the left or right of the teacher (12). Since the teacher is in position 3, the pilot can't be in position 1 or 3. Let's place the pilot in position 2 for now.

17. The nurse is on the right of the teacher (11). Since the teacher is in position 3, the nurse must be in position 4.

18. The person watching soccer is between the egyptian and the teacher (4). Since the teacher is in position 3 and the egyptian can't be in position 1 (since the Malaysian is there), the person playing soccer must be in position 2.

19. The brazilian is on the far right (19). Since the nurse is in position 4, the brazilian must be in position 5.

20. The person playing golf is on the left or right of the person playing tennis (1). Since the person playing tennis is in position 1, the person playing golf can't be in position 2. So, the person playing golf is in position 3.

21. The person playing sailing is on the left or right of the person playing golf (not specified in the puzzle, but since there are only 5 positions, it must be true). Since the person playing golf is in position 3, the person playing sailing must be in position 2.

22. The person playing water-polo is on the left of the person playing golf (5). Since the person playing golf is in position 3, the person playing water-polo must be in position 1.

23. The person playing tennis is the architect (18). So, the architect is in position 1.

24. The person playing golf is on the left or right of the person playing adventure movies (3). Since the person playing adventure movies is in position 10, the person playing golf can't be in position 9 or 11. So, the person playing golf is in position 10.

Lv4-5x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

2. The sport of snowboarding is in position 4. Since rugby is eating kale, it can't be in position 4, so it must be in position 3. The sports are now: baseball, cricket, cycling, rugby, and snowboarding.

3. The person who is camping is between traveling and cranberry. Since traveling is in the middle, camping must be in position 2 and cranberry in position 4. The food is now: corn, cranberry, kale, nectarine, radish.

4. Photography is on the left or right of corn. Since the spy movie watcher is on the left, photography can't be in position 1, so it must be in position 5.

5. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left, so it must be in position 1.

6. The person eating cranberry is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since martial-arts is on the far left, cranberry must be in position 3.

This is the final solution table."
Lv4-5x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the strawberry eater is on the right of the superhero movie watcher, we can place the superhero movie watcher in the second position (as the first position is occupied by the far left person). So, Superhero Movies goes in the 2nd row, 1st column.

2. Since the soccer player is on the left of the trance fan, and the trance fan is in an odd position, the trance fan must be in the 3rd, 5th, or 7th position. Let's place the trance fan in the 3rd column for now. So, Trance goes in the 2nd row, 3rd column.

3. The snake owner is between the tomato eater and the guinea-pig owner. Since the tomato eater is to the left of the snake owner, and the snake owner is on the left of the metal fan, the tomato eater must be in the 1st or 3rd column. The snake owner can't be in the 1st or 7th position (as it would violate the odd position rule for trance), so the snake owner must be in the 5th column. So, Snake goes in the 2nd row, 5th column.

4. Since the snake owner is to the left of the metal fan, the metal fan must be in the 4th or 6th column.

5. The soccer player is on the left or right of the lemon eater. Since the lemon eater is the superhero movie watcher (who is in the 2nd column), the soccer player can't be in the 1st or 3rd column. So, the soccer player must be in the 4th or 6th column. Since the soccer player is also to the left of the trance fan (who is in the 3rd column), the soccer player must be in the 4th column. So, Soccer goes in the 1st row, 4th column.

6. The mouse owner is on the far left. Since the snake owner is in the 5th column, the mouse owner must be in the 1st column. So, Mouse goes in the 6th row, 1st column.

7. The volleyball player is the mouse owner. So, Volleyball goes in the 6th row, 1st column.

8. Since the trance fan is in the 3rd column, the odd position rule for trance is satisfied. So, we don't need to consider the 3rd row anymore.

9. The tomato eater is to the right of the superhero movie watcher (who is in the 2nd column), so the tomato eater can't be in the 1st column. So, the tomato eater must be in the 4th or 6th column. Since the tomato eater is also to the right of the snake owner (who is in the 5th column), the tomato eater must be in the 6th column. So, Tomato goes in the 1st row, 6th column.

10. The lemon eater is the skiing player. So, Skiing goes in the 1st row, 2nd column.

11. Since the soccer player is in the 4th column, the family movie watcher can't be in the 4th column (as it would violate the left or right rule with trance). So, the family movie watcher must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th column. Since the family movie watcher is also to the left or right of the trance fan (who is in the 3rd column), the family movie watcher must be in the 1st column. So, Family goes in the 2nd row, 1st column.

12. Since the metal fan is in the 4th or 6th column, the snowboarding player must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 5th column. Since the snowboarding player is also to the right of the snake owner (who is in the 5th column), the snowboarding player must be in the 2nd column. So, Snowboarding goes in the 3rd row, 2nd column.

13. Since the soccer player is in the 4th column, the lemon eater (who is the skiing player) can't be in the 4th column. So, the lemon eater must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th column. Since the lemon eater is also to the left or right of the trance fan (who is in the 3rd column), the lemon eater must be in the 1st column. So, this violates the left or right rule with the family movie watcher. So, the lemon eater must be in the 5th column. So, Lemon goes in the 1st row, 5th column.

14. Since the trance fan is in the 3rd column, the apple eater can't be in the 3rd column. So, the apple eater must be in the 1st, 4th, or 6th column. Since the apple eater is also to the right of the trance fan, the apple eater must be in the 6th column. So, Apple goes in the 2nd row, 6th column.

15. Since the satire movie watcher is in an odd position, it must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th column. Since the satire movie watcher is also on the left or right of the family movie watcher (who is in the 1st column), the satire movie watcher must be in the 3rd column. So, Satire goes in the 4th row, 3rd column.

16. Since the satire movie watcher is in the 3rd column, the family movie watcher can't be in the 3rd column. So, the family movie watcher must be in the 1st or 5th column. This violates the left or right rule with trance. So, the family movie watcher must be in the 5th column. So, Family goes in the 2nd row, 5th column.

17. Since the volleyball player is the mouse owner (who is in the 1st column), the snake owner can't be in the 1st column. So, the snake owner must be in the 4th or 6th column. Since the snake owner is also to the left of the metal fan, the snake owner must be in the 4th column. So, Snake goes in the 2nd row, 4th column.

18. Since the cucumber eater is not the tomato eater (who is in the 6th column), the cucumber eater must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th column. Since the cucumber eater is also not the apple eater (who is in the 6th column), the cucumber eater must be in the 1st or 5th column. Since the cucumber eater is also not the lemon eater (who is in the 5th column), the cucumber eater must be in the 1st column. So, Cucumber goes in the 3rd row, 1st column.

19. Since the gospel fan is not the trance fan (who is in the 3rd column), the gospel fan must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th column. Since the gospel fan is also not the house fan (who is in the odd positions), the gospel fan must be in the 4th or 6th column. Since the gospel fan is also not the metal fan (who is in the 4th column), the gospel fan must be in the 6th column. So, Gospel goes in the 3rd row, 6th column.

20. Since the house fan is not in the odd positions, the house fan must be in the 2nd or 4th column. Since the house fan is also not the gospel fan (who is in the 6th column), the house fan must be in the 2nd column. So, House goes in the 5th row, 2nd column.

Lv4-5x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people and 5 items for each category. Let's label the people from 1 to 5 and the items from A to E for each category.

2. From rule 2, the person drinking mirinda is on the far left, so Mirinda is in position 1 (A1).

3. From rule 3, the Italian is on the left of the person eating broccoli. Since we know Mirinda is on the far left, the Italian cannot be in position 1. So, the Italian is either in position 2 or 3. If the Italian is in position 2, then broccoli must be in position 1. But that would mean grapes (eating grapes is watching horror movies) would have to be in position 5, which is not possible because the person drinking water (tennis) is in position 5 (rule 8). So, the Italian must be in position 3. This means broccoli is in position 2.

4. From rule 4, the person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we know Mirinda (1) and broccoli (2) are already placed, the only available positions for iced-tea are 3, 4, and 5. But from rule 17, iced-tea is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching drama movies cannot be in position 1 (Mirinda) or position 2 (broccoli), the only possible position for iced-tea is 4. This means the person playing badminton is in position 3.

5. From rule 5, the person who's sport is handball is on the left of the Thai. Since we know Mirinda (1), broccoli (2), iced-tea (4), and badminton (3) are already placed, the only available positions for Thai are 5 and 2. But from rule 14, the person eating pepper is on the far right. Since we know Thai cannot be in position 5 (rule 15), Thai must be in position 2. This means pepper is in position 5.

6. From rule 6, the person watching documentary movies is on the left of the Nigerian. Since we know Mirinda (1), broccoli (2), iced-tea (4), badminton (3), Thai (2), and pepper (5) are already placed, the only available positions for documentary are 1 and 3. But from rule 15, the person drinking fanta is in an odd position. So, the person watching documentary is in position 3. This means the person watching family movies (rule 16) is in position 2.

7. From rule 7, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person eating pumpkin. Since we know Mirinda (1), broccoli (2), iced-tea (4), badminton (3), Thai (2), documentary (3), and family (2), the only available position for fanta is 1.

8. From rule 8, the person drinking water is the person who's sport is tennis. Since we know Mirinda (1), broccoli (2), iced-tea (4), badminton (3), Thai (2), documentary (3), family (2), fanta (1), and pepper (5) are already placed, the only available position for tennis is 5.

9. From rule 9, the Chinese is in the middle. Since we know Mirinda (1), broccoli (2), iced-tea (4), badminton (3), Thai (2), documentary (3), family (2), fanta (1), and tennis (5) are already placed, the Chinese must be in position 4.

10. From rule 10, the person playing soccer is on the far right. Since we know Mirinda (1), broccoli (2), iced-tea (4), badminton (3), Thai (2), documentary (3), family (2), fanta (1), Chinese (4), and tennis (5) are already placed, the only available position for soccer is 5.

11. From rule 11, the person drinking mirinda is the person drinking mirinda. This is already satisfied since we placed mirinda in position 1.

12. From rule 12, the person watching family movies is between the person eating grapes and the Chinese. Since we know the positions of family (2), grapes (1), and Chinese (4), the only possible position for the person watching family movies is 3.

13. From rule 13, the person playing cycling is on the left of the person eating pepper. Since we know the positions of cycling and pepper (3 and 5 respectively), this rule is already satisfied.

14. From rule 14, the person eating pepper is on the far right. This is already satisfied since we placed pepper in position 5.

15. From rule 15, the person drinking fanta is in an odd position. This is already satisfied since we placed fanta in position 1.

16. From rule 16, the person watching family movies is the person eating broccoli. This is already satisfied since we placed family in position 2 and broccoli in position 3.

17. From rule 17, iced-tea is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since we know the positions of iced-tea (4) and drama (3), this rule is already satisfied.

18. From rule 18, the person playing badminton is on the left of the Nigerian. Since we know the positions of badminton (3) and Nigerian (5), this rule is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-5x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the snake owner is to the right of the volleyball player. Let's place the snake owner and volleyball player in the last two positions (5 and 1 respectively).

2. The pear eater is to the right of the weightlifting person. Since the weightlifting person is in the middle (position 3), the pear eater must be in position 4.

3. The indie fan is on the left or right of the reggae fan. Since the reggae fan can't be in position 1 (because the pear eater is there), the reggae fan must be in position 2. The indie fan can then be in position 3 (left of reggae) or position 5 (right of reggae). Let's place the indie fan in position 3 for now.

4. The cycling person is driving the van. Since the van driver must be in the last position (5), the cycling person must be in position 1.

5. The snake owner is to the right of the dog owner. Since the snake owner is in position 5 and the volleyball player is in position 1, the dog owner must be in position 2.

6. The reggae fan is to the right of the indie fan. Since the indie fan is in position 3, the reggae fan must be in position 4.

7. The salsa fan is the van driver. Since the van driver is in position 5, the salsa fan is also in position 5.

8. The cauliflower eater is in an odd position. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are filled, the cauliflower eater must be in position 2.

9. The hamster owner is to the left of the goldfish owner. Since the cauliflower eater is in position 2, the goldfish owner must be in position 3. The hamster owner can then be in position 4.

10. The baseball player is the hip-hop fan. Since the baseball player is the helicopter driver (position 14), the hip-hop fan must be in position 14.

11. The salsa fan is on the left or right of the motorbike driver. Since the salsa fan is in position 5, the motorbike driver can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the motorbike driver must be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the motorbike driver in position 2 for now.

12. The taxi driver is to the left of the helicopter driver. Since the helicopter driver is in position 14, the taxi driver must be in position 13.

13. The grapefruit eater is on the far right. Since the pear eater is in position 4 and the motorbike driver is in position 2, the grapefruit eater must be in position 1.

14. The person driving the helicopter is the baseball player. Since the baseball player is in position 14, this condition is already satisfied.

15. The grapes eater is to the left of the hamster owner. Since the hamster owner is in position 4, the grapes eater must be in position 3.

16. The salsa fan is on the left or right of the lime eater. Since the salsa fan is in position 5, the lime eater can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the lime eater must be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the lime eater in position 2 for now.

17. The reggae fan is on the left or right of the pear eater. Since the reggae fan is in position 4 and the pear eater is in position 4, this condition is a contradiction. Let's place the reggae fan in position 3 instead of position 4.

18. The hip-hop fan is on the left or right of the volleyball player. Since the volleyball player is in position 1 and the hip-hop fan is in position 14, this condition is already satisfied.

19. The weightlifting person is in the middle. Since the weightlifting person is already in position 3, this condition is already satisfied.

20. The van driver is on the far left or far right. Since the van driver is in position 5, the van driver is on the far right.

Now, let's rearrange the conditions that were not yet satisfied:

11. The motorbike driver is in position 2 or 4. Since the lime eater is in position 2, the motorbike driver must be in position 4.

16. The lime eater is in position 2 or 4. Since the motorbike driver is in position 4, the lime eater must be in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:
