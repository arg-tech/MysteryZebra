Lv4-4x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning each person a number from 1 to 7, and each item a number from 1 to 7 as well. We will fill in the table row by row, column by column.

1. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Let's assume the skateboarder is in position 1 or 7. If the skateboarder is in position 1, the boat driver must be in position 2 or 6. However, the boat driver is also the person who's sport is cricket, which we haven't assigned yet. If the skateboarder is in position 7, the boat driver must be in position 6 or 2. But this would mean the boat driver is also the person eating pear, which we haven't assigned yet. So, let's assume the skateboarder is in position 6, and the boat driver is in position 2 (cricket).

2. The person driving the van is on the far left or far right. Since the boat driver is not in the far left or far right, the van driver must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7.

3. The mechanic is the person driving the tram. Since the van driver is in position 1, the tram driver must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, the tram driver cannot be in position 6 because the skateboarder is there, and the skateboarder is not a mechanic. So, the tram driver must be in position 2 (mechanic).

4. The person eating corn is on the far left or far right. Since the van driver and the mechanic are in positions 1 and 2, the corn eater must be in position 3, 5, or 7.

5. The person driving the boat is the person who's sport is cricket. We already know this, so we don't need to assign the sport for position 2.

6. The person who's sport is badminton is the person eating tomato. Since the skateboarder is in position 6, the badminton player must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. However, the badminton player cannot be in position 1 because the accountant must be on the left or right of the badminton player (points 10 and 19), and the accountant hasn't been assigned yet. So, the badminton player must be in position 5 or 7. Let's assume the badminton player is in position 7 (badminton).

7. The person who's sport is climbing is in position 4. Since the mechanic is in position 2, the climber cannot be in position 2. So, the climber must be in position 4 (climbing).

8. The person eating tomato is the badminton player, who is in position 7. So, the tomato eater is in position 1.

9. The accountant is on the left or right of the badminton player (points 10 and 19). Since the badminton player is in position 7, the accountant must be in position 6 or 2. However, the accountant cannot be in position 2 because the mechanic is there. So, the accountant must be in position 6 (accountant).

10. The scientist is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the badminton player is in position 7, the scientist must be in position 1 or 5. However, the scientist cannot be in position 1 because the van driver is there, and the van driver must be in an odd position (point 9). So, the scientist must be in position 5 (scientist).

11. The police-officer is the person eating lime. Since the accountant is in position 6, the police-officer must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. However, the police-officer cannot be in position 1 because the van driver is there, and the van driver must be in an odd position (point 9). So, the police-officer must be in position 3 (police-officer).

12. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person eating pear. Since the boat driver is in position 2, the pear eater must be in position 1 or 3. However, the pear eater cannot be in position 1 because the van driver is there, and the van driver must be in an odd position (point 9). So, the pear eater must be in position 3 (pear).

13. The mechanic is on the right of the dressmaker. Since the mechanic is in position 2, the dressmaker must be in position 1 or 3. However, the dressmaker cannot be in position 1 because the van driver is there, and the van driver must be in an odd position (point 9). So, the dressmaker must be in position 3 (dressmaker).

14. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person eating lime. Since the badminton player is in position 7 and the police-officer is in position 3, the lime eater must be in position 5 or 6. However, the lime eater cannot be in position 6 because the accountant is there. So, the lime eater must be in position 5 (lime).

15. The person eating lime is between the accountant and the person driving the train. Since the accountant is in position 6 and the lime eater is in position 5, the train driver must be in position 7 (train).

16. The police-officer is on the left of the electrician. Since the police-officer is in position 3, the electrician must be in position 1, 5, or 7. However, the electrician cannot be in position 1 because the van driver is there, and the van driver must be in an odd position (point 9). So, the electrician must be in position 7 (electrician).

17. The person eating pear is the person driving the train. We already know this, so we don't need to assign the food for position 7.

18. The lawyer is on the far left or far right. Since the van driver, the mechanic, the accountant, the police-officer, the electrician, and the train driver are all assigned, the lawyer must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, the lawyer cannot be in position 1 because the van driver is there, and the van driver must be in an odd position (point 9). So, the lawyer must be in position 5 or 3. Let's assume the lawyer is in position 5 (lawyer).

19. The police-officer is on the left or right of the accountant. Since the police-officer is in position 3 and the accountant is in position 6, the accountant must be in position 1.

20. The police-officer is the person eating lime. We already know this, so we don't need to assign the person for position 3 again.

21. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person driving the tram. Since the mechanic is in position 2 and the tram driver is in position 5, the snowboarder must be in position 6 or 7. However, the snowboarder cannot be in position 7 because the badminton player is there. So, the snowboarder must be in position 6 (snowboarding).

22. The person eating watermelon is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the accountant is in position 1, the watermelon eater must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, the watermelon eater cannot be in position 6 because the snowboarder is there. So, the watermelon eater must be in position 2 (watermelon).

23. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the accountant. Since the accountant is in position 1, the lacrosse player must be in position 2 or 6. However, the lacrosse player cannot be in position 6 because the snowboarder is there. So, the lacrosse player must be in position 2 (lacrosse).

24. The person driving the van is on the far left or far right. We already know this, so we don't need to assign the person for position 1 again.

25. The mechanic is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the mechanic is in position 2, the climber must be in position 1 or 3. However, the climber cannot be in position 1 because the van driver is there, and the van driver must be in an odd position (point 9). So, the climber must be in position 3 (climbing).

26. The person eating grapefruit is on the left of the accountant. Since the accountant is in position 1, the grapefruit eater must be in position 2 or 6. However, the grapefruit eater cannot be in position 6 because the snowboarder is there. So, the grapefruit eater must be in position 2 (grapefruit).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|             |     1      |     2      |       3        |       4       |     5      |     6      |      7       |
| Food        | grapefruit | corn      | climbing       | watermelon    | badminton  | lime       | snowboarding |
| Job         | accountant | mechanic   | dressmaker     | lawyer        | police-officer| electrician | scientist   |
| Sport       | badminton  | climbing   | lacrosse      |               |            | skateboarding| snowboarding |

This is the final solution table for the given logic puzzle."	{'food': ['grapefruit', 'corn', 'climbing', 'watermelon', 'badminton', 'lime', 'snowboarding'], 'job': ['accountant', 'mechanic', 'dressmaker', 'lawyer', 'police-officer', 'electrician', 'scientist'], 'sport': ['badminton', 'climbing', 'lacrosse', '', '', 'skateboarding', 'snowboarding'], 'transport': ['boat', 'van', '', '', '', 'taxi', 'tram']}	True	2	False
Lv4-4x7-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Identify the variables:
   - Beverages: coffee, cola, iced-tea, lemonade, milk, sprite, water
   - Hobbies: board-games, camping, chess, dancing, drawing, reading, sudoku
   - Jobs: analyst, architect, doctor, engineer, journalist, musician, teacher
   - Pets: dog, fish, frog, goat, pony, snake, turtle

2. Identify the constraints:
   - Positions are numbered from 1 to 7, leftmost being 1 and rightmost being 7.
   - Each variable (beverage, hobby, job, pet) has a unique position.

3. Start with the given information:
   - Lemonade is not in position 3 (1. and 17.)
   - Doctor is in an odd position (2. and 11., 18., 21.)
   - Coffee is on the far left or far right (3.)
   - Sudoku is on the left or right of the owner of the fish (4. and 19.)
   - Engineer is on the left of the owner of the frog (5.)
   - Water is on the right of the analyst (6.)
   - Chess is on the left of the person drinking sprite (7.)
   - Drawing is on the left of the person drinking water (8.)
   - The owner of the fish is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (9.)
   - Journalist is the person who's hobby is camping (10.)
   - The doctor is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea (11., 18.)
   - Water is on the right of the person drinking lemonade (12.)
   - The owner of the goat is on the left of the teacher (15.)
   - The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games (16.)
   - The owner of the dog is on the left of the person drinking lemonade (17.)
   - The doctor is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea (18.)
   - The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle (20.)
   - The engineer is in an odd position (21.)
   - The teacher is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping (22.)
   - The person drinking milk is on the far right (26.)
   - The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the owner of the goat (27.)
   - The person drinking milk is on the far left or far right (28.)

4. Use the given information to eliminate possibilities for each variable in each position. For example, since the doctor is in an odd position, we know that coffee, cola, iced-tea, and milk cannot be in positions 2, 4, and 6 because those are even positions.

5. Continue this process until you can determine the position of each variable for all positions.

6. Once you have determined the positions for all variables, arrange them in the table according to the positions.

This process is quite complex and may require multiple iterations to solve. I'm afraid I can't perform the calculations for you, but I hope this breakdown helps you solve the puzzle!

The final solution table will be '#############'."	{}	False	0	False

Lv4-4x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 7 items in each category, so we can label them from 1 to 7 for each category (Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality, Transport).

2. From rule 17, the person watching horror movies is driving the motorbike, so we can place ""Horror"" in the position of Motorbike.

3. From rule 8, the Colombian is driving the quad-bike, so we can place ""Colombian"" in the position of Quad-bike. Since the Colombian is watching superhero movies (rule 9), we can place ""Superhero"" in the position of Quad-bike.

4. From rule 18, the German is on the far left or far right. Since the positions are filled by 4, 5, and 6, the German must be in position 1 or 7. If the German is in position 1, then the Thai (rule 6) must be in position 2, and the Indonesian (rule 25) must be in position 3. In this case, the superhero fan (Colombian) cannot be in an odd position (rule 3), so the German must be in position 7. This means the Thai is in position 6, and the Indonesian is in position 5.

5. From rule 19, the martial-arts fan is on the right of the fan of disco. Since the disco fan is in position 2 (Thai is in position 6), the martial-arts fan must be in position 3 or 4. If the martial-arts fan is in position 3, then the fan of pop (rule 24) must be in position 4, which contradicts rule 5 (electronic is in an odd position). So, the martial-arts fan is in position 4. This means the fan of disco is in position 2.

6. From rule 20, the martial-arts fan is on the far left or far right. Since the martial-arts fan is in position 4, the far left and far right positions are filled by the fan of pop (rule 24) and the fan of house (rule 15).

7. From rule 11, the jet-ski driver is on the left or right of the ship driver. Since the jet-ski driver is the electronic fan (rule 1), and the electronic fan is in an odd position (rule 5), the jet-ski driver must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 2, 4, and 6. If the jet-ski driver is in position 2, then the ship driver must be in position 3, which contradicts rule 11. If the jet-ski driver is in position 4, then the ship driver must be in position 5, and the fan of house must be in position 6. If the jet-ski driver is in position 6, then the ship driver must be in position 5, and the fan of house must be in position 3.

8. From rule 13, the fan of pop is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike (Colombian). Since the fan of pop is in position 1 or 7 (rule 20), the Colombian must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the Colombian is in position 2, then the fan of pop must be in position 1, which contradicts rule 24. If the Colombian is in position 3, then the fan of pop must be in position 4, which contradicts rule 24. If the Colombian is in position 4, then the fan of pop must be in position 7, which contradicts rule 20. If the Colombian is in position 5, then the fan of pop must be in position 6, which is correct.

9. From rule 14, the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the person watching horror movies is in position 1 (rule 17), the person driving the train must be in position 2 or 3. If the person driving the train is in position 2, then the person watching horror movies must be on the right, which contradicts rule 14. If the person driving the train is in position 3, then the person watching horror movies must be on the left, which is correct.

10. From rule 2, the person driving the jet-ski is the fan of electronic. Since the jet-ski driver is in position 6 (rule 8), the electronic fan is in position 6.

11. From rule 3, the Indonesian is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies (Colombian). Since the Colombian is in position 2 (rule 8), the Indonesian can be in position 1 or 3. If the Indonesian is in position 1, then the Thai (rule 4) must be in position 2, which contradicts rule 6. If the Indonesian is in position 3, then the Thai must be in position 4, which is correct.

12. From rule 12, the Thai is on the left of the fan of folk. Since the Thai is in position 6 (rule 4), the fan of folk must be in position 5.

13. From rule 16, the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the Thai. Since the quad-bike driver is the Colombian (rule 8), the Colombian is in position 7.

14. From rule 10, the person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the Thai. Since the Thai is in position 6, the person watching thriller movies can be in position 5 or 7. If the person watching thriller movies is in position 5, then the fan of house must be in position 6, which contradicts rule 11. If the person watching thriller movies is in position 7, then the fan of house must be in position 1, which is correct.

15. From rule 15, the fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of pop. Since the fan of house is in position 1 (rule 14), the fan of pop must be in position 2 or 3. If the fan of pop is in position 2, then the fan of disco must be in position 3, which contradicts rule 5. If the fan of pop is in position 3, then the fan of disco must be in position 2, which is correct.

16. From rule 23, the person watching mystery movies is on the far left. Since the far left position is filled by the fan of house (rule 23), the mystery fan must be in position 2.

17. From rule 1, the person driving the jet-ski is the fan of electronic. Since the jet-ski driver is in position 6 (rule 8), the electronic fan is in position 6.

18. From rule 21, the person watching epic movies is on the left of the Colombian. Since the Colombian is in position 2 (rule 8), the epic fan must be in position 1.

19. From rule 19, the martial-arts fan is on the right of the fan of disco. Since the fan of disco is in position 2 (Thai), the martial-arts fan must be in position 3.

20. From rule 22, the fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of disco. Since the fan of house is in position 1 (rule 14), the fan of disco must be in position 2 (Thai), and the fan of house must be in position 3 (Martial-Arts).

21. From rule 25, the Mexican is on the left or right of the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian is in position 5 (rule 11), the Mexican can be in position 4 or 6. If the Mexican is in position 4, then the fan of pop must be in position 5, which contradicts rule 24. If the Mexican is in position 6, then the fan of pop must be in position 7, which is correct.

22. From rule 18, the German is on the far left or far right. Since the far left and far right positions are filled by the fan of house (rule 20) and the fan of pop (rule 24), the German must be in position 3 or 5. If the German is in position 3, then the fan of pop must be in position 4, which contradicts rule 24. If the German is in position 5, then the fan of pop must be in position 6, which is correct.

23. From rule 13, the fan of pop is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike (Colombian). Since the Colombian is in position 2 (rule 8), the fan of pop must be in position 4, which is correct.

24. From rule 25, the Mexican is on the left or right of the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian is in position 5 (rule 11), the Mexican can be in position 4 or 6. If the Mexican is in position 4, then the fan of pop must be in position 5, which contradicts rule 24. If the Mexican is in position 6, then the fan of pop must be in position 7, which is correct.

Lv4-4x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the nigerian is on the right of the person watching disaster movies, we know that the disaster movie watcher cannot be in the first position. So, the disaster movie watcher can be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 7.

2. The person watching crime movies is the person who's sport is skiing. Since the skiing person cannot be in the first position (as the sport positions are numbered 3, 5, or 7), the crime movie watcher can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6.

3. The person watching western movies is in the middle. So, the western movie watcher is in position 3.

4. Now we know that the skiing person is in position 5 or 7. Since the nigerian is on the right of the person watching disaster movies, the skiing person (who is also the crime movie watcher) cannot be in position 7. So, the skiing person is in position 5.

5. The person eating nectarine is the person who's sport is skiing. So, the nectarine eater is in position 4.

6. The chinese is in the middle. Since the western movie watcher is in position 3, the chinese cannot be in position 3. So, the chinese is in position 5.

7. The person watching crime movies is in an odd position. Since we already know the crime movie watcher is in position 5, this condition is satisfied.

8. The person eating carrot is in an even position. Since the nectarine eater is in position 4 (an even position), the carrot eater cannot be in position 4. So, the carrot eater is in position 2, 6, or 8. But position 8 is already taken by the chinese, so the carrot eater is in position 2 or 6.

9. The person watching comedy movies is the french. Since the western movie watcher is in position 3, the comedy movie watcher cannot be in position 3. So, the comedy movie watcher is in position 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7. But position 5 is already taken by the chinese, and position 3 is already taken by the western movie watcher. So, the comedy movie watcher is in position 1, 2, 4, 6, or 7.

10. The person watching superhero movies is the nigerian. Since the nigerian is in position 4, the superhero movie watcher is also in position 4.

11. The person eating orange is in the middle. So, the orange eater is in position 3.

12. The colombian is on the right of the person eating orange. So, the colombian is in position 5 or 7. But position 5 is already taken by the chinese, so the colombian is in position 7.

13. The colombian is the person who's sport is badminton. So, the badminton player is in position 7.

14. The person watching zombie movies is on the far left or far right. Since the far left position is already taken by the person watching comedy movies, the zombie movie watcher is in position 1, 3, 5, 6, or 7. But position 5 is already taken by the chinese (watching scientific movies), and position 3 is already taken by the western movie watcher. So, the zombie movie watcher is in position 1, 6, or 7.

15. The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the soccer player is in position 1, 3, 5, or 7, the zombie movie watcher is in position 1, 3, or 7. But position 3 is already taken by the western movie watcher, so the zombie movie watcher is in position 1 or 7.

16. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the soccer player is in position 1, the water-polo player is in position 2.

17. The malaysian is on the far right. Since the zombie movie watcher is in position 1, the malaysian is in position 7.

18. The person who's sport is tennis is in an even position. Since the nectarine eater is in position 4 (an even position), the tennis player cannot be in position 4. So, the tennis player is in position 2, 6, or 8. But position 8 is already taken by the chinese, so the tennis player is in position 2 or 6.

19. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the soccer player is in position 1, the water-polo player is in position 2. But we already know that position 2 is the tennis player's position. So, this condition is not possible. Let's assume there's a mistake in this condition.

20. The person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis player is in position 2, the rowing person is in position 1.

21. The person who's sport is soccer is the person watching zombie movies. So, the soccer player is in position 1.

22. The person who's sport is water-polo is in position 2.

23. The person who's sport is tennis is in position 6.

24. The person who's sport is rowing is in position 1.

25. The person who's sport is cricket is the person eating pear. So, the cricket player is in position 5.

26. The person who's sport is badminton is in position 7.

27. The person who's sport is skiing is in position 5.

28. The person who's sport is soccer is in position 1.

29. The person who's sport is water-polo is in position 2.

30. The person who's sport is tennis is in position 6.

31. The person who's sport is rowing is in position 1.

32. The person who's sport is cricket is in position 5.

33. The person who's sport is badminton is in position 7.

34. The person who's sport is skiing is in position 5.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |    1    |     2      |     3     |    4    |     5     |     6      |     7     |

However, there seems to be a contradiction in condition 19, as it implies that the water-polo player should be in position 2, but we have already placed the tennis player in position 2. I'll leave it up to you to decide how to handle this contradiction."	{'food': ['pear', 'water-polo', 'rowing', 'nectarine', 'carrot', 'tennis', 'badminton'], 'movie-genre': ['zombie', '', '', 'crime', 'comedy', '', 'scientific'], 'nationality': ['colombian', '', '', 'nigerian', 'french', '', 'malaysian'], 'sport': ['soccer', 'water-polo', 'rowing', 'skiing', '', 'tennis', 'badminton']}	True	2	False
Lv4-4x7-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people based on their jobs. Since the videographer is eating orange, we can place them in position 5. The coach (who is the coach) is drinking fanta, so we can place them in position 2 (since the videographer is in position 5, and the coach is to the left of the videographer). The bartender is singing, so we can place them in position 1 (since the coach is in position 2, and the bartender sings coffee, which needs to be in the middle, position 11).

2. The social-worker is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the bartender (who is the bartender) is in position 1 and sings, the person who dances must be in an adjacent position. Let's place the dancer in position 3 (since the bartender is in position 1, and the dancer can't be in position 2 because the coach is there). Now, the social-worker can be in position 6 or 7.

3. The engineer is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the woodworker is in an odd position (let's say position 3), the engineer must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 4, 6, and 7. Let's place the engineer in position 4.

4. The photographer is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the bartender is in position 1, the photographer can't be in position 2 (because the coach is there). The only other position on the left is position 6, so the photographer is in position 6. Now, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 8.

5. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the coach is in position 2 and drinks fanta, the person drinking sprite must be in position 3. The only position on the right is position 4, so the person drinking milk is in position 4.

6. The person eating avocado is in an odd position and is to the right of the person eating orange (which is the videographer in position 5). The only odd positions left are 1, 3, and 7. Since the bartender is in position 1, the avocado eater can't be there. The person eating orange is the videographer, so the avocado eater can't be in position 5. That leaves position 7.

7. The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating nectarine. Since the avocado eater is in position 7, the pineapple eater must be in position 6. The only fruit left for the person in position 3 is nectarine.

8. The person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games (which is the coach in position 2). The only position on the left is position 1. Since the bartender is in position 1, the pomegranate eater must have a hobby other than camping (since the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping, and there's no other position left for the person who's hobby is camping). The only hobbies left for the pomegranate eater are baking, chess, dancing, and singing. Since the bartender sings, the pomegranate eater can't sing. Since the dancer is in position 3, the pomegranate eater can't dance. That leaves baking and chess. Since the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing (the bartender), the pomegranate eater can't be a baker. That leaves chess, but since the person who's hobby is chess is in an even position, the pomegranate eater can't be in position 1. That means the pomegranate eater must have the hobby of camping, and the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 7.

9. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping (which is in position 7). The only position on the left is position 1.

10. The person eating cucumber is the person drinking soy-milk (since soy-milk is the only drink left for the person in position 6, and the only food left for the person in position 6 is cucumber).

11. The person eating lettuce is on the far right (position 7).

12. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in an odd position (let's say position 3).

13. The person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing (the bartender). Since the bartender is in position 1, the person who bakes can be in position 2 or 3. However, since the person who's hobby is woodworking is in position 3, the person who bakes must be in position 2.

14. The person eating pineapple is on the left or right of the photographer (who is in position 6). Since the person eating pineapple is in position 6, the photographer must be in position 4.

15. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position (position 8).

16. The person who's hobby is singing is the bartender (position 1).

17. The person who's hobby is dancing is in position 3.

18. The person drinking soy-milk is the person eating cucumber (position 6).

19. The coach is the person who's hobby is video-games (position 2).

20. The person drinking fanta is the coach (position 2).

21. The engineer is in position 4.

22. The photographer is in position 6.

23. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in position 3.

24. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 8.

25. The person who's hobby is baking is in position 2.

26. The social-worker is in position 6 or 7.

27. The person eating avocado is in position 7.

28. The person eating pineapple is in position 6.

29. The person eating nectarine is in position 3.

30. The person eating lettuce is in position 7.

31. The person drinking 7up is in position 1.

32. The person eating cucumber is in position 6.

33. The person drinking milk is in position 4.

34. The person drinking sprite is in position 3.

35. The person drinking coffee is in position 11 (the middle).

36. The person eating orange is the videographer (position 5).

37. The person eating pomegranate is in position 1.

Now, let's put it all together:

|            |    1     |      2       |       3       |     4     |      5       |       6       |      7      |

  1. We know the person eating orange is the videographer, but we don't know their hobby yet.
  2. We know the person eating avocado is in position 7, but we don't know their hobby yet.
  3. We know the person eating pineapple is in position 6, but we don't know their hobby yet.
  4. We know the person eating nectarine is in position 3, but we don't know their hobby yet.
  5. We know the person eating lettuce is in position 7, but we don't know their hobby yet.
  6. We know the person drinking 7up is in position 1, but we don't know their hobby yet.
  7. We know the person drinking milk is in position 4, but we don't know their hobby yet.

We can't determine the hobbies and foods for the people in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 because we have too many unknowns. However, we have correctly placed the people based on their jobs and the given constraints.

Here's the final solution table with the known positions:

|            |    1     |      2       |       3       |     4     |      5       |       6       |      7      |

| Food       |         |            |              |         |             |              |             |
| Hobby      |         |            |              |         |             |              |             |
| Job        |         |            |              |         |             |              |             |

And here's the final solution table with the hobbies and foods filled in based on the given constraints:

|            |    1     |      2       |       3       |     4     |      5       |       6       |      7      |
| Beverage   | 7up     |   fanta     |   sprite     |   milk    |   coffee    |   soy-milk   |   pomegranate|
| Food       | avocado |            |              |         |             |              |             |
| Hobby      |        |            |              | baking   |             |              | camping     |
| Job        |        | coach      |              | engineer |             | videographer | social-worker|

However, there are still multiple possible solutions for the hobbies and foods for the people in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 due to the unknowns in the puzzle. The given constraints only allow us to determine the positions of the people based on their jobs. The hobbies and foods for these people can be filled in based on the given constraints, but there are multiple possible solutions due to the unknowns in the puzzle.

Lv4-4x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the table has 7 columns, we can assign numbers from 1 to 7 to the columns. Let's start with the first row (Beverage).

2. From rule 16, we know that the person drinking mirinda is eating radish. Since the person eating radish must be in an odd column (rule 10), let's place mirinda in column 3 (radish).

3. From rule 18, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the crime movie watcher cannot be in column 1 (rule 8), the 7up must be in column 2.

4. From rule 19, we know that the person eating mango is on the left of the software-developer. Since the software-developer cannot be in column 1 (rule 8), the mango must be in column 2.

5. From rule 23, we know that the architect is on the left of the person eating mango. Since the mango is in column 2, the architect must be in column 1.

6. From rule 13, we know that the person watching thriller movies is in an odd column. Since the architect and the mango are in columns 1 and 2, the thriller watcher must be in column 3, 5, or 7. However, the person drinking milk is also in column 3 (rule 11), so the thriller watcher cannot be in column 3. Therefore, the thriller watcher must be in column 5 or 7. Since the person drinking soy-milk must be on the left or right of the disaster movie watcher (rule 21), the disaster movie watcher cannot be in column 7. So, the thriller watcher is in column 5, and the disaster movie watcher is in column 7.

7. From rule 20, we know that the person watching sports movies is the person eating carrot. Since the carrot cannot be in column 1 (rule 8), the sports movies watcher cannot be in column 2 (since the mango is there). So, the carrot must be in column 4, and the sports movies watcher is in column 6.

8. From rule 14, we know that the manager is in an odd column. Since the architect, mango, thriller watcher, and sports movies watcher are in columns 1, 2, 5, and 6, the manager must be in column 3 or 7. However, the person drinking cola is also in column 3 (rule 22), so the manager must be in column 7.

9. From rule 15, we know that the person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the doctor. Since the doctor cannot be in column 1 (rule 8), the watermelon cannot be in column 2. So, the watermelon must be in column 4 or 6. However, the person drinking soy-milk must be on the left or right of the disaster movie watcher (rule 21), so the disaster movie watcher cannot be in column 6. Therefore, the watermelon is in column 4, and the doctor is in column 5.

10. From rule 7, we know that the designer is on the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the architect is in column 1, the designer must be in column 2.

11. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the thriller watcher is in column 5, the milk must be in column 6 or 7. However, the person drinking soy-milk must be on the left or right of the disaster movie watcher (rule 21), so the disaster movie watcher cannot be in column 7. Therefore, the milk is in column 6, and the person drinking soy-milk is in column 5.

12. From rule 12, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person eating carrot. Since the carrot is in column 4, the fantasy movies watcher must be in column 3.

13. From rule 2, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the freelancer. Since the freelancer is in column 7 (rule 5), the sprite must be in column 6 or 1. However, the person drinking cola is also in column 1 (rule 22), so the sprite must be in column 6.

14. From rule 9, we know that the person eating mango is on the right of the person eating pumpkin. Since the mango is in column 2 and the pumpkin is in column 4, the pumpkin must be in column 1.

15. From rule 6, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person eating pepper. Since the pepper cannot be in column 1 (rule 8), the 7up must be in column 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, the person drinking cola is also in column 1 (rule 22), so the 7up cannot be in column 1. Since the person drinking milk is in column 6, the 7up cannot be in column 7. Therefore, the 7up is in column 2, 3, or 5. However, the person drinking soy-milk must be on the left or right of the disaster movie watcher (rule 21), so the disaster movie watcher cannot be in column 3. Therefore, the 7up is in column 5, and the person drinking cola is in column 1.

16. From rule 17, we know that the person eating watermelon is on the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since the disaster movie watcher is in column 7, the watermelon must be in column 6.

17. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking cola is hot-chocolate. However, we have already placed cola in column 1, and hot-chocolate is mirinda (rule 16). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Here is the table up to the point where the contradiction occurs:

|               |       1       |   2    |     3      |     4     |    5     |         6          |     7      |

Lv4-4x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know the nationalities of the first two people. Let's place the Canadian in position 1 and the Japanese in position 3 (since the Canadian is on the left of the Japanese).

   |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6    |     7     |

2. From rule 2, we know the paramedic watches sports movies. Since the positions are odd, the paramedic must be in position 1 (designated as 'designer' in the table). So, the paramedic is a designer and watches sports movies.

   |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6    |     7     |

3. From rule 3, the person watching animation movies is in an odd position. Since the designer is already in an odd position, the animation movies must be in position 5.

   |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6    |     7     |

4. From rule 4, the person drinking milk is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since the designer is watching sports movies, the person drinking milk must be in position 2. So, the person drinking milk is a ______ and the person watching adventure movies is in position 6.

   |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6     |     7     |

5. From rule 5, the nigerian is on the right of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 5, the person watching crime movies must be in position 6. So, the person watching crime movies is the person drinking almond-milk.

   |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6     |     7     |

6. From rule 6, the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the person watching crime movies is in position 6, the person drinking mirinda can be in position 5 or 7. However, since the person watching animation movies is in position 5, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 7.

   |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6     |     7     |

7. From rule 7, the writer is on the left of the entrepreneur. Since the designer is in position 1, the entrepreneur must be in an odd position. The only remaining odd positions are 3 and 5. However, since the person drinking mirinda is in position 7, the entrepreneur must be in position 5. So, the writer is in position 3.

   |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6     |     7     |

9. From rule 10, the person drinking coffee is on the right of the malaysian. Since the person drinking water is in position 3, the person drinking coffee must be in position 4.

   |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6     |     7     |

10. From rule 11, the italian is on the left of the designer. Since the designer is in position 1, the italian must be in position 2.

    |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6     |     7     |

    | Nationality   | canadian| italian | american    | malaysian  |           | nigerian|          |

11. From rule 12, the japanese is the person watching family movies. Since the person watching crime movies is in position 6, the person watching family movies must be in position 2. However, the italian is already in position 2. This contradicts rule 11. There seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently impossible to satisfy all the given rules.

The final solution table, assuming the error in rule 12 is a typo and the japanese should be watching sports movies instead of family movies, would look like this:

   |               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4      |     5     |    6     |     7     |

   | Nationality   | canadian| italian | american    | malaysian  |           | nigerian|          |

This table satisfies all the given rules except rule 12, which seems to be a typo."	{}	False	0	False
Lv4-4x7-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the nationalities, hobbies, pets, and sports to the columns and rows.

1. Assign the nationalities to the rows:

Lv4-4x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 people, so each row and each column represents one person.

2. Let's start with nationalities. Since the Japanese is on the right of the Polish and the Polish is on the right of the fan of funk, we can place the Japanese in the 7th column and the Polish in the 6th column. The fan of funk can be in the 5th column. The remaining nationalities can be filled in the remaining columns in any order. Let's place American in the 1st column (since the American is on the left of the Egyptian), Egyptian in the 2nd column, Brazilian in the 3rd column (since it's in an even position and the Japanese and Brazilian are on opposite sides), Indian in the 4th column (since the fan of soul is the Indian), and Russian in the 5th row (since the Russian is in an odd position and the Russian is on the right of the fan of superhero).

3. Now let's fill in the hobbies. Since the American is the photographer, we can place photography in the 1st row. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking, so drawing can be in the 2nd row and woodworking in the 3rd row (since woodworking is in the middle). The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking, so baking can be in the 4th row. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in an even position, so it can be in the 6th row. The remaining hobbies can be filled in the remaining rows in any order.

4. Now let's fill in the movie-genres. The person watching fantasy movies is on the far right, so it can be in the 7th column. The fan of gospel is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies, so gospel can be in the 6th column. The person watching satire movies is the fan of punk, so satire can be in the 5th column. The person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving, so spy can be in the 3rd or 4th column. The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the Russian, so superhero can be in the 5th row. The remaining movie-genres can be filled in the remaining rows and columns in any order.

5. Finally, let's fill in the music-genres. The fan of funk is on the right of the fan of house, so funk can be in the 6th row and house can be in the 5th row. The remaining music-genres can be filled in the remaining rows in any order.

Here is the final solution table:
