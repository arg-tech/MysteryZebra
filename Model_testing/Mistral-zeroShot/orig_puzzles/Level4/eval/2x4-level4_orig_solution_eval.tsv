Lv4-2x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. Let's place the lemonade drinker in the second position (since the mouse owner must be to their left). So, the first position is for the mouse owner.

2. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the owner of the goat. Since the lemonade drinker is in the second position, the goat owner must be in the fourth position. Now, we can place the 7up drinker in the third position, as they are to the left of the goat owner.

3. The person drinking water is in an odd position. Since we have filled the first, second, and fourth positions, the water drinker must be in the third position. But this contradicts our previous placement of the 7up drinker. To resolve this, we can swap the 7up and water drinkers, placing the water drinker in the third position and the 7up drinker in the fourth position.

4. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse owner is in the first position, the horse owner can be either in the second or third position. Let's place the horse owner in the second position for now.

5. The person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right. Since we have placed the 7up drinker in the fourth position, they are not on the far left. So, they must be on the far right. This means the horse owner, who is currently in the second position, must be moved to the first position.

Now, let's rearrange the table according to our findings:

| Beverage   |  1  |   2    |   3   |    4     |
|-----------|-----|-------|-------|----------|
| Pet        |     |       |       |          |

1. The horse is in the first position.
2. The goat is in the fourth position.
3. The water is in the third position.
4. The 7up is in the second position.
5. The mouse owner is in the second position, so the mouse is in the first position.

Now, let's fill in the pets:

| Beverage   |  1  |   2    |   3   |    4     |
|-----------|-----|-------|-------|----------|
| Pet        | Dog | Goat  | Horse |  Mouse   |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage   |  1  |   2    |   3   |    4     |
|-----------|-----|-------|-------|----------|
| Pet        | Dog | Goat  | Horse |  Mouse   |

Lv4-2x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 different movie genres and 4 nationalities. So, each row and each column will represent a unique genre and nationality.

2. The person watching musical movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. This means that the Musical and Superhero columns must be adjacent (touching horizontally). Let's assume the order is Musical, Superhero, Crime, Scientific from left to right in the top row (nationalities).

3. The french is on the left of the nigerian. Since we already placed the French in the top row (first column), the Nigerian must be in the second column.

4. The nigerian is in an odd position. Since there are 4 columns, an odd position means the second column. However, we already placed the Nigerian there in the previous step. This contradicts the rule. There seems to be an error in the puzzle as it stands.

Assuming the puzzle is corrected, let's continue:

5. The german is on the right of the nigerian. Since the Nigerian is in the second column, the German must be in the third column.

6. The french is the person watching crime movies. Since we already placed the French in the first column, the Crime genre must be in the first row.

7. The remaining genres (Musical, Superhero, Scientific) must be placed in the remaining rows and columns. Since Musical is to the left of Superhero, and we know the order of nationalities, the only possible arrangement is:

   | Crime (French) | Musical | Superhero | Scientific |
   |---------------|--------|----------|-----------|
   | Nationality   | French  |          |           |
   | Nationality   | German  |          |           |
   | Nationality   | Nigerian|          |           |
   | Nationality   | Russian |          |           |

8. The nationality for the remaining rows can be filled based on the available options: Russian, which is not yet placed, must be in the fourth row.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Crime (French) | Musical | Superhero | Scientific |
|---------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Nationality   | French  |          |           |

Lv4-2x4-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since there are only 4 positions, and the person watching western movies can't be in the first or last position (due to other conditions), the person eating watermelon must be in the second or fourth position.

2. The person eating pomegranate is in an even position. Since there are only 4 positions, and the first position is odd (due to the condition about animation movies), the person eating pomegranate must be in the second, third, or fourth position.

3. The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating watermelon is to the left or right of the person watching western movies, and the person eating watermelon can't be in the first position, the person eating grapes must be in the first position.

4. The person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the person eating grapes is in the first position, the person watching spy movies must be in the third position.

5. The person watching animation movies is in an odd position. Since the first position is taken by the person eating grapes, the person watching animation movies must be in the second or fourth position. However, we already know that the person eating pomegranate is in an even position, so the person watching animation movies must be in the fourth position.

6. The person eating grapes is on the right of the person eating pomegranate. Since the person eating grapes is in the first position, the person eating pomegranate must be in the second position.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv4-2x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies are different, so we can write them down in any order. Let's start with Cooking, Drawing, Reading, and Woodworking.

2. The person who's hobby is drawing is between the fan of blues and the fan of reggae. So, the music-genres must be arranged as Blues, Drawing, Reggae, and the other two (Folk and Indie) in some order.

3. The fan of indie is in an odd position. Since we have 4 positions, the only odd position is the third one. So, the arrangement of music-genres should be Blues, Drawing, Indie, Reggae, and Folk.

4. The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of reggae. This means that Folk must be in the second position, and Reggae in the fourth position. So, the arrangement of music-genres is Blues, Drawing, Indie, Folk, Reggae.

5. The fan of folk is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since Cooking is in the first position, Folk cannot be in the first or second position. So, the arrangement of hobbies must be Cooking, Drawing, Reading, Woodworking.

Now, let's put the hobbies and music-genres together:

Lv4-2x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of hip-hop is on the far left, we can place it in the first column. Let's put it in the first row (position 1).

| Music-Genre | Folk | Hip-hop | Jazz | Punk |
|------------|------|--------|------|------|
| Nationality |     |        |      |      |

2. The fan of jazz is in an odd position, so it can't be in the first row (position 1). It also can't be in the last row (position 4) because the russian is to the right of the fan of jazz. So, the only remaining odd position is the third row (position 3).

| Music-Genre | Folk | Hip-hop | Jazz | Punk |
|------------|------|--------|------|------|

Lv4-2x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 4 genres and 4 nationalities, so each row and each column will have one of each.

2. The Italian is in an even position, so they can't be in the first or last row (positions 1 and 4). Similarly, they can't be in the first or last column (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4). So, the Italian must be in position 5 (row 2, column 3).

3. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the Italian, so they must be in position 6 (row 2, column 4).

4. The person watching epic movies is in an odd position, so they can't be in the first or second row (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4). They also can't be in the last column (position 4), so they must be in position 7 (row 3, column 2).

5. The indonesian is on the left of the person watching animation movies. The only position left for the Indonesian is position 1 (row 1, column 1).

6. The japanese is on the left or right of the indonesian in 3 different positions. The only positions left for the Japanese are positions 2, 3, or 4. Since the Italian and the person watching time-travel movies are already placed, the Japanese must be in position 3 (row 1, column 3).

7. The only genre left for the person in position 3 is animation. So, the final table is:

Lv4-2x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person driving the ship is in an odd position in the table, which means it can't be in the first or second row. So, it must be in the 3rd or 4th row.

2. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the car. This means the car can't be in the first column (since there's no left position). So, the car must be in the second, third, or fourth column.

3. The person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. This means the mystery movies can't be in the first column. So, mystery movies must be in the second, third, or fourth column.

4. The person driving the ship is the person watching epic movies. Since the ship is not in the first row, the epic movies must be in the second, third, or fourth row.

5. The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Since the car is not in the first column, the western movies can be in the first, second, or fourth column. But since the mystery movies are not in the first column, the western movies can't be in the first column either. So, the western movies must be in the second or fourth column.

6. The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the car. Since the car is not in the last column, the quad-bike can't be in the last column either. So, the quad-bike must be in the first, second, or third column.

Now, let's place the elements that we know:

|               |  1   |    2    |    3    |     4     |

- The car can't be in the first column, so it must be in the second, third, or fourth row. Let's place it in the second row for now.
- The roller is on the left of the car, so it must be in the first column.
- The ship is the person watching epic movies, so it must be in the third row.
- The quad-bike is on the right of the car, so it must be in the third column.

- The person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since mystery movies are not in the first column, western movies must be in the fourth column.
- The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person watching western movies. So, mystery movies must be in the second column.

Now we have:

Now we have placed all the genres. Let's place the remaining transport:

1. Since the teacher is in an odd position and the job positions are numbered 1 to 4, the teacher cannot be in position 1 or 4. So, the teacher can be in either position 2 or 3.

2. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the pilot, and the teacher is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, the guinea-pig owner cannot be in position 1 (as there is no position to the left of position 1). So, the guinea-pig owner can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. If the teacher is in position 2, then the guinea-pig owner cannot be in position 1 (as per point 2), so the guinea-pig owner must be in position 4. But this would mean the teacher is in an even position, which contradicts our first conclusion. So, the teacher must be in position 3.

4. Now we know the teacher is in position 3. Since the teacher is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, the guinea-pig owner must be in position 2.

5. The coach is between the teacher and the pilot. Since the teacher is in position 3 and the pilot is not in position 1 (as the guinea-pig owner is in position 2), the coach can only be in position 1 or 4. But since the owner of the fish is in an odd position (not position 4), the coach must be in position 1.

6. The owner of the fish is in an odd position, so it must be in position 1.

7. The owner of the fish is between the coach and the owner of the goat. Since the coach is in position 1 and the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 2, the owner of the goat must be in position 3.

8. The owner of the bird is left or right of the pilot. Since the coach is on the left of the pilot (in position 1) and the owner of the goat is in position 3, the owner of the bird must be in position 4.

Lv4-2x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage, and the person eating cabbage is on the right of the person eating mango, we can deduce that the arrangement of the food must be either:
   - Mango - Cabbage - Pepper
   - Pepper - Cabbage - Mango

2. Now, let's consider the pet owners. The owner of the cat is between the owner of the hamster and the person eating pepper. If the arrangement of food is Mango - Cabbage - Pepper, then the owner of the cat cannot be in the first position (as there is no hamster owner before it), so the arrangement must be Pepper - Cabbage - Mango.

3. The owner of the cat is in an odd position. In the arrangement Pepper - Cabbage - Mango, the positions are 2, 3, and 4. So, the owner of the cat must be in position 3 (Cabbage).

4. Now we know that the owner of the cat is the person eating cabbage, so the owner of the cat cannot be the owner of the mouse (as per point 5). This means the owner of the mouse must be in position 1 (Pepper) or position 5 (Watermelon). But since the owner of the cat is in an odd position, the owner of the mouse must be in an even position. So, the owner of the mouse must be in position 4 (Watermelon).

5. Now we know the owner of the mouse is the person eating watermelon, so the owner of the hamster must be in position 2 (Mango).

6. Finally, the owner of the turtle is left, which means it must be in position 5 (as all other positions are occupied).

Lv4-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking almond-milk is a fan of jazz, so let's place the almond-milk in the position where jazz can be on the left or right (since we don't know the exact position yet). Let's place almond-milk in position 1 or 4.

2. Since the fan of disco is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk, and the almond-milk is in position 1 or 4, the fan of disco must be in position 2 or 3.

3. The fan of jazz is between the fan of disco and the person drinking juice. If the almond-milk is in position 1, then the fan of disco must be in position 2, and the fan of jazz must be in position 3 (since the fan of juice can't be in position 1 or 2). If the almond-milk is in position 4, then the fan of disco must be in position 3, and the fan of jazz must be in position 2.

4. The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position. Since we have already placed the almond-milk in positions 1 and 4, it must be in position 1 (since 1 is an odd number). So, the fan of disco is in position 2, and the fan of jazz is in position 3.

5. The person drinking juice is to the left or right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in position 3, the person drinking juice can be in position 2 or 4.

6. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep. Since we don't know the position of the fan of dubstep yet, we can't place the cola yet.

7. Now let's place the fan of dubstep. Since the fan of dubstep can't be in position 1 (because almond-milk is there), and can't be in position 3 (because jazz is there), it must be in position 2 or 4. If the fan of dubstep is in position 2, then the person drinking juice must be in position 4, and the person drinking cola can be in position 1 or 3. If the fan of dubstep is in position 4, then the person drinking juice must be in position 1, and the person drinking cola can be in position 2 or 3.

8. Since the person drinking cola must be in an odd position (as per the puzzle), it can't be in position 2. So, the fan of dubstep must be in position 4, the person drinking juice must be in position 1, and the person drinking cola must be in position 3.
