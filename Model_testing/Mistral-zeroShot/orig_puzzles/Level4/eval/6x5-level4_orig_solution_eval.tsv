Lv4-6x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people and 5 items for each category. Let's assign numbers 1 to 5 to the people for each category.

2. From point 12, we know that the person eating apple is watching horror movies. So, let's place the apple eater in position 5 (far right) and the horror movie watcher in position 5.

3. From point 15, we know that the person eating nectarine is also on the far right. Since we already placed the apple eater on the far right, the nectarine eater must be in position 1.

4. From point 18, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is either on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since we placed the nectarine eater (who is also the person eating lemon, as we'll see later) on the far right, the person who's hobby is camping must be on the left. So, let's place the person who's hobby is camping in position 2.

5. From point 14, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is watching fantasy movies. So, let's place fantasy movies in position 2.

6. From point 16, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is driving the boat. Since the person who's hobby is camping is on the left, the person who's hobby is card-games must be on the right. So, let's place the person who's hobby is card-games in position 4.

7. From point 17, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person driving the boat. So, the person who's hobby is baking is in position 3.

8. From point 19, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is in an even position. Since we already placed the person who's hobby is card-games (position 4) and the person who's hobby is baking (position 3), the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 2 or 4. However, from point 5, we know that fantasy movies are in position 2. So, the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 4.

9. From point 13, we know that the person eating lemon is the person who's sport is skiing. Since we placed the person who's hobby is camping (who is also the person eating nectarine) on the far right, the person eating lemon must be on the far left. So, the person who's sport is skiing is in position 1.

10. From point 11, we know that the person drinking coffee is the person who's sport is skiing. So, let's place coffee in position 1.

11. From point 13, we also know that the person eating lemon is the person who's sport is skiing. So, the person drinking coffee (who is also the person who's sport is skiing) is drinking coffee.

12. From point 6, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is watching disaster movies. So, let's place disaster movies in position 1.

13. From point 2, we know that the person watching scientific movies is the person eating peach. Since we placed the person who's sport is skiing (who is also the person eating lemon) on the far left, the person eating peach must be on the far right. So, let's place peach in position 5.

14. From point 3, we know that the person drinking cola is in an odd position. Since we placed the person who's sport is skiing (who is also the person drinking coffee) in position 1, the person drinking cola must be in position 3. So, let's place cola in position 3.

15. From point 4, we know that the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee. So, the person drinking coffee (who is also the person who's sport is skiing) is on the left of the person drinking cola.

16. From point 8, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is on the far right. Since we placed the person who's hobby is camping (who is also the person watching fantasy movies) in position 2, the person watching fantasy movies is on the far right of position 2.

17. From point 16, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is on the far right. Since the person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies, the person driving the scooter must be in position 3. So, let's place scooter in position 3.

18. From point 21, we know that the person drinking cola is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. Since the person drinking cola is in position 3 and the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person drinking cola, the person watching scientific movies is in position 4. So, let's place scientific in position 4.

19. From point 20, we know that the person driving the bus is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person drinking cola (who is also the person drinking mirinda), the person driving the bus is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right and the person who's hobby is baking is on the left, the person driving the bus must be in position 5. So, let's place bus in position 5.

20. From point 23, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the left of the person driving the subway. Since the person who's hobby is camping is on the left and the person driving the scooter is in position 3, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2. So, let's place sprite in position 2.

21. From point 7, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person who's sport is surfing is on the far right and the person who's sport is skiing is on the far left, the person watching comedy movies must be in position 4. Since the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person watching snowboarding, the person watching snowboarding must be in position 3. So, let's place snowboarding in position 3 and comedy in position 4.

22. From point 22, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left or far right. Since we placed the person who's sport is snowboarding in position 3, the person who's sport is snowboarding is not on the far right. So, the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left.

16. H < DD
17. M = V
18. D = O
19. O = U
20. P is to the left of Q
21. F is in the middle
22. A is between Z and Y

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |      1       |       2        |     3     |     4     |       5        |

Now we can use the remaining clues to fill in the remaining positions:

1. S is to the left of W, so W is in position 3 and S is in position 2.
2. M is on the far left or far right, so M is in position 1 or 5. Since M = V, V is in position 1 or 5.
3. L = P, so P is in position 4.
4. T is to the left or right of Q, so Q is in position 2 or 5. Since T is in position 3, Q is in position 5.
5. X or W is to the left or right of B, so B is in position 2 or 4. Since B is even, B is in position 4.
6. N is to the left or right of Y, so Y is in position 1 or 5. Since N is in position 3, Y is in position 1.
7. A is between Z and Y, so A is in position 2.
8. P is to the left of Q, so Q is in position 3.

Lv4-6x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can number them from 1 to 5.

2. Let's start with the positions of the music genres. Since the fan of rock is on the left of the writer (1 or 2), and the fan of rock is on the left or right of the software-developer (1, 2, 3, or 4), the only possible positions for rock are 1 and 3. Since the fan of electronic is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), it can't be in position 1, so it must be in position 3. The fan of country is on the far left (position 1), the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the firefighter (positions 2, 3, or 4), and the fan of house is on the right of the fan of house (positions 2, 3, or 4). So, house can't be in position 1, and since electronic is in position 3, house must be in position 2. The fan of electronic is in an odd position (3), so rock must be in position 1, and hip-hop and country are in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

3. Now let's place the jobs. The social-worker is between the owner of the rat and the person who's sport is parkour. Since the owner of the rat can't be in position 1 (because the fan of country is there), the social-worker can't be in position 2 (because the fan of electronic is there). So, the social-worker must be in position 3. The firefighter is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the social-worker is in position 3, the firefighter can't be in position 2 or 4. So, the firefighter must be in position 1. The software-developer is on the right of the firefighter, so it must be in position 5. The doctor is the person eating potato, so it must be in position 4. The writer is the person drinking coffee, so it must be in position 2.

4. Now let's place the pets. The owner of the cat is drinking juice, so it must be in position 1. The owner of the dog is on the left of the firefighter (position 1), so it can't be in position 5. The owner of the dog is on the far left or far right, but we already placed the cat in the far left, so the dog must be in position 5. The owner of the frog is drinking tea, so it must be in position 3. The owner of the rat is between the social-worker and the person who's sport is parkour, so it must be in position 4. The owner of the snake is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour, so it must be in position 5.

5. Finally, let's place the sports. The person who's sport is handball is in an odd position, so it must be in position 1 or 3. Since the fan of rock is in position 1, handball can't be in position 1. So, handball must be in position 3. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the owner of the snake, so it must be in position 5. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person who's eating corn (positions 2, 3, or 4), and the person eating corn is in an odd position (3), so skateboarding can't be in position 1 or 3. So, skateboarding must be in position 5. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person eating corn, so it must be in position 2. The person who's sport is skiing can't be in position 1 (because handball is there), position 3 (because skateboarding is there), or position 5 (because parkour is there), so it must be in position 4.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv4-6x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's assign the jobs to the rows (1-5) since we have the most information about them.
   - The manager is driving the jet-ski, so Manager is in row 1.
   - The person driving the skateboard is in an even position (4), so Skateboard is in row 3 or 5. Since the manager is on the left of the skateboard driver (3), the skateboard driver is in row 5. So, Skateboard is in row 5.
   - The person driving the helicopter is on the far right, so Helicopter is in row 5.
   - The photographer is the person drinking mirinda (16, 18), so Photographer is in row 2.
   - The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the manager (23), so Roller is in row 1, 3, or 5. Since the skateboard driver is in row 5, the roller cannot be in row 5. So, Roller is in row 1 or 3.
   - The person driving the jet-ski is the manager, so we already know this.

2. Now let's assign the sports to the columns (1-5).
   - The person who's sport is golf is the owner of the rat (2), so Golf is in column 2.
   - The person who's sport is skiing is in an odd position (11), so Skiing is in column 3, 5. Since the skateboard driver is in column 5, Skiing cannot be in column 5. So, Skiing is in column 3.
   - The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person drinking mirinda (13), so Water-polo is in column 1 or 2. Since the golf player is in column 2, Water-polo is in column 1.
   - The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person eating cabbage (14), so Cricket is in column 1, 3, or 5. Since the water-polo player is in column 1, Cricket is not in column 1. So, Cricket is in column 3 or 5. Since the skateboard driver is in column 5, Cricket is in column 3.
   - The person who's sport is skateboarding is in row 5 (Skateboard), so Skateboarding is in column 4.
   - The person who's sport is golf is the owner of the rat (2), so Rat is in row 2.
   - The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person drinking mirinda (13), so Mirinda is in column 2.
   - The person who's sport is cricket is in column 3 (Cricket), so Cricket is in row 3.
   - The person who's sport is skiing is in row 3 (Skiing), so Skiing is in column 3.

3. Now let's assign the pets to the remaining empty cells.
   - The owner of the turtle is in the middle (4), so Turtle is in row 3.
   - The owner of the snake is on the left or right of the owner of the rat (17), so Snake is in row 2 or 4. Since the water-polo player is in row 1, the snake cannot be in row 1. So, Snake is in row 4.
   - The owner of the frog is the person eating orange (9), so Frog is in row 4.
   - The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person drinking sprite (12), so Hamster is in row 2.
   - The person eating plum is on the left of the person driving the helicopter (7), so Plum is in row 4.
   - The person eating mango is on the left of the analyst (20), so Mango is in row 1.
   - The person drinking cola is on the right of the person eating cabbage (22), so Cola is in row 3.

4. Finally, let's assign the foods and beverages to the remaining empty cells.
   - The person eating cabbage is in row 3 (Cabbage), so Cabbage is in column 3.
   - The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person driving the skateboard (10), so Sprite is in column 5.
   - The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the photographer (15), so Lemonade is in column 1.
   - The analyst is on the left or right of the person driving the roller (23), so Analyst is in row 1 or 3. Since the skateboard driver is in row 5, the analyst cannot be in row 5. So, Analyst is in row 1.
   - The person eating raspberry is not specified, so it can be any empty cell.

Lv4-6x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that each row represents a different person, and each column represents a different category (hobby, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, sport, transport).

2. From rule 18, we know that the fan of reggae is driving the helicopter. Since there are only 5 different nationalities, the helicopter driver must be one of them. Let's assign nationalities to the first four rows to exclude the helicopter driver:
   - Row 1: Malaysian (since the Malaysian can't be the helicopter driver)
   - Row 2: Dutch (since the Dutch is on the left or right of the fan of folk, and the fan of folk can't be the helicopter driver)
   - Row 3: Brazilian (since the reggae fan is in the middle, so the left and right must be filled with other nationalities)
   - Row 4: Indian (since the Indian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking, and the baker can't be the helicopter driver)

3. Now, the helicopter driver must be Chinese or Indonesian. Since the Chinese is on the left or right of the Dutch (rule 2), the helicopter driver must be Chinese. So, Row 5 is Chinese.

4. From rule 19, we know that the jet-ski driver is on the far left. Since the helicopter driver is Chinese, the jet-ski driver must be one of the remaining nationalities: Brazilian, Dutch, Indian, or Malaysian. Since the Dutch is on the left or right of the fan of folk (rule 23), the jet-ski driver can't be Dutch. Also, the Indian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking (rule 11), so the jet-ski driver can't be Indian either. Therefore, the jet-ski driver must be either Brazilian or Malaysian. Since the Malaysian is already assigned, the jet-ski driver must be Brazilian. So, Row 5 is Brazilian.

5. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the far left. Since the helicopter driver and the jet-ski driver are already assigned, the magic-trick person must be one of the remaining rows: Row 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the fan of reggae is the helicopter driver (rule 18), the magic-trick person can't be the reggae fan. Also, the card-games fan is the metal fan (rule 7), so the magic-trick person can't be the card-games fan either. Therefore, the magic-trick person must be one of the remaining hobbies: baking, card-games, dancing, or traveling. Since the card-games fan is the metal fan, the magic-trick person can't be the card-games fan. Also, the person who's hobby is traveling is in an even position (rule 9), so the magic-trick person can't be the traveler. Therefore, the magic-trick person must be the dancer. So, Row 1 is Dancing.

6. Now, the remaining hobbies are baking, card-games, and traveling. Since the card-games fan is the metal fan, the card-games person can't be the baker or the traveler. Also, the person who's hobby is traveling is in an even position (rule 9), so the card-games person can't be the traveler. Therefore, the card-games person must be the baker. So, Row 2 is Baking.

7. The remaining hobby is traveling. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is in an even position (rule 9), the traveler must be one of the remaining rows: Row 3, 4, or 5. Since the helicopter driver and the jet-ski driver are already assigned, the traveler can't be the Chinese or the Brazilian. Therefore, the traveler must be either Dutch or Malaysian. Since the Dutch is on the left or right of the fan of folk (rule 23), the traveler can't be Dutch. Therefore, the traveler must be Malaysian. So, Row 3 is Traveling.

8. Now, the remaining nationalities are Chinese and Dutch. Since the Chinese is on the left or right of the Dutch (rule 2), the Dutch must be on the far right. Since the helicopter driver and the jet-ski driver are already assigned, the Dutch must be one of the remaining rows: Row 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since the helicopter driver and the jet-ski driver are already assigned, the Dutch can't be the Chinese or the Brazilian. Therefore, the Dutch must be one of the remaining rows: Row 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since the helicopter driver and the jet-ski driver are already assigned, the Dutch can't be the Chinese or the Brazilian. Also, the fan of reggae is the helicopter driver (rule 18), so the Dutch can't be the reggae fan. Therefore, the Dutch must be the metal fan, which means Row 2 is Dutch.

9. The remaining nationality is Chinese. Since the Chinese is on the left or right of the Dutch (rule 2), the Chinese must be on the far left. Since the helicopter driver and the jet-ski driver are already assigned, the Chinese must be one of the remaining rows: Row 1, 3, 4, or 5. Since the helicopter driver and the jet-ski driver are already assigned, the Chinese can't be the Brazilian or the Malaysian.
