Lv4-6x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different people for each category, so we can fill in the table with 2 rows for each category.

2. From point 3, we know that the person drinking fanta is the person eating plum. So, we can place fanta and plum in the same row. Let's say the first row is for fanta and plum.

3. From point 5, we know that the social-worker is the person who's hobby is photography. Since the social-worker must be in a different row (as there are only 2 rows for each category), the second row must be for the social-worker and photography.

4. Now, we know that the social-worker's hobby is photography, so we can place photography in the second row. Since the social-worker is in the second row, the first row must be for the other hobby, which is singing. So, we have:

   |               |    1    |       2       |
   | Beverage      | fanta  |               |
   | Food          | plum   |               |
   | Hobby         | singing| photography    |

5. From point 1, we know that there are 2 different jobs. Since the social-worker is in the second row, the first row must be for the other job. Let's say the first job is doctor. So, we have:

   |               |    1    |       2       |
   | Beverage      | fanta  |               |
   | Food          | plum   |               |
   | Hobby         | singing| photography    |
   | Job           | doctor | social-worker  |

6. From point 4, we know that the person drinking sprite is in an even position. Since the first row is filled, the second row must be for sprite. So, we have:

   |               |    1    |       2       |
   | Beverage      | fanta  | sprite       |
   | Food          | plum   |               |
   | Hobby         | singing| photography    |
   | Job           | doctor | social-worker  |

7. From point 2, we know that the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since singing is in the first row, the goldfish must be in the second row. So, we have:

   |               |    1    |       2       |
   | Beverage      | fanta  | sprite       |
   | Food          | plum   | goldfish     |
   | Hobby         | singing| photography    |
   | Job           | doctor | social-worker  |

8. From point 4, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of disco. Since we already know the positions of singing and photography, we can place disco in the first row and hip-hop in the second row. So, we have:

   |               |    1    |       2       |
   | Beverage      | fanta  | sprite       |
   | Food          | plum   | goldfish     |
   | Hobby         | disco  | hip-hop      |
   | Job           | doctor | social-worker |

9. From point 6, we know that the person drinking sprite is in an even position. Since we already know the positions of fanta and disco, sprite must be in the second row. So, we have:

   |               |    1    |       2       |
   | Beverage      | fanta  | disco        |
   | Food          | plum   | goldfish     |
   | Hobby         | singing| hip-hop      |
   | Job           | doctor | social-worker |

10. From point 2, we know that the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since singing is in the first row and goldfish is in the second row, the person with the hobby of singing must be in the first column. So, we have:

    |               |    1    |       2       |
    | Beverage      | fanta  | disco        |
    | Food          | plum   | goldfish     |
    | Hobby         | singing| hip-hop      |
    | Job           | doctor | social-worker |

11. From point 4, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of disco. Since we already know the positions of singing and disco, hip-hop must be in the second column. So, we have:

    |               |    1    |       2       |
    | Beverage      | fanta  | disco        |
    | Food          | plum   | goldfish     |
    | Hobby         | singing| hip-hop      |
    | Job           | doctor | social-worker |

12. We have filled all the categories with unique values, so the table is complete.

Final solution table:

    |               |    1    |       2       |
    | Beverage      | fanta  | disco        |
    | Food          | plum   | goldfish     |
    | Hobby         | singing| hip-hop      |
    | Job           | doctor | social-worker |

We can put '#############' around the final solution table to indicate that it is the solution:

#############
|               |    1    |       2       |

Lv4-6x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 people, so we can fill in the table with 2 rows.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      |             |          |
| Food          |             |          |
| Hobby         |             |          |
| Music-Genre   |             |          |
| Nationality   |             |          |
| Pet           |             | gold     |

2. We know there are 2 different favorite beverages, so we can fill in juice and tea in the Beverage column.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | juice      | tea     |
| Food          |             |          |
| Hobby         |             |          |
| Music-Genre   |             |          |
| Nationality   |             |          |
| Pet           |             | gold     |

3. We know there are 2 different types of food, so we can fill in asparagus and broccoli in the Food column.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | juice      | tea     |
| Food          | asparagus  | broccoli |
| Hobby         |             |          |

| Nationality   |             |          |
| Pet           |             | gold     |

4. The person eating broccoli is the person who's hobby is writing. Since there are only 2 hobbies, we can fill in writing in the Hobby column for the second row.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | juice      | tea     |
| Food          | asparagus  | broccoli |
| Hobby         | video-games| writing  |
| Music-Genre   |             |          |
| Nationality   |             |          |
| Pet           |             | gold     |

5. The polish is on the right of the person eating asparagus. Since the first row is the only one left for the polish, we can fill in polish in the Nationality column for the first row.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | juice      | tea     |

| Nationality   | polish     |          |
| Pet           |             | gold     |

6. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since the goldfish is in the last row, the first row must have the fish. But we already have a nationality there, so the fish must be in the Pet column of the second row.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | juice      | tea     |
| Food          | asparagus  | broccoli |

| Music-Genre   |             |          |
| Nationality   | polish     | dutch    |
| Pet           | fish       | gold     |

7. The person drinking juice is in an odd position. The first row is even, so the second row must have the juice.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | juice      | tea     |
| Food          | asparagus  | broccoli |
| Hobby         | video-games| writing  |
| Music-Genre   | jazz      | rock     |
| Nationality   | polish     | dutch    |
| Pet           | fish       | gold     |

8. We know there are 2 different music-genres, so we can fill in jazz and rock in the Music-Genre column.

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | juice      | tea     |
| Food          | asparagus  | broccoli |
| Hobby         | video-games| writing  |
| Music-Genre   | jazz      | rock     |
| Nationality   | polish     | dutch    |
| Pet           | fish       | gold     |

Lv4-6x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 items (Beverage, Hobby, Music-Genre, Nationality, Sport, Transport) and 2 of each. Let's label them A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, E1, E2, F1, F2, G1, G2 (where A1 is the first item in the first row, B1 is the first item in the second row, and so on).

2. From the clues, we can deduce the following:

   - A1 and A2 are both different beverages, so A1 = cola and A2 = fanta.
   - B1 and B2 are both different hobbies, so B1 = gardening and B2 = reading.
   - C1 and C2 are both different music-genres, so C1 = dubstep and C2 = folk.
   - D1 and D2 are both different nationalities, so D1 = german and D2 = pakistani.
   - E1 and E2 are both different sports, so E1 = golf and E2 = tennis.
   - F1 and F2 are both different means of transport, so F1 = bus and F2 = subway.

3. Now let's use the position clues:

   - The person driving the subway is in an odd position, so F2 = subway and it must be in an odd position. Since there are 6 items, the odd positions are 1, 3, and 5. So, F2 = subway and it's in position 1, 3, or 5.
   - The pakistani is on the left of the fan of folk, so D2 must be in a position to the left of C2. This means D2 can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - The fan of folk is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening, so C2 must be in a position to the right of B1. This means C2 can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - The fan of folk is on the far right, so C2 must be in position 6.
   - The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person who's sport is golf, so A2 must be in a position to the right of E1. This means A2 can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

4. Now we have some overlaps:

   - D2 can't be in position 1 because the fan of folk (C2) is in position 6 and there are only 5 positions between them. So, D2 can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - C2 is in position 6, so it's on the far right. This means the person who's hobby is gardening (B1) can't be in position 6 because the fan of folk (C2) is on its right. So, B1 can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - A2 can't be in position 1 because the person who's sport is golf (E1) must be in a position to its left. So, A2 can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
   - Since the subway (F2) is in an odd position and the fan of folk (C2) is in position 6, the subway (F2) can't be in position 6. So, F2 can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

5. Now let's use the remaining clues to solve the puzzle:

   - The fan of folk (C2) is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (B1), so C2 can't be in positions 1 or 2. So, C2 = folk is in position 5.
   - The person drinking fanta (A2) is on the right of the person who's sport is golf (E1), so A2 can't be in positions 1, 2, or 4. So, A2 = fanta is in position 3.
   - The subway (F2) is in an odd position and can't be in position 6, so F2 = subway is in position 1.
   - The pakistani (D2) is on the left of the fan of folk (C2), so D2 = pakistani is in position 4.
   - The fan of folk (C2) is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (B1), so B1 = gardening is in position 2.
   - The person drinking cola (A1) is not the pakistani (D2) because the pakistani (D2) is in position 4 and A1 must be in a position to its left. So, A1 = cola is in position 1.
   - The person who's sport is golf (E1) is not the fan of folk (C2) because C2 is in position 5 and E1 must be in a position to its right. So, E1 = golf is in position 3.
   - The person who's sport is tennis (E2) is not the subway driver (F2) because F2 is in position 1 and E2 must be in a position to its right. So, E2 = tennis is in position 2.

6. The final solution table is:

```

| cola      | gardening | dubstep | german | golf   | bus    |

Lv4-6x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different hobbies, 2 different sports, 2 different movie-genres, 2 different music-genres, and 2 different beverages. Since there are 6 categories and 2 options for each, we can represent each category with a number from 1 to 6. Let's assign the numbers to the categories as follows:

   |               |       1       |    2    |
   | Beverage      |               |         |
   | Food          |               |         |
   | Hobby         |               |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |               |         |
   | Music-Genre   |               |         |
   | Sport         |               |         |

2. From point 2, we know that the person drinking mirinda is the person eating watermelon. So, we can fill in the following:

   |               |       1       |    2    |
   | Beverage      | mirinda      |         |
   | Food          | watermelon   |         |
   | Hobby         |               |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |               |         |
   | Music-Genre   |               |         |
   | Sport         |               |         |

3. From point 4, we know that the fan of country is in an odd position. Since there are 6 categories and the fan of country is one of the 2 options for music-genre, it must be in an odd position among the 6 categories. The only odd positions are 1, 3, and 5. However, since the fan of country can't be in the first position (because the person drinking mirinda is in the first position), the fan of country must be in the 3rd position. So, we can fill in:

   |               |       1       |    2    |
   | Beverage      | mirinda      |         |
   | Food          | watermelon   |         |
   | Hobby         |               |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |               |         |
   | Music-Genre   | country      | r&b     |
   | Sport         |               |         |

4. From point 3, we know that the fan of country is in the 3rd position. Since the fan of country is not in the first position, the fan of the other music-genre (r&b) must be in the first position. So, we can fill in:

   |               |       1       |    2    |
   | Beverage      | mirinda      |         |
   | Food          | watermelon   |         |
   | Hobby         |               |         |
   | Movie-Genre   | sports      | romance |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b         | country |
   | Sport         |               |         |

5. From point 1, we know that there are 2 different hobbies. Since we already have one (reading), the other must be sudoku. So, we can fill in:

   |               |       1       |    2    |
   | Beverage      | mirinda      |         |
   | Food          | watermelon   |         |
   | Hobby         | reading     | sudoku  |
   | Movie-Genre   | sports      | romance |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b         | country |
   | Sport         |               |         |

6. From point 3, we know that the fan of country is in the 3rd position and the fan of r&b is in the 1st position. Since the hobby of the person to the right of the skateboarder is sudoku, the person with the hobby of sudoku (the skateboarder) must be in the 2nd position. Since the person with the hobby of reading is in the 1st position, the person with the sport of skateboarding must be in the 3rd position. So, we can fill in:

   |               |       1       |    2    |
   | Beverage      | mirinda      |         |
   | Food          | watermelon   | kale    |
   | Hobby         | reading     | sudoku  |
   | Movie-Genre   | sports      | romance |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b         | country |
   | Sport         | skateboarding| rugby   |

7. From point 3, we know that the person drinking juice is on the right of the person watching sports movies. Since the person with the sport of rugby is to the right of the person with the hobby of sudoku, the person drinking juice must be the person watching sports movies. So, we can fill in:

   |               |       1       |    2    |
   | Beverage      | juice       | mirinda |
   | Food          | watermelon   | kale    |
   | Hobby         | reading     | sudoku  |
   | Movie-Genre   | sports      | romance |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b         | country |
   | Sport         | skateboarding| rugby   |

8. From point 3, we know that the person drinking juice is on the right of the person watching sports movies. Since the person with the sport of rugby is in the 3rd position, the person drinking juice must be in the 4th position. So, we can fill in:

   |               |       1       |    2    |
   | Beverage      | juice       | mirinda |
   | Food          | watermelon   | kale    |
   | Hobby         | reading     | sudoku  |
   | Movie-Genre   | sports      | romance |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b         | country |
   | Sport         | skateboarding| rugby   |

Lv4-6x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 people and they have 2 different hobbies, one person's hobby is traveling and the other is video-games. Let's place them in the table:

   |               |       1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      |               |             |
   | Hobby         | Traveling     | Video-games  |
   | Job           |               |             |
   | Movie-Genre   |               |             |
   | Music-Genre   |               |             |
   | Transport     |               |             |

2. Since there are 2 different jobs, we can place them in the table:

   |               |       1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      |               |             |
   | Hobby         | Traveling     | Video-games  |
   | Job           | Accountant    | Lawyer      |

   | Transport     |               |             |

3. Since there are 2 different beverages, we can place them in the table:

   |               |       1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate| Mirinda     |

   | Music-Genre   |               |             |
   | Transport     |               |             |

   Note that hot-chocolate is in an odd position (1st or 3rd), so it must be in the 1st position.

   |               |       1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate| Mirinda     |

   | Transport     |               |             |

4. Since the person watching zombie movies is on the right of the accountant, we can place zombie movies in the 2nd row, 2nd column:

   |               |       1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate| Mirinda     |

   | Transport     |               |             |

5. Since the person driving the scooter is on the right of the fan of jazz, we can place scooter in the 2nd row, 6th column:

   |               |       1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate| Mirinda     |
   | Hobby         | Traveling     | Video-games  |
   | Job           | Accountant    | Lawyer      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports        | Zombie      |
   | Music-Genre   | Jazz         | R&B         |
   | Transport     | Scooter       | Van         |

6. Now we have filled all the columns except for the 6th one (Transport). Since there are 2 different means of transport, we can place van in the 1st row, 6th column:

   |               |       1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate| Mirinda     |
   | Hobby         | Traveling     | Video-games  |
   | Job           | Accountant    | Lawyer      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports        | Zombie      |
   | Music-Genre   | Jazz         | R&B         |
   | Transport     | Van           | Scooter      |

So the final solution table is:

Lv4-6x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different hobbies, 2 different movie-genres, 2 different music-genres, 2 different nationalities, 2 different pets, and 2 different sports, we can place one of each in the first row and one in the second row.

2. The person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. So, we can place Baking in the first column and Fishing in the second column of the Hobby row.

3. The fan of country is on the left or right of the British. Since there are only two positions for the British nationality, the fan of country must be in the other position. So, we can place Country in the first column and Disco in the second column of the Music-Genre row.

4. The fan of country is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the fan of country is already placed, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the other position. So, we can place Baseball in the first column and Snowboarding in the second column of the Sport row.

5. The owner of the frog is the fan of disco. So, we can place Frog in the second column of the Pet row.

6. Now, we have one position left for the British nationality. Since the British cannot be the fan of country (as per point 3), they must be in the other position. So, we can place British in the first column of the Nationality row.

7. We have one position left for the movie-genre Disaster. Since the person watching Disaster movies is in an even position (position 2), Disaster must be in the second column of the Movie-Genre row.

8. The only genre left for the first column of the Movie-Genre row is Mystery.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |    1     |      2       |

Lv4-6x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different types of food, 2 hobbies, 2 jobs, 2 movie genres, 2 nationalities, and 2 means of transport. This means each category will have one item in the first row and one in the second row.

2. The project-manager is on the left of the person watching romance movies. Since there are only 2 positions, the project-manager must be in position 1, and the person watching romance movies must be in position 2. So, we can fill the first row as follows:

   |               |        1        |     2      |
   | Food          | broccoli       |   kiwi     |

   | Transport     |                |          |

3. The person whose hobby is dancing is the project-manager. So, the job in the second row must be the other hobby, which is chess.

   |               |        1        |     2      |
   | Food          | broccoli       |   kiwi     |

   | Transport     |                |          |

4. The person driving the boat is in an odd position##4. Since there are only 2 positions, the boat cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2.

   |               |        1        |     2      |
   | Food          | broccoli       |   kiwi     |

   | Nationality   |                |   australian|
   | Transport     | boat           |          |

5. The australian is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli##3. Since the australian is in the second row, the person eating broccoli must be in the first row. So, the food in the first row must be broccoli, and the food in the second row must be kiwi.

   |               |        1        |     2      |
   | Food          | broccoli       |   kiwi     |

   | Transport     | boat           | skateboard |

6. The person watching drama movies must be in the position where the job is project-manager, because the project-manager is on the left of the person watching romance movies. So, the movie genre in the first row must be drama, and the movie genre in the second row must be the other genre, which is drama. But this contradicts the given information that the person watching romance movies is in the second row.

There seems to be a contradiction in the given information, so the puzzle cannot be solved as stated."	{}	False	0	False
Lv4-6x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the car has the hobby of video-games (1st row, 1st column), we can fill that in. Let's denote the positions as P1 (for the car) and P5 (for the video-games).

2. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person driving the car, so the ship driver (P2) is to the right of P1.

3. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left, so it must be in the 1st column, but since we already have the car driver in the 1st column, the water-polo player must be in the 2nd row (P2).

4. The fan of dubstep is on the left of the Dutch, so the dubstep fan cannot be in the 1st column (since the Dutch is in the 2nd row). Therefore, the dubstep fan must be in the 1st row (P1 is already filled, so it must be P2).

5. The owner of the lizard is in an odd position. Since we have filled the 1st and 2nd positions in the 1st row and 1st column, the lizard owner must be in the 3rd position (P3).

6. Now we know the nationality of the person in P3, so the remaining nationality (Brazilian) must be in P1 (since the Dutch is in P2).

7. The hobby of the person in P3 is magic-tricks, as it's the remaining hobby.

8. The remaining music-genre is blues, so it must be in P2 (since P1 is dubstep).

9. The remaining pet is a turtle, so it must be in P1 (since P2 and P3 are already filled).

10. The remaining sport is skateboarding, so it must be in P3.

11. The remaining transport is a ship, so it must be in P2.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-6x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 people and 2 positions, the owner of the lizard must be in position 1 or 4. Let's assume the lizard owner is in position 1 for now.

2. The hobby of the person in position 2 is not hiking (since hiking is an odd position and position 2 is even). So, the hobby of the person in position 1 is hiking.

3. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since position 1 is occupied by the lizard owner (who can't be watching martial-arts movies), the skateboard user must be in position 2. So, the martial-arts movie fan is in position 1.

4. The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the fan of metal. Since the martial-arts movie fan is in position 1 and the lizard owner is in position 4, the avocado eater must be in position 2. So, the fan of metal is in position 1.

5. The fan of soul is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. But we already know the martial-arts movie fan is in position 1, so the fan of soul must be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Transport     | Skateboard | Tram         |

Since the lizard owner is in position 1 and the hobby of the person in position 2 is not hiking, the lizard owner's hobby must be collecting. So, the final table is:

2. Similarly, there are 2 different music-genres (pop and techno), so we can place one in row 1 and the other in row 2. Since the techno fan is the owner of the mouse (from point 4), we can place techno in row 2 (position 2) and pop in row 1 (position 1).

3. There are 2 different nationalities (french and thai), so we can place one in row 1 and the other in row 2. Since the person driving the airplane is on the left of the thai (from point 3), the thai cannot be in position 1. So, the thai is in position 2 and the french is in position 1.

4. There are 2 different pets (cat and mouse), so we can place one in row 1 and the other in row 2. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the mouse (from point 2), the owner of the mouse cannot be in position 1. So, the mouse is in position 2 and the cat is in position 1.

5. There are 2 different sports (ice-hockey and surfing), so we can place one in row 1 and the other in row 2. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in an even position (from point 1), the ice-hockey is in position 2 and surfing is in position 1.

6. Finally, there are 2 different means of transport (airplane and bus), so we can place one in row 1 and the other in row 2. Since the person driving the airplane is on the left of the thai (from point 3), the airplane cannot be in position 2. So, the airplane is in position 1 and the bus is in position 2.
