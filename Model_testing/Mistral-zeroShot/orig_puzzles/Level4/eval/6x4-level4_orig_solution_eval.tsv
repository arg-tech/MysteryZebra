Lv4-6x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that each person has a unique hobby, job, movie genre, music genre, pet, and transport. Let's assign them in order.

   - Hobby: baking (1), cooking (2), traveling (3), writing (4)
   - Job: analyst (1), coach (2), freelancer (3), security-guard (4)
   - Movie-Genre: action (1), disaster (2), documentary (3), mystery (4)
   - Music-Genre: classical (1), d&b (2), dubstep (3), rock (4)
   - Pet: bird (1), chinchilla (2), lizard (3), rabbit (4)
   - Transport: boat (1), jet-ski (2), quad-bike (3), train (4)

2. From point 11, we know that the fan of rock is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the analyst watches disaster movies (point 10), the fan of rock cannot be the analyst (point 4). So, the fan of rock must be either 1 or 3. Since the analyst is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling (point 16), the fan of rock cannot be the analyst (point 4). So, the fan of rock must be 3.

3. From point 14, we know that the security-guard is the fan of d&b. Since the security-guard cannot be the fan of rock (point 23), the security-guard must be 2.

4. From point 13, we know that the analyst is in an even position. Since the security-guard is 2 and the coach is 1, the analyst must be 4.

5. From point 12, we know that the security-guard is the person who's hobby is cooking. But we already know that the security-guard is 2, which contradicts the hobby assignment. So, the hobby of the security-guard must be traveling (3).

6. From point 15, we know that the person watching action movies is the person who's hobby is cooking. But we already know that the security-guard is the person who's hobby is cooking (point 26), which contradicts the movie genre assignment. So, the person watching action movies must be the coach (1).

7. From point 7, we know that the person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the coach watches action movies (point 28), the coach cannot be the person watching documentary movies. So, the person watching documentary movies must be the analyst (4).

8. From point 5, we know that the security-guard's hobby is traveling (3). Since the security-guard is on the far right (point 2), the person with hobby 1 must be on the far left. So, the person with hobby 1 is baking.

9. From point 6, we know that the coach watches action movies (1). Since the coach is on the left of the owner of the lizard (point 17), the owner of the lizard must be the freelancer (3).

10. From point 1, we know that the person with hobby 2 is cooking. Since the security-guard is the person who's hobby is cooking (point 25), the person with hobby 2 is the security-guard (2).

11. From point 8, we know that the person with hobby 1 is baking. Since the person driving the boat is on the far left or far right (point 8), the person with hobby 1 (baking) cannot drive the boat. So, the person with hobby 4 (writing) must drive the boat.

12. From point 1, we know that the person with hobby 3 is traveling. Since the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the fan of dubstep (point 3) and on the far right (point 4), the person with hobby 3 (traveling) must drive the quad-bike.

13. From point 1, we know that the person with hobby 2 is cooking. Since the person driving the jet-ski is the analyst (point 2), the person with hobby 2 (cooking) cannot drive the jet-ski. So, the person with hobby 1 (baking) must drive the jet-ski.

14. From point 1, we know that the person with hobby 4 is writing. Since the person with hobby 4 (writing) drives the boat (point 30), the person with hobby 1 (baking) cannot keep a pet. So, the person with hobby 2 (cooking) keeps the chinchilla (point 5).

15. From point 1, we know that the person with hobby 3 is traveling. Since the person with hobby 3 (traveling) drives the quad-bike (point 32), the person with hobby 1 (baking) cannot have a pet. So, the person with hobby 2 (cooking) keeps the rabbit.

16. From point 1, we know that the person with hobby 1 is baking. Since the person with hobby 1 (baking) drives the jet-ski (point 31), the person with hobby 3 (traveling) cannot listen to dubstep. So, the person with hobby 2 (cooking) listens to classical music.

17. From point 1, we know that the person with hobby 4 is writing. Since the person with hobby 4 (writing) drives the boat (point 30), the person with hobby 3 (traveling) cannot listen to d&b. So, the person with hobby 2 (cooking) listens to rock music.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-6x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 12, the person watching action movies is the person driving the train. Let's place them in position 3 (since there are 4 positions).

2. From point 13, the person driving the quad-bike is on the far left or far right. Since the train is in position 3, the quad-bike can't be in position 1 or 4, so it must be in position 2.

3. From point 17, the fan of punk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the train (action movies fan) is in position 3 and the writing hobby is on the right (point 16), punk can't be in position 1. So, punk is in position 2.

4. From point 18, the fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of punk. So, electronic is in position 1.

5. From point 6, the fan of electronic is the person who's hobby is camping. So, camping is in position 1.

6. From point 11, the person drinking lemonade is in an odd position. Since positions 1, 3, and 4 are filled, lemonade must be in position 2.

7. From point 7, the person drinking juice is on the left of the owner of the frog. Since the train (action movies fan) is in position 3, the frog owner can't be in position 1 or 4. So, the frog owner is in position 2 and the juice drinker is in position 4.

8. From point 5, the owner of the guinea-pig is the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the board-games hobby is the reggae fan (point 4), the guinea-pig owner is in position 4.

9. From point 9, the person driving the scooter is on the right of the person driving the train. Since the train is in position 3, the scooter is in position 1.

10. From point 10, the person watching spy movies is the person who's hobby is camping (already placed in position 1). So, spy movies are in position 1.

11. From point 14, the person watching spy movies is the owner of the mouse. Since the spy movies fan is in position 1, the mouse owner is in position 1.

12. From point 8, the person drinking juice is in position 4. Since the frog owner is in position 4, the juice drinker can't be the frog owner. So, the juice drinker must be the owner of the lizard.

13. From point 5, the owner of the guinea-pig is the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the board-games hobby is the reggae fan (already placed in position 4), the guinea-pig owner must be the owner of the mouse (already placed in position 1). This means the hobby of writing must be the owner of the lizard (since it's on the right of the martial-arts fan, as per point 16).

14. From point 15, the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person drinking cola. Since the mouse owner is in position 1, the cola drinker is in position 2.

15. From point 11, the person drinking lemonade is in position 2. Since the lemonade drinker is already placed, the only beverage left is cola, which must be in position 4.

Lv4-6x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and 4 positions, each person must have one unique hobby, music-genre, nationality, pet, and sport. We'll start by assigning the hobbies:

   |               |       1       |       2       |      3       |     4      |
   | Beverage      | soy-          |               |              |            |
   | Hobby         | puzzles      | board-games   | rock-climbing | magic-tricks|
   | Music-Genre   |               |               |              |            |
   | Nationality   |               |               |              |            |
   | Pet           |               |               |              |            |
   | Sport         | water-polo    |               |              |            |

2. Now let's assign the music-genres:

   |               |       1       |       2       |      3       |     4      |
   | Beverage      | soy-          |               |              |            |
   | Hobby         | puzzles      | board-games   | rock-climbing | magic-tricks|

   | Sport         | water-polo    |               |              |            |

3. Next, let's assign the nationalities. Since the Spanish is the person who does puzzles, and the Italian is in an even position, we can place the Italian in position 2:

   |               |       1       |       2       |      3       |     4      |

   | Sport         | water-polo    |               |              |            |

4. The Spanish is on the right of the fan of techno, so the fan of techno must be in position 4:

   |               |       1       |       2       |      3       |     4      |

Lv4-6x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and an even position is the 2nd and 4th positions, the Russian must be in either the 2nd or 4th position. Let's assume the Russian is in the 2nd position.

2. Since the person watching family movies is on the left of the person drinking tea, the family movie person and tea drinker cannot be in the 2nd and 4th positions (because the Russian is in the 2nd position). So, the family movie person and tea drinker must be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the tea drinker is in position 1.

3. The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position, so it cannot be in the 2nd position (Russian) or the 4th position (since the tea drinker is in the 1st position). So, the almond-milk drinker must be in positions 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the almond-milk drinker is in position 3.

4. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the police-officer, so it cannot be in the 4th position (Russian) or the 2nd position (tea drinker). It also cannot be in the 3rd position (almond-milk drinker). So, the 7up drinker must be in positions 1, 5, or 7. Since the almond-milk drinker is in position 3, the 7up drinker must be in position 1.

5. The 7up drinker is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk, so the almond-milk drinker must be in position 3 and the 7up drinker is in position 1.

6. The American is watching martial-arts movies, so the martial-arts movie person must be in an even position (since the Russian is in the 2nd position and the 7up drinker is in the 1st position). So, the martial-arts movie person can only be in the 4th position.

7. The martial-arts movie person is on the left or right of the Polish, so the Polish cannot be in the 1st or 3rd position (since the 7up drinker and almond-milk drinker are in those positions). So, the Polish must be in the 2nd or 4th position. Since the Russian is in the 2nd position, the Polish must be in the 4th position.

8. The Polish is between the person driving the ship and the person eating cucumber, so the ship driver and cucumber eater cannot be in the 1st or 4th positions. So, they must be in the 2nd and 3rd positions. But the almond-milk drinker is in the 3rd position, so the ship driver must be in the 2nd position and the cucumber eater in the 3rd position.

9. The person driving the airplane is in an odd position, so it cannot be in the 2nd position (Russian) or the 4th position (Polish). So, the airplane driver must be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Since the 7up drinker is in the 1st position and the librarian must be on the far left or far right (not in positions 2 or 4), the librarian must be in the 5th position. So, the airplane driver must be in the 3rd position.

10. The librarian is on the right of the person driving the airplane, so the librarian is in the 5th position and the airplane driver is in the 3rd position.

11. The person eating tomato is the person drinking almond-milk, so the tomato eater is in the 3rd position.

12. The person driving the bus is the American, so the American is in the 4th position (since the Russian, tea drinker, almond-milk drinker, 7up drinker, airplane driver, and librarian are already placed).

13. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the entrepreneur, so the entrepreneur must be in the 1st position (since the Russian, tea drinker, almond-milk drinker, 7up drinker, airplane driver, and librarian are already placed, and the bus driver is in the 4th position).

14. The doctor is in an even position, so the doctor must be in the 2nd position (since the Russian is in the 2nd position and the entrepreneur is in the 1st position).

15. The person eating raspberry is in an odd position, so the raspberry eater must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. Since the entrepreneur is in the 1st position, the raspberry eater must be in the 3rd or 5th position. But the tomato eater is in the 3rd position, so the raspberry eater must be in the 5th position.

16. The food items are cucumber, nectarine, raspberry, and tomato, and they are in positions 2, 3, 5, and 4 respectively.

17. The beverages are 7up, almond-milk, fanta, and tea, and they are in positions 1, 3, (not given), and 2 respectively.

18. The jobs are doctor, entrepreneur, librarian, police-officer, and they are in positions 2, 1, 5, 4, and (not given) respectively.

Lv4-6x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating nectarine is either to the left or right of the fan of techno (#3). Let's assume the fan of techno is in position 1 (leftmost) or 4 (rightmost). If the fan of techno is in position 1, then the nectarine eater must be in position 2 or 3. But position 2 is already occupied (by the fan of disco, per rule 3), so the nectarine eater must be in position 3. If the fan of techno is in position 4, then the nectarine eater must be in position 1, 2, or 5. However, position 1 is already occupied (by the fan of disco), and position 5 is even (per rule 4), so the nectarine eater must be in position 2.

2. The person driving the snowmobile is on the far left or far right (#2). Since the fan of techno (who drives the snowmobile) is in position 3 (per the previous step), the snowmobile driver must be in position 1 or 4. But position 1 is already occupied (by the fan of disco), so the snowmobile driver must be in position 4.

3. The fan of disco is the person who's hobby is board-games (#3). So, the board-games person is in position 1.

4. The person eating tomato is in an even position (#4). Since the board-games person is in position 1, the tomato eater must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, position 6 is odd, so the tomato eater must be in position 2 or 4. But position 2 is already occupied (by the nectarine eater), so the tomato eater must be in position 4.

5. The person eating tomato is on the right of the owner of the rat (#5). Since the tomato eater is in position 4, the rat owner must be in position 3.

6. The person eating peach is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine (#6). Since the nectarine eater is in position 3 and the tomato eater is in position 4, the peach eater must be in position 1 or 5. However, position 1 is already occupied (by the fan of disco), so the peach eater must be in position 5.

7. The person driving the bus is on the left of the person driving the airplane (#7). Since the snowmobile driver is in position 4 and the bus driver must be to its left, the bus driver must be in position 3.

8. The person who's sport is baseball is the fan of punk (#8). So, the baseball player is in position 6.

9. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing (#10). Since the baseball player is in position 6, the swimmer must be in position 5. So, the rower must be in position 7.

10. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (#11). Since the rower is in position 7, the collector must be in position 6.

11. The person driving the bike is on the right of the fan of punk (#12). Since the punk fan is in position 6, the bike driver must be in position 5.

12. The fan of hip-hop is on the far left or far right (#14). Since all other positions are occupied, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 1 or 4. However, position 1 is already occupied (by the fan of disco), so the fan of hip-hop must be in position 4.

13. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the far right (#15). Since the tomato eater (who has the hobby of drawing) is in position 4, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in position 6.

14. The fan of techno is between the owner of the goldfish and the person who's hobby is drawing (#16). Since the goldfish owner is in position 2 (the rat owner's left) and the person who's hobby is drawing is in position 6, the fan of techno must be in position 5.

The table is incomplete because the hobby, music-genre, pet, and sport for position 3 are not specified. However, we know the food (sailing) and transport (snowmobile) for position 3 (the fan of techno)."	{'food': ['disco', 'nectarine', 'tomato', 'goldfish', 'peach', 'drawing'], 'hobby': ['board-games', 'collecting', 'drawing', 'rock-climbing', 'rowing', '-'], 'music-genre': ['disco', 'techno', '-', 'techno', 'punk', 'hip-hop'], 'pet': ['-', 'rat', 'goldfish', 'dog', 'ferret', '-'], 'sport': ['baseball', '-', 'swimming', 'rowing', 'sailing', '-'], 'transport': ['airplane', 'bus', 'snowmobile', 'bike', '-', '-']}	True	4	False
Lv4-6x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the Nationality column with 4 different nationalities (Argentine, Australian, Chinese, Spanish).

2. We know there are 4 pets, so we can fill in the Pet column with 4 different pets (Fish, Goat, Goldfish, Rat).

3. We know there are 4 sports, so we can fill in the Sport column with 4 different sports (Parkour, Sailing, Surfing, Water-polo).

4. We know there are 4 means of transport, so we can fill in the Transport column with 4 different means of transport (Jet-ski, Skateboard, Subway, Taxi).

5. Now let's fill in the Beverage column. Since we know the positions of some people who drink certain beverages, we can start by placing the person drinking tea on the far left or far right. Let's place tea on the far left for now. This means the person drinking tea is either Australian or Spanish (since the other two nationalities are taken). If the person drinking tea is Australian, then the Spanish must be drinking fanta (since the Spanish is on the right of the Argentine and the Argentine is on the left of the person drinking tea). But this would mean the person drinking tea is not on the far left, which is a contradiction. So, the person drinking tea must be Spanish. This means the Argentine is drinking sprite (since the Spanish is on the right of the Argentine and the Argentine is not drinking tea). The person drinking fanta must be on the far right, so they are either Australian or Chinese. Since the Chinese is in an even position, they cannot be on the far right. So, the person drinking fanta is Australian, and the person drinking tea is Spanish. This leaves the person drinking sprite as the last beverage, so they are the Australian.

6. Now let's fill in the Music-Genre column. Since the fan of electronic is on the far right, they must be the Australian (since the other three nationalities are taken). The fan of blues can't be on the left of the person driving the skateboard (since the fan of blues is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard), so they must be the Spanish (since the Australian is driving the skateboard). This means the fan of blues is on the right of the Spanish, and the fan of techno (who is the Argentine) is on the left of the Spanish. This leaves the fan of house and the fan of techno (who is also the Argentine) on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the fan of house is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski, they must be the Chinese (since the Argentine is the fan of techno). This leaves the fan of techno (who is also the Argentine) on the other side of the jet-ski. So, the fan of house is the Chinese, and the fan of techno is the Argentine driving the jet-ski. The fan of electronic is the Australian, and the fan of blues is the Spanish. This leaves the fan of techno (who is also the Argentine) as the last genre, so they are the fan of techno.

7. Now let's fill in the Pet column. Since the Spanish is the owner of the goldfish, they are not the owner of the goat (since the person drinking sprite is the owner of the goat). The person drinking tea is the Spanish, so they cannot be the owner of the fish or the goldfish. This leaves the Argentine as the owner of the fish, and the Australian as the owner of the goldfish. The person drinking fanta is the Australian, so they cannot be the owner of the fish or the goldfish. This leaves the Chinese as the owner of the fish. The person drinking sprite is the Argentine, so they cannot be the owner of the fish or the goldfish. This leaves the Spanish as the owner of the goldfish. The person drinking tea is the Spanish, so they cannot be the owner of the rat. This leaves the Argentine as the owner of the rat. The person driving the jet-ski is the Argentine (since they are the fan of techno), so they cannot be the owner of the rat. This leaves the Australian as the owner of the rat. The person driving the skateboard is the Spanish (since they are the fan of blues), so they cannot be the owner of the goat. This leaves the Australian as the owner of the goat. The person driving the subway can't be the owner of any pet since they are not on the far left or far right. This leaves the person driving the taxi as the owner of the fish.

8. Now let's fill in the Sport column. Since the person drinking tea is the Spanish, they cannot be the person doing parkour (since the person doing parkour is on the left of the person drinking fanta). This leaves the Argentine as the person doing parkour. The person doing sailing is the fan of techno (since the fan of techno is the argentine), so they are the Argentine. The person doing surfing can't be the Spanish (since the Spanish is the owner of the goldfish and the person doing surfing is on the left of the person drinking fanta), so they must be the Australian. This leaves the person doing water-polo as the Chinese.

9. Now let's fill in the Transport column. Since the person driving the jet-ski is the Argentine, they cannot be the person driving the taxi (since the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person doing water-polo). This leaves the Argentine as the person driving the skateboard (since they are the fan of blues). This means the person driving the taxi is the Spanish (since the Spanish is on the right of the Argentine). The person driving the subway can't be the owner of any pet since they are not on the far left or far right. This leaves the person driving the jet-ski as the owner of the fish.

Lv4-6x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the reader is on the left of the chess player. Let's place them in the first two positions.

2. The goldfish owner is in an even position, so they must be in the second or fourth position. Since the goldfish owner cannot be the reader or the chess player (as they are already placed), the goldfish owner must be in the fourth position.

3. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi. Since the reader is eating kiwi, the video-games person must be in the first, third, or fifth position. However, the video-games person cannot be in the first position because the goldfish owner is in the second position, and they cannot be next to each other. So, the video-games person must be in the third or fifth position. Let's place them in the third position.

4. The fan of punk is on the left of the malaysian. Since the malaysian cannot be in the first position (as the nationalities must be unique), the punk fan must be in the first position.

5. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the fan of blues. Since the reader is already placed, the fan of blues must be in the second position.

7. The scientist is between the egyptian and the fan of pop. Since the scientist cannot be in the first position (as the nationalities must be unique), the scientist must be in the second or third position. However, the scientist cannot be in the second position because the fan of blues is already there. So, the scientist must be in the third position.

9. The person eating kiwi is the person who's hobby is reading. Since the reader is already placed, this condition is satisfied.

10. The person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the scientist. Since the scientist is in the third position, the cucumber eater can be in the first or second position. However, the cucumber eater cannot be in the first position because the punk fan is already there. So, the cucumber eater must be in the second position.

12. The owner of the rat is on the left of the italian. Since the rat owner is already placed, this condition is satisfied.

13. The journalist is between the person who's hobby is chess and the person eating zucchini. Since the journalist cannot be in the first position (as the jobs must be unique), the journalist must be in the fourth or fifth position. However, the journalist cannot be in the fifth position because the fan of blues is already there. So, the journalist must be in the fourth position.

Lv4-6x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the hobby of sudoku is in an odd position, it can be either 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

2. The person driving the bus is the one with the hobby of card-games, so Bus must be in row 2.

3. The musician is the one drinking coffee, so Coffee must be in row 4.

4. The person driving the car is on the far right, so Car must be in column 4.

5. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person who's sport is snowboarding, so Woodworking and Snowboarding must be in the same row. Since the fisherman is in an odd position, Woodworking cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 3 or 5. If it's in position 3, Snowboarding must be in position 1, but that would mean the person eating apricot is on the left of the person eating banana, which contradicts rule 14. So, Woodworking is in position 5, and Snowboarding is in position 1.

6. The person eating banana is the one who's sport is baseball, so Banana must be in column 2.

7. The designer is on the left of the entrepreneur, so Designer must be in position 1 or 3. If it's in position 1, Entrepreneur must be in position 3, but that would mean the person drinking mirinda is in an odd position, which contradicts rule 9. So, Designer is in position 3, and Entrepreneur is in position 1.

8. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage. Since the person eating banana is in column 2, the person eating cabbage must be in column 3 or 4. If it's in column 3, the person who's sport is basketball must be in row 1 or 2. But that would mean the person driving the bus is the one with the hobby of card-games, which contradicts rule 2. So, the person eating cabbage is in column 4, and the person who's sport is basketball is in row 2 or 3. But if it's in row 2, the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking, which contradicts rule 12. So, the person who's sport is basketball is in row 3.

9. The person drinking mirinda is in an even position, so it can be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 6, but that would mean the person driving the trike is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person drinking mirinda, which contradicts rule 16. So, the person drinking mirinda is in position 4.

10. The person drinking soy-milk must be in position 6.

11. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk, so Mirinda is in column 1, and Soy-milk is in column 2.

12. The person driving the trike is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person drinking mirinda, so Trike is in position 3.

13. The fisherman is in an odd position, so Fisherman is in position 1.

14. The person eating apricot is on the right of the person eating banana, so Apricot is in column 3.

15. The fisherman is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since the person drinking coffee is in row 4, the fisherman can be in column 2 or 4. But if it's in column 2, the person driving the trike is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person drinking mirinda, which contradicts rule 16. So, the fisherman is in column 4.

16. Now we know the positions of all the people except the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person driving the trike is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person drinking mirinda, and the person drinking mirinda is in position 4, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 2.
