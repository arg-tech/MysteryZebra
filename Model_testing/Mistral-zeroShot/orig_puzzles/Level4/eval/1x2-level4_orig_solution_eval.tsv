Lv4-1x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information:

1. There are two different nationalities: Indian and Polish.
2. The Indian is in an even position.

Since there are only two nationalities and one position is even, the Indian must be in the second position (position 2).

Now let's fill in the table:

|               |   1    |   2    |
| Nationality   |        |        |

Since the Indian is in position 2, the Polish nationality must be in position 1.

So the final solution table is:

#############
|               |   1    |   2    |
| Nationality   | Polish | Indian |
#############"	{'nationality': ['polish', 'indian']}	True	2	True
Lv4-1x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's use the given information and deduce the sports for each person based on the condition that they prefer different types of sports.

1. Since there are only two sports (cycling and swimming), if one person prefers swimming, the other person must prefer cycling.

2. The person who prefers swimming is in an even position, which means they must be in the second row (position 2) because the table has two rows (positions 1 and 2).

3. Now that we know the person in position 2 prefers swimming, the person in position 1 must prefer cycling.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|         |    1    |    2     |
| Sport   | Cycling | Swimming |
#############"	{'sport': ['cycling', 'swimming']}	True	2	True
Lv4-1x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's use the given information and deduce the sports for each person based on the condition that they prefer different types of sports.

1. Since there are only two sports available (sailing and snowboarding), if one person prefers snowboarding, the other person must prefer sailing.

2. The person who prefers snowboarding is in an even position (position 2). So, let's assign snowboarding to position 2.

3. Now, since the people prefer different types of sports, position 1 must prefer sailing.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|         |    1    |      2       |
| Sport   | Sailing | Snowboarding |

This table represents the solution to the given puzzle."	{'sport': ['sailing', 'snowboarding']}	True	2	True
Lv4-1x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people watching different movie-genres: fantasy and superhero.

2. The person watching fantasy movies is in an odd position. Since there are only two positions, the fantasy movie-watcher must be in position 1.

3. Now, we know that the person watching the fantasy movie is in position 1, so the superhero movie-watcher must be in position 2.

4. Finally, we can fill in the table with the movie-genres:

```
#############
|               |    1    |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy | Superhero |
#############
```

So, the final solution is:

```
#############
|               |    1    |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy | Superhero |
#############
```

This means that the person in position 1 is watching a fantasy movie, and the person in position 2 is watching a superhero movie."	{'movie-genre': ['fantasy', 'superhero']}	True	2	True
Lv4-1x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's assign the sports to the two positions systematically and check if the conditions are met.

1. Let's assume that the sport in position 1 is Snowboarding (S).
2. Since the people prefer 2 different types of sports, position 2 must have Volleyball (V).
3. Now, let's check the condition that the person who's sport is volleyball is in an even position (position 2 is even). The condition is met.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|         |      1       |     2      |
| Sport   |     Snowboarding | Volleyball |

This table satisfies both conditions given in the puzzle."	{'sport': ['snowboarding', 'volleyball']}	True	2	True
Lv4-1x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information:

1. There are two different nationalities: Chinese and Mexican.
2. The Mexican is in an even position (position 2 or 4).

Since there are only two nationalities and one of them must be in position 2 (even), the other nationality must be in position 1.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|               |    1    |    2    |
| Nationality   | Chinese | Mexican |

Lv4-1x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down:

1. We know there are two different sports, skiing and water-polo.
2. The person who plays water-polo is in an odd position, which means they can't be in position 1 because odd positions start from 1. So, the person who plays water-polo must be in position 2.
3. Since there are only two sports and one position is already filled with water-polo, the other sport, skiing, must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|  1   |  2  |
|Skiing |Water-polo|
#############
```

This table represents the final solution to the puzzle."	{'1': ['2'], 'skiing': ['water-polo']}	False	0	False
Lv4-1x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two pets, a goat and a horse.

2. The owner of the horse is in an even position, which means the horse cannot be in the first position (1) because the positions are numbered sequentially and start from 1, which is an odd number. So, the horse must be in the second position (2).

3. Since there are only two pets and one is the horse, the other pet (the goat) must be in the first position (1).

The final solution table is:

```
#############
|       |  1   |   2   |
| Pet   | Goat | Horse |
#############"	{'pet': ['goat', 'horse']}	True	2	True
Lv4-1x2-9	"Let's break this down:

1. We have two types of food: artichoke and tomato.
2. The person eating artichoke is in an even position. This means they are either the first or the second person.
3. Since there are two people and one food type left (tomato), the second person must be eating tomato.

Now let's fill in the table:

|        |   1    |     2     |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Food   | Artichoke | Tomato   |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-1x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down:

1. We know there are two people, and they use two different means of transport: bike and quad-bike.

2. The person driving the bike is in an even position, which means they are either the first or the second person. Since the first position is numbered 1, the person driving the bike must be in position 1.

3. Now, we know the person in position 1 is using a bike. So, the person in position 2 must be using a quad-bike.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
|             |     1     |  2   |
| Transport   | bike      | quad-bike |
