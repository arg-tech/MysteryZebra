Lv4-4x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 movie genres, 2 sports, and 2 types of transport. Let's assign them numbers for easier reference:

   |               |    1    |    2    |
   | Beverage      | Coffee  | Fanta  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime   | Spy    |
   | Sport         | Cycling | Surfing|
   | Transport     | Jet-ski | Taxi   |

2. From point 3, we know that the person watching spy movies is the person drinking coffee. So, we can swap the positions of Coffee and Fanta in the Beverage column to match this condition:

   |               |    1    |    2    |
   | Beverage      | Fanta  | Coffee  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime   | Spy    |
   | Sport         | Cycling | Surfing|
   | Transport     | Jet-ski | Taxi   |

3. From point 1, we know that the people prefer 2 different beverages. Since we've already assigned them, this condition is satisfied.

4. From point 2, we know that the person drinking fanta is in an even position. The only even positions are the 2nd and 4th. However, the 4th position is already occupied by Coffee (which is now the beverage of the spy movie watcher), so the person drinking Fanta must be in the 2nd position.

5. From point 4, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. The only possible arrangement that satisfies this condition is if Taxi is in the 2nd position and Jet-ski is in the 1st position.

6. Now we have the positions of Fanta and Taxi fixed. Since there's only one position left for Cycling and Surfing, Surfing must be in the 1st position and Cycling in the 4th position.

7. Finally, since the person drinking Coffee (Fanta in the original arrangement) is watching spy movies, the person drinking Fanta (now in the 2nd position) must be watching Crime movies.

The final solution table is:

   |               |    1    |    2    |
   | Beverage      | Fanta  | Coffee  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime   | Spy    |

Lv4-4x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different types of food, 2 movie genres, 2 pets, and 2 types of transport, we can assign each category to a unique number from 1 to 4. Let's start with the food:

   |               |      1      |    2    |
   | Food          | Avocado    | Cabbage |

2. Now let's assign the movie genres:

   |               |      1      |    2    |
   | Food          | Avocado    | Cabbage |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action     | Documentary |

3. Next, let's assign the pets:

   |               |      1      |    2    |
   | Food          | Avocado    | Cabbage |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action     | Documentary |
   | Pet           | Dog       | Rat      |

4. The owner of the rat is in an odd position, so the rat must be in position 1 or 3. Since the rat can't be in position 1 (because the owner of the rat can't be the one watching action movies, as stated in point 2), the rat must be in position 3. So, the dog is in position 1.

   |               |      1      |    2    |
   | Food          | Avocado    | Cabbage |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action     | Documentary |
   | Pet           | Dog       | Rat      |

5. The person eating cabbage is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the rat is eating cabbage and is in position 3, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 1. But we already know that position 1 is the dog. So, the dog is watching documentary movies, which contradicts point 2.

There seems to be a contradiction in the given information, and the puzzle cannot be solved as stated. The puzzle should be revised to avoid this contradiction."	{}	False	0	False
Lv4-4x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different means of transport, we can place one in each row. Let's place 'helicopter' in the first row and 'bike' in the second row.

   |             |      1       |       2       |
   | Beverage    |              |               |
   | Job         |              |               |

   | Transport   | helicopter   | bike          |

2. Since the person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the entrepreneur, the entrepreneur cannot be in position 1. So, the entrepreneur must be in position 2. Let's place 'entrepreneur' in the second row, second column.

   |             |      1       |       2       |
   | Beverage    |              |               |
   | Job         |              | entrepreneur   |

   | Transport   | helicopter   | bike          |

3. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the entrepreneur, so the lizard owner must be in position 2. Since there are 2 different pets, the person with the frog must be in position 1. Let's place 'lizard' in the second row, second column and 'frog' in the first row, first column.

   |             |      1       |       2       |
   | Beverage    | frog        | lizard       |

   | Transport   | helicopter   | bike          |

4. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position. Since there are only 2 positions, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2. Since there are 2 different beverages, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1. Let's place 'hot-chocolate' in the second row, second column and 'soy-milk' in the first row, first column.

   |             |      1       |       2       |
   | Beverage    | hot-chocolate| lizard       |
   | Job         | soy-milk    | entrepreneur   |
   | Pet         | frog        |               |
   | Transport   | helicopter   | bike          |

5. The remaining job is 'accountant'. Since there are 2 different jobs, the accountant must be in the other position. So, the accountant is in position 1. Let's place 'accountant' in the first row, first column.

   |             |      1       |       2       |

Lv4-4x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different hobbies, and 2 different music genres. This means that each category will have one item on the left and one on the right.

2. Let's start with the beverages. Since there are two different beverages, they must be placed in the first row, one in each column. Let's say Almond-Milk in column 1 and Sprite in column 2.

3. Now let's place the foods. The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. So, Zucchini must be in column 1 and Strawberry in column 2.

4. Next, let's place the hobbies. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we already placed the foods, we know that the person who likes cooking is on the right side. So, Card-Games must be in column 1 and Cooking in column 2.

5. Finally, let's place the music genres. The fan of pop is in an even position. Since we already placed the hobbies, we know that the person who likes pop must be in column 2. Classical must be in column 1.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv4-4x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 jobs, 2 movie-genres, and 2 pets. So, each category will have one item in the first column and another in the second column.

2. Since the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, we can place hot-chocolate in the first row and disaster in the second row of the Movie-Genre column. This leaves us with one movie genre left for the first row (let's say mystery) and the second row (let's say horror) for the other genre.

3. Since the owner of the frog is in an odd position, the frog cannot be in the first row (as the first position is even). So, the frog must be in the second row. This means the chinchilla must be in the first row.

4. Since the engineer is in an odd position, the engineer cannot be in the first row. So, the engineer must be in the second row. This means the dancer must be in the first row.

5. Now we have filled the Job column: Dancer in the first row and Engineer in the second row.

6. We still need to fill the Beverage and Pet columns. Since we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching disaster movies, the hot-chocolate must be in the first row. This means the other beverage (milk) must be in the second row.

7. We still have one pet left (let's say dog). Since we have filled all the other categories, the dog can go in any of the two empty cells in the Pet column. Let's place it in the first row for now.

8. Now we have the final solution table:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Milk      |
   | Job           | Dancer       | Engineer  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Mystery   |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla    | Frog      |

   However, we placed the dog in the first row for the Pet column, but we didn't have any information about the pet for the first row. So, the final solution table should not include the Pet column.

   So, the final solution table without the Pet column is:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Milk      |
   | Job           | Dancer       | Engineer  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Mystery   |

   But since we don't have the Pet column, we can't confirm the pet ownership. So, the final solution table with the Pet column is:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Milk      |
   | Job           | Dancer       | Engineer  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Mystery   |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla    | Frog      |

   But remember, the Pet column is not confirmed as we didn't have any information about the pet for the first row.

   So, the final solution table without the Pet column is:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Milk      |
   | Job           | Dancer       | Engineer  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Mystery   |

Lv4-4x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two jobs, two nationalities, two pets, and two sports. So, each category will have one unique value in each row.

2. The person who prefers soccer is in the even position, which means it can be either the first or the second row. Let's assume soccer is in the first row for now.

3. The Egyptian is on the far left or far right. If the Egyptian is in the first row, the nationality column would be filled, and the Egyptian cannot be on the far right because the electrician (who is Dutch) is the Egyptian (from point 3). So, the Egyptian must be in the first row and the Dutch in the second row.

4. The owner of the cat is on the left of the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is in the first row, the cat owner must be in the second row.

5. Now, we know the nationality and pet for the second row (Dutch and Cat), so the job and sport for the second row are the remaining options (Electrician and Soccer or Climbing). Since the electrician is Dutch (from point 3), the job and sport for the second row must be Electrician and Soccer (because the person who prefers soccer is in the first row).

6. Now, we know the nationality and job for the first row (Egyptian and not Electrician), so the pet and sport for the first row are the remaining options (Cat and Horse or Climbing). Since the cat is on the left of the Egyptian (from point 4), the pet for the first row must be Horse.

7. The remaining sport for the first row is Climbing.

Lv4-4x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 4 items for each category (2 beverages, 2 foods, 2 jobs, 2 movie-genres), but we know that each item appears only once in each row. So, each row must have a unique item.

2. Since there are 2 different beverages, let's label them as A (iced-tea) and B (lemonade).

3. Similarly, let's label the foods as C (avocado) and D (grapefruit).

4. The jobs can be labeled as E (dancer) and F (electrician).

5. The movie-genres can be labeled as G (crime) and H (family).

6. From point 1, we know that each row must have a unique item. So, let's assign each item to a row and column based on the given clues:

   - Since the person eating avocado is in an odd position (1 or 3), and the avocado is C, C must be in either the 1st or 3rd column. But since the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea, G cannot be in the 3rd column. So, G must be in the 1st column, and C must be in the 3rd column.

   - Now, since the dancer is on the left or right of the person eating avocado, E cannot be in the 2nd row because the 2nd column is occupied by C. So, E must be in the 1st or 3rd row. But since the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea, E cannot be in the 3rd row because the 3rd column is occupied by G. So, E must be in the 1st row.

   - Now, we know that the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since G is in the 1st column and A is in the 2nd column, the person watching crime movies (G) must be in the 1st row, and the person drinking iced-tea (A) must be in the 2nd row.

   - Now, we know that the dancer (E) is in the 1st row, and the person eating avocado (C) is in the 3rd column. The only remaining position for the electrician (F) is in the 1st row and 3rd column.

   - The only remaining positions for the movies are in the 2nd row. Since the person drinking lemonade (B) cannot be on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (A), B must be in the 2nd column. The only remaining position for the family movie (H) is in the 2nd row and 2nd column.

7. So, the final solution table is:

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | A (iced-tea) | B (lemonade) |

Lv4-4x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages, 2 jobs, 2 music-genres, and 2 means of transport, we can assign each category a unique value from 1 to 4. Let's start with beverages: Fanta = 1, Sprite = 2.

2. Now let's assign jobs: Architect = 1, Coach = 2.

3. For music-genres, since the trance fan is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5), and the classical fan is in an even position (position 2, 4, or 6), we can assign Classical = 2 and Trance = 1 or 3. Since the coach is on the left or right of the fan of classical, the coach cannot be in position 1 or 6. So, the coach must be in position 2 or 4, and the classical fan must be in position 3 or 5. If the coach is in position 2, the classical fan must be in position 5, and if the coach is in position 4, the classical fan must be in position 3. Let's assume the coach is in position 2 for now. So, Classical = 3, Trance = 1.

4. Now let's assign music-genres: Classical = 3, Trance = 1.

5. Since the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person driving the airplane, the fanta drinker cannot be in position 1 or 6. Also, the fanta drinker cannot be in position 2 (because the coach is there), and cannot be in position 4 (because the classical fan is there). So, the fanta drinker must be in position 3 or 5. If the fanta drinker is in position 3, the airplane driver must be in position 6, and if the fanta drinker is in position 5, the airplane driver must be in position 1. Let's assume the fanta drinker is in position 3. So, Fanta = 3, Airplane = 6.

6. Now we have only one position left for the van driver, which must be in position 4 or 5. Since the van driver cannot be in position 5 (because the fanta drinker is there), the van driver must be in position 4. So, Van = 4.

7. Now we have filled all the positions, and we can check the consistency of our assignments:

|               |   1    |     2     |

Lv4-4x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 hobbies, 2 pets, and 2 means of transport. Let's assign them numbers for easier tracking:

   | Pet         |           |         |
   | Transport   |           |         |

2. Since there are 2 different beverages, let's assign them as 1 (7up) and 2 (milk).

3. Since there are 2 different hobbies, let's assign them as A (drawing) and B (skydiving).

4. Since there are 2 different pets, let's assign them as C (bird) and D (lizard).

5. Since there are 2 different means of transport, let's assign them as E (roller) and F (van).

6. Now let's use the clues:

   a) The person who's hobby is skydiving is the owner of the bird. So, the row with hobby B must be the row with pet C.

   b) The person drinking 7up is in an odd position. Since the positions are numbered 1 and 2, the only odd position is 1. So, the beverage 1 (7up) must be in the first row.

   c) The person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the hobby B (skydiving) is in the second row, the transport E (roller) must be in the first row.

7. Now we have some fixed values:

   |             |     1     |    2    |
   | Beverage    |  7up      |  milk   |
   | Hobby       |           | skydiving|
   | Pet         |           |   bird  |
   | Transport   | roller    |         |

8. We still have some variables to fill: the second hobby, the second pet, and the second transport. Since we have only one remaining position for each, they must be A (drawing), D (lizard), and F (van) respectively.

9. So, the final solution table is:

   |             |     1     |    2    |

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different jobs, and 2 different movie-genres. So, each row and each column should have only one unique item.

2. Let's start with the beverages. Since there are two, they can be placed in either row or column 1 or 2. Let's place them in row 1 for now:

   |               |    1     |     2     |
   | Beverage      | 7up     |  lemonade |
   | Food          |         |           |
   | Job           |         |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |           |

3. Now let's place the foods. Since there are two, they can be placed in either row or column 2. Let's place them in column 2 for now:

   |               |    1     |     2     |
   | Beverage      | 7up     |  lemonade |
   | Food          | banana  |  papaya  |
   | Job           |         |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |           |

4. The architect is in an even position. Since there are 4 positions, the architect can be in either row 1 or 3. Let's place the architect in row 1 for now:

   |               |    1     |     2     |
   | Beverage      | 7up     |  lemonade |
   | Food          | banana  |  papaya  |
   | Job           | architect|           |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |           |

5. The architect is on the right of the person eating banana. Since the architect is in position 1-1, the person eating banana must be in position 1-2. So, the person eating papaya must be in position 2-2:

   |               |    1     |     2     |
   | Beverage      | 7up     |  lemonade |
   | Food          | banana  |  papaya  |
   | Job           | architect| writer   |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |           |

6. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching action movies. Since the architect is in position 1-1 and the person eating banana is in position 1-2, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2-1. The only movie genre left is action, so it must be in position 2-2:

   |               |    1     |     2     |
   | Beverage      | 7up     |  lemonade|
   | Food          | banana  |  papaya  |
   | Job           | architect| writer   |
   | Movie-Genre   | action  |  spy     |

7. Now we have filled all the positions with unique items, and all the conditions are satisfied. So, the final solution table is:

   |               |    1     |     2     |
   | Beverage      | 7up     |  lemonade|
   | Food          | banana  |  papaya  |
   | Job           | architect| writer   |
   | Movie-Genre   | action  |  spy     |
