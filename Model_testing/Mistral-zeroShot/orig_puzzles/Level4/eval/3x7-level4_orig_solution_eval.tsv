Lv4-3x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the thai is drinking water, so we can place the thai in the 7th position (column 7, row 1).

2. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the thai is in the 7th position, the badminton player must be in one of the first six positions. Let's place the badminton player in the 1st position (column 1, row 2). The cyclist is then in the 2nd position (column 2, row 2).

3. The Italian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the badminton player is in the 1st position, the Italian cannot be in the 2nd position (column 2, row 3). So, the Italian must be in one of the remaining even positions (4, 6, or 7). Let's place the Italian in the 4th position (column 4, row 3). This means the rugby player is in the 5th position (column 5, row 3).

4. The person drinking milk is on the far right. Since the Italian is in the 4th position, the milk drinker must be in the 7th position (column 7, row 3).

5. The person who's sport is basketball is the brazilian. Since the rugby player is in the 5th position, the brazilian (basketball player) must be in the 6th position (column 6, row 3).

6. The person drinking tea is the person drinking tea (already placed in the 1st position).

7. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left or right of the indian. Since the badminton player is in the 1st position, the indian must be in one of the remaining positions. Let's place the indian in the 2nd position (column 2, row 1).

8. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the cyclist is in the 2nd position, the biathlon player can be in either the 1st or 3rd position. Let's place the biathlon player in the 1st position (column 1, row 1).

9. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the thai. Since the thai is in the 7th position, the hot-chocolate drinker can be in either the 6th or 8th position. Let's place the hot-chocolate drinker in the 6th position (column 6, row 1).

10. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the rugby player is in the 5th position, the iced-tea drinker must be in the 6th position (column 6, row 1).

11. The person drinking tea is in the middle. This is already satisfied as the person drinking tea is in the 1st position.

12. The person drinking tea is in an even position. This is already satisfied as the person drinking tea is in the 1st position.

13. The thai is in an odd position. This is already satisfied as the thai is in the 7th position.

14. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the biathlon player is in the 1st position and the lemonade drinker is yet to be placed, the lemonade drinker must be in the 2nd position (column 2, row 1).

15. The turkish is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis player is yet to be placed, the turkish must be in one of the remaining positions. Let's place the turkish in the 3rd position (column 3, row 3). This means the tennis player is in the 4th position (column 4, row 3).

16. The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the badminton player is in the 1st position and the basketball player is in the 6th position, the badminton player must be in the 7th position (column 7, row 2).

17. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling. This is already satisfied as the biathlon player is in the 1st position and the cyclist is in the 2nd position.

18. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left or right of the indian. This is already satisfied as the badminton player is in the 1st position and the indian is in the 2nd position.

19. The person who's sport is basketball is the person drinking tea. This is already satisfied as the basketball player is in the 6th position and the tea drinker is in the 1st position.

20. The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. This is already satisfied as the badminton player is in the 7th position and the basketball player is in the 6th position.

Lv4-3x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the security-guard is on the right of the person driving the van, so the van driver cannot be the security-guard. Let's place the van driver in position 1 (far left) and the security-guard in position 6 (far right).

2. The owner of the lizard is the social-worker, so the social-worker cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 (since those are odd positions and the lizard owner is in an even position). Let's place the social-worker in position 2.

3. The owner of the bird is in an even position, so it cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the bird owner is also the security-guard (from point 7), the security-guard cannot be in position 2 (since the social-worker is there). So, the bird owner (and thus the security-guard) must be in position 4.

4. The accountant is in an odd position, so the accountant cannot be in position 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since the accountant cannot be the bird owner (since the bird owner is the security-guard), the accountant cannot be in position 4. So, the accountant must be in position 1.

5. The teacher is on the right of the owner of the frog, so the teacher cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the accountant is in position 1, the frog owner must be in position 3. So, the teacher is in position 2.

6. The owner of the cat is in the middle, so the cat owner must be in position 4.

7. The writer is on the right of the owner of the bird, so the writer cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the teacher is in position 2, the writer cannot be in position 6. So, the writer must be in position 5.

8. The lawyer is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (from point 14), so the lawyer cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the teacher is in position 2 and the writer is in position 5, the lawyer must be in position 6.

9. The pilot is in an even position, so the pilot cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the teacher is in position 2, the writer is in position 5, and the lawyer is in position 6, the pilot must be in position 4.

10. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile, so the bus driver cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the teacher is in position 2, the writer is in position 5, the lawyer is in position 6, and the pilot is in position 4, the bus driver must be in position 8. So, the snowmobile driver is in position 7.

11. The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (from point 16), so the dog owner cannot be in position 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since the teacher is in position 2, the writer is in position 5, the lawyer is in position 6, the pilot is in position 4, and the bus driver is in position 8, the dog owner must be in position 3.

12. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person driving the skateboard (not given in the puzzle, but we can assume this since all other pets have specific positions). So, the skateboard driver cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the teacher is in position 2, the writer is in position 5, the lawyer is in position 6, the pilot is in position 4, the bus driver is in position 8, and the dog owner is in position 3, the skateboard driver must be in position 7. So, the mouse owner is in position 6.

13. The person driving the quad-bike is in an even position and is on the left or right of the writer (from point 13 and 17). Since the quad-bike driver cannot be in position 2, 4, 6, or 8 (since the writer is in position 5), the quad-bike driver must be in position 1.

14. The person driving the helicopter is the social-worker (from point 18), so the social-worker cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the teacher is in position 2, the writer is in position 5, the lawyer is in position 6, the pilot is in position 4, the bus driver is in position 8, the dog owner is in position 3, and the quad-bike driver is in position 1, the helicopter driver must be in position 7. So, the hamster owner is in position 6.

Lv4-3x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the paramedic watches drama movies, we know that they are in an odd position (4, 6, or 8) and in the 1st, 3rd, or 7th column (odd positions) due to rule 4 and 7. Let's place the paramedic in position (5, 3) for now.

2. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the paramedic (who owns the hedgehog) is on the right of the bird owner, the horror movie watcher must be in position (4, 2) or (6, 2). Let's place them in position (6, 2) for now.

3. The dancer is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the paramedic is on the left of the western movie watcher, the dancer must be in position (5, 1) or (7, 1). Let's place them in position (7, 1) for now.

4. The analyst is in an odd position. Since the paramedic, dancer, and western movie watcher are already placed, the analyst must be in position (3, 1) or (5, 5) or (7, 5). Let's place them in position (5, 5) for now.

5. The engineer is the person watching animation movies. Since the analyst is on the far right, the engineer must be in position (1, 6) or (3, 6) or (5, 6). Let's place them in position (3, 6) for now.

6. The owner of the chinchilla is on the far left or far right. Since the paramedic (who owns the chinchilla) is in the 3rd column, the chinchilla owner must be in the 1st or 7th column. However, the paramedic is already in the 3rd column, so the chinchilla owner must be in the 1st column. This means the chinchilla owner cannot be the horror movie watcher (6, 2) or the dancer (7, 1), so the chinchilla owner must be the engineer (1, 6).

7. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since the engineer (who owns the chinchilla) is in the 1st column, the mouse owner must be in the 2nd column. The only available position for the mouse owner is (2, 4) (since the analyst is in position (5, 5) and the paramedic is in position (5, 3)).

8. The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the rat. Since the mouse owner is in the 2nd column, the dog owner must be in the 1st column. However, the only available position in the 1st column is the far left, which is already occupied by the engineer (who owns the chinchilla). This means the dog owner cannot be in the 1st column, so the dog owner must be in the 7th column. The only available position for the dog owner is (7, 6) (since the scientist is not yet placed).

9. The owner of the goat is in the middle. Since the mechanic is in the 3rd position, the goat owner must be in the 4th or 5th position. However, the paramedic, analyst, and engineer are already placed, so the goat owner must be the dancer (7, 1) or the person watching western movies (5, 1). Since the dancer is already placed, the goat owner must be the person watching western movies (5, 1).

10. The scientist is on the left or right of the paramedic. Since the paramedic is in the 3rd column, the scientist can be in the 2nd or 4th column. However, the analyst is already in the 5th column, so the scientist must be in the 4th column. The only available position for the scientist is (4, 5).

11. The person watching adventure movies is between the lawyer and the person watching animation movies. Since the lawyer is not yet placed, let's place them in position (6, 1) for now. The person watching animation movies is the engineer (3, 6), so the person watching adventure movies must be in position (4, 1).

12. The person watching romance movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the paramedic (who watches drama) is in the 3rd column, the romance movie watcher can be in the 2nd or 4th column. However, the scientist is already in the 4th column, so the romance movie watcher must be in the 2nd column. The only available position for the romance movie watcher is (2, 5).

13. The mechanic is in the middle. Since the mechanic is already placed in the 3rd position, this step is satisfied.

14. The lawyer is in position (6, 1).

15. The owner of the rat is in the 6th column. Since the dog owner is in the 7th column (7, 6), the rat owner must be in the 6th column. The only available position for the rat owner is (6, 4) (since the scientist is in position (4, 5) and the romance movie watcher is in position (2, 5)).

Lv4-3x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 7 people, each with a unique preference for a movie genre, music genre, and transport. Let's assign numbers to each category for easier reference:
   - Movie-Genres: 1 (Adventure), 2 (Crime), 3 (Fantasy), 4 (Horror), 5 (Sports), 6 (Time-Travel), 7 (Zombie)
   - Music-Genres: A (Ambient), B (D&B), C (Disco), D (Folk), E (Hip-Hop), F (Jazz), G (Techno)
   - Transports: Q (Quad-bike), R (Roller), S (Snowmobile), T (Tram), V (Van), B (Bus)

2. From rule 13, the person driving the snowmobile is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the snowmobile driver is on the far left (S).

3. From rule 9, the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. If the snowmobile driver is on the far left, the roller driver must be on the far right (R).

4. From rule 18, the fan of folk is driving the quad-bike (Q).

5. From rule 16, the person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies. Since the snowmobile driver (time-travel) is on the far left, the adventure movie fan must be on the far right (1).

6. From rule 10, the person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the fan of ambient. So, the fan of ambient is on the far left (A).

7. From rule 11, the fan of techno is on the left of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of ambient is on the far left, the fan of d&b must be on the far right (B).

8. From rule 15, the fan of d&b is the person watching sports movies. So, sports movies are in position 5 (S).

9. From rule 19, the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since we know the positions of sports (S), time-travel (T), and the fan of d&b (B), we can deduce that fantasy movies are in position 3 (F).

10. From rule 14, the fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the fan of jazz. Since we know the positions of sports (S), time-travel (T), the fan of d&b (B), and fantasy (F), we can deduce that the fan of jazz is in position 6 (J).

11. From rule 12, the fan of jazz is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since we know the positions of sports (S), time-travel (T), the fan of d&b (B), fantasy (F), and the fan of hip-hop (H), we can deduce that the person driving the train is in position 4 (Tr).

12. From rule 17, the person driving the van is on the left of the person driving the bus. Since we know the positions of sports (S), time-travel (T), the fan of d&b (B), fantasy (F), the fan of hip-hop (H), the fan of jazz (J), and the person driving the train (Tr), we can deduce that the person driving the bus is in position 7 (Bs) and the person driving the van is in position 2 (V).

13. From rule 5, the person watching horror movies is the person driving the van. So, horror movies are in position 4 (H).

14. From rule 2, the fan of hip-hop is on the far right. Since we know the positions of sports (S), time-travel (T), the fan of d&b (B), fantasy (F), the fan of jazz (J), the person driving the train (Tr), and the person driving the van (H), we can confirm that the fan of hip-hop is in position 6 (H).

Lv4-3x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 7 different music-genres, sports, and means of transport. So, each row and each column should have unique values.

2. From rule 1, we know that the fan of d&b is the fan of d&b, so we can fill the first row with 'd&b' in the first cell.

3. From rule 2, the person who's sport is snowboarding is the fan of reggae. Since we already have a value in the first row, let's place snowboarding in the second row, second cell (since it's the fan of reggae).

4. From rule 3, the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of classical. Since we have d&b and snowboarding, let's place hip-hop in the first row, third cell and classical in the first row, fourth cell.

5. From rule 4, the person driving the subway is the fan of dubstep. Since we have d&b, snowboarding, hip-hop, and classical, let's place subway in the second row, fifth cell.

6. From rule 5, the fan of classical is on the right of the person driving the bike. So, the person driving the bike should be in the first row, sixth cell. Let's place bike in the second row, sixth cell.

7. From rule 6, the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person driving the bike. Since we have snowboarding in the second row, second cell, the person driving the bike should be in the first row, second cell. So, bike is in the second row, sixth cell and the person driving the bike is in the first row, second cell.

8. From rule 7, the person driving the car is the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since we have snowboarding in the second row, second cell, the person driving the car is also in the second row, second cell. So, car is in the second row, second cell and the person driving the car is the person who's sport is snowboarding.

9. From rule 8, the person driving the jet-ski is the fan of funk. Since we have d&b, snowboarding, hip-hop, classical, subway, bike, and car, let's place funk in the third row, first cell.

10. From rule 9, the person driving the motorbike is in an odd position. Since we have filled the first six cells, the motorbike must be in the seventh cell of any row. However, since we have already placed car and bike in the second row, the motorbike must be in the third row, seventh cell.

11. From rule 12, the person driving the motorbike is in an odd position. Since we have filled the first six cells, the motorbike must be in the seventh cell of any row. However, since we have already placed car and bike in the second row, the motorbike must be in the third row, seventh cell.

12. From rule 13, the fan of funk is in the middle. Since we have placed funk in the third row, first cell, the fan of funk is in the third row, first cell and the seventh cell.

13. From rule 14, the person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since we have already placed snowboarding, cycling, and skiing, let's place sailing in the fourth row, first cell and ice-hockey in the fourth row, second cell.

14. From rule 15, the person who's sport is cricket is the fan of funk. Since we have already placed funk in the third row, first cell, the person who's sport is cricket must be in the first row. However, we have already placed d&b, snowboarding, hip-hop, classical, and bike, so cricket must be in the seventh cell of the first row.

15. From rule 16, the person who's sport is skiing is between the fan of indie and the fan of funk. Since we have already placed funk in the third row, first cell and seventh cell, and indie can't be in the third row (since we have already placed funk in the middle), let's place indie in the fifth row, third cell. Since skiing is between indie and funk, let's place skiing in the fifth row, fourth cell.

16. From rule 18, the person who's sport is cycling is in an even position. Since we have already placed snowboarding, skiing, sailing, and ice-hockey, let's place cycling in the sixth row, second cell.

17. From rule 10, the person who's sport is cycling is the person driving the skateboard. Since we have already placed cycling in the sixth row, second cell, let's place skateboard in the sixth row, sixth cell.

18. From rule 11, the person who's sport is skiing is the person driving the motorbike. Since we have already placed skiing in the fifth row, fourth cell, the motorbike is also in the fifth row, fourth cell.

19. From rule 12, the person driving the motorbike is in an odd position. Since we have already placed motorbike in the fifth row, fourth cell, it's in an odd position.

20. From rule 19, the person driving the subway is on the far left or far right. Since we have already placed subway in the second row, fifth cell, the person driving the subway is on the far right.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

Lv4-3x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 12, the lacrosse player is in the middle. Since there are 7 people, the lacrosse player must be in position 4. Let's assume the lacrosse player is in position 4 (L).

2. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the lacrosse player (L). So, the reading hobby must be in position 3 (R).

3. From rule 19, the skydiving hobby is on the left or right of the ice-hockey sport. Since the lacrosse player is in position 4, the ice-hockey sport must be in position 2 or 6. Let's assume the ice-hockey sport is in position 2 (I).

4. From rule 18, the surfing sport is on the left or right of the colombian (C). Since the lacrosse player is in position 4 and the colombian can't be in position 1 (from rule 17), the surfing sport must be in position 5 or 7. Let's assume the surfing sport is in position 5 (S).

5. From rule 16, the skateboarding sport is on the right of the cooking hobby. Since the cooking hobby can't be in position 1 (from rule 6), the skateboarding sport must be in position 6 (K).

6. From rule 8, the malaysian is the sailing sport. Since the malaysian can't be in position 1 (from rule 6) or position 7 (from rule 13), the sailing sport must be in position 3 (M).

7. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is traveling is the soccer player. Since the soccer player can't be in position 1 (from rule 6) or position 7 (from rule 17), the soccer player must be in position 2 (T).

8. From rule 14 and 15, the chess hobby is in an odd position. Since the chess hobby can't be in position 1 (from rule 6) or position 7 (from rule 17), the chess hobby must be in position 5 (C).

9. From rule 13, the italian is on the left of the malaysian (M). So, the italian must be in position 2 (I).

10. From rule 4, the turkish is on the left or right of the pakistani. Since the pakistani can't be in position 1 (from rule 6) or position 7 (from rule 17), the pakistani must be in position 6 (P).

11. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is fishing is the turkish (P). So, the fishing hobby must be in position 6 (F).

12. From rule 5, the indian is on the right of the malaysian (M). So, the indian must be in position 7 (I).

13. From rule 3, the person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the soccer player is in position 2 (T) and the skydiving hobby is in position 6 (F), the skydiving hobby must be in position 1 (S).

14. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the writing hobby is in position 3 (R) and the fishing hobby is in position 6 (F), the writing hobby must be in position 4 (W).

Lv4-3x7-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. From statements 6 and 10, we know that the person eating grapes is the one driving the trike. Let's place grapes in the 'trike' position (position 7).

2. From statement 13, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is on the left or right of the person driving the bus. Since we already placed grapes (surfing) in position 7, the person who's sport is surfing cannot be in position 1 (left of the bus) or position 6 (right of the bus). So, the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since surfing is a unique sport, we can place it in one of these positions. Let's place surfing in position 2 (sport).

3. From statement 11, we know that the person who's sport is cricket is on the left or right of the person eating cauliflower. Since we already placed surfing in position 2, cricket cannot be in position 1 (left of cauliflower) or position 3 (right of cauliflower). So, cricket must be in position 4 or 5. Since cricket is a unique sport, we can place it in one of these positions. Let's place cricket in position 4 (sport).

4. From statement 12, we know that the person who's sport is cricket is on the far right. Since we already placed cricket in position 4, it must be in the rightmost position. So, we swap cricket with the person in position 5, and cricket becomes sport 5.

5. From statement 14, we know that the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Since we already placed surfing in position 2 and cricket in position 5, the person eating papaya cannot be in position 1 (left of boat) or position 6 (right of boat). So, the person eating papaya must be in position 3 or 4. Since papaya is a unique food, we can place it in one of these positions. Let's place papaya in position 3 (food).

6. From statement 15, we know that the person driving the trike (grapes) is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since we already placed grapes in position 7 and basketball is a unique sport, it must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Since grapes is on the left of basketball, basketball cannot be in position 7. So, basketball must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since basketball is a unique sport, we can place it in one of these positions. Let's place basketball in position 1 (sport).

7. From statement 19, we know that the person driving the bike is on the right of the person eating carrot. Since we already placed basketball in position 1, the person eating carrot cannot be in position 2. So, the person eating carrot must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since carrot is a unique food, we can place it in one of these positions. Let's place carrot in position 3 (food).

8. From statement 16, we know that the person driving the bike is in an odd position. Since we already placed carrot in position 3, the person driving the bike must be in position 1, 5, or 7. Since the person driving the trike (grapes) is in position 7, the person driving the bike cannot be in position 7. So, the person driving the bike must be in position 1 or 5. Since the person driving the bike is on the right of the person eating carrot (position 3), it cannot be in position 1. So, the person driving the bike is in position 5 (transport).

9. From statement 18, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is in the middle. Since we already placed basketball in position 1, volleyball must be in position 4 or 6. Since volleyball is a unique sport, we can place it in one of these positions. Let's place volleyball in position 4 (sport).

10. From statement 9, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the person driving the bus. Since we already placed surfing in position 2, biathlon cannot be in position 1 (left of bus) or position 3 (right of bus). So, biathlon must be in position 4 or 6. Since biathlon is a unique sport, we can place it in one of these positions. Let's place biathlon in position 6 (sport).

11. From statement 3, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is between the person eating corn and the person driving the train. Since we already placed surfing in position 2, skateboarding cannot be in position 1 (left of corn) or position 3 (right of corn). So, skateboarding must be in position 4 or 5. Since skateboarding is a unique sport, we can place it in one of these positions. Let's place skateboarding in position 4 (sport).

12. From statement 17, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is the person driving the snowmobile. Since we already placed skateboarding in position 4 (sport), the person driving the snowmobile is in position 4 (transport).

13. From statement 8, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is in an even position. Since we already placed skateboarding in position 4 (an even position), this statement is satisfied.

14. From statement 1, we know that the person eating grapes is the person who's sport is surfing. Since we already placed grapes in position 7 (food) and surfing in position 2 (sport), this statement is satisfied.

15. From statement 2, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is the person eating grapes. Since we already placed grapes in position 7 (food) and surfing in position 2 (sport), this statement is satisfied.

16. From statement 5, we know that the person eating cauliflower is on the left of the person eating corn. Since we already placed corn in position 3 (food), the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2.

17. From statement 11, we know that the person who's sport is cricket is on the left or right of the person eating cauliflower. Since we already placed cauliflower in position 2, cricket cannot be in position 1 (left of cauliflower). So, cricket must be in position 3.

Lv4-3x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the jet-ski driver is in an odd position and there are 7 positions, the jet-ski driver must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the jet-ski driver is in position 1 (we'll check other possibilities later).

2. The owner of the snake is in an odd position, so it can't be in position 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since the goldfish owner is on the left or right of the volleyball player, the snake can't be in position 7 (as it would be too far from the volleyball player). So, the snake must be in position 3.

3. Now we know the goldfish is on the left or right of the volleyball player. If the goldfish is in position 5, the volleyball player must be in position 7 (as the goldfish can't be in position 6 due to the snake being in position 3). But this would mean the jet-ski driver can't be in position 1 because the volleyball player is in position 7. So, the goldfish must be in position 6.

4. The person driving the taxi is the person who's sport is baseball. Since the baseball player is on the left or right of the person driving the train, the baseball player can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 (as the jet-ski driver, snake owner, and volleyball player are already in these positions). So, the baseball player must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But if the baseball player was in position 6, the taxi driver would be the goldfish owner, which contradicts the fact that the taxi driver is the baseball player. So, the baseball player must be in position 4.

5. The owner of the ferret is between the person driving the tram and the owner of the rabbit. Since the rabbit owner is in position 4 (as the baseball player), the ferret can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. The only remaining position is 2, so the ferret is in position 2.

6. The owner of the lizard is the person who's sport is surfing. Since the lizard owner can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 (as the jet-ski driver, snake owner, goldfish owner, and baseball player are already in these positions), the lizard must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But if the lizard was in position 2, it would be the ferret, which contradicts the fact that the lizard is the surfer. So, the lizard must be in position 6.

7. The person who's sport is badminton is on the far right. Since the volleyball player is in position 7 and the lizard is in position 6, the badminton player must be in position 1.

8. The owner of the dog is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. So, the dog owner must be in position 7.

9. The owner of the horse can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 (as the jet-ski driver, snake owner, goldfish owner, and dog owner are already in these positions). The only remaining position is 2, so the horse owner is in position 2.

10. The person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position. Since the jet-ski driver, snake owner, goldfish owner, baseball player, ferret owner, lizard owner, dog owner, and horse owner are all in even positions, the swimmer must be in position 5.

11. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the owner of the rabbit. Since the rabbit owner is in position 4 (as the baseball player), the skateboarder must be in position 3.

12. The person driving the airplane is in the middle. Since the jet-ski driver, snake owner, goldfish owner, baseball player, ferret owner, lizard owner, dog owner, horse owner, and swimmer are all in even positions, the airplane driver must be in position 6.

13. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboarder is in position 3, the volleyball player must be in position 4.

14. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the skateboarder is in position 3, the ice-hockey player must be in position 2.

15. The person who's sport is surfing is the owner of the lizard. This is already known.

16. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the owner of the rabbit. This is already known.

17. The owner of the snake is between the owner of the horse and the person who's sport is baseball. Since the horse owner is in position 2 and the baseball player is in position 4, the snake must be in position 3.

Now, let's check the assumptions we made about the jet-ski driver:
- If the jet-ski driver was in position 3, the snake would be in position 1, which would mean the goldfish would have to be in position 7, but then the volleyball player couldn't be in position 4 (as the goldfish is on the left or right of the volleyball player).
- If the jet-ski driver was in position 5, the snake would be in position 1, which would mean the goldfish would have to be in position 7, but then the volleyball player couldn't be in position 4 (as the goldfish is on the left or right of the volleyball player).
- If the jet-ski driver was in position 7, the snake would be in position 3, but then the goldfish would have to be in position 5, which would mean the volleyball player couldn't be in position 4 (as the goldfish is on the left or right of the volleyball player).

So, our initial assumption that the jet-ski driver is in position 1 is correct.

Lv4-3x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 hobbies, nationalities, and pets. Let's assign a number from 1 to 7 to each of them.

2. From rule 13, we know that the Malay is in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 (even positions) and does camping (let's say hobby 1). So, hobby 1 = camping, nationality 1 = Malay.

3. From rule 2, the person with hobby 2 (puzzles) is to the left of the person with pet 4 (frog). Since the Malay is in position 1, the person with hobby 2 must be in position 0 or 2. But position 0 is already taken (rule 10), so hobby 2 = puzzles, nationality 2 = ? (not Malay).

4. From rule 4, the person with hobby 2 is in an odd position. So, hobby 2 = puzzles, nationality 2 = Egyptian (since all even positions are taken).

5. From rule 5, the owner of pet 3 (bird) is to the left or right of the person with hobby 2. Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the bird owner must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. But position 1 is already taken (Malay), so the bird owner is in position 3, 5, or 7. Let's say hobby 3 = filmmaking, nationality 3 = Dutch (since the Dutch owns the goat, which is on the right of the bird, as per rule 6).

6. From rule 8, the person with hobby 4 (singing) is to the left of the person with pet 2 (cat). Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the person with hobby 4 must be in position 0 or 4. But position 0 is already taken (rule 10), so hobby 4 = singing, nationality 4 = ? (not Egyptian).

7. From rule 9, the person with hobby 2 (puzzles) is to the left or right of the person with hobby 4 (singing). Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the person with hobby 4 must be in position 3 or 5. But position 3 is already taken (Dutch), so hobby 4 = singing, nationality 4 = British (since the British is between the Argentine and the Dutch, as per rule 12).

8. From rule 18, the person with hobby 2 (puzzles) is to the left of the person with hobby 4 (singing). So, hobby 2 must be in position 0 or 2, and hobby 4 must be in position 1 or 3. But position 0 is already taken (Malay), so hobby 2 = puzzles, nationality 2 = Egyptian, hobby 4 = singing, nationality 4 = British.

9. From rule 1, we know that there are 7 hobbies. Since we have assigned hobbies 1, 2, 3, and 4, the remaining hobbies are 5, 6, and 7.

10. From rule 17, the owner of pet 5 (hamster) is on the far left or far right. Since the Malay, Egyptian, Dutch, and British are already placed, the hamster owner must be in position 6 or 7. But position 7 is already taken (rule 10), so hobby 5 = hamster, nationality 5 = ? (not Malay, Egyptian, Dutch, British).

11. From rule 11, the Thai is in an even position. Since the Malay, Egyptian, Dutch, British, and the person with hobby 5 are in odd positions, the Thai must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But position 2 is already taken (Egyptian), so the Thai is in position 4 or 6. Since the Thai is between the Argentine and the Dutch (rule 12), the Thai must be in position 4. So, hobby 6 = fishing, nationality 6 = Thai.

12. From rule 19, the person with hobby 7 (skydiving) is in an even position. Since the Malay, Egyptian, Dutch, British, and the Thai are in even positions, the person with hobby 7 must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. But position 1 is already taken (Malay), position 3 is taken (Dutch), and position 5 is taken (hobby 3 = filmmaking), so hobby 7 = skydiving, nationality 7 = ? (not Malay, Egyptian, Dutch, British, Thai).

13. From rule 6, the owner of pet 6 (goat) is on the right of the owner of pet 3 (bird). Since the Dutch owns the bird, the goat owner must be in position 4, 5, or 7. But position 4 is taken (Thai), position 5 is taken (hobby 3 = filmmaking), and position 7 is already taken (rule 10), so this rule is a contradiction. There seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Lv4-3x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 items in each category (beverages, food, nationalities), so we can label them from 1 to 7.

2. From rule 14, we know that the person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the argentine. Since the argentine is in position 4 (rule 2), the cucumber must be in position 3, 5, or 7. However, rule 18 says the person drinking 7up is the person eating cucumber, and since the russian is the person drinking 7up (rule 4), the russian must be in position 3.

3. Now we know the russian is in position 3, so the argentine must be in position 4. This means the cucumber is not in position 4, so it must be either 5 or 7. But rule 14 also says the cucumber is on the left or right of the argentine, so it can't be in position 7. Therefore, the cucumber is in position 5.

4. Since the russian is in position 3, the 7up is in position 3. This means the beverages are now: 1-7up, 2-coffee, 3-7up, 4-tea, 5-milk, 6-, 7-.

5. From rule 18, we know that the person eating cucumber is the person drinking 7up, so the milk must be in an odd position (rule 6). The only odd positions left are 1 and 5, but the milk can't be in position 1 because the person drinking milk is on the left of the australian (rule 12), and the australian is in position 10 (rule 10). So the milk is in position 5.

6. Now the beverages are: 1-7up, 2-, 3-7up, 4-tea, 5-milk, 6-, 7-. From rule 17, we know the person eating garlic is on the left or right of the person eating onion. Since the argentine is eating onions (rule 9), the garlic must be in position 2 or 4. But the garlic can't be in position 2 because the person eating garlic is on the left or right of the person eating onion, and the onion is in position 4. So the garlic is in position 2.

7. Now the beverages are: 1-7up, 2-garlic, 3-7up, 4-tea, 5-milk, 6-, 7-. From rule 15, we know the person eating cranberry is on the left of the person eating artichoke. Since the australian is eating artichoke (rule 10), the cranberry must be in position 1 or 3. But the cranberry can't be in position 1 because the person drinking 7up is in position 1 (rule 4). So the cranberry is in position 3.

8. Now the beverages are: 1-7up, 2-garlic, 3-cranberry, 4-tea, 5-milk, 6-, 7-. From rule 16, we know the australian is on the left of the malaysian.
