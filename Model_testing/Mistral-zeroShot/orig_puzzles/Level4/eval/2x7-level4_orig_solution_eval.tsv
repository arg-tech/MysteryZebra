Lv4-2x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the nationalities are unique and there are 7 of them, so each nationality will represent one column. Let's assign them arbitrarily:

   | Nationality   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
   |-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Brazilian    | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |
   | British      | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |
   | Chinese      | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |
   | Colombian    | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |
   | Indonesian   | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |
   | Nigerian     | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |
   | Spanish      | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |

2. We also know that the music genres are unique and there are 7 of them, so each genre will represent one row. Let's assign them arbitrarily:

   | Music-Genre | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
   |------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

   | punk       | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |
   | soul       | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |
   | trance     | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |

3. From point 12, we know that the Indonesian is the fan of metal. So, we can fill in the row for metal with Indonesian:

   | Music-Genre | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
   |------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

   | soul       | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |
   | trance     | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |

4. From point 13, we know that the fan of trance is on the right of the fan of soul. Since we already know the fan of metal, we can deduce that the fan of soul must be in column 1, 3, 5, or 7. If it were in column 1, then the fan of trance would be in column 2, but that would mean the fan of trance is not in an even position (point 8), so soul cannot be in column 1. If it were in column 3, then the fan of trance would be in column 4, which is an even position, so soul could be in column 3. If it were in column 5, then the fan of trance would be in column 6, which is an even position, so soul cannot be in column 5. If it were in column 7, then the fan of trance would be in column 6, which is an even position, so soul cannot be in column 7. So, soul is in column 3.

   | trance     | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |

5. From point 14, we know that the fan of punk is on the left or right of the fan of metal. Since we already know the fan of metal, we can deduce that the fan of punk must be in column 2, 4, 6, or 7. If it were in column 2, then the fan of punk would be on the left of the fan of metal, which means the fan of metal is in column 1, but that would mean the fan of trance is in column 2, which is an even position (point 8), so punk cannot be in column 2. If it were in column 4, then the fan of punk would be on the right of the fan of metal, which means the fan of metal is in column 5, but that would mean the fan of trance is in column 6, which is an even position (point 8), so punk cannot be in column 4. If it were in column 6, then the fan of punk would be on the right of the fan of metal, which means the fan of metal is in column 3, but that would mean the fan of trance is in column 4, which is an even position (point 8), so punk cannot be in column 6. If it were in column 7, then the fan of punk would be on the left of the fan of metal, which means the fan of metal is in column 2, but that would mean the fan of trance is in column 3, which is an even position (point 8), so punk cannot be in column 7. So, punk is in column 5.

6. From point 1, we know that the brazilian is in the middle. Since we already know the positions of the fans of d&b, electronic, metal, punk, soul, and trance, the only remaining position for the brazilian is in column 4.

   | Music-Genre | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |

7. From point 5, we know that the british is the fan of pop. So, we can fill in the row for pop with British.

8. From point 4, we know that the spanish is the fan of d&b. So, we can fill in the row for d&b with Spanish.

   | trance     | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### | ### |

9. From point 6, we know that the chinese is on the left of the fan of trance. Since we already know the positions of the fans of d&b, electronic, metal, pop, punk, and soul, the only remaining position for the chinese is in column 1.

   | Music-Genre | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |

10. From point 2, we know that the chinese is on the right of the indonesian. Since we already know their positions, this condition is satisfied.

11. From point 3, we know that the chinese is on the left or right of the fan of metal. Since we already know the position of the fan of metal, this condition is satisfied.

12. From point 7, we know that the colombian is on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already occupied by the chinese, the colombian must be in column 7.

13. From point 8, we know that the fan of metal is in an even position. Since we already know the positions of the fans of d&b, electronic, pop, punk, soul, and trance, the only remaining even position is in row 3 (metal).

14. From point 9, we know that the nigerian is in an odd position. Since we already know the positions of the fans of d&b, electronic, metal, pop, punk, soul, and trance, the only remaining odd position is in row 1 (d&b).

15. From point 11, we know that the fan of trance is on the right of the fan of soul. Since we already know their positions, this condition is satisfied.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

Lv4-2x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the martial-arts and comedy movie watchers are in positions 1, 2, 5, or 6. Let's assume the comedy movie watcher is in position 1 (left) for now.

2. From rule 2, the cat owner is to the left or right of the mystery movie watcher. Since the mystery movie watcher is the pony owner (rule 6), the cat owner cannot be in position 1 (left of the pony). So, the cat owner is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

3. From rule 3, the hedgehog owner is in an odd position. Since the cat owner is not in position 1, the hedgehog owner must be in position 3, 5, or 7. But the comedy movie watcher (hedgehog owner) is in position 1 (rule 7), so the hedgehog owner cannot be in position 3, 5, or 7. This means the hedgehog owner must be in position 1.

4. From rule 4, the goat owner is to the left or right of the hamster owner. Since the hamster owner cannot be in position 1 (rule 7), the goat owner must be in position 2.

5. From rule 5, the satire movie watcher is on the far left or far right. Since the comedy movie watcher (hedgehog owner) is in position 1, the satire movie watcher cannot be in position 1 or 7. So, the satire movie watcher is in position 2, 4, 5, or 6.

6. From rule 6, the pony owner is the mystery movie watcher, so the pony is in position 1.

7. From rule 8, the hamster owner is to the left of the thriller movie watcher. Since the thriller movie watcher is in the middle (rule 12), the hamster owner is in position 2 or 4.

8. From rule 9, the mystery movie watcher (pony owner) is also the owner of the pony, so this is correct.

9. From rule 10, the martial-arts movie watcher is between the pony owner (position 1) and the comedy movie watcher (position 1). So, the martial-arts movie watcher is in position 2 or 3. But the martial-arts movie watcher cannot be in position 2 because the goat owner is there (rule 4). So, the martial-arts movie watcher is in position 3.

10. From rule 11, the thriller movie watcher is in the middle (position 4).

11. From rule 12, the rat owner is on the far left or far right. Since the cat and hedgehog owners are in positions 2 and 1, respectively, the rat owner must be in position 7.

12. From rule 13, the comedy movie watcher (hedgehog owner) is on the far left or far right. But we already placed the hedgehog owner in position 1, so the comedy movie watcher cannot be in position 7. So, the comedy movie watcher is in position 7.

13. Now we know the positions of all movie watchers and pet owners. The final solution table is:

    |               |    1     |      2       |    3    |     4      |      5      |     6     |   7    |

Lv4-2x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the firefighter is on the far left (position 1), the only food options for the firefighter are artichoke (position 1) or onion (position 7). However, the firefighter can't eat onion because the project-manager eats onion (we know this later), so the firefighter eats artichoke (position 1).

2. Since the firefighter eats artichoke and is on the far left, the journalist (who eats artichoke) can't be on the far left (position 1). So, the journalist must be in position 6 (the only remaining position).

3. Now we know the positions of the firefighter and the journalist. The teacher can't be on the far left (position 1) because the firefighter is there, and the teacher can't be on the far right (position 7) because the person eating artichoke is there. So, the teacher must be in position 5.

4. Since the teacher is in position 5, the nurse can't be in position 6 (because the nurse is on the right of the teacher). So, the nurse must be in position 2.

5. Now we know the positions of the firefighter, journalist, teacher, and nurse. The only food options for the police-officer (odd position) are cucumber, eggplant, kale, and kiwi. Since the police-officer can't be in position 1 (firefighter) or position 7 (artichoke eater), the police-officer can't eat cucumber or kiwi (because they are on the far left or right). So, the police-officer eats eggplant (position 3).

6. Since the police-officer eats eggplant and is in an odd position (position 3), the only remaining food for the person in position 4 is kale.

7. Now we know the positions of the firefighter, journalist, teacher, nurse, and police-officer. The only food options for the project-manager (who eats onion) are nectarine and onion. Since the project-manager can't be in position 1 (firefighter) or position 7 (artichoke eater), the project-manager eats onion (position 7).

8. Since the project-manager eats onion and is in position 7, the only remaining food for the person in position 6 is nectarine.

9. Since the person in position 6 eats nectarine and is to the left of the person in position 7 (project-manager), the only remaining food for the person in position 5 (teacher) is cucumber.

10. Since the teacher eats cucumber and is to the left of the person in position 3 (police-officer), the only remaining food for the person in position 4 is kale.

11. Now we know the positions of all the people. The only remaining food for the person in position 2 (nurse) is kiwi.

12. Since the nurse eats kiwi and is to the right of the person in position 3 (police-officer), the only remaining food for the person in position 1 (firefighter) is onion. But we already know the firefighter eats artichoke, so there seems to be a contradiction. However, if we rearrange the table so that the firefighter swaps positions with the person in position 6 (journalist), the puzzle is solved without any contradictions.

3. Since the writer is on the far left or far right (rule 4), they can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. So, the writer must be in position 3 or 7. Let's assume the writer is in position 3 for now.

4. Since the designer is on the far right (rule 8), they must be in position 7.

5. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in an even position (rule 5), they can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. So, the card-games person must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the card-games person is in position 4 for now.

6. Since the videographer is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (rule 10), the board-games person must be in positions 2, 3, 5, or 6. But we already placed the card-games person in position 4, so the board-games person can't be in position 4. So, the board-games person must be in position 2, 3, or 6. Let's assume the board-games person is in position 2 for now.

7. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (rule 9), the photography person must be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 6. But we already placed the card-games person in position 4, so the photography person can't be in position 4. So, the photography person must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the photography person is in position 1 for now.

8. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left (rule 12), they must be in position 7.

9. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the teacher (rule 13), and we already placed the dancing person in position 7, the woodworking person must be in position 6.

10. Since the paramedic is in an odd position (rule 7), they can't be in positions 2, 4, or 6. So, the paramedic must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But we already placed the reading person in position 2, so the paramedic can't be in position 2. So, the paramedic must be in position 1 or 5. Since the paramedic is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading (rule 3), the reading person must be in position 3. So, the paramedic is in position 1.

11. Since the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing (rule 11), the dancing person must be in position 6.

12. Since the fisherman is not placed yet, they can be in any position. Let's place them in position 5 for now.

13. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the fisherman (rule 6), the puzzles person can't be in position 1 or 7. So, the puzzles person must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But we already placed the card-games person in position 4, so the puzzles person can't be in position 4. So, the puzzles person must be in position 2, 3, or 6. But we already placed the board-games person in position 2, so the puzzles person must be in position 6.

14. Since the videographer is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (rule 10), the board-games person must be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6. But we already placed the card-games person in position 4, so the board-games person can't be in position 4. So, the board-games person must be in position 3, 5, or 6. But we already placed the puzzles person in position 6, so the board-games person must be in position 3.

15. Since the person who's hobby is photography is in positions 1, 3, 5, or 6 (rule 5), and we already placed the card-games person in position 4, the photography person can't be in position 4. So, the photography person must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But we already placed the writer in position 3, so the photography person must be in position 1.

16. Since the teacher is not placed yet, they can be in any position except position 1 (since the writer is already there) and position 7 (since the dancing person is already there). Let's place them in position 2 for now.

17. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the teacher (rule 13), the woodworking person can't be in position 2. So, the woodworking person must be in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

| Hobby   |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4      |      5       |      6      |      7      |

Lv4-2x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 7 genres and 7 nationalities, so each row and each column represents a unique combination of genre and nationality.

2. Let's start with the given information that the Spanish is in an odd position (4) and the Polish is also in an odd position (8). This means that both the Spanish and Polish cannot be in the first or last position (1, 7).

3. The Spanish is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies (2). Since the Spanish is not in the first position (2), the disaster movies cannot be in the first position either. So, disaster movies are in positions 2, 4, or 6.

4. The person watching thriller movies is in the middle (3), so thriller movies are in position 3. Since the Spanish is not in the first position and the thriller movies are in the middle, the Spanish cannot be in position 3. So, the Spanish is in positions 2, 4, or 6 but not in position 3.

5. The thriller movies are on the right of the Chinese (12), so the Chinese is not in positions 2, 4, or 6. The Chinese must be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.

6. The person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right (9), so epic movies are in positions 1 or 7. Since the Spanish is not in the first position and the Chinese is not in positions 2, 4, or 6, the epic movies cannot be in position 7. So, epic movies are in position 1.

7. The Australian is on the left of the person watching epic movies (7), so the Australian is in positions 2, 4, or 6. Since the Spanish is not in the first position and the Chinese is not in positions 2, 4, or 6, the Australian cannot be in position 2. So, the Australian is in positions 4 or 6.

8. The person watching drama movies is on the left of the Australian (5), so drama movies are in positions 1, 3, or 5. Since the Spanish is not in the first position and the Chinese is not in positions 2, 4, or 6, the drama movies cannot be in position 5. So, drama movies are in positions 1 or 3.

9. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies (6), so horror movies are in positions 1, 3, or 5. Since the Spanish is not in the first position and the Chinese is not in positions 2, 4, or 6, the horror movies cannot be in position 5. So, horror movies are in positions 1 or 3.

10. The mexican is on the far left or far right (10), so the Mexican is in positions 1 or 7. Since the Spanish is not in the first position and the Chinese is not in positions 2, 4, or 6, the Mexican cannot be in position 7. So, the Mexican is in position 1.

11. The person watching action movies is on the left of the British (11), so action movies are in positions 2, 4, or 6. Since the Spanish is not in the first position and the Chinese is not in positions 2, 4, or 6, the action movies cannot be in position 2. So, action movies are in positions 4 or 6.

12. The only remaining position for the British is position 5.

13. The only remaining genre for position 2 is romance.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv4-2x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of punk is on the right of the person eating pepper, and the person eating pepper is on the far left, the fan of punk must be on the far right. Let's place the fan of punk in position 7.

2. The person eating zucchini is the fan of d&b, so we place the zucchini in position 2.

3. The fan of r&b is between the fan of d&b (zucchini) and the person eating raspberry. Since the fan of punk is on the far right, the only available position for raspberry is position 5. So, the fan of r&b is in position 3 or 4. Let's place the fan of r&b in position 3 (eating kale) for now.

4. The fan of classical is on the left or right of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of r&b is in position 3, the fan of classical can only be in position 1 or 5. But the fan of classical is in an odd position, so it must be in position 1.

5. The person eating broccoli is between the person eating pumpkin and the person eating raspberry. Since raspberry is in position 5 and the fan of punk is in position 7, the only available position for pumpkin is position 4. So, the person eating broccoli must be in position 6.

6. The person eating kale is the fan of r&b, which we placed in position 3. So, the person eating kale is in position 3.

7. The person eating pepper is the fan of jazz. Since the fan of punk is in position 7 and the person eating pepper must be on the far left, the only available position for pepper is position 1.

8. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the fan of r&b, so zucchini must be in position 4.

9. The fan of salsa is in the middle, so it must be in position 6.

10. The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the fan of salsa, so pumpkin must be in position 5.

11. The person eating broccoli is in an even position, but we already placed it in position 6. This contradicts the given condition, so we need to adjust our placement of the fan of r&b. Let's move the fan of r&b to position 4 (eating raspberry), and the fan of classical to position 5 (eating broccoli).

12. The person eating kale is the fan of r&b, which is now in position 4.

13. The person eating pepper is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed it in position 1, it must be on the far left.

14. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the fan of r&b, so zucchini must be in position 4.

15. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the fan of r&b, which is now in position 4. This condition is already satisfied.

16. The fan of salsa is in position 6.

17. The person eating pumpkin is in position 5.

Lv4-2x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 music genres and 7 sports, so each row and each column will have one unique item.

2. From rule 1, we know that the fan of indie is on the left of the fan of salsa. Let's place them in the first and second columns of a row, say row 1. So, the first row looks like this: [Indie, Salsa, _, _, _, _, _].

3. From rule 7, we know that the fan of indie is on the far left or far right. Since it's already in the first position, it must be on the far right in another row. Let's place it in the last column of row 7: [_, _, _, _, _, _, Indie].

4. From rule 8, we know that the fan of rock is the person who's sport is surfing. Since surfing is in the middle of the rows (rule 11), and we already placed surfing's fan in the 7th row (rule 3), rock must be in the 5th row. So, the 5th row looks like this: [_, _, Rock, _, _, _, _].

5. From rule 12, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is the fan of pop. Since pop can't be in the first or last column (rule 7), and it can't be in an even position (rule 9), it must be in the 3rd column of an odd row. The only odd rows left are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th. Since tennis can't be in the same row as indie (rule 12), it can't be in the 1st or 5th row. So, it must be in the 3rd row: [_, Pop, _, _, _, _, _].

6. From rule 10, we know that the person who's sport is golf is on the right of the fan of salsa. Since salsa is in the 2nd column, golf must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 6th column of any row. The only available spots for golf are the 4th column of the 2nd row and the 6th column of the 4th row. Since golf can't be in the same row as tennis (rule 3), it must be in the 4th row: [_, _, Pop, Golf, _, _, _].

7. From rule 6, we know that the fan of pop is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since volleyball can't be in the first or last column (rule 7), and it can't be in an even position (rule 9), it must be in the 3rd column of an odd row. The only odd rows left are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th. Since pop is already in the 3rd row, volleyball can't be in the 1st or 5th row. So, it must be in the 5th row: [_, _, _, _, Volleyball, _, _].

8. From rule 4, we know that the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since tennis is in the 3rd column of the 3rd row, folk can't be in the same row or column as tennis. So, folk must be in the 2nd row: [Folk, _, _, _, _, _, _].

9. From rule 3, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since golf is in the 4th column of the 4th row, swimming can't be in the same column. It can't be in the first or last column (rule 7), and it can't be in an even position (rule 9). The only available spots for swimming are the 2nd column of the 2nd row and the 4th column of the 6th row. Since swimming can't be in the same row as tennis (rule 3), it must be in the 6th row: [_, _, _, _, _, Swimming, _].

10. From rule 13, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the fan of salsa. Since salsa is in the 2nd column, climbing must be in the 1st column of any row. The only available spot for climbing is the 1st column of the 2nd row: [Climbing, Folk, _, _, _, _, _].

11. The only remaining spot is the 6th column of the 1st row. Since we already placed indie in the 7th column of the 7th row, the only music genre left is ambient. So, the 1st row looks like this: [Ambient, _, _, _, _, _, _].

12. The only remaining sports are biathlon and surfing. Since surfing is already in the 5th row, biathlon must be in the 1st row: [Ambient, Biathlon, _, _, _, _, _].

Now, let's place the sports in the remaining spots:
- The person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the fan of salsa. So, the 2nd row looks like this: [Climbing, Folk, Tennis, _, _, _, _].
- The person who's sport is golf is on the right of the fan of salsa. So, the 4th row looks like this: [_, _, Pop, Golf, Swimming, _, _].
- The person who's sport is surfing is in the middle. So, the 5th row looks like this: [_, _, Rock, _, _, Volleyball, _].

We still have one empty spot in the 6th row: [_, _, _, _, _, Swimming, _]. Since swimming can't be in an even position (rule 9), it must be in the 6th column: [_, _, _, _, Swimming, _, _].

Now, let's place the remaining music genres:
- The fan of r&b is on the far right. So, the 7th row looks like this: [_, _, _, _, _, R&B, _].

We still have one empty spot in the 1st row: [Ambient, Biathlon, _, _, _, _, _]. Since ambient can't be in an even position (rule 9), it must be in the 1st column: [Ambient, Biathlon, _, _, _, _, _].

The only remaining music genre is folk. Since folk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis, it can't be in the 2nd row (since tennis is already there). So, it must be in the 3rd row: [_, Folk, _, _, _, _, _].

Now, the only empty spot is in the 3rd column of the 1st row. The only music genre left is pop. So, the final solution table is:

```

1. Since the person playing rugby is in an odd position (position 1, 3, 5, or 7), and the person drinking 7up is the person playing rugby (11), 7up must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume 7up is in position 1 for now.

2. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking juice (2). If cola is in position 2, then juice must be in position 3, but that would place rugby (7up) in an even position, which contradicts the first assumption. So, cola cannot be in position 2. If cola is in position 3, then juice must be in position 4, which is fine.

3. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person who's sport is handball (3). If badminton is in position 2, then handball must be in position 4, but that would place rugby (7up) in an even position, which contradicts the first assumption. So, badminton cannot be in position 2. If badminton is in position 4, then handball must be in position 1, but that would place rugby (7up) in an even position, which also contradicts the first assumption. So, badminton cannot be in position 4 either. Therefore, badminton must be in position 5, and handball must be in position 6.

4. The person who's sport is rugby is on the left or right of the person drinking juice (4). Since rugby (7up) is in position 1, it must be on the right of juice (4). So, juice must be in position 2.

5. The person drinking coffee is in an even position (6). So, coffee must be in position 6.

6. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (7). So, hot-chocolate must be in position 5.

7. The person who's sport is parkour is in the middle (5). So, parkour is in position 5.

8. The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton (9). So, fanta must be in position 2.

9. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta (10). Since parkour is in position 5, it cannot be on the left of fanta (2), so it must be on the right of fanta (3).

10. The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person drinking coffee (13). So, basketball must be in position 7.

11. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking coffee (14). So, coffee must be in position 6, which is already occupied by coffee. This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that 7up is in position 1 was incorrect. Let's try position 3 instead.

12. Repeating step 4, the person drinking juice must be in position 2.

13. Repeating step 5, the person drinking coffee must be in position 6.

14. Repeating step 6, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 5.

15. Repeating step 7, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 4.

16. Repeating step 8, the person playing parkour must be in position 3.

17. Repeating step 9, the person drinking fanta must be in position 1.

18. Repeating step 10, the person playing badminton must be in position 7.

19. Repeating step 11, the person playing rugby (7up) must be in position 5.

20. Repeating step 12, the person playing handball must be in position 6.

21. Repeating step 13, the person playing basketball must be in position 4.

22. Repeating step 14, the person drinking 7up must be on the left of the person drinking coffee, so it must be in position 4.

23. Repeating step 15, the person playing golf must be in position 2.

1. Since the security-guard is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket, and the security-guard is on the far left or far right, the security-guard must be either in the first or the seventh position. Let's assume the security-guard is in the first position (S1). This means the person who's sport is cricket (C) must be in the second, fourth, or sixth position.

2. The person who's sport is biathlon (B) is between the person who's sport is cycling (Cy) and the fisherman (F). Since the fisherman is in an odd position, and the cyclist can't be in the first position (because the security-guard is there), the cyclist must be in the third position. This means the biathlete is in the fourth position, and the fisherman is in the fifth position.

3. The person who's sport is surfing (S) is on the left of the doctor (D). Since the doctor can't be in the first position (because the security-guard is there), the doctor must be in the second, fourth, or sixth position. Let's assume the doctor is in the second position. This means the surfer is in the first position.

4. The person who's sport is baseball (Ba) is in an odd position. Since the surfer, doctor, biathlete, fisherman, and cyclist are all accounted for, the baseball player must be in the third position.

5. The entrepreneur (E) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the security-guard is in the first position (S1), the entrepreneur can't be in the first or seventh position. Also, the entrepreneur is between the software-developer (SD) and the person who's sport is cricket (C). This means the entrepreneur must be in the fifth position, and the cricket player (C) must be in the sixth position.

6. The police-officer (P) is the person who's sport is biathlon (B).

7. The software-developer (SD) is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing (S). Since the surfer is in the first position, the software-developer must be in the second position.

8. The entrepreneur (E) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket (C). Since the entrepreneur is in the fifth position, the cricket player must be in the sixth position. This means the entrepreneur is on the right of the cricket player.

9. The person who's sport is basketball (Bk) is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon (B). Since the biathlete is in the fourth position, the basketball player must be in the seventh position.

1. Since the house fan is in an even position (4, 6, or 2), and it's not on the far left (house can't be in position 1 due to rule 9), it must be in position 4.

2. The house fan is to the right of the mouse owner. So, the mouse owner must be in position 3.

3. The rock fan is to the left of the house fan, so rock must be in position 2.

4. The ferret owner is to the left or right of the r&b fan (position 5 or 7). Since the house fan is to the right of the mouse owner, the ferret owner can't be in position 3, so the ferret owner must be in position 7.

5. The trance fan is between the r&b fan and the cat owner. Since the r&b fan is the fish owner (rule 12), the cat owner must be to the right of the fish owner (r&b), so the cat owner must be in position 6. Therefore, the trance fan must be in position 5.

6. The hamster owner is on the far left or far right. Since we already have the house, rock, r&b, trance, and cat in their positions, the only available positions for the hamster are 1 and 7. However, the hamster owner can't be in position 7 because the ferret owner is there (rule 4). So, the hamster owner must be in position 1.

7. The country fan is on the left or right of the frog owner. Since the house fan is in position 4, the country fan can't be in position 3 (because of rule 10). So, the country fan must be in position 2, and the frog owner must be in position 6.

8. The rabbit owner is on the left or right of the frog owner. Since the country fan is in position 2, the rabbit owner can't be in position 1 (because of rule 7). So, the rabbit owner must be in position 3.

9. The funk fan is in an even position. Since all the even positions are already taken, the funk fan must be in position 8.
