Lv4-3x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies, movie genres, and sports are different for each person, so we can fill in the first condition (different hobbies, genres, and sports) in the table.

2. From point 11, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is the person watching scientific movies and is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. So, we can place the person watching scientific movies in the last column and the person who's hobby is writing in the second to last column. Let's place them as follows:

   |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |
   | Hobby         |            |          |         |            |             |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |          |         |            |             |
   | Sport         |            |          |         |            |             |
   |              | writing    | scientific|         |            |             |

3. From point 10, we know that the person watching scientific movies is the person who's sport is volleyball. So, we can place volleyball in the last row. Let's place it as follows:

   |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |
   | Hobby         |            |          |         |            |             |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |          |         |            |             |
   | Sport         |            |          | volleyball|            |             |

4. From point 12, we know that the person who's sport is golf is in an odd position (4 or 5). Since volleyball is already in position 5, golf must be in position 4. Let's place it as follows:

   |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |
   | Hobby         |            |          |         |   golf     |             |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |          |         |           |             |
   | Sport         |            |          | volleyball|           |             |

5. From point 9, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since biathlon is not placed yet, soccer must be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, since the person who's hobby is writing is in position 2 and the person who's sport is golf is in position 4, soccer cannot be in position 2 or 4. So, soccer must be in position 1 or 3. Let's try placing it in position 1 first:

   |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

   | Sport         |           |          | volleyball|           |             |

6. From point 8, we know that the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since soccer is in position 1, family movies cannot be in position 2. So, family movies must be in position 3 or 5. Let's try placing it in position 3:

   |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

   | Sport         |           |          | volleyball|           |             |

7. From point 7, we know that the person watching comedy movies is on the far left. So, comedy movies must be in position 1. Let's place it as follows:

   |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

   | Sport         |           |          |         |           |             |

8. From point 6, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since comedy is in position 1 and writing is in position 2, fantasy movies must be in position 2. Let's place it as follows:

   |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

9. From point 4, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is between the person watching adventure movies and the person who's hobby is writing. Since volleyball is in position 5 and writing is in position 2, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 3. Let's place it as follows:

   |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

10. From point 3, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is the person who's sport is basketball. Since we don't have basketball in the table yet, let's place it in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, since soccer is in position 1, basketball cannot be in position 1. So, basketball must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Let's try placing it in position 2:

    |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

11. From point 2, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is in an even position. Since we have already placed basketball in position 2, reading must be in position 4. Let's place it as follows:

    |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

52. From point 8, we know that the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since we have already placed basketball in position 2, family movies cannot be in position 2. So, family movies must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, since we have already placed comedy in position 1, soccer in position 1, and golf in position 5, family movies cannot be in position 1, 2, or 5. So, family movies must be in position 3 or 4. Let's try placing it in position 3:

    |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

53. From point 6, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we have already placed basketball in position 1, fantasy movies must be in position 2. Let's place it as follows:

    |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

54. From point 1, we know that the person watching adventure movies is the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since we have already placed fantasy movies in position 2, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 3. Let's place it as follows:

    |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

55. From point 4, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is between the person watching adventure movies and the person who's hobby is writing. Since we have already placed adventure movies in position 3 and writing in position 2, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 4. Let's place it as follows:

    |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

56. From point 12, we know that the person who's sport is golf is in an odd position. Since we have already placed volleyball in position 4, golf must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, since we have already placed basketball in position 1, soccer in position 2, and volleyball in position 4, golf cannot be in position 1, 2, or 4. So, golf must be in position 3 or 5. But we have already placed writing in position 2, so golf must be in position 5. Let's place it as follows:

    |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

57. From point 9, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we don't have biathlon in the table yet, let's place it in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since we have already placed golf in position 5, soccer cannot be in position 5. So, soccer must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's try placing it in position 1:

    |               |     1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |      5      |

Lv4-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is in an odd position (4), it can't be in position 1, 2, or 5. So, it must be in position 3.

2. The software-developer is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's sport is swimming. Since the software-developer is in position 3 (from point 1), the person who's sport is golf must be in position 1 and the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 5.

3. The software-developer is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the software-developer is in position 3, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in position 4.

4. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is in position 4, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 2 and the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 3.

5. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the police-officer. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3, the police-officer must be in position 1 (far left, as stated in point 8).

6. The person who's hobby is collecting is in the middle. Since the police-officer is in position 1 and the person who's sport is swimming is in position 5, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 2.

7. The architect is the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is in position 4, the architect must be in position 2.

8. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is in position 3 and the person who's sport is swimming is in position 5, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 4.

9. The scientist is between the person who's sport is water-polo and the person who's sport is handball. Since the person who's sport is water-polo is in position 4 and the person who's sport is swimming is in position 5, the scientist must be in position 5.

10. The person who's sport is handball must be in position 1, as it's the only remaining position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-3x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking fanta is the person who's sport is swimming. Let's place them in the 5th column and 2nd row (since there are 5 sports and 5 beverages). So, Fanta is in the 5th column and Swimming is in the 2nd row.

2. The person driving the helicopter is the person who's sport is golf. Since the person driving the helicopter can't be in the middle (because the person drinking lemonade is in the middle), the person driving the helicopter must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th row. However, since the person driving the helicopter is not the person drinking water (from rule 4), the person driving the helicopter can't be in the 5th row. So, the person driving the helicopter is in the 1st or 3rd row. Let's place Golf in the 1st row for now.

3. The person drinking lemonade is in the middle. Since we know Fanta is in the 5th column and Golf is not in the 5th row, the only possible position for Lemonade is the 3rd column and 3rd row.

4. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since we know Fanta, Lemonade, and Golf are placed, the only possible positions for Cola are the 1st, 2nd, or 4th column. However, since Cola can't be in the 5th column (because the person drinking water must be in an even position, and the 5th column is odd), Cola can't be in the 1st or 5th column. So, Cola is in the 4th column. But this means the person drinking water must be in the 2nd column.

5. The person drinking cola is between the person driving the helicopter and the person drinking water. Since we know Cola is in the 4th column and Golf is in the 1st column, the person drinking water must be in the 3rd column.

6. The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right. Since we know Fanta, Lemonade, Golf, Cola, and Water are placed, the only possible positions for Subway are the 1st or 5th column. However, since the person driving the subway is also the person playing basketball (from rule 11), and Basketball is on the far right (from rule 8), the person driving the subway must be in the 5th column.

7. The person driving the tram is the person drinking iced-tea. Since we know Fanta, Lemonade, Golf, Cola, Water, and Subway are placed, the only possible position for Iced-Tea is the 2nd column.

8. The person driving the taxi is between the person driving the helicopter and the person driving the tram. Since we know Golf is in the 1st row and Tram is in the 3rd row, the person driving the taxi must be in the 2nd row.

9. The person who's sport is skateboarding is in an even position. Since we know Fanta, Lemonade, Golf, Cola, Water, Subway, and Tram are placed, the only possible position for Skateboarding is the 4th row.

10. Now we can place the sports. Since Basketball is the person driving the subway (in the 5th column), Skateboarding must be in the 4th column (since it's in an even position). Rugby can't be in the 1st or 5th column (since Fanta, Lemonade, Golf, Cola, and Water are already placed), so Rugby must be in the 2nd or 4th column. Since Skateboarding is in the 4th row, Rugby can't be in the 4th row. So, Rugby is in the 2nd row. This means Basketball is in the 5th row. Since Swimming is in the 2nd row, Golf is in the 1st row, and Cola is in the 4th row, Rugby must be in the 2nd column. This means Basketball is in the 4th column. Since Skateboarding is in the 4th row, and it's not in the 4th column, it must be in the 3rd row. This means Swimming is in the 3rd column.

Here is the final solution table:

9. The owner of the mouse is in an even position. The only even positions left are 2 and 4. Since the mouse can't be next to the cat (rule 4), the mouse must be in position 4.

Lv4-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, each with a different nationality, music genre preference, and mode of transport. Let's assign a number to each nationality, genre, and transport for easier reference.

   Nationalities: 1 - American, 2 - Brazilian, 3 - Italian, 4 - Malaysian, 5 - Russian
   Genres: a - d&b, b - indie, c - jazz, d - techno, e - trance
   Transports: f - airplane, g - scooter, h - ship, i - snowmobile, j - train

2. From point 11, the Russian (5) is the fan of techno (e).

3. From point 4, the Malaysian (4) is the fan of trance (e).

4. From point 5, the person driving the snowmobile (i) is between the person driving the airplane (f) and the fan of trance (4). This means the snowmobile can't be in position 1, 5, or 6. So, the possible positions for the snowmobile are 2, 3, 4, or 7. Since the fan of indie (b) is in the middle (position 3), the snowmobile can't be in position 3. So, the snowmobile is either in position 2, 4, or 7.

   Let's assume the snowmobile is in position 2. This means the airplane is in position 1 and the fan of trance is in position 3. Now, the fan of indie (b) must be in position 5, and the fan of jazz (c) must be in position 6 or 7 (since the fan of trance is in position 3 and the fan of indie is in position 5). However, this arrangement violates point 2, as the fan of jazz is not on the left or right of the fan of trance. So, the snowmobile can't be in position 2.

   Let's try another arrangement: the snowmobile is in position 4. This means the airplane is in position 1, the fan of trance is in position 2, and the fan of indie is in position 3. The fan of jazz (c) can be in position 5 or 6, and the fan of d&b (a) can be in position 7. This arrangement satisfies all conditions.

5. Now that we have the positions for the snowmobile, airplane, fan of trance, and fan of indie, we can place the fan of jazz (c) in position 6 (since the fan of jazz can't be in position 5 due to point 2).

6. The fan of d&b (a) must be in position 7, as all other positions are occupied.

7. From point 7, the American is on the left of the Brazilian. Since the American (1) is in position 7, the Brazilian (2) must be in position 6.

8. From point 8, the Italian is on the right of the airplane (f). Since the airplane is in position 1, the Italian (3) must be in position 5.

9. From point 9, the Russian (5) is on the far right. Since the fan of techno (5) is in position 7, the Russian can't be in position 7. So, the Russian must be in position 5.

10. From point 10, the Italian (3) is on the left of the airplane (f). Since the airplane is in position 1 and the Italian is in position 5, the Italian can't be in position 4. So, the Italian must be in position 5.

11. Now, the only remaining position for the Brazilian (2) is position 6.

Lv4-3x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person with the hobby of puzzles is in an odd position and is to the right of the person who does biathlon. Let's assume the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 from left to right. So, the person with the hobby of puzzles can only be in position 1, 3, or 5.

2. The person watching action movies is the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles can't be in position 1 (because of rule 1), the person watching action movies must be in position 1. So, the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 1, and the sport of the person in position 1 is biathlon (since the person with the hobby of puzzles is to the right of the person who does biathlon).

3. Now, the person with the hobby of puzzles can only be in position 3 or 5. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in an odd position and can't be in position 1 (because the person watching action movies is there), the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 5. So, the person with the hobby of martial-arts is in position 5, and the sport of the person in position 5 is snowboarding (since the person with the hobby of puzzles is to the left or right of the person who does parkour, and the person watching martial-arts movies can't be in position 1 or 3 because of rules 1 and 2).

4. The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles can't be in position 1 (because of rule 1), the person with the hobby of reading must be in position 2. So, the person with the hobby of reading is in position 2, and the sport of the person in position 2 is rowing (since the person with the hobby of reading is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming).

5. The person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles can't be in position 1 (because of rule 1), the person watching thriller movies must be in position 4. So, the person with the hobby of thriller is in position 4, and the sport of the person in position 4 is parkour.

6. The person with the hobby of hiking is on the far right. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles can't be in position 1 (because of rule 1), the person with the hobby of hiking must be in position 5. So, the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 5, and the sport of the person in position 3 (which is the only remaining sport) is swimming.

7. Now we have the following table:

   |               |      1       |    2     |      3       |    4     |    5     |

   | Sport         | biathlon    | rowing   | swimming    | parkour   | snowboard |

8. The person watching martial-arts movies is in an odd position and can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because of rules 1, 3, and 5). So, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 2. This means the movie-genre of the person in position 2 is martial-arts. So, the final table is:

   |               |      1       |    2     |      3       |    4     |    5     |

Lv4-3x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking water is on the left or right of the fan of ambient, and the fan of hip-hop is on the far right, water cannot be in the far right position. So, water must be in the first or second position.

2. The person driving the roller is in an odd position, so it cannot be in the first or last position. Since the fan of blues is the person driving the roller, blues cannot be in the far right position. So, blues must be in the second, third, or fifth position.

3. The person driving the bike is on the right of the fan of ambient, and the fan of salsa is the person driving the bike. Since water is already in the first or second position, salsa cannot be in the first position. So, salsa must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position.

4. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since water is in the first or second position, and salsa is not in the first position, lemonade must be in the third position. So, soy-milk must be in the fourth or fifth position.

5. The person drinking water is on the far left or far right. Since water is already in the first or second position, it must be in the first position.

6. The person drinking lemonade is in the middle, so it must be in the third position.

7. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person drinking coffee. Since water is in the first position, coffee must be in the second, fourth, or fifth position. But since the fan of blues is in the second, third, or fifth position, coffee cannot be in the second position. So, coffee must be in the fourth or fifth position.

8. The fan of hip-hop is on the far right, so it must be in the fifth position.

9. The person driving the tram is on the far left or far right. Since water is in the first position, the tram cannot be in the first position. So, the tram must be in the fifth position.

10. The fan of pop is on the left or right of the person driving the tram. Since the tram is in the fifth position, the fan of pop can be in the second, third, or fourth position.

11. The person driving the roller is in an odd position, so it must be in the third position. Since the fan of blues is the person driving the roller, blues must be in the third position.

12. The only remaining position for the fan of pop is the second position.

13. The only remaining position for coffee is the fourth position.

14. The only remaining position for soy-milk is the fifth position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the freelancer is on the far left, so we can place them in the first column. Let's put them in the first row for now.

   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Hobby | | | | |
   | Job  | | | | |
   | Music | | | | |

2. The fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of techno, so the fan of r&b must be in the second column. Since the freelancer is a fan of r&b, we can place the fan of techno in the third column.

   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Hobby | | | | |
   | Job  | | | | |

3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is between the entrepreneur and the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the freelancer is the entrepreneur's left neighbor, the rock-climber must be in the second row and the sudoku person must be in the fourth row.

4. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the journalist. Since the rock-climber is in the second row, the journalist must be in the fifth row. The fan of blues cannot be in the first or fifth column because of the conditions about even positions and far left/right positions. So, the fan of blues must be in the third column.

   |   | 1 (Freelancer) | 2 (r&b) | 3 (Blues) | 4 (Sudoku) | 5 (Journalist) |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Hobby | | Rock-climbing | Blues | | Sudoku |
   | Job  | | Entrepreneur | | | |

Lv4-3x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of metal drinks almond-milk, so let's place it in the first column under beverages.
2. The fan of jazz owns a rabbit, so we place the rabbit in the fifth position under pets and the fan of jazz in the corresponding position under music-genres. Since the fan of reggae is in an odd position, the fan of jazz cannot be in the first or third position, so it must be in the second or fourth position. Let's place it in the fourth position for now.
3. The owner of the goat drinks fanta, so we place the goat in the third position under pets and fanta in the corresponding position under beverages. Since the owner of the goat is on the far left or far right, it cannot be in the second or fourth position, so it must be in the first or third position. Let's place it in the first position for now.
4. The owner of the frog is to the left of the fan of disco. Since the fan of disco drinks cola, the frog must be in the first, second, or fourth position. The owner of the rabbit is in an odd position and on the far left or far right, so it cannot be in the first position. Therefore, the frog must be in the second position, and the fan of disco in the third position.
5. The owner of the cat drinks cola, so we place the cat in the fifth position under pets and cola in the corresponding position under beverages. Since the owner of the cat is the person drinking cola, it must be in the fifth position.
6. The fan of reggae is in an odd position, so it must be in the first, third, or fifth position. Since the fan of jazz and the owner of the cat are already in the first, third, and fifth positions, the fan of reggae must be in the second position.
7. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the fan of disco is drinking cola and the fan of reggae is in the second position, the owner of the rabbit must be in the fourth position.
8. The owner of the goat is on the far left or far right. Since it is already in the first position, it must be in the fifth position. However, this contradicts the fact that the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, as the person drinking mirinda is in the second position. This puzzle has an inconsistency and cannot be solved with the given information.

Final solution table (with the inconsistency):

Lv4-3x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person watching comedy movies cannot be in the first or last position (since the dog owner is on the left or right of them and the dog owner is not in the first or last position). So, the person watching comedy movies is either 2 or 4.

2. Since the mechanic is on the right of the owner of the rat, the mechanic cannot be in the first position. So, the mechanic is either 2, 3, or 4.

3. The journalist is in the middle, so the journalist is in position 3.

4. The person watching satire movies is the scientist. Since the scientist cannot be in the first position (as the journalist is in the middle), the scientist is either 2, 4, or 5.

5. The person watching western movies is the security-guard, so the security-guard is in position 5.

6. The owner of the dog is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is either 2 or 4, the dog owner is either 1 or 2. But we know the mechanic is on the right of the owner of the rat, so the owner of the rat cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the dog owner is 1 and the person watching comedy movies is 2.

7. The owner of the chinchilla is in an odd position. Since we know the positions of the dog owner, journalist, and security-guard, the only odd position left is 3.

8. The owner of the dog is between the person watching documentary movies and the owner of the chinchilla. Since the dog owner is 1 and the chinchilla owner is 3, the person watching documentary movies must be 2.

9. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla owner is 3, the hedgehog owner can be either 2 or 4. But we know the mechanic is on the right of the owner of the rat, so the owner of the rat cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the owner of the hedgehog is 2 and the owner of the rat is 5.

10. The only job left for position 4 is the electrician.

11. The scientist is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since the scientist is in position 2 and the goldfish owner must be odd (as the chinchilla owner is 3), the goldfish owner is 1.
