Lv4-1x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Russian is in an odd position and there are 4 nationalities, the Russian must be in either the 1st or 3rd position.

2. The Turkish is between the German and the Russian. If the Russian were in the 1st position, there would be no nationality to the left of the Turkish, which contradicts the given information. So, the Russian must be in the 3rd position.

3. Now, we know the Russian is in the 3rd position and the Turkish is to the right of the German. This means the Turkish must be in the 4th position.

4. The only remaining nationality is the German. Since the German is not in the 1st position (because the Russian is there), the German must be in the 1st position.

The final solution table is:

```

|  1   |   2    |    3    |  4   |
| German|        | Russian| Turkish|

Lv4-1x4-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person eating avocado is on the left of the person eating potato. This means that avocado cannot be in position 4, and potato cannot be in position 1. So, we can fill in the positions for avocado and potato as follows:

   |        |   1    |    2    |   3    |   4   |
   | Food   | Avocado|         | Potato |       |

2. The person eating banana is in an odd position. Since we already placed avocado and potato, the only odd positions left are 1 and 3. However, since the person eating banana is on the left or right of the person eating avocado, banana cannot be in position 1. So, banana must be in position 3.

   |        |   1    |    2    |   3    |   4   |
   | Food   | Avocado| Banana  | Potato |       |

3. Now, the person eating banana is on the left or right of the person eating avocado. Since banana is in position 3, avocado must be in position 2.

   |        |   1    |    2    |   3    |   4   |
   | Food   | Avocado| Banana  | Potato |       |

4. The only food left is lemon. Since avocado is in position 2 and potato is in position 4, lemon must be in position 1.

   |        |   1    |    2    |   3    |   4   |
   | Food   | Lemon  | Avocado| Banana  | Potato |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-1x4-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people watching 4 different genres, so they must be in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. The person watching drama movies is in an odd position, so it can only be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

3. If drama is in position 1, then zombie must be in position 2 (since it's to the left or right of drama) and martial-arts must be in position 4 (since it's not to the left of drama). This leaves position 3 for mystery. But this violates rule 3, as mystery is between zombie and martial-arts, which is not possible in this arrangement.

4. So, let's try assuming drama is in position 3 instead. This means zombie is in position 2 and martial-arts is in position 4. This leaves position 1 for mystery. Now, mystery is between zombie and martial-arts, which satisfies rule 3.

5. Finally, we have one genre left, which is mystery. Since it's not between any other genres, it must be in the remaining position, which is position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |   1   |   2    |    3    |      4       |

Lv4-1x4-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the sports are different, we can't have two of the same sport in the same row. So, we know that each column represents a unique sport.

2. From rule 2, the person who prefers soccer must be in an even position. Since there are only 4 positions, the person who prefers soccer must be in position 2 or 4.

3. If soccer is in position 2, then according to rule 3, weightlifting must be in position 1 (left of baseball) or position 3 (right of baseball). But if weightlifting is in position 1, then soccer can't be in position 2 because rule 2 states that soccer is in an even position. So, weightlifting can't be in position 1. Therefore, weightlifting must be in position 3 (right of baseball).

4. Now, we know that soccer is in position 4 and weightlifting is in position 3. So, baseball must be in position 1 (left of soccer) or position 2 (left of weightlifting). But if baseball is in position 1, then according to rule 3, snowboarding must be in position 2 (between baseball and weightlifting), which contradicts the fact that soccer is in position 4. So, baseball can't be in position 1. Therefore, baseball must be in position 2 (left of weightlifting).

5. Now, we know that baseball is in position 2, soccer is in position 4, and weightlifting is in position 3. So, snowboarding must be in position 1 (left of baseball).

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |      1       |    2     |       3       |   4    |

Lv4-1x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and they prefer 4 different sports, each sport will be assigned to one person.

2. The person who prefers handball is in position 4 (an even position). So, let's place handball in the last position (position 4).

3. The person who prefers sailing is to the right of the person who prefers handball. So, let's place sailing in position 3.

4. Now, the person who prefers lacrosse is either to the left or right of the person who prefers sailing. Since there are only two positions left (1 and 2), and we need to place 4 different sports in 4 positions, lacrosse must be in one of the remaining positions. Let's place lacrosse in position 1 for now.

5. Now, the last sport, water-polo, is left. It cannot be in position 4 (handball is already there), and it cannot be in position 3 (sailing is already there). So, it must be in position 2.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-1x4-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the Chinese is on the far right, we know that the nationalities must be arranged as follows: ______ Chinese.

2. The Chinese is on the left or right of the Thai. If the Thai were on the far left, the Chinese would have to be on the far right, which contradicts the first point. So, the Thai must be in the second or third position. Let's consider the Thai in the second position for now: ______ Thai _ Chinese.

3. The Colombian is in an odd position. Since we have already placed two nationalities, the Colombian must be in the third position: ______ Thai _ Colombian _ Chinese.

4. Now, we have three nationalities placed, and the fourth one must be Brazilian. The only remaining position is the first one: Brazilian _ Thai _ Colombian _ Chinese.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-1x4-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The writer is in an odd position, so they cannot be in position 1 or 4. This means they must be in either position 2 or 3.

2. Since the writer is in an odd position, the analyst cannot be on the left of the writer (as the leftmost position is even). So, the analyst must be in position 3 or 4.

3. The firefighter is between the analyst and the dressmaker. If the analyst is in position 3, then the firefighter must be in position 2, and the dressmaker in position 1. But this arrangement violates the rule that the writer is in an odd position (position 1 is even). So, the analyst must be in position 4.

4. Now we know the analyst is in position 4, and the writer is not in position 1. So, the writer must be in position 2.

5. The firefighter is between the analyst and the dressmaker. Since the analyst is in position 4, the firefighter must be in position 3.

6. Finally, the dressmaker is the only one left, so they must be in position 1.

The final solution table is:

Lv4-1x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the entrepreneur is in an even position (4), the entrepreneur must be in position 4. So, we know that the entrepreneur is a freelancer or a fisherman, as those are the only jobs left for the last position.

2. The freelancer is on the right of the entrepreneur, so the freelancer must be in position 3. This means the freelancer's job is known.

3. Now, the chef is on the right of the freelancer, so the chef must be in position 2. This means the chef's job is known.

4. Now we are left with position 1. Since the entrepreneur is not a chef or a freelancer, the entrepreneur must be a fisherman. This means the only job left for position 1 is the chef.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-1x4-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 4 different music-genres: d&b, disco, folk, rock.

2. From point 3, we know that the fan of d&b is in an odd position. Since there are 4 genres and odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5, d&b cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, d&b must be in position 3.

3. From point 2, we know that the fan of d&b is between the fan of disco and the fan of folk. Since d&b is in position 3, disco must be in position 1 or 2, and folk must be in position 4 or 5.

4. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different music-genres, so if disco is in position 1, then rock must be in position 5. But this would mean that d&b is not between disco and folk, which contradicts point 2. So, disco must be in position 2.

5. Now we know that disco is in position 2 and d&b is in position 3. This means that folk must be in position 4 because if it were in position 5, d&b would not be between disco and folk.

6. Finally, this leaves rock in position 1.

Lv4-1x4-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the hobbies are different, we can list them in any order. Let's start with the hobby that must be in an even position (baking). Since there are 5 positions, the only even position is the middle one (position 3). So, baking goes in position 3.

2. The photography hobby must be between baking and traveling. Since baking is in position 3, photography must be either in position 2 or 4. If photography were in position 2, it would violate rule 3 (sudoku would have to be in position 1, but then there would be no room for traveling). So, photography must be in position 4.

3. Now we know that photography is in position 4, and baking is in position 3. This means that traveling must be in an adjacent position, either 1 or 5. However, if traveling were in position 1, it would violate rule 1 (sudoku would have to be in position 2, but then there would be no room for photography). So, traveling must be in position 5.

4. Now we know that traveling is in position 5, and photography is in position 4. This means that sudoku must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, or 3). Since sudoku must be to the left or right of traveling, it can't be in position 1. So, sudoku must be in either position 2 or 3.

5. If sudoku were in position 2, it would violate rule 2 (photography would be in position 4, and there would be no hobby between baking and traveling). So, sudoku must be in position 3.

The final solution table is:
