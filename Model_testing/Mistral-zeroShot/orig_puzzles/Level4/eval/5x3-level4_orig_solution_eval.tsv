Lv4-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The bus is on the far left (row 4, column 1).
2. The taxi driver is the librarian (row 5, column 1).
3. Since the librarian is the taxi driver and the bus is on the far left, the taxi driver cannot be on the far left, so they must be in the middle (row 3 or row 5). However, the librarian cannot be in row 3 because the person with the hobby of rock-climbing is in an even position (row 3 or row 6), and the librarian cannot be next to the person watching documentary movies (from rule 3). So, the librarian is in row 5.
4. The person with the hobby of traveling is to the right of the taxi driver (rule 1). Since the taxi driver is in row 5, the person with the hobby of traveling is in row 6.
5. The person with the hobby of rock-climbing is in an even position (row 3 or row 6). Since the librarian and the person with the hobby of traveling are already placed, the person with the hobby of rock-climbing must be in row 3.
6. The scientist is on the right of the mexican (rule 7). Since the mexican cannot be in the far left (rule 4), the mexican must be in row 2 or row 4. If the mexican is in row 2, the scientist would have to be in row 1, but the scientist watches scientific movies (rule 8), and there's no space left for the person watching documentary movies (rule 3). So, the mexican is in row 4. The scientist is in row 6.
7. The person watching documentary movies must be in an odd position (row 1, 3, or 5). Since the librarian, the person with the hobby of traveling, the person with the hobby of rock-climbing, the mexican, and the scientist are already placed, the person watching documentary movies must be in row 1.
8. The chinese is on the far left (rule 4), so they are in row 1.
9. The nationality of the person in row 2 is either chinese, italian, or mexican. Since the mexican and the chinese are already placed, the person in row 2 must be italian.
10. The job of the person in row 3 is either journalist or scientist. Since the scientist is already placed, the person in row 3 must be a journalist.
11. The movie genre of the person in row 6 is either disaster, documentary, or scientific. Since the person watching documentary movies is already placed, the person in row 6 must be watching either disaster or scientific movies. Since the scientist is already watching scientific movies (rule 8), the person in row 6 must be watching disaster movies.

The final solution table is:

The table is not complete because we don't have enough information to fill in the remaining cells. However, we have placed all the people and their hobbies, jobs, nationalities, and means of transport according to the given rules."	{'hobby': ['traveling'], 'job': [''], 'movie-genre': [''], 'nationality': [''], 'transport': ['']}	True	0	False
Lv4-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 columns.

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          |             |          |             |
| Hobby         |             |          |             |
| Job           |             |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   |             |          |             |
| Nationality   |             |          |             |

2. The American is on the far right, so Nationality column 3 is American.

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          |             |          | American    |
| Hobby         |             |          |             |

| Movie-Genre   |             |          |             |
| Nationality   |             |          | Nigerian    |

3. The person who's hobby is fishing is the person watching sports movies. Since the American is not watching sports movies, it must be either person 1 or 2. Let's assume person 1 is fishing. So, Hobby 1 is fishing, and Movie-Genre 1 is sports.

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | Lemon      | Orange   | American    |

| Nationality   |             |          | Nigerian    |

4. The person eating lemon is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. So, Food 2 must be lemon.

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | Lemon      | Lemon    | American    |

| Nationality   |             |          | Nigerian    |

5. The nigerian is in an even position. Since we already placed the American on the right, the Nigerian must be on the left. So, Nationality 1 is Nigerian.

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | Lemon      | Lemon    | American    |
| Hobby         | Fishing    | Gardening |             |
| Job           |             |          |             |

| Nationality   | Nigerian   |           | American    |

6. The person who's hobby is gardening is the person eating orange. So, Food 1 is orange.

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | Orange     | Lemon    | American    |
| Hobby         | Fishing    | Gardening |             |
| Job           |             |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports     |           |             |
| Nationality   | Nigerian   |           | American    |

7. The pilot is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the American is not watching comedy movies, the pilot must be either person 1 or 3. Let's assume person 3 is a pilot.

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | Orange     | Lemon    | Pilot       |
| Hobby         | Fishing    | Gardening |             |
| Job           |             |          | Pilot       |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports     |           | Comedy      |
| Nationality   | Nigerian   |           | American    |

8. The person watching sports movies is between the person eating orange and the mechanic. Since the mechanic is not person 3 (pilot), it must be person 2.

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | Orange     | Sports   | Pilot       |
| Hobby         | Fishing    | Gardening |             |
| Job           | Mechanic   |          | Pilot       |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports     | Comedy   | Comedy      |
| Nationality   | Nigerian   | American | American    |

9. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person watching comedy movies. Since we already placed the American watching comedy movies, the hobby of person 1 must be woodworking.

|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | Orange     | Sports   | Pilot       |

| Nationality   | Nigerian   | American | American    |

Now we have filled all the columns with the given conditions. The final solution table is:

Lv4-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different items for each category, so we can fill in the categories with their respective items.

   |               |    1    |      2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | fanta | iced-tea |
   | Food          | grapes | kiwi | plum |
   | Hobby         | baking | camping | magic-tricks |
   | Nationality   | australian | british | japanese |
   | Transport     | bike | boat | ship |

2. Now let's apply the given conditions:

   - The japanese is on the far right, so Japanese goes in the 3rd column.
   - The person driving the bike is on the right of the person eating kiwi. Since the bike is in the 2nd row and kiwi is in the 2nd column, the person eating kiwi must be in the 1st column. So, grapes goes in the 1st row.
   - The person drinking fanta is on the far left, so fanta goes in the 1st column.
   - The person eating grapes is the person driving the bike, so grapes and bike are in the same row, and grapes is in the 1st column, so bike goes in the 1st row.
   - The australian is on the left or right of the japanese. Since the japanese is in the 3rd column, the australian can be in the 2nd or 3rd column. However, the person driving the bike (which is the australian) is in the 1st row, so the australian cannot be in the 3rd column (as it would violate the condition that the japanese is in an odd position). Therefore, the australian must be in the 2nd column.
   - The japanese is in an odd position. Since the japanese is in the 3rd column, the conditions are satisfied.
   - The person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since almond-milk is in the 1st column, the person drinking almond-milk cannot be in the 1st or 3rd column. So, the person who's hobby is baking can be in the 1st or 3rd column. However, the person who's hobby is baking is in an odd position, and the only odd position left for the person who's hobby is baking is the 1st column. So, baking goes in the 1st row.
   - The person who's hobby is baking is in an odd position. Since baking is in the 1st row, the conditions are satisfied.
   - The person driving the boat is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person drinking fanta. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in the 3rd row and the person drinking fanta is in the 1st row, the person driving the boat can be in the 2nd row. However, the only available spot in the 2nd row is between baking and camping. But baking is the hobby of the person drinking almond-milk, and we already placed almond-milk in the 1st column. So, this condition cannot be satisfied with the current arrangement.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a contradiction in the given conditions, and it's not possible to arrange the table according to the given conditions.

The final solution table would be:

#############
| Beverage      | fanta | almond-milk | iced-tea |
| Food          | grapes | kiwi | plum |
| Hobby         | baking | camping | magic-tricks |
| Nationality   | australian | british | japanese |
| Transport     | bike | boat | ship |
#############

However, the condition about the boat's position cannot be satisfied with this arrangement."	{'beverage': ['fanta', 'almond-milk', 'iced-tea'], 'food': ['grapes', 'kiwi', 'plum'], 'hobby': ['baking', 'camping', 'magic-tricks'], 'nationality': ['australian', 'british', 'japanese'], 'transport': ['bike', 'boat', 'ship']}	True	9	False
Lv4-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the quad-bike driver watches fantasy movies, so let's place them in the second position (Fantasy is in the middle, and odd positions are 1, 3, 5).

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Food |   | Fantasy |   |
   | Job  |   |   |   |
   | Movie-Genre |   |   |   |
   | Sport |   |   |   |
   | Transport |   |   |   |

2. The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies, so pineapple goes in the first position.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Pineapple | Fantasy |   |
   | Job  |   |   |   |
   | Movie-Genre |   |   |   |
   | Sport |   |   |   |
   | Transport |   |   |   |

3. The entrepreneur is on the far right, so they go in the third position.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Pineapple | Fantasy | Entrepreneur |
   | Job  |   |   |   |
   | Movie-Genre |   |   |   |
   | Sport |   |   |   |
   | Transport |   |   |   |

4. The police-officer is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since we don't know the position of surfing yet, we can't place the police-officer yet.

5. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the quad-bike driver is already in the second position, the snowmobile driver can't be in the first or third position. So, the snowmobile driver can only be in the second position, but that's where the quad-bike driver is. This creates a contradiction, so there must be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we ignore the contradiction and assume that the snowmobile driver is in the second position, we can continue:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Pineapple | Fantasy | Entrepreneur |
   | Job  |   | Police-officer |   |
   | Movie-Genre |   |   |   |
   | Sport |   |   |   |
   | Transport | Snowmobile |   |   |

6. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we don't know the position of volleyball yet, we can't place the bus yet.

7. The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position. Since the quad-bike driver is already in the second position, the quad-bike driver must have been incorrectly placed. If we move the quad-bike driver to the first position, the puzzle becomes solvable:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Quad-bike (Fantasy) | Pineapple | Entrepreneur |
   | Job  |   |   |   |
   | Movie-Genre |   |   |   |
   | Sport |   |   |   |
   | Transport |   |   |   |

8. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the quad-bike driver is now in the first position, the snowmobile driver can be in the second or third position. Let's place the snowmobile driver in the third position for now:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Quad-bike (Fantasy) | Pineapple | Snowmobile |
   | Job  |   |   |   |

   | Sport |   |   |   |
   | Transport | Bus |   |   |

9. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the snowmobile driver is in the third position, the bus driver can be in the first or second position. Let's place the bus driver in the first position:

   |---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Bus (Volleyball) | Quad-bike (Fantasy) | Snowmobile |

   | Transport |   |   |   |

10. The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple. Since the bus driver is in the first position, the adventure movie watcher can be in the second or third position. Let's place the adventure movie watcher in the second position:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Bus (Volleyball) | Adventure | Quad-bike (Fantasy) |

   | Transport | Bus (Volleyball) |   |   |

12. The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the police-officer. Since the entrepreneur is in the third position, the police-officer must be in the second position. The only sport left is surfing, so it must be in the first position:

   | Transport | Bus (Volleyball) |   |   |

14. The person who's sport is volleyball is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person eating artichoke. Since the quad-bike driver is in the second position and the artichoke eater is not yet placed, the volleyball player must be in the third position:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |

16. The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple. Since the artichoke eater is in the first position, the epic movie watcher can be in the second or third position. Let's place the epic movie watcher in the second position:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|

   | Movie-Genre | Epic |   |   |
   | Sport | Surfing | Rowing | Volleyball |
   | Transport | Bus (Volleyball) |   |   |

18. The person watching fantasy movies is the person driving the quad-bike, so the quad-bike driver is correctly placed in the third position:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Pineapple | Adventure | Quad-bike (Fantasy) |

The final solution table is:

   | Transport | Bus (Volleyball) |   |   |

However, this solution contains a contradiction as well, since the snowmobile driver is placed in the first position, which is also the position of the bus driver. This contradicts the initial statement that the snowmobile driver is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. The puzzle seems to have an inconsistency."	{}	False	0	False
Lv4-5x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the handball player is on the far left, so let's place the handball player in the first column (Column 1).

2. Since the bartender is not the handball player and is to the left of the rowing person, the bartender must be in the third position (Column 3).

3. The social-worker cannot be in the first or third column because the handball player and bartender are already there. So, the social-worker must be in the second column (Column 2).

4. The fisherman is left, so he must be in the first or third column. Since the first column is occupied by the handball player, the fisherman must be in the third column (Column 3).

5. Now, the fisherman is a job, and we know that the bartender is between the social-worker and the person watching epic movies. So, the person watching epic movies must be in the second column (Column 2).

6. The genre of the person watching epic movies is known, so let's place the western movie fan in the first column (Column 1) because the handball player is watching superhero movies (as per point 5 and 6).

7. The genre of the person watching superhero movies is known, so let's place the superhero movie fan in the second column (Column 2) between the social-worker and the person watching epic movies (as per point 6).

8. The genre of the person watching country music is known, so let's place the country music fan in the third column (Column 3) because the bartender is a fan of ambient music (as per point 4).

9. The hobby of the person in the first column (handball player) is not known yet, but we know that the person in the third column (fisherman) is not a collector (as per point 4). So, the hobby of the handball player must be either dancing or magic-tricks. Since the hobby of the person in the second column (social-worker) is not dancing (as per point 7), the handball player's hobby must be magic-tricks.

10. Now, the hobby of the person in the second column (social-worker) is not known yet, but we know that the person in the third column (fisherman) is not a collector (as per point 4). Also, the person in the first column (handball player) has a hobby of magic-tricks. So, the social-worker's hobby must be either collecting or dancing. Since the person in the first column (handball player) is not a collector (as per point 4), the social-worker's hobby must be dancing.

11. Finally, the hobby of the person in the third column (fisherman) is not known yet, but we know that the person in the first column (handball player) has a hobby of magic-tricks and the person in the second column (social-worker) has a hobby of dancing. So, the fisherman's hobby must be collecting.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv4-5x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the airplane is on the far right, so let's place it in the rightmost cell of the Transport column.

   | Transport     |           |             |          |

2. The fan of soul is on the far left, so let's place it in the leftmost cell of the Music-Genre column.

   |               |     1     |      2      |    3     |

   | Transport     |           |             |          |

3. Since the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse, and the fan of soul is on the far left, we can place the person watching drama movies in the second cell of the Movie-Genre column and the person playing lacrosse in the third cell of the Sport column.

   |               |     1     |      2      |    3     |

   | Transport     |           |            |          |

4. The person who's hobby is board-games is in an even position. Since we have already placed 3 people in the first, second, and third positions of the Hobby column, the person with the hobby of board-games must be in the fourth position. However, there are no empty cells left, so we need to move someone to the fourth position. Let's move the person watching scientific movies to the fourth position of the Movie-Genre column.

   |               |     1     |      2      |    3     |

   | Transport     |           |            |          |

5. The fan of rock is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person driving the airplane is on the far right, the person driving the snowmobile must be in the second cell of the Transport column. Let's place the fan of rock in the second cell of the Music-Genre column and the person driving the snowmobile in the second cell of the Transport column.

   |               |     1     |      2      |    3     |

   | Transport     | Motorbike |            |          |

6. The person who's hobby is camping is not yet placed. Since the person with the hobby of board-games is in an even position, the person with the hobby of camping must be in an odd position. The only odd positions left are the first and third positions of the Hobby column. Since the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku (which we haven't placed yet), the person with the hobby of camping must be in the third position of the Hobby column. Let's place the person with the hobby of camping in the third position of the Hobby column and the person with the hobby of sudoku in the first position of the Hobby column.

   |               |     1     |      2      |    3     |

   | Transport     | Motorbike |            | Snowmobile|

7. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku, so our placement is correct.

8. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of r&b is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis, our placement is correct.

9. The fan of r&b is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis, so our placement is correct.

Lv4-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Let's place the taxi driver in the middle (position 2) and the jet-ski driver in either position 1 or 3.

2. The person who's sport is swimming is the engineer. Since the engineer can't be in position 1 (as per point 3), let's place the swimmer in position 3 (as per point 6, the swimmer can't be on the far right, so the jet-ski driver must be in position 1).

3. Now, the person driving the jet-ski is the person in position 1. Since the person eating broccoli is the person doing snowboarding (point 5), and the person doing snowboarding is on the far right (point 6), the person eating broccoli must be in position 3.

4. The owner of the horse is the person eating broccoli (point 8), so the horse owner is in position 3.

5. The person eating radish is in an even position (point 4), so the person eating radish is either in position 2 or 4. Since the person driving the tram is on the right of the owner of the goldfish (point 9), the goldfish owner must be in position 2. Therefore, the person eating radish must be in position 4.

6. The person eating eggplant is the paramedic (point 7), so the paramedic is in position 1.

7. The jobs are engineer, paramedic, software-developer. Since the engineer is in position 3, the paramedic is in position 1, and the person in position 2 owns the goldfish, the software-developer must be in position 2.

8. The sports are cricket, snowboarding, swimming. Since the swimmer is in position 3, the person doing cricket must be in position 1 (as the sport is not snowboarding or swimming). The person doing snowboarding is in position 3. The person doing swimming is in position 2 (as the software-developer is in position 2).

9. The pets are goldfish, guinea-pig, horse. Since the goldfish owner is in position 2, the guinea-pig owner must be in position 1 (as the paramedic is in position 1). The horse owner is the person eating broccoli, so the horse is in position 3.

10. The transports are jet-ski, taxi, tram. Since the taxi driver is in position 2 and the jet-ski driver is in position 1, the tram driver must be in position 3.

Lv4-5x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating kiwi is in an odd position and there are 3 people, they must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, since the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person eating watermelon, the person eating kiwi can't be in position 1 (as it would leave no room for the person eating watermelon on the right). So, the person eating kiwi is either in position 3 or 5.

2. The person watching spy movies is on the right of the person eating watermelon, so the person eating watermelon must be in position 2.

3. The person watching spy movies is on the right of the brazilian, so the brazilian must be in position 1.

4. The fan of funk is between the person watching epic movies and the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person watching epic movies is on the far left (position 1), the fan of funk can't be in position 1 or 3 (as there's no room for the person watching epic movies on their left). So, the fan of funk is in position 2 or 4. But since the fan of funk is between the person watching epic movies and the person who's sport is basketball, the fan of funk must be in position 4. This means the person watching epic movies is in position 1 and the person playing basketball is in position 3.

5. The person watching spy movies is between the person watching animation movies and the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person watching animation movies is on the far left (position 1), the person watching spy movies must be in position 2. The person who's sport is snowboarding must be in position 3 (as there's no other position left).

6. The italian is on the right of the person watching spy movies, so the italian is in position 3.

7. The person watching animation movies must be in position 5 (as there's no other position left).

8. The remaining person, who is a fan of metal and plays climbing, must be in position 4.

Lv4-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 8, the fan of indie is on the far left, so we can place Indie in the first column of the Music-Genre row.

2. Since the electrician is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting, and the person who's sport is basketball is the electrician (point 4), the person who's sport is weightlifting must be on the far right. So, we can place Weightlifting in the third column of the Sport row.

3. Now, the person watching romance movies is between the person who's sport is basketball and the person who's hobby is collecting (point 3). Since the person who's sport is basketball is the electrician (point 4), the person watching romance movies must be to the left of the electrician and to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Given that the electrician is on the far right, the only possible position for the person watching romance movies is the second column. So, we can place Romance in the second column of the Movie-Genre row.

4. The person who's sport is basketball is the person watching scientific movies (point 6), but we already know that the person watching romance movies is between the person who's sport is basketball and the person who's hobby is collecting. This contradicts point 6, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it stands.

Assuming the error is in point 6, let's continue:

5. The designer is in an even position (point 5). Since we have already placed three elements in the rows, the designer must be in the first, second, or third column of the Job row. However, the electrician is on the far right, so the designer cannot be in the third column. Therefore, the designer must be in the first or second column of the Job row.

6. Since the fan of dubstep is the person watching romance movies (point 1), and we have already placed Romance in the second column of the Movie-Genre row, the fan of dubstep must be in the first column. So, we can place Dubstep in the first column of the Music-Genre row.

7. The person who's sport is basketball is the person who's hobby is singing (point 7). Since we have already placed Singing as the hobby of the person in the third column, the person who's sport is basketball must be in the first or second column. However, the electrician is on the far right, so the person who's sport is basketball cannot be in the first column. Therefore, the person who's sport is basketball must be in the second column. So, we can place Basketball in the second column of the Sport row.

8. The only remaining hobby is collecting. Since the designer is not in the third column (point 5), the person who's hobby is collecting must be in the third column. So, we can place Collecting in the third column of the Hobby row.

9. The only remaining job is the police-officer. Since the designer is in an even position (point 5), the police-officer must be in the first column. So, we can place Police-Officer in the first column of the Job row.

1. We know that the board-games person is to the right of the rat owner. So, let's place the rat owner in the first position (1) and the board-games person in the third position (3).

2. The puzzles person watches superhero movies, so the superhero movie fan cannot be in the first or third position (1, 3) because the rat owner and board-games person are already there. The superhero movie fan must be in an even position (2 or 4). Since the r&b fan is in an odd position (3), the superhero movie fan must be in position 2. So, the puzzles person is in position 4.

3. The r&b fan is to the left of the puzzles person, so the r&b fan must be in position 1.

4. The folk fan is to the left of the documentary movie fan, so the documentary movie fan cannot be in the first or third position (1, 3). The documentary movie fan must be in an even position (2 or 4). Since the superhero movie fan is in position 2, the documentary movie fan must be in position 4. So, the folk fan is in position 1.

5. The water-polo player is to the right of the folk fan, so the water-polo player cannot be in the first or third position (1, 3). The water-polo player must be in an even position (2 or 4). Since the superhero movie fan is in position 2 and the documentary movie fan is in position 4, the water-polo player must be in position 2.

6. The gardening person is not yet placed. Since the rat owner and board-games person are already placed, the gardening person cannot be in the first or third position (1, 3). The gardening person must be in an even position (2 or 4). Since the superhero movie fan, puzzles person, r&b fan, folk fan, and water-polo player are already placed, the gardening person must be in position 2.

7. The pet owners are also not yet placed. Since the rat owner is in position 1, the mouse owner cannot be in position 1. The mouse owner must be in position 3. Since the board-games person is in position 3, the pet of the board-games person must be the goldfish (since the rat is already taken by the rat owner and the mouse is taken by the mouse owner). So, the goldfish is in position 3.

8. Since the rat is taken by the rat owner and the mouse is taken by the mouse owner, the pet of the gardening person must be the mouse (since the goldfish and rat are already taken). So, the mouse is in position 2.
