Lv4-1x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the Japanese is between the German and the Canadian. Let's assume the order is German-Japanese-Canadian.

2. From rule 2, the Mexican is on the right of the Brazilian. So, the possible positions for Brazilian are 1, 3, 5, or 7. But since the Brazilian is in an odd position (rule 7), it can only be in positions 1, 3, or 7. Let's assume the Brazilian is in position 3 for now.

3. From rule 4, the Mexican is in the middle. So, the Mexican must be in position 4. This means the Brazilian is not in position 3, so it must be in position 1 or 7. But since the Brazilian is in an odd position (rule 7), it must be in position 1.

4. Now, the Italian is on the left of the Russian (rule 3), so the possible positions for the Italian are 2, 4, or 6. But since the Italian is not in an odd position (not specified in the rules, but we can deduce this from the positions of the other nationalities), it cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the Italian must be in position 2 or 6. But since the Italian is on the left of the Russian (rule 3), the Italian cannot be in position 6. So, the Italian is in position 2.

5. The Canadian is in an odd position (rule 5), so it cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 6. So, the Canadian must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the Canadian is to the left of the Japanese (rule 6), it cannot be in position 5. So, the Canadian is either in position 1 or 3. But since the Canadian is in an odd position (rule 5), it must be in position 1.

6. Now, the only remaining position for the Japanese is position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |  6   |  7   |
#############
| Brazilian| Italian|   _  | Mexican| Japanese|   _  |   _  |
```

We still need to fill in the gaps. Since the Mexican is in the middle (rule 4), the Italian cannot be in position 6. So, the Italian is in position 2. Since the Canadian is to the left of the Japanese (rule 6), the Canadian cannot be in position 5. So, the Canadian is in position 1. Now, the only remaining position for the Brazilian is position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |  6   |  7   |
#############
| Brazilian| Italian| Canadian| Mexican| Japanese|   _  |   _  |
```

We still have two empty spaces. Since the Mexican is in the middle (rule 4), the remaining nationalities must be on the left of the Mexican. But the only nationality left is the Russian, and the Russian is on the right of the Italian (rule 3). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the rules of the puzzle."	{}	False	0	False
Lv4-1x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since snowboarding is on the far left, we can place it in the first position.
2. Since golf is in an even position, it cannot be in the first position (as it would be odd), so it must be in the second position. This means sailing must be in the third position, as it is to the left of golf.
3. Since snowboarding is to the left of badminton, badminton cannot be in the first position. Let's assume it's in the second, third, or fourth position. If it were in the second position, soccer would have to be in the first position, which contradicts the fact that soccer is to the left or right of badminton. If it were in the third position, climbing would have to be in the fourth position, which contradicts the fact that climbing is to the right of soccer. So, badminton must be in the fourth position. This means soccer is in the fifth position, and climbing is in the sixth position (as it is to the right of soccer).
4. Since soccer is in the fifth position, the positions are now even, so golf is still in the second position.
5. Since climbing is in the sixth position, volleyball must be in the seventh position, as it is the only sport left.
6. Since soccer is in the fifth position and is to the left or right of badminton, badminton must be in the third position. This means soccer is in the sixth position, and the final arrangement is as follows:

|         |       Snowboarding     |      Golf     |    Sailing    |     Badminton    |     Soccer     |    Climbing    |     Volleyball    |

Lv4-1x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, we know the paramedic is in an even position. Since there are 7 jobs and an even number, the paramedic must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, if the paramedic were in position 2, the videographer would have to be in position 1, which contradicts rule 1. So, the paramedic cannot be in position 2. If the paramedic were in position 6, the videographer would have to be in position 5, which also contradicts rule 1. Therefore, the paramedic must be in position 4.

2. Now we know the paramedic is in position 4. This means the videographer is in position 5.

3. From rule 1, we know the paramedic is to the right of the videographer, so the firefighter cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. The firefighter cannot be in position 6 or 7 because of rule 8. So, the firefighter must be in position 5.

4. Since the firefighter is in position 5, the software-developer must be in position 3.

5. From rule 5, we know the pilot is to the left of the firefighter, so the pilot cannot be in position 6 or 7. The pilot cannot be in position 1 or 2 because of rule 3 (the musician is to the left or right of the pilot). So, the pilot must be in position 4.

6. From rule 3, we know the musician is to the left or right of the pilot. Since the pilot is in position 4, the musician cannot be in position 1 or 7. The musician also cannot be in position 6 because of rule 8 (the firefighter is to the left of the software-developer, and the software-developer is in position 3). So, the musician must be in position 2.

7. The only job left is the teacher. Since the paramedic is in position 4, the teacher must be in position 6.

8. Finally, the last job is the videographer, who is in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-1x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the sports are arranged in a line and there are 7 different sports, the positions are numbered from 1 to 7.

2. From rule 3, the person who's sport is ice-hockey (#5) must be in an even position. So, the possible positions for ice-hockey are 2, 4, or 6.

3. From rule 4, the person who's sport is ice-hockey (#5) is on the left of the person who's sport is golf (#6). So, ice-hockey can only be in position 2 or 4.

4. From rule 7, the person who's sport is golf (#6) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (#5). Since we know ice-hockey is in position 2, golf can be in position 1 or 3.

5. From rule 1, the person who's sport is cycling (#1) is on the far left or far right. Since golf is already on the left, cycling must be on the far right.

6. From rule 5, the person who's sport is tennis (#7) is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling (#1). So, tennis must be in position 3.

7. From rule 8, the person who's sport is lacrosse (#4) is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis (#3).

8. From rule 2, the person who's sport is swimming (#5) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse (#4). Since we know lacrosse is in position 4, swimming can be in position 2 or 6.

9. From rule 6, the person who's sport is ice-hockey (#5) is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer (#6). Since we know ice-hockey is in position 2, soccer must be in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |    1    |   2    |    3     |    4     |   5    |     6      |  7   |

Lv4-1x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person drinking lemonade is in an even position, so it can't be in the first or seventh position.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left, so it must be in the first position.
3. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since lemonade can't be in the first position, mirinda must be in the second position.
4. The person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right. Since iced-tea and mirinda are already in the first and second positions, sprite can't be in the first position. So, sprite must be in the seventh position.
5. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking lemonade, and neither can be in the first position. So, fanta must be in the sixth position.
6. The person drinking milk can't be in the first or seventh position because those are already taken. It also can't be in the second position because sprite is there. So, milk must be in the third position.
7. Now, we have filled 3, 4, 5, and 6 with milk, water, fanta, and sprite respectively. The only remaining beverage is iced-tea, which must be in the first position.

Lv4-1x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the basketball player is in the middle, we know that sports 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are on the left and right of the basketball player.

2. The water-polo player is on the far left or far right. Since the rugby player is on the far left, water-polo cannot be on the far left, so it must be on the far right.

3. The ice-hockey player is on the left or right of the parkour player. Since we know the positions of basketball, rugby, and water-polo, and there are only 4 remaining spots, the only possible position for ice-hockey is the second position from the left (since it cannot be on the far left due to water-polo being on the far right). This means parkour must be in the third position.

4. Now, the water-polo player is in the seventh position (far right).

5. The volleyball player is on the left or right of the snowboarding player. Since we know the positions of basketball, rugby, water-polo, ice-hockey, and parkour, the only possible positions for volleyball and snowboarding are the first and sixth positions. Since volleyball is on the left or right of basketball, it must be in the first position, and snowboarding must be in the sixth position.

6. The volleyball player is on the left or right of the basketball player. But we already placed volleyball in the first position, so basketball must be in the fifth position.

7. The rugby player is on the far left, so it must be in the first position.

8. Now, we know the positions of all sports except for parkour. Since water-polo is in the seventh position, and it is on the right of the ice-hockey player (second position), the only remaining position for parkour is the third position.

3. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since soy-milk can't be in position 1 (as it's an odd position and there's no beverage before it), let's place soy-milk in position 5.

4. The person drinking water is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking tea. Since water can't be in position 6 (as it's an odd position and there's no beverage after it), let's place lemonade in position 6 and water in position 5.

Lv4-1x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the horse is in position 1 (it owns itself), so we can fill that in.

| Pet   | horse    |       |            |        |        |      |       |

2. The fish is either to the left or right of the horse. Since we already have the horse in position 1, the fish can only be in position 2 or 3. Let's try both possibilities:

   Case 1: Fish in position 2:
   |       |    1     |   2   |     3      |   4    |   5    |  6   |   7   |

   | Pet   | horse    |       |   fish     |        |        |      |       |

3. Now, the rabbit is to the left or right of the fish. In both cases, the rabbit can only be in position 4, 5, or 6. Let's try each position for both fish cases:

   Case 1 (Fish in position 2):
   - Rabbit in position 4: This violates rule 5 (rabbit is to the right of fish), so it can't be here.
   - Rabbit in position 5: This violates rule 6 (rabbit is to the left of fish), so it can't be here.
   - Rabbit in position 6: This is a valid placement.

   Case 2 (Fish in position 3):
   - Rabbit in position 4: This violates rule 6 (rabbit is to the left of fish), so it can't be here.
   - Rabbit in position 5: This is a valid placement.
   - Rabbit in position 6: This violates rule 5 (rabbit is to the right of fish), so it can't be here.

   So, the rabbit can be in position 5 in Case 1 or position 6 in Case 2.

4. Now, we know the rabbit's position, and we can place the pets that are to the left or right of the rabbit. Since the lizard is to the left or right of the rabbit, it can only be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's try each position:

   - Lizard in position 1: This violates rule 8 (chinchilla is to the left or right of the lizard), so it can't be here.
   - Lizard in position 2: This is a valid placement.
   - Lizard in position 3: This violates rule 8 (chinchilla is to the left or right of the lizard), so it can't be here.

5. Now, we know the lizard's position, and we can place the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla is to the left or right of the lizard, it can only be in position 1, 2, or 4. Let's try each position:

   - Chinchilla in position 1: This violates rule 4 (snake is to the left of the chinchilla), so it can't be here.
   - Chinchilla in position 2: This is a valid placement.
   - Chinchilla in position 4: This violates rule 8 (chinchilla is to the left or right of the lizard), so it can't be here.

6. Now, we know the chinchilla's position, and we can place the snake. Since the snake is to the left of the chinchilla, it can only be in position 3.

7. The goldfish and the lizard are the remaining pets. Since the goldfish is not mentioned in any rule, we can place it in any empty position. Let's try placing it in position 6:

|       |    1     |   2   |     3      |   4    |   5    |  6   |   7   |
| Pet   | horse    | fish  |   snake    | rabbit | lizard | gold |       |

8. The lizard is the only pet left, and it can only be in position 7.

Lv4-1x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of r&b is on the right of the fan of classical, and the fan of gospel is on the far left, we can place gospel in the first position and r&b in the last position (7th).

2. The fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of funk and the fan of funk is in the middle. So, funk must be in the 3rd position. Since soul can be on the left or right of funk, we'll place it in the 4th position for now.

3. The fan of classical is in an even position. Since we've placed gospel (1st), funk (3rd), and r&b (7th), the only even positions left are the 2nd and 6th. However, the fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of indie, so classical can't be in the 2nd position. Therefore, classical must be in the 6th position.

4. Now, the fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of classical. Since classical is in the 6th position, soul can only be in the 5th position.

5. The fan of indie is to the right of the fan of gospel. Since gospel is in the 1st position, indie must be in the 2nd position.

6. The only genre left is folk. Since it's not specified where it should be, we can place it in the remaining position, which is the 4th.

So, the final solution table is:
