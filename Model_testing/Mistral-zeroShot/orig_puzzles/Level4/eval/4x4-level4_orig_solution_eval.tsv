Lv4-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of d&b, and they both prefer different music genres, we can place them in columns 1 and 2, with ambient in column 1 (A) and d&b in column 2 (D).

2. The person eating banana is in an even position and cannot be in column 1 (since it's occupied by the fan of ambient), so they must be in column 2 (D) or column 4 (E). However, since the fan of d&b is already in column 2, the person eating banana must be in column 4 (E). Also, the person eating banana is the owner of the rat, so we can write 'R' in cell E4.

3. Now we know that the person eating banana is in column 4, so the person eating carrot (M) must be in column 1 (A).

4. The brazilian is on the left of the fan of funk, so the brazilian must be in column 1 (A). Since the mexican is the person eating carrot, the mexican must be in column 3 (C). So, we can write 'B' in cell A1 (Brazilian) and 'M' in cell C3 (Mexican).

5. The pakistani is on the right of the person eating lettuce, so the pakistani must be in column 2 (D) or column 4 (E). Since the fan of d&b is already in column 2, the pakistani must be in column 4 (E). Also, the pakistani is not a pet owner, so we can write 'P' in cell E4 (Pakistani).

6. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person eating cabbage, so the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 1 (A) or column 2 (D). Since the fan of ambient is already in column 1, the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 2 (D). Also, the owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the rat and the fan of techno, so the fan of techno must be in column 3 (C). So, we can write 'C' in cell C3 (Techno) and 'Ch' in cell D2 (Chinchilla).

7. The fan of funk is the person eating lettuce, so we can write 'F' in cell E3 (Funk) and 'L' in cell E1 (Lettuce).

8. The owner of the horse is in an even position, so they must be in column 2 (D) or column 4 (E). Since the fan of d&b, the pakistani, and the owner of the chinchilla are already in column 2, the owner of the horse must be in column 4 (E). So, we can write 'H' in cell E4 (Horse).

9. Now we have filled all the nationalities, music genres, and pets. The food is the only remaining variable. Since we know the owners of the rat, chinchilla, and horse, we can deduce that the person eating cabbage must be eating cabbage (C). So, we can write 'C' in cell A2 (Cabbage).

10. Finally, since there are only four different types of food and we have filled three of them, the person eating the remaining food (lettuce) must be eating lettuce (L). So, we can write 'L' in cell C1 (Lettuce).

The final solution table is:

|               |    1    |     2     |     3      |     4     |

Lv4-4x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and an even position is the 2nd and 4th positions, the hobby of woodworking can be in positions 2 or 4. Let's assume it's in position 2 for now.

2. The Indian cannot be in position 1 because the Indian is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing, and the person in position 1 (hobby) is woodworking, which is not a climbing sport. So, the Indian must be in position 3.

3. The person eating kale cannot be in position 1 because it's an odd position, and the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person eating kale. So, the person eating kale must be in position 4.

4. The person eating kale is in position 4, so the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 3.

5. The person eating eggplant is the Colombian, so the Colombian must be in position 1.

6. The Colombian is on the left or right of the Mexican. Since the Indian is in position 3 and the Colombian is in position 1, the Mexican can only be in position 2 or 4. But the Mexican is the person who's hobby is drawing, and we assumed the hobby of woodworking is in position 2. So, the Mexican must be in position 4.

7. The person eating peas cannot be in position 1 because it's an odd position, and the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person eating peas. So, the person eating peas must be in position 3.

8. The Spanish cannot be in position 1 because the Spanish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon, and the person in position 1 is the Colombian, who does not do biathlon. So, the Spanish must be in position 2.

9. The person eating carrot must be in position 5 because the person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person eating carrot, and the Mexican is in position 4.

10. The person who's sport is climbing must be in position 6 because the Indian is in position 3 and the person eating eggplant is in position 1.

11. The person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 1 because the Spanish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon, and the Colombian is in position 1.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv4-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the hot-chocolate drinker is on the left or right of the librarian, and the librarian is in an odd position (from rule 8), the hot-chocolate drinker must be in an even position. Let's assume the librarian is in position 3 (odd). Then, the hot-chocolate drinker must be in position 2 (even).

2. The Egyptian is the social-worker (rule 2). Let's place the Egyptian in position 4 (even) since the writer is in an even position (rule 8).

3. The hot-chocolate drinker is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda (rule 3). Since the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 2, the mirinda drinker must be in position 1 or 4. However, the mirinda drinker can't be in position 1 because the writer is the juice drinker (rule 5) and the writer is in an even position (rule 8). So, the mirinda drinker must be in position 4.

4. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position (rule 11). Since we already placed the hot-chocolate drinker in position 2, the librarian must be in position 1.

5. The person drinking juice is the writer (rule 5). Since the writer is in an even position (rule 8), the juice drinker must be in position 4.

6. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the owner of the goat (rule 6). Since the goat owner can't be in position 1 (because the librarian is there), the sprite drinker must be in position 1, and the goat owner must be in position 2.

7. The owner of the dog is the Italian (rule 7). Since the dog owner can't be in position 1 (because the sprite drinker is there), the dog owner must be in position 3.

8. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the British (rule 9). Since the mirinda drinker is in position 4, the British must be in position 2.

9. The only remaining position for the social-worker (Egyptian) is position 3.

10. The only remaining position for the paramedic is position 1.

11. The only remaining position for the social worker is position 3.

Lv4-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, and D, where A is the first row and D is the fourth row.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking fanta (F) is eating corn (C). So, we can place F in the first column and C in the same row.

3. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is sudoku (S) is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games (CG). Since CG is eating corn, S cannot be in the first column. So, S must be in the second or fourth column.

4. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is chess (CHESS) is in an even position. Since S cannot be in the first column, CHESS cannot be in the second row (as it would be an odd position). So, CHESS must be in the third or fourth row.

5. From rule 5, the person drinking iced-tea (IT) is the person who's sport is surfing (SURF). Since we know that CHESS is parkour (from rule 9), SURF cannot be in the first or third row (as it would be next to parkour). So, SURF must be in the second or fourth row.

6. From rule 6, the person doing parkour (PK) is on the left of the person drinking fanta (F). Since F is in the first column, PK must be in the second row.

7. From rule 7, the person drinking water (W) is on the left of the person doing parkour (PK). So, W must be in the first column and second row.

8. From rule 8, the person eating lime (L) is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini (Z). Since W and F are in the first column, L cannot be in the first column. So, L must be in the second or fourth column.

9. From rule 10, the person doing cycling (CYCLING) is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games (CG). Since CG is eating corn (C), CYCLING cannot be in the first row. So, CYCLING must be in the third or fourth row.

10. From rule 11, the person drinking sprite (S) is the person eating zucchini (Z). Since W and PK are in the second row, Z cannot be in the second row. So, Z must be in the third or fourth row.

11. From rule 12, the person eating zucchini (Z) is on the left or right of the person eating corn (C). Since C is in the first row, Z cannot be in the first row. So, Z must be in the third row.

12. Now we know that Z is in the third row, so C must be in the fourth row.

13. Since C is eating corn, F is drinking fanta, W is drinking water, IT is drinking iced-tea, S is doing sudoku, PK is doing parkour, SURF is doing surfing, and CYCLING is doing cycling, we can fill in the table:

    |            |      1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |

Lv4-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left or far right. Let's assume it's on the far left for now (we'll check later if it's on the far right).

2. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person eating spinach. If ice-hockey is on the far left, then rock-climbing must be in the second position (as cricket can't be in the first position due to the ice-hockey condition). So, the table looks like this:

   |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |

3. The manager is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. So, the manager must be in the fourth position.

   |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |

   | Sport   |   cricket   |   ice-hockey |   ?         |   ?       |

4. The librarian is the person eating kiwi (from condition 4). So, the third row becomes:

   |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |

   | Sport   |   cricket   |   ice-hockey |   ?         |   ?       |

5. The bartender is on the left or right of the librarian. Since the librarian is in the third position, the bartender can only be in the first or fourth position. But the bartender eats orange (from condition 7), so the bartender must be in the first position.

   |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |

   | Sport   |   cricket   |   ice-hockey |   ?         |   ?       |

6. The person who's hobby is gardening is in an even position. The only even position left is the second position.

   |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |

   | Sport   |   cricket   |   ice-hockey |   ?         |   ?       |

7. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the librarian (from condition 8). So, the second row becomes:

   |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |

8. The librarian is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (from condition 10). The only person left for the librarian to be on the right of is the person in the fourth position. So, the hobby of the person in the fourth position must be sudoku.

   |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |

   | Sport   |   cricket   |   ice-hockey |   ?         |   ?       |

9. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple. The only person left for the snowboarding person to be on the left or right of is the person in the fourth position (as the bartender and librarians are already placed). So, the person eating pineapple must be the snowboarder.

   |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |

10. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing (from condition 12). But we don't have a person with skiing yet. So, let's assume the person in the first position does skiing.

    |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |

    | Sport   |   cricket   |   ice-hockey |   snowboarding|   skiing    |

11. The manager is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (from condition 3). But we placed the manager in the third position, and the ice-hockey person is in the second position. This contradicts the condition 3.

However, if we assume that ice-hockey is on the far right instead of the far left, then the manager can be in the third position, and the table looks like this:

    |         |      1       |      2       |       3       |     4     |
    | Food    |   skiing    |   librarian  |   manager     |   snowboarder|

    | Sport   |   cricket   |   ice-hockey |   snowboarding|   skiing    |

Now, the manager is in the correct position, and all conditions are satisfied. So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-4x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 items in each category, we can label them A, B, C, D for each category (Beverage, Food, Music-Genre, Nationality).

2. From point 5, the person drinking 7up is in an odd position. So, 7up can't be in position 1 or 4. Let's place 7up in position 3.

3. From point 2, the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since 7up is in position 3, iced-tea must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But from point 10, the Canadian is on the far left or far right, and the Colombian is on the far right. If iced-tea were in position 1, the Canadian would have to be in position 2, which contradicts point 10. So, iced-tea must be in position 4.

4. From point 8, the person drinking iced-tea is the person eating cauliflower. So, Cauliflower is in position 4.

5. From point 1, there are 4 different favourite beverages. We've placed 7up and iced-tea. The remaining beverages must be in positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's try placing lemonade in position 1.

6. From point 6, the fan of gospel is between the German and the fan of dubstep. If lemonade is in position 1, the German must be in position 2 and the fan of dubstep in position 3. But from point 9, the Colombian is on the far right, which means the Nationality in position 4 must be Canadian. But if the German is in position 2, the Canadian can't be in position 4 because of point 8. So, lemonade can't be in position 1.

7. Let's try placing tea in position 1 instead. Now, the German must be in position 2, the fan of dubstep in position 3, the Canadian in position 4, and the Colombian in position 2. But this contradicts point 6 because the fan of gospel would then be between the Colombian and the Canadian, not between the German and the fan of dubstep. So, tea can't be in position 1 either.

8. Let's try placing iced-tea in position 1. Now, the German must be in position 2, the fan of dubstep in position 3, the Canadian in position 4, and the Colombian in position 2. But this contradicts point 6 because the fan of gospel would then be between the Colombian and the Canadian, not between the German and the fan of dubstep. So, iced-tea can't be in position 1 either.

9. The only remaining beverage for position 1 is 7up. So, 7up must be in position 1. Now, the German must be in position 2, the fan of dubstep in position 3, the Canadian in position 4, and the Colombian in position 2. But this contradicts point 6 because the fan of gospel would then be between the Colombian and the Canadian, not between the German and the fan of dubstep. This means our initial assumption that 7up can't be in position 3 was incorrect.

10. Let's try placing 7up in position 2 instead. Now, the German must be in position 3, the fan of dubstep in position 4, the Canadian in position 1, and the Colombian in position 4. This satisfies all conditions.

11. From point 7, the fan of folk is the person eating cauliflower, which is in position 4.

12. From point 4, the person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea is in position 4, lemonade must be in position 1 or 3. But from point 3, the person eating apple is on the right of the person eating artichoke. If lemonade were in position 1, the person eating apple would have to be in position 2, which means the person eating artichoke would have to be in position 3. But this contradicts point 1, as the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. So, lemonade must be in position 3.

13. From point 3, the person eating apple is on the right of the person eating artichoke. So, Artichoke must be in position 2.

14. From point 9, the Colombian is on the far right. So, the Nationality in position 1 must be Canadian.

15. From point 2, the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since 7up is in position 2 and iced-tea is in position 4, 7up must be on the left of iced-tea. So, the person drinking tea must be in position 3.

Lv4-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 4 people, so they will be labeled A, B, C, D from left to right.

2. We know that the genres are different, so each person watches a different genre. Let's assign the genres to the people: A - Drama, B - Scientific, C - Spy, D - Western.

3. We know that the nationalities are different, so each person is from a different nationality. Let's assign the nationalities to the people: A - Dutch, B - Egyptian, C - French, D - Nigerian.

4. We know that the pets are different, so each person has a different pet. Let's assign the pets to the people: A - Ferret, B - Frog, C - Goat, D - Lizard.

5. We know that the transport is different, so each person uses a different means of transport. Let's assign the transports to the people: A - Scooter, B - Skateboard, C - Subway, D - Trike.

6. From point 1, we know that A is watching Western movies, so A cannot be on the far right (10). Therefore, A must be in an even position. Since the ferret owner is in an odd position (12), A cannot be the ferret owner. So, A has a goat (D cannot have a goat because D is Nigerian and the goat is owned by the French, C). So, C has a goat. A has a lizard.

7. Now, A has a lizard and is on the left of the person driving the skateboard (1). Since B is Egyptian and on the right of the person watching spy movies (2), B cannot be the person driving the skateboard. So, B drives the trike. A drives the subway.

8. Since A drives the subway and B drives the trike, point 3 and 8 are satisfied.

9. Since A drives the subway, A cannot be the person driving the scooter (9). So, D drives the scooter.

10. Since D drives the scooter, D cannot be the person driving the skateboard (1). So, B drives the skateboard.

11. Since B drives the skateboard, B cannot be the person driving the subway (11). So, A drives the subway.

12. Since A drives the subway, A cannot be the person driving the trike (8). So, C drives the trike.

13. Since C drives the trike, C cannot be the person driving the scooter (9). So, D drives the scooter.

14. Since D drives the scooter, D cannot be the person driving the skateboard (1). So, B drives the skateboard.

15. Since B drives the skateboard, B cannot be the person driving the subway (11). So, A drives the subway.

16. Since A drives the subway, A cannot be the person driving the trike (8). So, C drives the trike.

17. Now, we have a cycle where we can't place the people anymore because of the constraints. However, we can see that the current arrangement satisfies all the given conditions.

Lv4-4x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The turtle owner is in position 4 (odd position).
2. The dog owner is between the turtle owner and the horse owner (position 2).
3. The American is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles (let's assume the hobby of the person in position 1 is puzzles).
4. The person watching sports movies is in an odd position (position 3 or 4).
5. The Spanish is on the right of the Nigerian (let's assume the nationality of the person in position 3 is Spanish and position 4 is Nigerian).
6. The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing (let's assume the hobby of the person in position 2 is dancing).
7. The horse owner is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles (position 1).
8. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the Australian (let's assume the nationality of the person in position 2 is Australian).
9. The dog owner is between the American and the person watching fantasy movies (position 1 is American, position 2 is Australian, and position 3 is fantasy).
10. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the dog owner (position 2).
11. The person who's hobby is traveling is in an even position (position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
12. The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess (let's assume the hobby of the person in position 3 is chess).

From the above, we can deduce the following:
- Position 1: American (hobby: puzzles), Horse (nationality: not determined yet), Chess (hobby: not determined yet)
- Position 2: Australian (nationality), Dog (pet), Dancing (hobby)
- Position 3: Spanish (nationality), Chess (hobby)
- Position 4: Nigerian (nationality), Turtle (pet)

We know that the hobby of position 1 is puzzles, so the hobby of position 3 must be something other than puzzles. Since there are only 4 hobbies, the hobby of position 3 must be chess.

Now we know that the nationality of position 3 is Spanish, so the nationality of position 4 must be Nigerian.

Since the hobby of position 2 is dancing, the pet of position 2 must be something other than turtle (since the turtle is in position 4). The remaining pets are dog and ferret. Since the dog is in position 2, the pet of position 4 must be a turtle.

Since the hobby of position 1 is puzzles, the pet of position 1 must be something other than horse (since the horse is in position 1). The remaining pets are dog, ferret, and turtle. Since the dog is in position 2, the ferret must be in position 1.

Since the hobby of position 3 is chess, the hobby of position 1 must be something other than chess. The remaining hobbies are dancing, traveling, and sports. Since the hobby of position 2 is dancing, the hobby of position 1 must be traveling.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-4x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and we have 12 clues, we can deduce that each clue gives us information about at least 2 people.

2. Let's start with the food positions. Since the mango eater is on the right of the jazz fan (even position), and the jazz fan is in an odd position, the mango eater must be in an even position. Also, since the garlic eater is on the far left or far right, and the mango eater is not the first or last, the garlic eater must be in the first or last position. So, we can place garlic in position 1 or 4, and mango in position 2 or 3. Let's place garlic in position 1 for now.

3. The fan of folk is between the person watching family movies and the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person watching family movies is the person watching family movies (according to clue 8), the fan of folk must be between the person watching family movies and the person in position 3 (since position 1 is garlic). So, the person in position 3 must be the skier, and the person in position 2 must be the fan of folk.

4. The person who's sport is snowboarding is in an even position and is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since position 1 is garlic and position 2 is folk, the snowboarder must be in position 4. The person watching documentary movies must be in position 3, and the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 1 (since the documentary watcher is on the right of the time-travel watcher).

5. The person watching family movies is on the left of the person eating potato. Since the person watching family movies is in position 1 (according to clue 8), the person eating potato must be in position 2.

6. The fan of jazz is in an odd position. Since we already placed the garlic eater in position 1, the jazz fan must be in position 3.

7. The fan of house is on the left of the person eating potato. Since the person eating potato is in position 2, the fan of house must be in position 1.

8. The person eating strawberry is not the first or last, so it must be in position 2 or 3. Since the fan of indie is on the right of the person eating strawberry (clue 13), the person eating strawberry must be in position 3. So, the person eating strawberry is in position 3, and the fan of indie is in position 4.

9. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person watching documentary movies is in position 3, the person watching time-travel movies is in position 4.

10. The person eating garlic is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the garlic eater in position 1, it must be on the far left.

Lv4-4x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 3, the musician is between the person who's sport is sailing and the person who's sport is lacrosse. Let's place the musician in the middle of the table (position 3). Since the musician is between sailing and lacrosse, the sailor must be on the left of the musician (position 1) and the lacrosse player on the right of the musician (position 4).

2. From point 2, the rugby player is on the left of the lacrosse player. So, the rugby player must be in position 2.

3. From point 4, the person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the turkish. Since the sailor is already in position 1, the turkish must be in position 5.

4. From point 6, the nigerian is on the far left or far right. Since the turkish is in position 5, the nigerian cannot be in position 1, so the nigerian must be in position 7 (far right).

5. From point 5, the person who's sport is sailing is the person drinking lemonade. We already know that the sailor is in position 1. So, the lemonade is in position 1.

6. From point 11, the dutch is the person drinking cola. Since the lemonade is in position 1, the cola must be in position 3 (as the musician is already in position 3).

7. From point 7, the person who's drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right. Since the nigerian is already in position 7, the hot-chocolate must be in position 4.

8. From point 8, the turkish is on the right of the nigerian. This is already satisfied as the nigerian is in position 7 and the turkish is in position 5.

9. From point 9, the social-worker is on the left of the musician. This is already satisfied as the musician is in position 3 and the social-worker is not yet placed. So, the social-worker can be in position 2.

10. From point 10, the dancer is in an even position. Since the social-worker is in position 2, the dancer can be in position 4 or 6. However, the dancer cannot be in position 6 as the nigerian is already there (point 6). So, the dancer is in position 4.

11. From point 1, the person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the lacrosse player is in position 4, the parkour player can be in position 2 or 6. However, the parkour player cannot be in position 6 as the nigerian is already there (point 6). So, the parkour player is in position 2.
