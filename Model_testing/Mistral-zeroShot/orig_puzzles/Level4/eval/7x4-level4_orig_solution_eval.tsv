Lv4-7x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so each column and row represents one person.

2. Let's start with the people and their positions. Since the person drinking 7up is in an odd position (8), they can't be in the first or last column (positions 1 and 4). So, they must be in positions 2 or 3. Similarly, the person drinking sprite (16) must be in an odd position, so they can't be in the first or last row (positions 1 and 4). So, they must be in positions 2 or 3 as well. The person drinking soy-milk (10) must be in an even position, so they can't be in the first or third row. So, they must be in positions 1 or 4. The person drinking iced-tea (9) must be in a position where they watch musical movies, but we don't know that yet.

3. Let's fill in the people and their positions based on the given information:

   - The person drinking 7up is the owner of the goldfish (7), so they can't be in the same column as the pet owner of the rabbit (17), which means they can't be in positions 1 and 4. So, they must be in position 2. This means the person drinking sprite must be in position 3, and the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1.

   - The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing (12), so they can't be in the first column. So, they must be in the second column. This means the person drinking sprite must be in the third column, and the person drinking soy-milk must be in the first column.

   - The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball (11), so they can't be in the last column. So, they must be in the second column. This means the person drinking soy-milk must be in the first column, and the person drinking 7up must be in the second column.

   - Now we know that the person drinking 7up is in the second column and the second row, so they can't be the person watching action movies (15), which means they must be watching adventure movies (21).

   - The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing (12), so the person who's sport is sailing must be in the first or third column. Since the person drinking sprite is in the second column, the person who's sport is sailing must be in the first column. So, the person who's sport is rowing must be in the third column, and the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in the fourth column.

   - The person drinking sprite is in the second row and the second column, so they can't be the person watching action movies (15), which means they must be watching adventure movies (21).

   - The person drinking soy-milk is in the first column and the first row, so they can't be the person watching action movies (15), which means they must be watching adventure movies (21) as well. This means the person watching action movies must be in the fourth column.

   - The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing (12), so they must be in the third row. This means the person drinking sprite must be in the first row, and the person drinking soy-milk must be in the second row.

Lv4-7x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 items for each category (beverage, food, music-genre, nationality, pet, sport, transport). Let's assign numbers 1-6 to the people and A-F to the items in each category.

2. From rule 13, we know that the person eating banana (#3) is on the left or right of the person who owns the lizard (#5). Since the lizard owner is not on the far left or far right (rule 3), the person eating banana must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the person eating banana is in position 2 (P2).

3. From rule 5, we know that P2 is the person driving the helicopter (H). From rule 6, we know that H is on the left of the fan of indie (I). Since I can't be in position 1 (rule 19), I must be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume I is in position 3 (I3).

2. H2 < H3
3. N1 < S2
4. N3 < N1 or N1 < N3

Let's assume H3 < G1:

2. N1 < S2

Since H2 and H3 are already placed, we can place S2 in the remaining position:

Lv4-7x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking water is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi, and there are only 4 positions, we can place the water and kiwi in the first two positions. Let's place water in the first position and kiwi in the second position.

2. The architect is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching epic movies is in an odd position and the person drinking fanta is on the far left, the person watching spy movies can't be in the first position. So, the architect can't be in the second position either. Let's place the architect in the third position. This means the person watching spy movies is in the fourth position.

3. The dutch is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the person drinking fanta is on the far left, the person playing badminton can't be in the first position. So, the dutch can't be in the second position either. Let's place the dutch in the second position. This means the person playing badminton is in the third position.

4. The person watching epic movies is in an odd position. Since we've placed the architect, the person watching epic movies can't be in the third position. So, the person watching epic movies is in the first position.

5. The person eating peas is the pilot. Since the person watching epic movies is in the first position, the person eating peas (pilot) can't be in the first position. So, the pilot is in the fourth position.

Let's place the gardener in the fifth position.

15. The person eating peach is between the colombian and the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in the first position, the person eating peach can't be in the first or the fourth position. So, the person eating peach is in the third position. This means the colombian is in the fifth position.

16. The person who's sport is cricket is in an even position. Since the person playing badminton is in the third position, the person playing cricket is in the second position.

Lv4-7x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 categories, so each category will have one person. Let's label the people A to F from left to right.

2. From point 11, the person watching action movies is on the far left, so A is watching action movies.

3. From point 19, the person watching thriller movies is the fan of disco, so B is watching thriller movies.

4. From point 18, the dancer is on the far right, so F is a dancer.

5. From point 12, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the Australian, so D is drinking fanta and C is the Australian.

6. From point 6, the Russian is on the left of the Australian, so B is Russian and A is Egyptian or Thai.

7. From point 10, the Egyptian is on the left or right of the fan of house, but we already know the Egyptian's position, so the fan of house must be D or E. Let's assume D is the fan of house for now.

8. From point 14, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the fan of reggae, but we already know the position of the fan of house, so the fan of reggae must be A or B. Since A is already assigned, B must be the fan of reggae.

9. From point 9, the person driving the jet-ski is the person drinking coffee. Since we know B is drinking coffee, B is driving the jet-ski.

10. Now we know B is Russian, drinking coffee, driving the jet-ski, and watching thriller movies. So, B's position is fixed.

11. From point 15, the Russian is driving the roller, so F is driving the jet-ski.

12. From point 16, the person drinking water is on the far left or far right. Since we know the positions of B and F, the person drinking water must be A or C. But A is already assigned, so C is drinking water and is a paramedic (from point 14).

13. From point 17, the paramedic is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies. Since C is the paramedic, C cannot be the person watching documentary movies (point 4). So, A is the person watching documentary movies and eating apple.

14. Now we know A is eating apple and watching documentary movies. So, A's position is fixed.

15. From point 13, the person drinking water is a paramedic, so D is a librarian (since we know C is a paramedic).

16. From point 5, the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person eating apple. Since A is eating apple, D must be driving the bus.

17. From point 18, the dancer is on the far right, so F is the dancer.

18. From point 2, the person drinking coffee is on the left of the person eating garlic. Since B is drinking coffee, E must be eating garlic.

19. From point 3, the librarian is on the right of the person driving the bus, so E is a librarian.

20. From point 7, the person eating tomato is on the left or right of the fan of disco. Since B is the fan of disco, A or F must be eating tomato. But A is already assigned, so F is eating tomato.

Now we have the final solution:

Lv4-7x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is golf is either to the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking. Let's assume golf is on the left of baking for now.

2. The owner of the goldfish is the person driving the subway, and the person driving the subway is in an odd position. Since there are 6 odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11), the goldfish owner can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, or 11. So, the goldfish owner must be in position 9 or 11. Let's place the goldfish owner in position 9 for now.

3. The person eating kale is on the far left or far right. Since we have placed the goldfish owner in position 9, the kale eater can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11. So, the kale eater must be in position 13 or 15. Let's place the kale eater in position 13 for now.

4. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person eating mango. Since we have placed the kale eater in position 13, the comedy movie watcher can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, or 15. So, the comedy movie watcher must be in position 17 or 19. Let's place the comedy movie watcher in position 17 for now.

5. The person eating artichoke is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour. Since we have placed the kale eater in position 13 and the comedy movie watcher in position 17, the artichoke eater can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19. So, the artichoke eater must be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the artichoke eater in position 2 for now.

6. The person watching disaster movies is the person who's hobby is photography. Since we have placed the comedy movie watcher in position 17, the disaster movie watcher must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20. Since the disaster movie watcher is also the photographer, they can't be in position 14 (because filmmaking is on the left of photography) or position 16 (because the argentine owns the chinchilla). So, the disaster movie watcher can be in position 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, or 20. Let's place the disaster movie watcher in position 10 for now.

7. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person eating mango. Since we have placed the kale eater in position 13 and the comedy movie watcher in position 17, the mystery movie watcher can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19. So, the mystery movie watcher must be in position 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18. Since the mystery movie watcher is on the left of the mango eater, they can't be in position 18 (because the mango eater is in position 19). So, the mystery movie watcher can be in position 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16. Let's place the mystery movie watcher in position 6 for now.

8. The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the japanese. Since we have placed the kale eater in position 13, the japanese can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19. So, the japanese must be in position 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18. Since the scientific movie watcher is on the right of the japanese, they can't be in position 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. So, the scientific movie watcher can be in position 12, 14, 16, or 18. Since the scientific movie watcher is in an even position, they can't be in position 18. So, the scientific movie watcher can be in position 12, 14, or 16. Let's place the scientific movie watcher in position 14 for now.

9. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we have placed the kale eater in position 13, the filmmaker can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19. So, the filmmaker must be in position 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18. Since the filmmaker is on the left of the dancer, they can't be in position 14 (because the photographer is there) or position 16 (because the argentine is there). So, the filmmaker can be in position 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 18. Since the filmmaker is in an even position, they can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, or 17. So, the filmmaker must be in position 12.

10. The person who's sport is baseball is in an odd position. Since we have placed the goldfish owner in position 9, the baseball player can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19. So, the baseball player must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 19. Since the baseball player is on the left of the nigerian, they can't be in position 19. So, the baseball player can be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's place the baseball player in position 3 for now.

11. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we have placed the filmmaker in position 12, the dancer must be in position 14, 16, or 18.

12. The owner of the goat is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour. Since we have placed the kale eater in position 13, the goat owner can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19. So, the goat owner must be in position 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18. Since the goat owner is on the left of the parkour person, they can't be in position 16 (because the dancer is there). So, the goat owner can be in position 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 18. Since the goat owner is in an even position, they can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19. So, the goat owner must be in position 14.

13. The person who's sport is parkour is in an odd position. Since we have placed the baseball player in position 3, the parkour person can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19. So, the parkour person must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 19. Since the parkour person is on the right of the artichoke eater, they can't be in position 1. So, the parkour person can be in position 3, 5, or 19. Since the parkour person is in an odd position, they can't be in position 14, 16, or 18. So, the parkour person must be in position 3.

14. The person driving the snowmobile is the person who's sport is baseball. Since we have placed the baseball player in position 3, the snowmobile driver must be in position 3.

15. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we have placed the snowmobile driver in position 3, the bus driver can be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7.

16. The nigerian is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since we have placed the baseball player in position 3, the nigerian must be in position 1 or 5. Since the nigerian is on the left of the baseball player, they can't be in position 5 (because the goat owner is there). So, the nigerian must be in position 1.

17. The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the japanese. Since we have placed the japanese in position 2, the scientific movie watcher must be in position 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20. Since the scientific movie watcher is on the right of the japanese, they can't be in position 2. So, the scientific movie watcher can be in position 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20. Since the scientific movie watcher is in an even position, they can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19. So, the scientific movie watcher must be in position 14.

Lv4-7x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 13 and 14, we know that the dancer is on the left of the software-developer and the german is on the right of the fan of soul. Since there are 4 people, the dancer must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and the german in position 2, 3, or 4.

3. From rule 17, the fan of indie is the person eating asparagus. Since the fan of indie is on the far right (rule 4), the asparagus can only be in position 4.

4. From rule 11, the british is the person watching animation movies. Since the animation movies can't be in position 1 (because the dancer is there), the animation movies must be in position 2 or 3.

5. From rule 15, the person who's hobby is drawing is the person watching western movies. Since the western movies can't be in position 1 (because the dancer is there), the western movies must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

6. From rule 12, the person watching water-polo is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since the animation movies are in position 2 or 3, the water-polo can only be in position 1 or 4.

7. From rule 16, the turkish is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the water-polo can't be in position 1 (because the turkish needs a neighbor), the water-polo must be in position 4. This means the rugby is in position 2 and the turkish is in position 3.

8. From rule 8, the person watching sports movies is the fan of r&b. Since the sports movies can't be in position 1 (because the dancer is there), the sports movies must be in position 2 or 3. Since the sports movies are on an even position (rule 10), they must be in position 2. This means the r&b is in position 2.

9. From rule 9, the dancer is between the person who's sport is rugby (position 2) and the software-developer. Since the dancer is in position 1, 2, or 3, the software-developer can only be in position 3 or 4.

11. From rule 18, the german is the doctor. Since the german is in position 2, the doctor is in position 2.

12. From rule 14, the fan of soul is on the left of the german (who is the doctor). Since the doctor is in position 2, the fan of soul is in position 1.

13. From rule 6, the argentine is on the right of the turkish (who is in position 3). Since the argentine can't be in position 4 (because the software-developer is there), the argentine must be in position 1.

Since the software-developer (who is the soccer player) is in position 3, the woodworking can't be on the right of the software-developer (because the pepper can't be in position 4). So, the woodworking is on the left of the software-developer, which means the woodworking is in position 2.

15. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is drawing is the person watching western movies. Since the western movies are in position 2, the drawing is in position 2.

16. From rule 1, the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies (which is the r&b fan in position 2). Since the dancer is in position 1, the dancing is in position 3.
