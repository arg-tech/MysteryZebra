Lv4-3x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two nationalities: Colombian and Mexican. Since there are two odd positions (1 and 3), the Mexican must be in either position 1 or 3. Let's assume the Mexican is in position 1 for now.

2. We have two sports: skiing and water-polo. Since the person who prefers skiing is on the right of the person driving the roller, and the Mexican is in position 1, the person who prefers skiing cannot be in position 1 (because there's no one to his left to drive the roller). So, the person who prefers skiing must be in position 2.

3. Now we know the person in position 2 prefers skiing and is Colombian (since the Mexican is in position 1). This means the person in position 1 must be Mexican and prefers water-polo.

4. Lastly, we have two means of transport: roller and taxi. Since the person who prefers skiing is to the right of the person driving the roller, the person driving the roller must be in position 2 (because the person in position 1 prefers water-polo, not skiing). So, the person in position 3 must be driving the taxi.

Final solution table:

Lv4-3x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 different beverages (Mirinda and Sprite), 2 different nationalities (Canadian and Turkish), and 2 different means of transport (Motorbike and Train).

2. The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking Mirinda. This means that the person drinking Mirinda cannot be on the first position (as there is no one to their left), so they must be in the second position. Let's place Mirinda in the second beverage position and the nationality of the person drinking Mirinda in the second nationality position. Let's assume the nationality is Canadian for now. So, we have:

| Beverage | 1 | 2 |
|----------|---|---|
| Nationality | 1 | Canadian |
| Transport | 1 |  |

3. The Canadian is in an even position, which means they are either in the first or the second position. Since we've already placed the Canadian in the second position, the Canadian must be in the first position. So, we have:

| Beverage | 1 | 2 |
|----------|---|---|
| Nationality | Canadian |  |
| Transport | 1 |  |

4. The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking Mirinda, so the person driving the train must be in the first position. Since there are only two means of transport, the person driving the train must be driving the motorbike (as the train driver cannot be in the second position because of the even position rule for the Canadian). So, we have:

| Beverage | 1 | 2 |
|----------|---|---|
| Nationality | Canadian |  |
| Transport | Motorbike |  |

5. Now, we have only one beverage left (Sprite), so it must be in the second position. So, we have:

| Beverage | 1 | 2 |
|----------|---|---|
| Nationality | Canadian | Sprite |
| Transport | Motorbike |  |

6. The remaining nationality (Turkish) and transport (Train) must be in the first position. Since the first position is already occupied by the Canadian, the Turkish must be the driver of the train. So, we have:

| Beverage | 1 | 2 |
|----------|---|---|
| Nationality | Turkish | Sprite |
| Transport | Train |  |

7. The last transport (Motorbike) must be in the second position. So, we have:

| Beverage | 1 | 2 |
|----------|---|---|
| Nationality | Turkish | Sprite |
| Transport | Train | Motorbike |

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage | 1 | 2 |
|----------|---|---|
| Nationality | Turkish | Sprite |
| Transport | Train | Motorbike |

This means the Turkish is driving the train, the Canadian is drinking Mirinda (which is in the second position), and the person on the motorbike is drinking Sprite (which is in the first position)."	{'beverage': ['1', '2'], 'nationality': ['turkish', 'sprite'], 'transport': ['train', 'motorbike']}	True	3	False
Lv4-3x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two different hobbies (collecting and writing), we can fill the first hobby in the first row (Hobby 1) with ""collecting"" and the second hobby (Hobby 2) with ""writing"".

2. Similarly, since there are two different movie-genres (fantasy and martial-arts), we can fill the first movie-genre (Movie-Genre 1) with ""martial-arts"" and the second movie-genre (Movie-Genre 2) with ""fantasy"".

3. Since there are two different types of sport (ice-hockey and swimming), we can fill the first sport (Sport 1) with ""ice-hockey"" and the second sport (Sport 2) with ""swimming"".

4. Now, let's consider the position of the person who's hobby is writing (Hobby 2). Since it's in an even position (position 2, 4, or 6), it can only be in position 2 or 4. However, since the person watching fantasy movies (Movie-Genre 2) is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (Sport 1), the person with the hobby of writing (Hobby 2) cannot be in position 2 because the person watching fantasy movies (Movie-Genre 2) would then be in position 1, which is not possible because there's no movie-genre in position 1. So, the person with the hobby of writing (Hobby 2) must be in position 4.

5. Now we know the person with the hobby of writing (Hobby 2) is in position 4, so the person with the hobby of collecting (Hobby 1) must be in position 2.

6. The person watching fantasy movies (Movie-Genre 2) is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (Sport 1), so the person watching fantasy movies (Movie-Genre 2) must be in position 6.

7. The only remaining spot for the person watching martial-arts movies (Movie-Genre 1) is position 1.

8. The person playing ice-hockey (Sport 1) must be on the left of the person watching fantasy movies (Movie-Genre 2), so the person playing ice-hockey (Sport 1) must be in position 6.

9. The only remaining spot for the person playing swimming (Sport 2) is position 1.

Lv4-3x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 different types of food (pomegranate and raspberry), 2 different movie-genres (fantasy and superhero), and 2 different means of transport (ship and train).

2. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching superhero movies. This means that either:
   - Food - Ship - Superhero
   - Food - Superhero - Ship

3. The person eating pomegranate is in an odd position. Since there are 4 positions in the table, an odd position would be either 1 or 3. However, since the person driving the ship is already placed (either in position 1 or 3), the person eating pomegranate cannot be in position 1 because it would mean the ship is in position 2, which is not a valid position for a means of transport. So, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 3.

4. Now we know that the person eating pomegranate is in position 3, and the person driving the ship is not in position 1 (because it would violate the odd position rule for pomegranate). So, the person driving the ship must be in position 1.

5. The person watching superhero movies must be in the remaining position, which is position 2.

6. Now we know the positions of the people and their activities:
   - Position 1: Driving a ship (Transport)
   - Position 2: Watching superhero movies (Movie-Genre)
   - Position 3: Eating pomegranate (Food)

7. To complete the table, we need to fill in the missing items. Since there are only 2 types of food and 2 movie genres, and we already know the food and movie genre for positions 1 and 3, the remaining food must be raspberry, and the remaining movie genre must be fantasy.

The final solution table is:

Lv4-3x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two types of food (lime and raspberry), two types of sports (cricket and rugby), and two types of transport (quad-bike and skateboard).

2. The person eating raspberry is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. This means that if we label the columns as 'Food' and 'Sport', the raspberry eater must be in column 2.

3. The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position. Since there are only two options for each category, the quad-bike must be in the first row (position 1).

4. Now we know that the quad-bike is in the first row and the raspberry eater is in the second row. Since there's only one position left in the first row, the lime eater must be there.

5. The sport of the person eating lime (in the first column) must be different from rugby (since the raspberry eater is eating next to the rugby player). So, the sport of the lime eater must be cricket.

6. Finally, the sport of the raspberry eater must be rugby, as it's the only sport left (cricket is taken by the lime eater).

7. The transport of the person eating lime (in the first row) must be different from the quad-bike (since the quad-bike is taken by the person in the first column). So, the transport of the lime eater must be skateboard.

8. The transport of the raspberry eater must be the remaining option, which is quad-bike, as it's the only transport left (skateboard is taken by the lime eater).

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv4-3x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people with two different hobbies, two different music-genres, and two different sports. So, we can fill in the first row with the hobbies, the second row with the music-genres, and the third row with the sports. Let's denote the two people as A and B.

2. The fan of metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since there are only two hobbies, the metal fan cannot be next to the fishing hobby in the first row. So, the fishing hobby must be in column 1, and the metal fan must be in column 2.

3. The person who's sport is basketball is in an odd position. Since there are only two sports, the basketball player must be in either row 1 or row 2. If it were in row 1, it would be in an even position (as the hobbies are in the first column), which contradicts the odd position rule. Therefore, the basketball player must be in row 2.

4. Now, we know that the metal fan is in column 2, and the basketball player is in row 2. The remaining hobby, singing, must be in column 1, and the remaining sport, water-polo, must be in row 1. The remaining music-genre, trance, can be either in row 1 or row 2. However, since the metal fan is in column 2, the trance fan must be in column 1 to ensure that the music-genres are different.

Lv4-3x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 different types of food, pepper and radish. Let's denote P for pepper and R for radish.

2. We have 2 different jobs, accountant (A) and dancer (D). Let's denote A for accountant and D for dancer.

3. We have 2 different sports, sailing (S) and skiing (K). Let's denote S for sailing and K for skiing.

4. From the first rule, the person who's sport is skiing (K) is on the left of the accountant (A). This means K cannot be in the rightmost column.

5. From the second rule, the person who's sport is sailing (S) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing (K). Since K is not in the rightmost column, S must be in the rightmost column or in the same column as K.

6. From the third rule, the person eating pepper (P) is in an even position. Since there are 2 columns and 2 rows, an even position can only be the second row or the second column. But since K is not in the rightmost column, P cannot be in the second column. So, P must be in the second row.

7. Now we know that P is in the second row, so the food in the first row must be R (radish).

8. Since P is in the second row and K is not in the rightmost column, S must be in the leftmost column of the second row.

9. Now we know the positions of all the food, so we can deduce the positions of the jobs. The accountant (A) must be in the row where there's pepper (P), which is the second row. The dancer (D) must be in the other row, which is the first row.

10. Finally, we know the positions of all the jobs, so we can deduce the positions of the sports. The person who's sport is skiing (K) is on the left of the accountant (A), so K must be in the first column of the first row. The person who's sport is sailing (S) is in the same column as K or the rightmost column, but since K is in the first column, S must be in the rightmost column of the second row.

The final solution table is:

Lv4-3x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 different types of food (blueberry, pumpkin), 2 different sports (surfing, volleyball), and 2 different means of transport (bike, helicopter).

2. The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing. This means that either:
   - Helicopter is in position 1 and surfing is in position 2, or
   - Helicopter is in position 2 and surfing is in position 1.

3. The person eating pumpkin is in an odd position. Since we have 4 positions, the odd positions are 1 and 3. So, the pumpkin eater can be in either position 1 or 3.

4. To avoid repetition, let's assume the pumpkin eater is in position 1. This means the food column would look like this:
   - Position 1: Pumpkin
   - Position 2: Surfing (since the helicopter driver is to the right of the surfer)
   - Position 3: Blueberry (since the food must be different in each position)
   - Position 4: Volleyball (since the remaining sport and transport are left)

5. Now, let's check if the transport can be placed according to the given conditions. The transport must be different in each position and the helicopter driver is in an even position (since the surfer is in an odd position and the surfer is to the right of the helicopter driver). However, positions 2 and 4 are even, and we already have a helicopter in position 2. So, this arrangement doesn't work.

6. Let's try another arrangement with the pumpkin eater in position 3:
   - Position 1: Blueberry
   - Position 2: Surfing
   - Position 3: Pumpkin
   - Position 4: Volleyball
   - Position 2 is even, so the helicopter driver is in position 4, and the bike user is in position 1.

7. This arrangement satisfies all the conditions:
   - The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing (position 4 is to the right of position 2)
   - The person eating pumpkin is in an odd position (position 3)

Lv4-3x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different hobbies, two different jobs, and two different music genres. So, each row and each column must have unique entries.

2. Since there are two different hobbies, let's label them as Hobby 1 (Baking) and Hobby 2 (Woodworking).

3. Similarly, let's label the jobs as Job 1 (Bartender) and Job 2 (Scientist).

4. For the music genres, let's label them as Music-Genre 1 (Classical) and Music-Genre 2 (R&B).

5. The person who's hobby is baking is in an even position, which means it can't be in the first position (position 1) because the positions are numbered 1 to 4. So, the hobby of Baking must be in position 2 or position 4.

6. If the hobby of Baking was in position 4, then the hobby in position 1 would be Woodworking. But since the scientist is in an even position, and position 4 is the hobby, position 2 would be the job, which means the scientist can't be in the first row. So, the hobby of Baking must be in position 2.

7. Now, the hobby in position 1 is Woodworking. The scientist is not in the first row, so the scientist must be in the second row.

8. The scientist is to the right of the fan of R&B. Since the hobby of Baking is in the second row and first column, the hobby of R&B must be in the second row and second column.

9. Now, we know the hobby, job, and music genre for the second row. The hobby is R&B, the job is Scientist, and the music genre is Classical. So, the second row must be:

   | Hobby         | Baking      | Woodworking |
   | Job           |             | Scientist   |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical   | R&B         |

10. Now, let's fill the first row. Since the scientist is not in the first row, the job in the first row must be Bartender. The person who's hobby is Woodworking is in an even position, which means it must be in position 4. So, the first row must be:

   | Hobby         | Baking      | Woodworking |
   | Job           | Bartender   |             |
   | Music-Genre   |             | R&B         |

11. Finally, we need to fill the music genre for the first row. Since the scientist is to the left of the fan of R&B, the fan of Classical must be in the first row. So, the final table is:

   | Job           | Bartender   | Scientist   |

3. The person eating kiwi must be in an odd position (3), because the person eating kiwi is on the left of the person eating kiwi's right neighbor, who has a hobby of singing (rule 1). So, the person eating kale must be in position 1, and the person eating kiwi must be in position 3.

4. Now, we know the person eating kale is in position 1, and the person eating kiwi is in position 3. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 1 (our assumption), the only remaining beverage is almond-milk, and it must be in position 2.

5. The person with the hobby of filmmaking must be in an odd position, because the person with the hobby of singing is in an even position (rule 1). Since the person eating kale (hobby unknown) is in position 1, the person with the hobby of filmmaking must be in position 3.
