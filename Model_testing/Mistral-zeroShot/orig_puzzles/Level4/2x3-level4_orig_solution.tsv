Lv4-2x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating cauliflower is in an even position (4th position is even), and there are only 3 positions, the cauliflower must be in the 2nd position.

2. Now we know the architect is eating pineapple (from point 3), so the architect must be in the 1st position. Since the architect is on the left or right of the firefighter (point 2), the firefighter must be in the 3rd position.

3. The person eating pomegranate is on the far left (point 4), so it must be in the 1st position, which contradicts our previous conclusion that the architect (who eats pineapple) is in the 1st position. This means the condition about the pomegranate is incorrect or there is a mistake in the puzzle.

Assuming there is no mistake, let's try to rearrange the conditions:

1. the person eating cauliflower is in an even position (2nd position)
2. the architect is on the left or right of the firefighter (2nd or 3rd position)
3. the architect is the person eating pineapple (1st position)
4. the person eating pomegranate is on the far left (impossible in this arrangement)
5. the engineer is the engineer (irrelevant to the arrangement)

With this new arrangement, we can't satisfy all conditions, so there seems to be a mistake in the puzzle. However, if we ignore the condition about the pomegranate being on the far left, we can solve the puzzle as follows:

|        |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Food   | Pineapple  | Cauliflower | Pomegranate|
| Job    | Architect  | Firefighter | Engineer   |

This arrangement satisfies all conditions except the one about the pomegranate being on the far left. If we ignore that condition, the solution is:

#############
|        |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Food   | Pineapple  | Cauliflower | Pomegranate|
| Job    | Architect  | Firefighter | Engineer   |

Lv4-2x3-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are three different hobbies and three different means of transport. So, each row and each column must have a unique value.

2. The person with the hobby of board-games is on the far right. This means that hobby 3 must be board-games.

3. The person driving the roller is in an even position. Since the positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3, the roller can only be in position 2 or 3. However, since the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 3, the roller cannot be in position 3 (because the hobby of the person in position 3 is known). So, the roller must be in position 2.

4. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we know the hobby of the person in position 3 (board-games), and the hobby of the person in position 1 is not yet known, the only way to satisfy this condition is if the taxi is in position 1 and the filmmaking person is in position 2.

5. Now, we know that the hobby of the person in position 1 is not filmmaking (because the person driving the taxi is to the left of the filmmaking person), and we also know that the hobby of the person in position 3 is board-games. The only remaining hobby is drawing. So, the hobby of the person in position 1 must be drawing.

6. Finally, we know that the person driving the boat is in an odd position (since the roller is in position 2 and the taxi is in position 1), and the only remaining transport is boat. So, the person driving the boat must be in position 3.

The final solution table is:

|             |    1    |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby       | Drawing | Roller    | Board-games |
| Transport   | Boat    | Roller    | Taxi       |

So, the final solution is:

#############
| Drawing    | Boat    | Roller    | Board-games |
| Transport  |         |           |             |

Lv4-2x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, and they have 3 different hobbies (baking, photography, sudoku) and 3 different music-genres (dubstep, electronic, salsa).

2. Since there are 3 people, the positions (1, 2, 3) correspond to the people.

3. Let's assign the hobbies and music-genres to the people based on the given conditions:

   - The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the fan of dubstep. So, the person in position 1 cannot be the baker, and the person in position 3 cannot be the fan of dubstep. This leaves position 2 for the baker and position 1 for the fan of dubstep.

   - The fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of dubstep. Since position 1 is the fan of dubstep, position 2 cannot be the fan of electronic. This leaves position 3 for the fan of electronic.

   - Now we know the music-genres of positions 1 and 3. Since there are only 3 music-genres, position 2 must be the fan of salsa.

   - The person who's hobby is photography is in an even position. Since positions 1 and 3 are odd, position 2 cannot be the photographer. This leaves position 1 for the hobby of baking and position 3 for the hobby of sudoku.

   - Now we know the hobbies of positions 1 and 3. Since there are only 3 hobbies, position 2 must be the photographer.

4. Putting it all together, the final solution table is:

   |               |     1      |      2      |   3    |
   | Hobby         | Baking     | Photography | Sudoku |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep    | Salsa      | Electronic |

Lv4-2x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 3 different movie-genres: musical, sports, superhero. Since there are only 3 columns, each column must represent one genre. Let's assume the columns are in this order: Musical (1), Sports (2), Superhero (3).

2. We also know that the people prefer 3 different types of sport: biathlon, cricket, lacrosse. Since there are only 3 rows, each row must represent one sport. Let's assume the rows are in this order: Biathlon (1), Cricket (2), Lacrosse (3).

3. From the third rule, the person watching sports movies is in an even position. Since the sports are in the second and third rows, the sports movies must be in the second and third columns (Sports and Superhero). So, the order of the rows is now: Biathlon (1), Sports (3), Lacrosse (2).

4. From the first rule, the person watching sports movies is the person who's sport is cricket. So, the third row (Lacrosse) must be moved to the second position, and the second row (Cricket) must be moved to the third position. The order of the rows is now: Biathlon (1), Cricket (2), Lacrosse (3).

5. From the fourth rule, the person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching superhero movies. Since the sports movies are in the second and third columns, the superhero movies must be in the first column (Musical). So, the order of the columns is now: Musical (1), Sports (2), Superhero (3).

6. Now we have the correct order of rows and columns. The final solution table is:

   |               |     1     |    2    |    3     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Musical   | Sports  | Superhero |

Lv4-2x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three hobbies (camping, chess, gardening) and three nationalities (Canadian, Colombian, Dutch). Since there are six possible positions for three items, we can use the given clues to fill in the table.

2. The person who's hobby is gardening is between the person who's hobby is camping and the Canadian. This means the gardener cannot be in the first position (as it would violate the ""between"" condition), nor can they be in the third position (as it would place them after the Canadian). So, the gardener must be in the second position.

3. The person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position. Since the gardener is in the second position (which is an even position), the chess player must be in either the first or third position. However, if the chess player were in the first position, the Dutch (who must be on the left of the Canadian) would have to be in the third position, which would place the gardener in the second position again, violating the first condition. Therefore, the chess player must be in the third position.

4. The Dutch is on the left of the Canadian. Since the Canadian cannot be in the first position (as the gardener is in the second position), the Dutch must be in the first position.

Now we can fill in the table:

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Hobby         | Dutch    | Gardening| Chess    |
| Nationality   | Canadian |         |         |

5. To find the nationality of the person in the second position, we know that the person with the hobby of gardening is in the second position. Since the Dutch and Canadian are already placed, the only remaining nationality is Colombian.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |

Lv4-2x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person with the hobby of baking plays lacrosse. Let's assign hobby 1 to baking, sport 3 to lacrosse.

2. The person with the hobby of collecting plays tennis. Since the person with hobby 1 (baking) is in position 2 (since they play lacrosse), and the person with hobby 2 (collecting) cannot be in position 1 (as per rule 3, positions are odd), the person with hobby 2 (collecting) must be in position 3. So, let's assign hobby 2 to collecting and sport 1 to tennis.

3. Now, the person with hobby 3 (filmmaking) is to the right of the person with sport 1 (tennis). Since hobby 2 (collecting) is already in position 3, hobby 3 (filmmaking) must be in position 1. So, let's assign hobby 3 to filmmaking and sport 2 to cricket (since there are only three sports and we have assigned two of them).

The final solution table is:

  |         |     1      |     2      |    3     |

Lv4-2x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Let's denote the positions as D (documentary), H (horror), M (martial-arts). So, D cannot be in position 1, and H must be in position 3 or 2 (3 if D is in position 2, 2 if D is in position 3).

2. The person watching documentary movies is between the owner of the turtle and the person watching martial-arts movies. This means D cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, D must be in position 2.

3. The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Since D is in position 2, H must be in position 3.

4. The owner of the dog is in an even position. Since D and H are in positions 2 and 3, the only even position left is position 1. So, the pet owner must be a dog owner.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |      1       |      2      |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   |              | Documentary | Horror |
| Pet           | Dog          |             |        |

Since we don't have any information about the pet for the person watching martial-arts movies, we can't fill that in. But we know the positions of the pets: Dog (position 1), Turtle (not position 1, 2, or 3), Goat (not position 1, 2, 3).

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-2x3-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The owner of the frog is between the owner of the rat and the person eating artichoke. This means the order cannot be Rat-Frog-Artichoke or Artichoke-Frog-Rat. So, the possible orders are Rat-Artichoke-Frog or Frog-Rat-Artichoke.

2. The owner of the snake is in an odd position. Since there are 3 positions, the snake cannot be in the first or third position. So, the snake cannot be in the Rat-Artichoke-Frog order, leaving us with Frog-Rat-Artichoke as the only possible order for the first 3 positions.

3. The owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating kale. Since the rat is in the second position, the person eating kale must be in the third position. So, the kale eater is Artichoke.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|        |   1    |  2   |     3     |
| Food   | Artichoke | Rat | Kale |
| Pet    |        |      |       |

4. To find the pets, we know that the snake is not in the first or third position, so it must be the second pet, which is the Rat. The only pet left for the first position is the Frog, and for the third position, the only food left is Kale.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-2x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are three people and they prefer three different sports, each sport must be in a unique position. Let's assign the sports to the positions:
   - Tennis in position 1 (odd position)
   - Lacrosse in position 2
   - Climbing in position 3

2. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the fan of dubstep. Since tennis is in position 1, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2 or 3. But if it were in position 3, it would mean that the person who likes climbing would be a fan of dubstep, which contradicts the fact that they prefer three different music genres. So, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2.

3. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the fan of ambient. Since lacrosse is in position 2, the fan of ambient must be in position 1 or 3. But if it were in position 1, it would mean that the person who likes tennis would be a fan of ambient, which contradicts the fact that they prefer three different music genres. So, the fan of ambient must be in position 3.

4. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since tennis is in position 1 and lacrosse is in position 2, tennis can be either to the left or right of lacrosse. However, since tennis is on the left of the fan of dubstep (which is in position 2), tennis must be in position 1, which means it's on the right of lacrosse.

1. We know there are three beverages (7up, coffee, cola) and three foods (corn, garlic, pineapple). We need to find their positions in the table.

2. Since the person eating corn is on the right of the person drinking cola, and there are only three positions, the person drinking cola must be in position 1 (leftmost) and the person eating corn in position 3 (rightmost).

3. The person eating pineapple is in an even position and is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 1, the person eating pineapple cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as those are odd positions and it must be on the right of 7up). So, the person eating pineapple must be in position 2.

4. Now, we know the positions of the person eating corn and pineapple. Since there are only two positions left, the person drinking 7up must be in position 2 (as it cannot be in position 1 due to the pineapple condition) and the person drinking coffee must be in position 3.

5. For food, since there are only two positions left, the person eating garlic must be in position 1 and the person eating garlic must be in position 3.
