Lv4-2x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the scooter. Let's place the scooter in the first position (1).

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | scooter |   |   |   |   |   |

2. The owner of the pony is on the tram. Since the scooter owner is on the left of the tram owner (1 is to the left of 2), we place the tram in the second position (2).

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | scooter | tram |   |   |   |   |

3. The owner of the horse is to the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the rabbit cannot be in the first or second position (as the scooter and tram owners are already placed), the rabbit must be in the third position (3). The horse is to the right of the rabbit, so it goes in the fourth position (4).

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | scooter | tram | rabbit | horse |   |   |

4. The scooter owner is between the tram and taxi owners. The only possible position for the taxi is the fifth position (5).

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | scooter | tram | rabbit | horse | taxi |   |

5. The taxi owner is in an even position. Since the scooter, tram, and rabbit owners are already placed, the only even position left is the sixth position (6).

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | scooter | tram | rabbit | horse | taxi |   |

6. The person driving the ship is on the far right. Since all other transports are already placed, the ship goes in the sixth position (6).

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | scooter | tram | rabbit | horse | taxi | ship |

7. The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the ship is already placed, the skateboard must be in the fifth position (5).

8. The owner of the snake is the person driving the skateboard. Since the snake cannot be the owner of any of the pets already placed, it must be the pet of the fifth transport (5).

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | scooter | tram | rabbit | horse | skateboard (snake) | ship |

9. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the horse. Since the horse is in the fourth position (4) and the guinea-pig is on the scooter (1), the only remaining position for the guinea-pig is the third position (3).

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | scooter (guinea-pig) | tram (pony) | rabbit | horse | skateboard (snake) | ship |

10. The owner of the hamster is the only remaining pet. Since the hamster cannot be the owner of any of the transports already placed, it must be the pet of the second transport (2).

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | scooter (guinea-pig) | hamster (hamster) | tram (pony) | rabbit | skateboard (snake) | ship |

So, the final solution is:

Lv4-2x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people, and they prefer 6 different movie genres. So, each person prefers one genre.

2. Let's assign genres to the first three people from left to right:
   - The first person watches horror movies (since they are to the left of the Brazilian). Let's place horror in the first row, first column.
   - The second person watches mystery movies (since they are to the right of the Brazilian and the Dutch watches mystery). Let's place mystery in the first row, second column.
   - The third person watches a genre that is not horror, mystery, or comedy yet (since the Dutch watches mystery and the Dutch is in the second position). Let's place this third genre in the first row, third column.

3. Now, let's assign nationalities to the first three people:
   - The first person is Brazilian (since the horror watcher is to their right).
   - The second person is Dutch (since they watch mystery).
   - The third person is not Brazilian or Dutch, so they must be one of the remaining four nationalities. Let's assume they are Italian (since they can be in an even position).

4. The fourth person watches comedy movies (since they are to the left of the person watching satire movies and to the left of the Italian). Let's place comedy in the second row, first column.

5. The fifth person watches satire movies (since they are to the left or right of the person watching scientific movies). Let's place satire in the second row, third column.

6. The sixth person watches scientific movies (since the Japanese is to their right). Let's place scientific in the second row, fifth column.

7. Now, we have only one position left for the Japanese (since the chinese is on the far left or far right). Let's place the Japanese in the third row, sixth column.

8. The remaining nationalities are British, Chinese, and Chinese (since one Chinese is already placed). Let's place the British in the third row, first column, and the second Chinese in the third row, fifth column.

The final solution table is:

```

Lv4-2x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who plays basketball is on the left of the person who plays golf. Let's place basketball on the far left (1st position) and golf on the 3rd position.

2. The fan of r&b is on the left or right of the person who plays weightlifting. Since we already placed basketball and golf, weightlifting can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. Let's place weightlifting in the 4th position for now. This means r&b is either in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.

3. The person who plays golf is on the left or right of the fan of r&b. Since golf is in the 3rd position, r&b cannot be in the 1st position. So, r&b is either in the 3rd or 5th position.

4. The fan of rock is in an odd position. Since we have placed basketball, golf, and weightlifting, the only odd positions left are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th. Let's place rock in the 3rd position for now.

5. The fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of rock. Since rock is in the 3rd position, soul can be in the 1st, 4th, or 6th position. Let's place soul in the 1st position for now.

6. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person who plays basketball. Since basketball is in the 1st position, salsa can be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. Let's place salsa in the 6th position for now.

7. The person who plays cycling is on the left of the fan of metal. Since we have placed basketball, golf, weightlifting, r&b, rock, and salsa, the only remaining positions for cycling are the 2nd and 4th. Let's place cycling in the 2nd position.

8. The person who plays basketball is on the far left or far right. Since we have placed basketball in the 1st position, it is on the far left.

9. The person who plays handball is the fan of soul. Since we have placed soul in the 1st position, handball must be in the 5th position.

Now, let's rearrange the sports to match the music genres according to the positions we have determined:

|               |     1      |   2   |    3    |       4       |     5      |    6     |
| Music-Genre   |            |       |         |               |            |          |
| Sport         |  Basketball| Cycling| Golf    | Weightlifting  | Rock       | Salsa    |

Since we have not definitively placed r&b and metal, let's place them in the remaining positions:

|               |     1      |   2   |    3    |       4       |     5      |    6     |
| Music-Genre   |  Basketball| Cycling| Golf    | Weightlifting  | Rock       | Salsa    |
| Sport         |  Ambient  | Metal  | R&B     | Soul          | Handball   | Ice-Hockey|

Now, we need to determine the exact positions for r&b and metal. Since r&b is on the left or right of weightlifting, it cannot be in the 4th position. So, r&b is in the 3rd position, and metal is in the 5th position.

Finally, we have the solution:

#############
|               |     1      |   2   |    3    |       4       |     5      |    6     |

Lv4-2x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person driving the boat is on the far right, so we can fill the last column with 'Boat'.

2. The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the train driver is in an even position (not the first or last), the person watching scientific movies can't be in the first or last column. So, the person watching scientific movies can only be in columns 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume it's in column 2 for now.

3. The person watching action movies is on the far left. So, it must be in the first column.

4. The person driving the train is in an even position. Since the action movie viewer is in the first column, the train driver can't be in the first or last row. So, the train driver can only be in rows 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume it's in row 4 for now.

5. The person driving the skateboard is the person watching family movies. Since the action movie viewer is in the first column, the family movie viewer can't be in the first column either. So, the family movie viewer can only be in columns 2, 3, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in column 3 for now.

6. The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person watching family movies. Since the family movie viewer is in column 3, the motorbike driver can be in columns 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in column 5 for now.

7. The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since we assumed the scientific movie viewer is in column 2, the satire movie viewer can only be in columns 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume it's in column 4 for now.

8. The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since we assumed the action movie viewer is in the first column, the drama movie viewer can only be in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in column 6 for now.

9. The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since we assumed the drama movie viewer is in the sixth column, the van driver can only be in columns 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume it's in column 1 for now.

Now, let's check the consistency of our assumptions:
- The person watching satire movies is to the right of the person watching scientific movies, which is true (column 4 is to the right of column 2).
- The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies, which is true (column 1 is to the left of column 6).
- The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching drama movies, which is true (column 1 is to the left of column 6).

So, our assumptions are consistent. Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv4-2x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 12, the person driving the skateboard is in an even position. Since there are 6 people and an even number, the skateboard person must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, since the skateboard person is between the person watching romance movies and the person driving the helicopter (point 1), the skateboard person cannot be in position 6. So, the skateboard person is either in position 2 or 4.

2. From point 11, the person watching musical movies is on the far right. Since the skateboard person is to the left of the person watching musical movies (point 3), the skateboard person must be in position 2.

3. Now we know the skateboard person is in position 2, so the person driving the helicopter is to the right of the skateboard person (point 1). The helicopter person cannot be in position 1 (because there are 6 different means of transport), so the helicopter person is in position 3.

4. The person driving the train is the one watching musical movies (point 2), so the train is in position 1.

5. The person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person watching western movies (point 4). Since the train is in position 1 and the skateboard is in position 2, the western movies person must be in position 3. So, the snowmobile person is in position 4.

6. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching documentary movies (point 6). Since the skateboard is in position 2, the documentary person cannot be in position 1 (because there are 6 different movie genres), so the documentary person is in position 5. The scientific person must be in position 3.

7. The person watching time-travel movies is to the right of the person watching scientific movies (point 8), so the time-travel person is in position 6.

8. The person driving the bike is to the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (point 10). Since the helicopter is in position 3, the bike can be in position 2 or 4. However, since the skateboard is in position 2, the bike cannot be in position 2. So, the bike is in position 4.

9. The person watching western movies is to the left or right of the person driving the skateboard (point 7). Since the skateboard is in position 2, the western movies person can be in position 1 or 3. However, since the train is in position 1, the western movies person must be in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |    6    |

| Transport     | Bike       | Car       | Helicopter | Snowmobile | Car       | Car      |

However, the transport column is incorrect because there are two cars. Let's adjust it:

|               |      1      |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |    6    |

Lv4-2x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 music genres and 6 nationalities, so each row and each column should have one unique entry.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Turkish is on the left of the Polish, the Turkish cannot be in the first column. Similarly, the Turkish cannot be in the last column because the Turkish is on the left of the fan of rock, and the fan of rock cannot be in the last row (as the fan of rock is on the left of the Turkish, and the Turkish is not in the first column). So, the Turkish must be in the middle columns (2, 3, 4, or 5).

3. The fan of jazz is the Russian. Since the Argentine is on the right of the fan of jazz, the Argentine cannot be in the first column. So, the Argentine must be in the middle columns (2, 3, 4, or 5).

4. The fan of indie is on the left of the fan of rock and on the far left or far right. Since the Turkish is not in the first column, the fan of indie cannot be in the first column either. So, the fan of indie must be in the middle columns (3, 4, or 5).

5. The fan of indie is also on the far left or far right. If the fan of indie is in the middle columns (3, 4, or 5), then it cannot be on the far right because the fan of trance is on the left of the fan of gospel, and the fan of gospel is in an odd position. So, the fan of indie must be in the second column.

6. Now we know that the Turkish is not in the first column, so it must be in one of the remaining columns (2, 3, 4, or 6). Since the Turkish is on the left of the fan of rock, the Turkish cannot be in the sixth column. So, the Turkish must be in one of the first four columns (1, 2, 3, or 4).

7. The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of gospel. Since the fan of gospel is in an odd position, the fan of trance must be in an even position. The only even positions left are the second and fourth columns. However, if the fan of trance is in the fourth column, it would mean that the fan of gospel is in the fifth column, which is odd, contradicting the given condition. So, the fan of trance must be in the second column.

8. Now we know that the Turkish is in the first column, the fan of indie is in the second column, and the fan of trance is in the second column. This means that the fan of gospel must be in the fifth column (odd position).

9. The fan of rock is on the left of the Turkish, so the fan of rock must be in the third column.

10. The fan of jazz is the Russian, so the Russian must be in the first row.

11. The fan of disco is the British, so the British must be in the sixth row.

12. The fan of jazz is on the right of the Argentine, so the Argentine must be in the fifth row.

13. The fan of indie is on the left of the fan of rock, so the fan of rock must be in the fourth row.

14. The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of gospel, so the fan of gospel must be in the third row.

15. The fan of disco is in the sixth row, and the remaining music genres are in the first through fifth rows. Since the fan of indie is in the second column, the fan of rock must be in the fourth column. The fan of trance is in the second column, so the fan of gospel must be in the third column. The fan of jazz is in the first column, so the fan of jazz must be in the first row. The fan of indie must be in the fifth row because it is on the far right. The fan of rock must be in the fourth row because it is on the left of the Turkish, who is in the first column. This leaves the third row for the fan of trance.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-2x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the writer plays tennis, so we can place the writer in the 1st or 5th column and tennis in row 1 or 5. Let's place tennis in row 1 for now.

2. The person who plays badminton is on the left or right of the writer. Since the writer is in column 1 or 5, badminton can only be in column 2 or 4. Let's place badminton in column 2 for now.

3. The person who plays snowboarding is on the left or right of the project-manager. Since we don't know the position of the project-manager yet, we can't place snowboarding yet.

4. The person who plays cricket is on the far left. Since we have already placed tennis and badminton, cricket must be in the first column.

5. The person who plays cricket is on the left or right of the engineer. Since cricket is in the first column, the engineer can't be in the first row. So, the engineer must be in the second row.

6. The software-developer is on the right of the engineer. So, the software-developer is in the third column.

7. The person who plays rugby is on the right of the person who plays lacrosse. Since we don't know the position of lacrosse yet, we can't place rugby yet.

8. The nurse is on the left of the person who plays tennis. Since tennis is in the first row, the nurse must be in the second row as well.

9. The analyst is in an even position. Since we have placed 4 people (nurse, writer, engineer, software-developer) in the first four positions, the analyst must be in the sixth position.

10. The person who plays lacrosse is on the right of the person who plays rugby. Since we don't know the position of rugby yet, we can't place lacrosse yet.

Now we have the following positions filled:

|         |        1        |      2       |         3          |    4     |     5     |   6    |

We still have to place rugby, lacrosse, and snowboarding, but we have some constraints:
- The person who plays snowboarding is on the left or right of the project-manager. Since we don't know the position of the project-manager yet, we can't place snowboarding yet.
- The person who plays rugby is on the right of the person who plays lacrosse. Since we don't know the position of lacrosse yet, we can't place rugby yet.

To place snowboarding, we need to know the position of the project-manager. To place lacrosse, we need to place rugby. Since we can't place rugby without knowing the position of lacrosse, we are stuck.

This puzzle seems to have a contradiction, as it's not possible to place all the sports and jobs according to the given conditions."
Lv4-2x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the sports are different and there are 6 of them, they can be arranged in any order. Let's assume the sports are arranged in alphabetical order for simplicity: Cricket, Snowboarding, Surfing, Swimming, Volleyball, Weightlifting.

2. From rule 11, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the far right. So, sprite must be in the 6th position.

3. From rule 10, we know that the person playing cricket is in an odd position. Since sprite is in the 6th position (odd), cricket must be in the 5th position.

4. From rule 12, we know that the person playing weightlifting is on the left of the person playing volleyball. Since volleyball is in an odd position (5th), weightlifting must be in the 4th position.

5. From rule 8, we know that the person drinking milk is in an even position. Since weightlifting is in the 4th position (even), milk must be in the 2nd position.

6. From rule 9, we know that the person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, hot-chocolate must be in the 1st position.

7. From rule 10, we know that the person playing cricket is in an odd position. Since cricket is in the 5th position (odd), the only remaining odd position is the 3rd position. So, the person playing surfing must be in the 3rd position.

8. From rule 4, we know that the person playing surfing is on the left of the person playing swimming. So, swimming must be in the 2nd position.

9. From rule 2, we know that the person playing swimming is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since swimming is in the 2nd position and iced-tea must be to its left (rule 5), iced-tea must be in the 1st position.

10. From rule 3, we know that the person playing snowboarding is on the right of the person playing volleyball. Since volleyball is in the 5th position (odd), snowboarding must be in the 6th position.

1. Since the person drinking 7up is either to the left or right of the person who is into filmmaking, we can't place them in the first two positions. So, 7up can only be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6.

2. The person drinking fanta is the one with the hobby of hiking. Since fanta can't be in the first two positions (as 7up can't be in the first two), fanta can only be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6.

3. The person drinking fanta is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. So, if fanta is in position 3, 4, or 5, iced-tea must be in a position to the left. But since 7up can't be in the first two positions, iced-tea can't be in position 2. So, fanta can't be in positions 3 or 5. Therefore, fanta can only be in position 4 or 6.

4. The person drinking iced-tea is in an even position. Since fanta can't be in position 4, iced-tea must be in position 4. So, fanta is in position 6.

5. The person drinking cola is not the one with the hobby of writing, and the person with the hobby of writing is between the person drinking cola and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. So, the person drinking cola can't be in the last two positions. Therefore, cola can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

6. Since the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person who's hobby is writing, and iced-tea is in position 4, the person with the hobby of writing can't be in positions 5 or 6. So, the person with the hobby of writing can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

7. The person drinking mirinda is on the far left. So, mirinda must be in position 1.

8. The person with the hobby of skydiving is on the far right. Since iced-tea is in position 4 and fanta is in position 6, the only remaining position for skydiving is position 6.

9. The person with the hobby of magic-tricks is to the right of the person drinking cola and to the left of the person with the hobby of writing. Since cola can't be in the last two positions, magic-tricks can't be in positions 5 or 6. So, magic-tricks can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

10. The person with the hobby of puzzles is not the one drinking 7up, fanta, iced-tea, cola, mirinda, or the one with the hobby of writing. So, puzzles can only be in positions 2 or 3.

11. Since hiking is the hobby of the person drinking fanta, and hiking can't be in the first two positions, puzzles can't be in position 2. So, puzzles must be in position 3.

Now, let's put the final solution:

| Beverage   | mirinda | fanta   | iced-tea | cola    | writing | skydiving |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Hobby      | filmmaking | hiking | puzzles | magic-tricks | skydiving | writing |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage   | mirinda | fanta   | iced-tea | cola    | writing | skydiving |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Hobby      | filmmaking | hiking | puzzles | magic-tricks | skydiving | writing |

Lv4-2x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person driving the ship is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking milk. Let's place the ship in position 3. So, hot-chocolate is either 2 or 4, and milk is either 1 or 5.

2. The person driving the train is on the far left. So, the train is in position 1, and the person drinking almond-milk is the person driving the train.

3. The person driving the van is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the train (almond-milk) is in position 1, the van can't be in position 1. So, the van is either 2 or 6. The quad-bike can't be in position 1, 2, 4, or 6 because of the ship and the van. So, the quad-bike is in position 3 or 5. If the quad-bike is in position 3, the van must be in position 2. If the quad-bike is in position 5, the van must be in position 6.

4. The person drinking water is the person driving the ship. So, water is in position 3.

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the hot-chocolate can't be in position 1 (train), it must be in position 2 or 4. If hot-chocolate is in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 1 (almond-milk). If hot-chocolate is in position 4, the person drinking milk must be in position 5.

6. The person driving the scooter is on the far right. So, the scooter is in position 6.

7. The person driving the scooter is the person drinking cola.

8. The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter. Since the motorbike can't be in position 1 (train), it must be in position 2 or 4. If the motorbike is in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 1 (almond-milk). If the motorbike is in position 4, the person drinking milk must be in position 5.

9. The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position. Since the train (almond-milk) is in position 1, it's not an odd position. So, the motorbike must be in position 2, and the person drinking milk must be in position 5.

10. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking milk. So, cola is in position 6.

11. The person drinking lemonade is left. Since all other positions are filled, lemonade must be in position 2.

Final solution table:

| Beverage    |      1      |    2     |       3       |   4   |     5     |    6    |
