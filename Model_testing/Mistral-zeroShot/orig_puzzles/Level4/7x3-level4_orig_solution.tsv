Lv4-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the positions of the nationalities, pets, and beverages. Let's assign them positions from 1 to 3.

   Nationalities: Japanese (J), Mexican (M), Russian (R)
   Pets: Bird (B), Ferret (F), Snake (S)
   Beverages: Fanta (F), Hot-Chocolate (H), Soy-Milk (SM)

2. From rule 6, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in an odd position. So, Hot-Chocolate can only be in position 1 or 3. Since the Russian is also in position 1 (rule 4), Hot-Chocolate must be in position 3. So, Snake is in position 3.

3. From rule 13, the owner of the snake is the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, we know the position of the Russian (R).

4. From rule 11, the owner of the bird is between the person watching thriller movies and the Russian (R). Since the person watching thriller movies is on the far right (rule 8), the bird cannot be in position 3. So, the bird must be in position 1 or 2.

5. From rule 12, the owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the Russian (R) owns the snake and is in position 3, the bird cannot be in position 3. So, the bird must be in position 1, and the ferret must be in position 2.

6. From rule 5, the person eating plum is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person eating nectarine. Since the Russian (R) drinks hot-chocolate and is in position 3, the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in position 3. So, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1 or 2.

7. From rule 9, the person eating nectarine is between the Japanese (J) and the fan of country. Since the Russian (R) is in position 3, the Japanese (J) cannot be in position 3. So, the Japanese (J) must be in position 1 or 2.

8. Since the person eating nectarine is a fan of ambient (rule 1), the person eating nectarine cannot be in position 3 (since the Russian (R) is in position 3 and we already know the position of the person eating nectarine). So, the person eating nectarine must be in position 1 or 2.

9. From rule 1, the fan of ambient is the person eating nectarine. So, we know the position of the person eating nectarine.

10. From rule 10, the person watching superhero movies is the manager. Since the Russian (R) is in position 3, the manager cannot be in position 3. So, the manager must be in position 1 or 2.

11. From rule 7, the person eating plum is on the left or right of the Mexican (M). Since the Russian (R) is in position 3, the Mexican (M) cannot be in position 3. So, the Mexican (M) must be in position 1 or 2.

12. Since the person watching thriller movies is on the far right (rule 8), the only position left for the person watching thriller movies is position 3.

13. From rule 10, the person watching superhero movies is the manager. Since the person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the Mexican (M) (rule 11), the manager (superhero watcher) must be on the other side of the Mexican (M). So, the manager (superhero watcher) must be in position 1.

14. From rule 2, the manager is on the left or right of the Russian (R). Since the manager is in position 1, the Russian (R) must be in position 2 or 3. But we already know the position of the Russian (R) from rule 3. So, this rule is contradictory and cannot be true.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a contradiction in the given rules, and it's not possible to solve the puzzle as it stands.

Final solution table:

|               |    1     |     2     |         3          |
| Beverage      | Fanta    | Soy-Milk | Hot-Chocolate      |
| Food          | Nectarine| Plum     |                    |
| Job           | Manager  | Dancer   | Software-Developer  |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance  | Superhero| Thriller            |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  | Country  | Funk                |
| Nationality   | Japanese | Mexican  | Russian             |
| Pet           | Bird    | Ferret   | Snake               |

However, the position of the Russian (R) is incorrect due to the contradiction in rule 2."
Lv4-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the designer is either to the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling, we can place the designer in the first or third position. Let's place the designer in the first position (1).

2. Since the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle, and the turtle is in an odd position (3), the frog must be in an even position (2 or 4). Since the accountant is the owner of the turtle (4), the accountant cannot be in position 2 (because the turtle is in an odd position). So, the frog must be in position 4. Let's place the frog owner (accountant) in position 4.

3. Now, the owner of the turtle (accountant) is in position 4, so the turtle is in position 2.

4. The chinese is the accountant (10), so the chinese is in position 4.

5. The person who's sport is swimming is the chinese (5), so the swimming person is in position 4.

6. The australian is on the left of the person eating onion (6), so the australian cannot be in position 1, 3, or 4. The only remaining position is 2. Let's place the australian in position 2.

7. The person who's sport is baseball is the person eating apple (7), so the baseball player is in position 1.

8. The fan of hip-hop is in the middle (8), so the hip-hop fan is in position 3.

9. The person eating apple is on the right of the fan of folk (9), so the person eating apple (baseball player) is in position 1, and the fan of folk is in position 2.

10. The hobby of the person in position 2 is chess (11), so the nationality of this person is spanish.

11. The musician is on the left or right of the accountant (12), but the accountant is in position 4, so the musician must be in position 3.

12. The food of the person in position 3 is lime, the hobby is chess, the job is musician, the music-genre is folk, the nationality is spanish, the pet is not specified yet, the sport is not specified yet.

13. The person who's sport is swimming is on the far right (13), so the sport of the person in position 1 is baseball, and the sport of the person in position 3 is not swimming. The only remaining sport is parkour, so the person in position 3 plays parkour.

14. The chinese is in an odd position (4), so the nationality of the person in position 3 must be either australian or chinese. Since the chinese is already in position 4, the person in position 3 must be australian.

15. The pet of the person in position 1 is not specified yet. The only remaining pet is horse, so the person in position 1 keeps a horse.

16. The pet of the person in position 3 is not specified yet. Since the person in position 3 is australian, the only remaining pet is turtle (because the accountant, who owns the turtle, is in position 4). So, the person in position 3 keeps a turtle.

The final solution table is:

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Food          | apple    | onion     | lime      |

Lv4-7x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people, so we can number them from 1 to 6.

2. Since the fan of hip-hop is on the far left or far right, let's assume the hip-hop fan is person 1 or 6. If person 1 is the hip-hop fan, then person 6 must be the fan of salsa (since the salsa fan is on the far right). In this case, the jazz fan must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But since the jazz fan is between the German and the project manager, and the German and the project manager must be in positions 2, 3, or 4, the jazz fan can only be in position 5. This means the salsa fan is in position 6, the hip-hop fan is in position 1, and the German, project manager, and paramedic are in positions 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The nationalities and jobs can be filled accordingly.

   | lemonade| peach   | engineer     | salsa     | malaysian | snake | taxi      |

3. Now, the person eating watermelon is the person driving the van, so the van driver is person 1. This means the bike driver is person 6, and the taxi driver is either person 2, 3, or 4. Since the taxi driver is on the left or right of the bike driver, the taxi driver must be in position 2 or 4. But since the paramedic is on the left of the engineer, the taxi driver cannot be the paramedic, so the taxi driver is the project manager (in position 4). This means the bike driver is the paramedic (in position 2).

   | lemonade| peach   | engineer     | salsa     | malaysian | snake | taxi      |

4. The person eating cabbage is on the left of the person driving the van, so the person eating cabbage is person 6 (the paramedic). This means the person eating peach is person 1 (the project manager).

   | lemonade| peach   | engineer     | salsa     | malaysian | snake | taxi      |

5. The person driving the bike is on the far left, so the person driving the bike is person 1 (the project manager). This means the person driving the taxi is person 6 (the paramedic).

   | lemonade| peach   | engineer     | salsa     | malaysian | snake | taxi      |

6. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person driving the bike, so the person driving the taxi is either person 2 or 4. But since the paramedic is on the left of the engineer, the person driving the taxi cannot be the paramedic, so the person driving the taxi is the engineer (in position 2).

   | lemonade| peach   | engineer     | salsa     | malaysian | snake | taxi      |

7. The person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the malaysian. Since the project manager (who is eating watermelon) is on the far right, the person eating watermelon cannot be on the left of the malaysian. So, the malaysian must be in position 3.

Lv4-7x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the scientist is eating grapefruit, so we can place the scientist in the third column and third row (since there are three types of food and beverages). Let's mark it as S.

2. The person driving the airplane is on the far right, so it must be in the third column. Since there are three types of transport, it can't be in the same row as the scientist (because the scientist is already there). Let's mark it as A.

4. The mechanic is on the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the scientist (who is a sailor) is in the third column, the mechanic must be in the second column. The mechanic's sport is rugby, so let's mark it as M (mechanic) in the second row and second column.

5. The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person drinking water. Since the mechanic is in the second column, the person watching documentary movies must be in the third column. Since there are three types of beverages, the person drinking water must be in the first row. Let's mark it as D (documentary) in the first row and third column.

6. The person eating peach is in an even position. Since the scientist (grapefruit) and the mechanic (rugby) are in odd positions, the person eating peach must be in the second column. Since the person watching documentary movies is already there, the person eating peach must be in the first row. Let's mark it as P (peach) in the first row and second column.

7. The person driving the scooter is the colombian. Since the scientist (grapefruit) is driving the airplane and the mechanic (rugby) is driving the scooter, the colombian must be in the second row and second column (since the mechanic is already there). Let's mark it as C (colombian) in the second row and second column.

   | Transport     |            | A (airplane) |             |

8. The person watching comedy movies is the dutch. Since the mechanic (rugby) is in the second row and second column, the dutch must be in the third row and third column (since the scientist and the mechanic are already there). Let's mark it as N (dutch) in the third row and third column.

   | Transport     |            | A (airplane) |             |

9. The person drinking iced-tea is the scientist (grapefruit). Since the scientist is already marked, we don't need to change anything.

   | Transport     |            | A (airplane) |             |

10. The person's sport is basketball. Since the mechanic (rugby) and the scientist (sailing) already have sports, the person playing basketball must be the paramedic. Let's mark it as B (basketball) in the first row and second column.

    |               |     1      |     2      |      3      |
    | Beverage      | B (basketball)| D (water)  | N (dutch)   |

    | Sport         | B (basketball)|             |             |
    | Transport     |            | A (airplane) |             |

11. The last remaining sport is rugby. Since the mechanic (rugby) is already marked, we don't need to change anything.

    |               |     1      |     2      |      3      |
    | Beverage      | B (basketball)| D (water)  | N (dutch)   |

    | Nationality   | C (colombian) |            | N (dutch)   |
    | Sport         | B (basketball)|             | R (rugby)   |
    | Transport     |            | A (airplane) |             |

12. The last remaining transport is train. Since the airplane and the scooter are already marked, let's mark the train in the first row and third column.

    |               |     1      |     2      |      3      |
    | Beverage      | B (basketball)| D (water)  | N (dutch)   |
    | Food          | P (peach)  | C (colombian)| S (grapefruit) |
    | Job           | B (paramedic)| C (colombian)| Sailor      |
    | Movie-Genre   | D (documentary) |            | N (comedy)  |
    | Nationality   | C (colombian) |            | N (dutch)   |
    | Sport         | B (basketball)|             | R (rugby)   |
    | Transport     | T (train)   | A (airplane) |             |

So, the final solution table is:

   |               |     1      |     2      |      3      |

Lv4-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 different hobbies, we can place them in the first column from left to right (Chess, Gardening, Singing).

2. Similarly, we can place the jobs in the second column from left to right (Dressmaker, Project-Manager, Pilot).

3. The same goes for movie-genres (Animation, Disaster, Spy), music-genres (Blues, Classical, Metal), nationalities (American, German, Indonesian), sports (Basketball, Soccer, Water-polo), and transport (Bus, Scooter, Tram).

Now let's apply the given conditions:

4. The fan of metal is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we already placed gardening, we know that metal can only be in the second or third row. Let's place it in the second row for now.

5. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since we already placed soccer (Pilot), basketball can be either in the first or third row. Let's place it in the first row for now.

6. The fan of classical is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed gardening and metal, classical can only be in the third column.

7. The project-manager is the person watching spy movies. Since we already placed spy movies (Project-Manager), we know that the Project-Manager is in the second row.

8. The person watching animation movies is the person driving the bus. Since we already placed spy movies (Project-Manager), animation can't be in the second row. So, animation is either in the first or third row. Let's place it in the first row for now.

9. The person driving the tram is in an even position. Since we already placed the first three elements in the first, second, and third rows, the tram driver must be in the fourth row.

10. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the fan of metal. Since we already placed metal in the second row, gardening can only be in the first or third row. Let's place it in the third row for now.

11. The indonesian is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since we already placed disaster movies, indonesian can only be in the second or third column. Let's place it in the third column for now.

12. The person who's sport is soccer is the pilot. Since we already placed soccer (Pilot), we know that the Pilot is in the second row.

13. The german is the fan of blues. Since we already placed blues, german can only be in the second or third column. Let's place it in the second column for now.

Now we have a table with some elements placed:

| Hobby   | Chess   | Gardening | Singing |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Job     | Dressmaker| Project-Manager | Pilot |
| Movie-Genre| Animation | Disaster | Spy |
| Music-Genre | Blues | Classical | Metal |
| Nationality | American | German | Indonesian |
| Sport   | Basketball | Soccer | Water-polo |
| Transport | Bus | Tram | Scooter |

We still need to place the remaining elements (Disaster, Water-polo, and Scooter) according to the conditions. However, with the given information, it's impossible to place these elements uniquely. There are multiple possible solutions for the remaining elements.

Final solution table (one of the possible solutions):

#############
| Hobby   | Chess   | Gardening | Singing |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Job     | Dressmaker| Project-Manager | Pilot |
| Movie-Genre| Animation | Disaster | Spy |

Lv4-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 categories, so each person has one unique item in each category.

2. Let's start with the given information:
   - The first person is Chinese (Nationality) and is on the far left (Position).
   - The second person's hobby is dancing (Hobby), which must be an even position (Position).
   - The third person's hobby is filmmaking (Hobby), and they are on the right of the scientist (Hobby, Job).
   - The fourth person drinks iced-tea (Beverage), and the security-guard is on the left of this person (Job, Position).
   - The fifth person's hobby is writing (Hobby), and their position is not specified yet.
   - The sixth person is a scientist (Job), and they are on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (Job, Hobby).

3. Now let's use the information about the hedgehog (Pet) and sprite (Beverage):
   - The person who drinks sprite is the owner of the frog (Beverage, Pet). Since the Chinese is already taken, the person drinking sprite must be the second person (Position). So, the second person's beverage is sprite, and they own a frog.
   - The person who owns the hedgehog must be either the third, fourth, or sixth person. Since the third person is already taken, and the fourth person drinks iced-tea, the sixth person must own the hedgehog (Pet).

4. Now let's use the information about the sports (Sport):
   - The person who does parkour is either the third, fourth, or sixth person. Since the third person's hobby is filmmaking and the fourth person drinks iced-tea, the sixth person must do parkour (Sport).
   - The person who does golf is either the first, second, or fifth person. Since the second person drinks sprite and the fifth person's hobby is not specified yet, the first person must do golf (Sport).
   - The person who does cycling is either the third, fifth, or sixth person. Since the third person's hobby is filmmaking, the fifth person must do cycling (Sport).

5. Now let's use the information about the music genres (Music-Genre):
   - The person who likes blues is either the first, second, or fifth person. Since the second person drinks sprite and the fifth person does cycling, the first person must like blues (Music-Genre).
   - The person who likes country is between the person who does golf and the person who does filmmaking (Music-Genre, Sport, Hobby). Since the first person likes blues and the third person does filmmaking, the fourth person must like country (Music-Genre).
   - The person who likes pop is on the left or right of the scientist (Hobby, Job). Since the third person does filmmaking and the fifth person does cycling, the fourth person must like pop (Hobby).

6. Now let's use the information about the remaining positions:
   - The fifth person's hobby is writing (Hobby). Since the second person drinks sprite and the sixth person does parkour, the fifth person must be in an even position (Position, Hobby). So, the fifth person is the fourth person, and their hobby is writing.
   - The sixth person does parkour (Sport). Since the fourth person likes pop and the fifth person writes, the sixth person must be on the right of the person who does parkour (Sport, Position). So, the sixth person is in the last position.

7. Now we have all the information filled in the table:

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | iced-tea      | sprite    |  lemonade    |
   | Hobby         | dancing       | filmmaking| writing      |
   | Job           | scientist     | security-guard| social-worker |
   | Music-Genre   | blues        | pop       | country      |
   | Nationality   | chinese      | mexican   | egyptian     |
   | Pet           | dog          | frog      | hedgehog     |
   | Sport         | cycling      | golf      | parkour      |

8. To make sure all the conditions are satisfied, let's verify:
   - The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour (Pet, Sport). The sixth person owns the hedgehog and does parkour, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The fan of pop is on the left or right of the scientist (Hobby, Job). The fourth person likes pop and is on the right of the scientist, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The fan of country is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's hobby is filmmaking (Music-Genre, Sport, Hobby). The fourth person likes country, the first person does golf, and the third person does filmmaking, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The person drinking sprite is the owner of the frog (Beverage, Pet). The second person drinks sprite and owns a frog, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The chinese is on the far left (Nationality, Position). The first person is Chinese, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the scientist (Hobby, Job). The third person does filmmaking and is on the right of the scientist, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour (Pet, Sport). The sixth person owns the hedgehog and does parkour, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The person who's hobby is dancing is in an even position (Hobby, Position). The second person does dancing, and their position is even, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the fan of blues (Beverage, Music-Genre). The fourth person drinks iced-tea, and the first person likes blues, so this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the number of items in each category, so we can fill in the number of items in each row.

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |

| Transport     |             |            |               |

2. From point 12, the person who's sport is skateboarding is in an odd position. Since there are 3 people, the skateboarder must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, since the scientist is the skateboarder (point 1), the skateboarder must be in position 1 (odd) because the scientist is the first job (position 1).

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |

| Transport     |             |            |               |

3. From point 11, the person driving the scooter is the person drinking milk (point 13). So, the milk drinker must be in position 2 (since the skateboarder is in position 1).

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | Lemonade   | Milk      | Mirinda      |

| Transport     |             | Scooter    |               |

4. From point 14, the person watching animation movies is on the far left or far right. Since the skateboarder is on the far right (point 6), the animation watcher must be on the far left. So, the animation watcher is in position 1.

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | Lemonade   | Milk      | Mirinda      |

| Transport     | Quad-bike  | Scooter    | Train         |

5. From point 4, the dressmaker is in position 3. Since the dressmaker watches disaster movies (point 4), the disaster movie watcher is in position 3.

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | Lemonade   | Milk      | Mirinda      |

| Transport     | Quad-bike  | Scooter    | Train         |

6. From point 3, the german is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the journalist is the rugby player (point 5), the german must be on the right of the journalist. However, the german cannot be in position 1 (point 7), so the german must be in position 2.

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |

| Transport     | Quad-bike  | Scooter    | Train         |

7. From point 9, the french is between the person eating pineapple and the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in position 3, the french must be in position 2 or 4. However, the french cannot be in position 2 (point 6), so the french must be in position 4.

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |

| Transport     | Quad-bike  | Scooter    | Train         |

8. From point 10, the german is on the far left or far right. However, we already placed the german in position 2. So, the german must be on the far right.

9. From point 8, the german is on the far right. Since the german is in position 2, the Polish nationality must be in position 3.

10. From point 15, the person eating nectarine is on the left or right of the person eating cauliflower. Since the French is in position 4 and eats pineapple, the person eating nectarine must be in position 1 or 3. However, the person eating nectarine cannot be in position 1 (point 2), so the person eating nectarine must be in position 3.

11. From point 5, the person who's sport is rugby is the journalist. Since the journalist is in position 2, the sport water-polo must be in position 1 or 3 (since skateboarding is in position 3). However, the sport water-polo cannot be in position 1 (point 8), so the sport water-polo must be in position 3.

| Transport     | Quad-bike  | Scooter    | Train         |

12. From point 8, the sport water-polo is in position 3. Since the water-polo player cannot be on the far left or far right (point 8), the water-polo player must be in position 3.

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |

Lv4-7x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 categories, so each category has one person. Let's label the people A, B, C, D, E, F from left to right.

2. Let's start with the Beverage category. Since there are 3 different beverages, we can assign them to the first three people: A (cola), B (iced-tea), and C (juice).

3. Now let's move to the Food category. Since the person eating grapes is on the left of the fan of rock, A cannot eat grapes. So, A eats peas, and let's say B eats grapes. This means C eats pineapple.

4. Let's assign jobs. The firefighter is in an even position, so it's either B or D. Since the subway driver is in an odd position (later we'll see that it's C), the firefighter cannot be B or C. So, the firefighter is D, and the designer is A, writer is E, and the job of F is yet to be determined.

5. The fan of trance is on the left or right of the designer, so it's either A or C. Since the firefighter is D, trance cannot be on the left of the designer (as firefighter is in an even position), so trance is on the right of the designer, i.e., C. So, the music genre of A is blues, and the music genre of F is yet to be determined.

6. The japanese is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the firefighter (D) cannot be the japanese (as firefighter is in an even position), the japanese is either B or C. Since the subway driver (C) is already determined, the japanese is B. So, the nationality of A is dutch, and the nationality of F is yet to be determined.

7. The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the firefighter (D) cannot be the sailor (as firefighter is in an even position), the sailor is either E or F. Since the subway driver (C) is already determined, the sailor cannot be C. So, the sailor is E, and the sport of F is golf.

8. The person who's sport is parkour is the person drinking juice. Since the firefighter (D) cannot be the parkour player (as firefighter is in an even position), the parkour player is either A, B, or F. Since the subway driver (C) is already determined, the parkour player cannot be C. So, the parkour player is A, and the sport of B is yet to be determined.

9. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the indian. Since the parkour player is A, the indian is B. So, the nationality of C is japanese, and the nationality of F is yet to be determined.

10. The person driving the subway is the person eating pineapple. This is already determined (C).

11. The japanese is on the right of the person driving the subway. This is also already determined (B).

12. The writer is on the right of the person driving the tram. Since the subway driver (C) is already determined, the writer cannot be C. So, the writer is F, and the job of A is yet to be determined.

13. The only job left is designer. Since the designer is on the left of the fan of trance (C), the designer cannot be F (as writer is on the right of the designer). So, the designer is A.

Lv4-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the number of options for each category, so we can start filling in the categories with their respective options. Let's start with Beverage. Since the librarian is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk, the librarian can't be in the first position. So, the first position must be one of the other two beverages, let's say water. The second position must be soy-milk because the librarian is on its right. The third position is then lemonade.

   | Beverage | water | soy-milk | lemonade |
   |---------|-------|----------|----------|

2. Since the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the social-worker, the social-worker must be in the second position. So, the first position is water (librarian's beverage), the second position is soy-milk (social-worker's right), and the third position is lemonade (person drinking it).

   | Beverage | water | soy-milk | lemonade |
   |---------|-------|----------|----------|

   | Transport|       |          |          |

3. The person who's sport is baseball is on the far left. Since we already have three beverages, the first position must be baseball. The hobby of the person playing baseball is chess according to rule 5, so the first position for Hobby is chess. The job of the chess player is the librarian, so the first position for Job is librarian.

   | Beverage | water | soy-milk | lemonade |

   | Transport|       |          |          |

4. The person who's hobby is dancing is the fan of country music according to rule 6. So, the second position for Music-Genre is country. The second position for Hobby is dancing.

   | Transport|       |          |          |

7. The person driving the motorbike is on the far right according to rule 10. Since we already have three beverages, three hobbies, three jobs, three music-genres, three pets, and two sports, the third position for Transport must be motorbike.

Lv4-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the positions of the nationalities, so we can fill in the Nationality column first. Let's assume the positions are American (A), Dutch (D), and Turkish (T) from left to right.

2. Since the teacher is Turkish, we can fill in the Job column for the third position as Teacher (T).

3. From rule 10, the teacher is in an odd position, so the first and second positions cannot be the teacher. Therefore, the first position must be the architect (A) and the second position must be the security-guard (S).

4. The architect is on the far right, so we can fill in the Job column for the third position. Now, the first position is the architect (A) and the second position is the security-guard (S).

5. The person eating grapes is on the far right, so the first, second, and third positions cannot be grapes (G). Let's assume the positions are carrot (C), grapes (G), and onion (O) from left to right.

6. The person eating carrot is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver cannot be in the first position (as it's an odd position and the teacher is there), the snowmobile driver must be in the second position (S). This means the first position must be onion (O).

7. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the fanta cannot be in the first position (as it's between the traveling hobby and the chess hobby), the almond-milk must be in the first position (A). This means the second position must be fanta (F).

8. The person drinking fanta is between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person who's hobby is chess. Since the traveling hobby cannot be in the first position (as it's on the left or right of the person watching drama movies), the traveling hobby must be in the third position (T). This means the second position must be chess (C).

9. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since the milk cannot be in the first position (as it's on the left of the fanta), the milk must be in the second position (F). This means the first position cannot be the taxi (X), so it must be the onion (O).

10. The person watching drama movies is the person eating carrot. Since the carrot is in the first position (O), the person watching drama movies is in the first position (D).

11. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the traveling hobby is in the third position (T), the person watching drama movies must be in the second position (D). This means the hobby of the person in the first position is chess (C).

12. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the traveling hobby is in the third position (T), the person with the hobby of collecting must be in the second position (C). This means the hobby of the person in the first position is chess (A).

13. The security-guard is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the traveling hobby is in the third position (T), the security-guard must be in the second position (S). This means the hobby of the person in the first position is chess (A).

14. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person with the hobby of collecting is in the second position (C), the person watching martial-arts movies must be in the first position (A).

So, the final solution table is:
