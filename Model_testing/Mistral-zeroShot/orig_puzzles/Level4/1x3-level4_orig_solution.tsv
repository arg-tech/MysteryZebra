Lv4-1x3-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three sports: rugby, skateboarding, and surfing.

2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing. This means that skateboarding cannot be in the first position, and surfing cannot be in the last position. So, the possible arrangements for surfing and skateboarding are:
   - Surfing - 1, Skateboarding - 2 or 3
   - Surfing - 2, Skateboarding - 1 or 3
   - Surfing - 3, Skateboarding - 1 or 2

3. The person who's sport is rugby is on the far right. This means rugby must be in the last position. So, the possible arrangements for rugby are:
   - Surfing - 1, Skateboarding - 2, Rugby - 3
   - Surfing - 2, Skateboarding - 1, Rugby - 3
   - Surfing - 3, Skateboarding - 1, Rugby - 2 (This is the only arrangement where rugby is in an odd position)

4. Since the positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3, and we have already determined that surfing and skateboarding cannot be in the first position, the only possible arrangement is:
   - Surfing - 2, Skateboarding - 1, Rugby - 3

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|         |    2    |       1       |   3   |
| Sport   |         |               |       |
#############
Sport 2 is surfing, Sport 1 is skateboarding, and Sport 3 is rugby."
Lv4-1x3-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three types of food: cabbage, carrot, and watermelon.

2. The person eating carrot is in an odd position, which means they cannot be in position 1 or 3 because those are even numbers. So, the carrot eater must be in position 2.

3. The person eating cabbage is on the far left, which means they must be in position 1.

4. This leaves position 3 for the watermelon eater.

So, the final solution table is:

|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage | Carrot    | Watermelon |

#############

Lv4-1x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and they have 3 different hobbies, each hobby must be assigned to one person. Let's label the positions as A, B, and C from left to right.

2. From rule 1, the person who has drawing as a hobby is in position 4, which means it can only be either B or C. Let's assume it's B for now.

3. From rule 2, the person who has drawing as a hobby is either to the left or right of the person who has magic-tricks as a hobby. If drawing is in B, then magic-tricks can only be in A or C. If magic-tricks is in A, then board-games must be in C, which contradicts rule 3 (drawing in B and magic-tricks in A would mean magic-tricks is not to the right of drawing). So, magic-tricks must be in C.

4. Now, we know that drawing is in B and magic-tricks is in C. This means board-games must be in A.

5. So, the final solution table is:

   |         |      1      |    2    |      3       |
   | Hobby   | Board-games | Drawing | Magic-tricks |

   This is the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv4-1x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three music genres: country, jazz, and techno. Since there are only three genres and three positions, each genre must be in a separate position.

2. The fan of jazz is in an odd position. Since positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3, and odd numbers are 1 and 3, jazz could be in position 1 or 3. However, since the fan of techno is on the left of the fan of jazz, jazz cannot be in position 1. So, jazz must be in position 3.

3. Now we know that jazz is in position 3. Since there are only two positions left, techno must be in position 1, and country must be in position 2.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Country  | Jazz |  Techno |
#############
```

This solution satisfies both conditions: the fan of jazz is in an odd position (position 3), and the fan of techno is on the left of the fan of jazz (position 1)."
Lv4-1x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 3 types of food: kiwi, onion, and papaya.

2. The person eating onion is in an odd position, which means they can only be in position 1 or 3.

3. If the onion eater is in position 1, then the papaya eater must be in position 2 (since the onion eater is on the left of the papaya eater). But this would mean the kiwi eater is in position 3, and since positions are numbered 1-3, this is not possible.

4. So, the onion eater must be in position 3. This means the papaya eater is in position 2 and the kiwi eater is in position 1.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
|   1   |   2    |  3   |
#############
| kiwi   | papaya | onion|
```

This is the only possible arrangement given the conditions provided."
Lv4-1x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 3 beverages: 7up, hot-chocolate, mirinda.

2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. This means that hot-chocolate cannot be in the rightmost position (position 3). So, the possible positions for hot-chocolate are 1 or 2.

3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position. Since position 1 is odd, hot-chocolate must be in position 2.

4. Now we know that hot-chocolate is in position 2. So, mirinda must be in position 3 because it is to the right of hot-chocolate.

5. This leaves position 1 for 7up.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|            |  1  |       2       |    3    |
| Beverage   | 7up |   hot-chocolate | mirinda |

Lv4-1x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three jobs: analyst, designer, and engineer. Let's label them A, D, and E respectively.

2. The engineer is on the right of the designer. This means E cannot be in the first column (1) and D cannot be in the last column (3). So, the possible positions for D and E in the first row are (1,2) and (2,1).

3. The engineer is in an even position. Since the positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3, the only even position is 2. This means E must be in the second column (2).

4. Now we know the engineer is in the second column (2), so the designer must be in the first column (1).

5. Since the engineer is in the second position (2), the only remaining job for the third column (3) is the analyst (A).

So, the final solution table is:

```
|       |    1     |    2     |    3    |
| Job   |  Analyst | Designer| Engineer|
```

Therefore, the final solution table is:

```

| Job   |  Analyst | Designer| Engineer|

Lv4-1x3-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three jobs: designer, paramedic, and teacher. Let's assign them the letters D, P, and T respectively.

2. Since the teacher is in an odd position (position 1, 3), the teacher cannot be in position 1 because the table only has three positions. So, the teacher must be in position 3. This means T is in position 3.

3. The teacher is on the right of the paramedic. Since we know the teacher is in position 3, the paramedic must be in position 1 or 2. If the paramedic were in position 1, the teacher would be on the left of the paramedic, which contradicts the given information. So, the paramedic must be in position 2. This means P is in position 2.

4. Now we know the positions of the teacher and paramedic. The only job left is the designer. Since there are only three positions and the teacher and paramedic are already placed, the designer must be in position 1. This means D is in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|    1     |     2     |    3    |
|  D       |      P    |   T    |

This table represents the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv4-1x3-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three beverages: cola, fanta, and iced-tea.

2. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking cola. This means that either iced-tea is in position 2 or 3, and cola is in position 1.

3. The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position. Since positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3, and an odd position means either 1 or 3, iced-tea cannot be in position 2. So, iced-tea is either in position 1 or 3.

4. If iced-tea were in position 1, then cola would have to be in position 3, but that would mean both iced-tea and cola are in even positions, which contradicts the fact that iced-tea is in an odd position.

5. Therefore, iced-tea must be in position 3. Since iced-tea is on the right of cola, cola must be in position 1.

6. The remaining beverage, fanta, must be in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   1   |  2   |    3     |
| cola  | fanta|  iced-tea |

Lv4-1x3-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have three types of food: papaya, pepper, and plum. Let's assign them the numbers 1, 2, and 3 respectively for easier reference.

2. The person eating pepper is on the left of the person eating papaya. This means that either pepper is in position 1 and papaya is in position 2, or pepper is in position 2 and papaya is in position 3.

3. The person eating papaya is in an even position. Since positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3, the only even position is position 2. So, from the first point, we know that either pepper is in position 1 and papaya is in position 2, or pepper is in position 2 and papaya is in position 3, but we know that papaya is in position 2.

4. Therefore, pepper must be in position 1 and plum must be in position 3.
