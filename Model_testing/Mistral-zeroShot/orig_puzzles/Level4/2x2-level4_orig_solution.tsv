Lv4-2x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different hobbies (card-games and collecting) and two different jobs (mechanic and teacher). So, each person must have one unique hobby and one unique job.

2. The mechanic is in an even position, which means he must be either in position 2 or 4. Since the hobbies are different, the person in position 1 cannot be the mechanic. So, the mechanic must be in position 4.

3. Now we know that the teacher is the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the mechanic is not the person in position 1 (as he is the mechanic), the teacher must be in position 1.

4. Now we know the teacher's hobby is collecting, so the person in position 2 must have the other hobby, which is card-games.

5. Lastly, we know that the jobs are different, so the person in position 2 cannot be a teacher (as the teacher is already in position 1). Therefore, the person in position 2 must be a mechanic.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Teacher   | Mechanic  |
| Job     | Collector | Mechanic  |

Lv4-2x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different sports (sailing and weightlifting) and two different beverages (coffee and soy-milk).

2. Since there are two of each, they must be distributed in the two positions (1 and 2).

3. The person who does sailing is in an odd position. So, the sailor must be in position 1 or 3 (since 1 is an odd number).

4. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking coffee. If the sailor is in position 1, then the coffee drinker must be in position 2, and the soy-milk drinker in position 1. But this violates the rule that the sailor is in an odd position. So, the sailor must be in position 3.

5. Now, the coffee drinker must be in position 1, and the soy-milk drinker in position 2.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|            |    1     |       2       |
| Beverage   | Coffee   |   Soy-Milk   |
| Sport      | Sailing  | Weightlifting |

```

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv4-2x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different music genres: ambient and house. Let's label them as A and H for simplicity.

2. We also know there are two different nationalities: Canadian and Turkish. Let's label them as C and T for simplicity.

3. The Canadian is in an odd position, which means they can only be in position 1 or 3. Since the fan of house is on the left of the fan of ambient, if the Canadian was in position 1, they would have to prefer house, which contradicts the fact that they prefer a different genre from the Turkish. So, the Canadian must be in position 3.

4. Now we know the Canadian prefers a genre different from house, so they must prefer ambient (A). This means the Turkish must prefer house (H).

5. Since the Canadian is in position 3 and prefers A, the only remaining position for the Turkish is position 1.

6. Now we know the Turkish prefers H, so the only remaining genre for the person in position 2 is ambient (A).

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |    1     |    2    |
  | Music-Genre   |   House  | Ambient |
  | Nationality   |   Turkish| Canadian |

Lv4-2x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two different beverages (7up, lemonade) and two different types of food (broccoli, mango).

2. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking 7up. This means that either the row or the column where lemonade is placed is to the right of the row or column where 7up is placed.

3. The person eating mango is in an even position. Since there are only two items in each row and column, the only even positions are the second position in the first row and the second position in the second row for the beverages, and the first position in both rows for the foods.

4. Combining the information from points 2 and 3, we can deduce that the person drinking 7up must be in the first column (odd position), and the person drinking lemonade must be in the second column (even position).

5. Now, let's place the foods. Since the person eating mango is in an even position, it must be in the second row (even position). The only remaining food is broccoli, which must be in the first row (odd position).

6. Finally, let's place the beverages. Since 7up is in the first column, it must be in the first row. The only remaining beverage is lemonade, which must be in the second row.

The final solution table is:

  |            |    1     |    2     |

Lv4-2x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two jobs (fisherman and social-worker) and two nationalities (Dutch and Polish). So, each cell should contain one job and one nationality.

2. The Dutch is in the even-numbered position, and there are 4 positions in total. So, the Dutch must be in position 4 (since counting from 1, the even numbers are 2 and 4).

3. The social-worker is to the right of the fisherman. Since the Dutch is in position 4, the only possible position for the fisherman is position 3 (as position 1 is already taken).

4. Now we know the fisherman is in position 3 and the Dutch is in position 4. Since the social-worker is to the right of the fisherman, the social-worker must be in position 2.

5. To determine the nationalities, we know the Dutch is in position 4, so the nationality in position 4 must be Dutch. Since the fisherman is in position 3, the nationality in position 3 must be the other nationality, which is Polish (as Dutch is already taken).

6. Similarly, since the social-worker is in position 2, the nationality in position 2 must also be Polish (as Dutch is already taken).

The final solution table is:

|               |     1     |       2       |

Lv4-2x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the people prefer 2 different types of sports (climbing and rugby), we can write them in the first column as follows:

   |             |   1   |     2     |
   | Sport       | Climbing | Rugby  |

2. Similarly, since the people use 2 different means of transport (motorbike and ship), we can write them in the second column:

   |             |   1   |     2     |
   | Sport       | Climbing | Rugby  |
   | Transport   | Motorbike | Ship  |

3. Now, let's apply the information from the clues:

   a) The person driving the motorbike is in an even position. Since there are only two positions, this means the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2 (Rugby).

   b) The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since Climbing is in position 1, the person driving the ship must be in position 1 (Motorcycle).

4. Now we can rearrange the table to reflect the correct positions:

   |             |   1   |     2     |
   | Sport       | Climbing | Rugby  |
   | Transport   | Ship  | Motorbike |

5. To make sure the person driving the motorbike is in an even position, we can rearrange the Transport column:

   |             |   1   |     2     |
   | Sport       | Climbing | Rugby  |
   | Transport   | Motorbike | Ship  |

6. Finally, we can put the solution in the final solution table:

Lv4-2x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people have 2 different hobbies (gardening, sudoku) and 2 different jobs (firefighter, journalist). So, we can fill in one hobby and one job for each row. Let's start with the hobbies:

|         |      1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Gardening  | Sudoku    |

2. Now, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the journalist. So, the first row must have the gardener, and the second row must have the sudoku enthusiast.

|         |      1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Gardening  | Sudoku    |
| Job     | Firefighter| Journalist|

3. The journalist is in the even position, which is the second row according to our numbering. So, the job of the first row must be firefighter, and the second row must be journalist.

|         |      1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Gardening  | Sudoku    |
| Job     | Firefighter| Journalist|

4. To make sure we have the correct positions, let's check the hobbies again. The gardener is on the left, so the first row should have gardening, and the second row should have sudoku. They are in the correct positions, so our solution is correct.

Lv4-2x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two nationalities (Australian and Pakistani) and two pets (Dog and Frog).

2. The owner of the frog is in an odd position, which means it can't be in the first position (position 1) because the numbering is odd-starting. So, the frog must be in the second position (position 2).

3. The Australian is on the left of the Pakistani. Since the nationalities are different, the only way to arrange them with this condition is to put the Australian in the first position (position 1) and the Pakistani in the second position (position 2).

4. Now we know the nationalities, and we know the pet of the second position (the frog). So, the pet of the first position (the dog) can be placed.

Final solution:

Lv4-2x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two jobs (doctor and electrician) and two nationalities (Canadian and German). So, we can create a 2x2 table with four cells, each representing a person with their job and nationality.

   |               |   1    |      2      |
   | Job           |       |             |
   | Nationality   |       |             |

2. The Canadian is in an even position, which means they must be in either the first or the second row (since positions are numbered 1 and 2). Let's assume the Canadian is in the first row for now.

   |               |   1    |      2      |
   | Job           | Canadian|             |
   | Nationality   |       |             |

3. Now, the electrician is on the right of the doctor. Since the Canadian is in the first row, the doctor must be in the second row. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |   1    |      2      |
   | Job           | Canadian| Doctor     |
   | Nationality   |       | German     |

4. Now we know the nationality of the people in the first and second rows. Since there are only two nationalities, the person in the first column must be German.

   |               |   1    |      2      |
   | Job           | Canadian| Doctor     |
   | Nationality   | German | German     |

5. Finally, we know that there are two different jobs, so the person in the first column must be an electrician.

Lv4-2x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different types of food (blueberry and corn) and two different music-genres (country and folk).

2. The fan of folk is the person eating corn. This means that the person eating blueberry must be the fan of country (since there's only one spot left for the country fan).

3. The fan of country is in an even position. Since we already know the position of the country fan (it's the one eating blueberry), we can check the positions. The even positions are 2 and 4. However, position 4 is already taken by the folk fan (who eats corn), so the country fan must be in position 2.

4. Now we know the positions and the food preferences of the fans. So, the final table would look like this:
