Lv4-4x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the nigerian is on the left or right of the project-manager, the project-manager can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the project-manager can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6.

2. The analyst is in an odd position, so they can't be in positions 2, 4, or 6. So, the analyst can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

3. The fan of ambient is on the left of the indonesian, so the indonesian can't be in position 1. So, the indonesian can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. The person drinking tea is on the right of the fan of salsa, and the fan of salsa is the person drinking sprite. So, the sprite can't be in position 1. So, the sprite can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the analyst. Since the analyst can't be in position 1, the hot-chocolate can't be in position 1 either. So, the hot-chocolate can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

6. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the analyst, and the analyst can't be in position 5. So, the hot-chocolate can't be in position 5 either. So, the hot-chocolate can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

7. The fan of salsa is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, and the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be in position 5. So, the fan of salsa can't be in position 5 either. So, the fan of salsa can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. The project-manager is on the right of the fan of house. Since the fan of salsa can't be in position 5, the fan of house can't be in position 5 either. So, the fan of house can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

9. The turkish is in an even position. Since the project-manager can't be in position 1, the turkish can't be in position 1 either. So, the turkish can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

10. The fan of d&b is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since the analyst can't be in position 1, the fan of d&b can't be in position 1 either. So, the fan of d&b can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

11. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the analyst. Since the analyst can't be in position 5, the person drinking tea can't be in position 5 either. So, the person drinking tea can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

12. The person drinking tea is on the right of the indonesian. Since the indonesian can't be in position 1, the person drinking tea can't be in position 1 either. So, the person drinking tea can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

13. The person drinking tea is on the right of the indonesian, and the indonesian can't be in position 5. So, the person drinking tea can't be in position 5 either. So, the person drinking tea can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

14. The turkish is on the left of the fan of trance. Since the fan of trance can't be in position 1, the turkish can't be in position 2 either. So, the turkish can be in positions 3, 4, or 6.

15. The fan of salsa is the person drinking sprite. Since the sprite can't be in position 1, the fan of salsa can't be in position 2 either. So, the fan of salsa can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

16. The fan of salsa is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, and the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be in position 5. So, the fan of salsa can't be in position 5 either. So, the fan of salsa can be in positions 3 or 4.

Now, let's check the possibilities:

- If the fan of salsa is in position 3, then the fan of salsa is the person drinking sprite, the person drinking tea is in position 4, the project-manager is in position 2, the fan of house is in position 1, the fan of d&b is in position 5, the person drinking milk is in position 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, the indonesian is in position 4, and the turkish is in position 6. This satisfies all the conditions.

- If the fan of salsa is in position 4, then the fan of salsa is the person drinking sprite, the person drinking tea is in position 3, the project-manager is in position 2, the fan of house is in position 1, the fan of d&b is in position 5, the person drinking milk is in position 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, the indonesian is in position 3, and the turkish is in position 6. This also satisfies all the conditions.

So, both positions 3 and 4 for the fan of salsa work. Here is the final solution table for the case where the fan of salsa is in position 3:

```
#############
| soy-milk   | project-manager | salsa (Sprite) | tea | hot-chocolate |
| analyst    |                |                |     |              |

And here is the final solution table for the case where the fan of salsa is in position 4:

```
#############
| soy-milk   | project-manager | tea | salsa (Sprite) | hot-chocolate |
| analyst    |                |     |                |              |

Both solutions are valid."
Lv4-4x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 3, the person who's hobby is drawing is the fan of techno. Let's place them in the 5th position (Techno).

2. From point 1, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person driving the roller (Roller). Since Techno is in the 5th position, Roller must be in either the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. Let's place Roller in the 4th position for now.

3. From point 11, the person driving the roller is on the right of the person driving the boat (Boat). So, Boat must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position. Let's place Boat in the 1st position.

4. From point 14, the owner of the turtle is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing (Techno). Since Techno is in the 5th position, Turtle must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th position. Let's place Turtle in the 2nd position for now.

5. From point 9, the owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the fan of disco (Disco). Since Turtle is in the 2nd position and we need to place Goldfish, Disco must be in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Let's place Disco in the 3rd position for now.

6. From point 6, the fan of reggae is in an odd position. Since Disco is in the 3rd position, Reggae must be in the 1st, 5th, or an unassigned position.

7. From point 10, the owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games (Card-games). Since Goldfish is in the 2nd position and we need to place Card-games, Card-games must be in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Let's place Card-games in the 5th position for now.

8. From point 8, the person who's hobby is cooking is between the person who's hobby is drawing (Techno) and the person driving the boat (Boat). Since Techno is in the 5th position and Boat is in the 1st position, Cooking must be in the 2nd or 4th position. Let's place Cooking in the 2nd position.

9. From point 4, the owner of the rat is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking). Since Cooking is in the 2nd position, Rat must be in the 1st position.

10. From point 7, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog (Hedgehog). Since Rat is in the 1st position and we need to place Hedgehog, Hedgehog must be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Let's place Hedgehog in the 3rd position for now.

11. From point 2, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the fan of d&b (D&B). Since D&B is not placed yet, let's place D&B in the 4th position for now.

12. From point 12, the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left or right of the fan of reggae (Reggae). Since Reggae is in the 1st position and Cooking is in the 2nd position, Reggae must be in the 5th position.

13. From point 13, the owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike (Quad-bike). Since Turtle is in the 2nd position and we need to place Quad-bike, Quad-bike must be in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Let's place Quad-bike in the 4th position for now.

14. From point 1, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the fan of d&b (D&B). Since D&B is in the 4th position and Woodworking is not placed yet, Woodworking must be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th position. Let's place Woodworking in the 1st position.

Now, let's check the consistency of the positions:
- The hobbies are unique and in the correct order: Card-games, Cooking, Drawing (Techno), Woodworking, Photography
- The music-genres are unique and in the correct order: D&B, Disco, Reggae, Soul, Techno
- The pets are unique and in the correct order: Rat, Goldfish, Turtle, Hedgehog, [Unassigned]
- The means of transport are unique and in the correct order: Boat, Roller, Quad-bike, [Unassigned], Snowmobile

Since all the conditions are met, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |    2    |     3     |     4      |      5      |
| Hobby         | Card-games | Cooking | Drawing   | Woodworking | Photography |
| Music-Genre   | D&B       | Disco   | Techno    | Soul       | Reggae      |
| Pet           | Rat       | Goldfish| Turtle    | Hedgehog   | [Unassigned] |
| Transport     | Boat      | Roller  | Quad-bike | [Unassigned]| Snowmobile  |

However, the puzzle does not provide enough information to determine the unassigned pet and transport."
Lv4-4x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people and 5 items for each category (beverage, movie-genre, sport, transport). Let's assign numbers 1 to 5 to each person for each category.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking fanta is not in position 5 (since the person on the left of the swimmer is not in position 5). So, fanta can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

3. From rule 2, we know that the baseball person is not in position 1 (since the baseball person is on the left of the martial-arts movie person, and the martial-arts movie person can't be in position 1 because the fanta person can't be in position 5). So, baseball can be 2, 3, or 4.

4. From rule 3, we know that the family movie person is not in position 5 (since the volleyball person is on the right of the family movie person, and the volleyball person can't be in position 5 because the soccer person is on the far right). So, family can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

5. From rule 4, we know that the lemonade person is in position 3 (since the lemonade person is the person drinking lemonade).

6. From rule 5, we know that the western movie person is on the right of the swimmer. Since the swimmer can't be in position 5, the western movie person can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, western can be 2 or 4.

7. From rule 6, we know that the horror movie person is on the right of the family movie person. Since family can't be in position 5, horror can't be in position 1. So, horror can be 2, 3, or 4.

8. From rule 7, we know that the soccer person is in position 5.

9. From rule 8, we know that the skateboard person is either 1 or 2 (since the skateboard person is next to or the same person as the trike person, and the trike person can't be in position 5 because the soccer person is in position 5).

10. From rule 9, we know that the martial-arts movie person is the skateboard person. So, martial-arts is 1 or 2.

11. From rule 10, we know that the coffee person is the climber. So, coffee is 2 (since the climber can't be in position 5 because the soccer person is in position 5, and the martial-arts movie person is 1 or 2).

12. From rule 11, we know that the milk person is not 2 (since the milk person is drinking milk and the coffee person is the climber, so the milk person can't be the climber). So, milk is 1, 3, 4, or 5.

13. From rule 12, we know that the scooter person is not 5 (since the scooter person is between the climber and the action movie person, and the climber is the coffee person, so the scooter person can't be in position 5). So, scooter is 1, 2, 3, or 4.

14. From rule 13, we know that the action movie person is not 5 (since the action movie person is on the left or right of the coffee person, and the coffee person is the climber, so the action movie person can't be in position 5). So, action is 1, 2, 3, or 4.

15. From rule 14, we know that the volleyball person is in position 1 or 5 (since the volleyball person can't be in an odd position).

16. From rule 15, we know that the milk person is not 1 or 5 (since the milk person is in an odd position, and the volleyball person is in position 1 or 5). So, milk is 3 or 4.

17. From rule 16, we know that the fanta person is not 1 or 5 (since the fanta person is on the left or right of the lemonade person, and the lemonade person is in position 3). So, fanta is 2 or 4.

18. From rule 17, we know that the horor movie person is not 2 (since the horror movie person is on the right of the family movie person, and the family movie person can't be in position 5 because the volleyball person is in position 1 or 5). So, horror is 4.

19. From rule 18, we know that the family movie person is in position 5.

20. From rule 19, we know that the volleyball person is in position 1.

21. From rule 20, we know that the soccer person is in position 5.

22. From rule 21, we know that the climber (coffee person) is in position 2.

23. From rule 22, we know that the martial-arts movie person is in position 1 (since the martial-arts movie person is the skateboard person, and the skateboard person is next to or the same person as the trike person, and the trike person can't be in position 5 because the soccer person is in position 5).

24. From rule 23, we know that the skateboard person is in position 2 (since the skateboard person is the martial-arts movie person).

25. From rule 24, we know that the trike person is in position 3 (since the trike person is next to or the same person as the skateboard person, and the skateboard person is in position 2).

26. From rule 25, we know that the lemonade person is in position 4 (since the lemonade person is not the fanta person, and the fanta person can't be in position 1, 2, or 5).

27. From rule 26, we know that the fanta person is in position 3 (since the fanta person is on the left or right of the lemonade person, and the lemonade person is in position 4).

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage      | fanta | lemonade | coffee | milk |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts | family | action | horror |
| Sport         | volleyball | soccer | climbing |  |
| Transport     | trike | skateboard | bike | taxi |

Since we don't have information about the person in position 5 for the sport and transport categories, the table is incomplete. However, we have solved the beverage and movie-genre categories completely."
Lv4-4x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label the positions from left to right as A, B, C, D, and E.

2. From point 1, we know that the quad-bike driver is between the helicopter driver and the person watching epic movies. Since the helicopter driver is in an odd position (point 4), the quad-bike driver can't be in position A (since it would make the helicopter driver in position B, which is even). So, the quad-bike driver is either in position C, D, or E. Let's assume the quad-bike driver is in position C for now. This means the helicopter driver is in position A and the person watching epic movies is in position D or E.

3. From point 2, we know that the musical fan is on the far right. Since there are only 5 positions, the musical fan must be in position E. This means the person watching action movies is in position B (since it's to the right of the person watching action movies, according to point 7).

4. From point 3, we know that the cucumber eater is on the left of the cherry eater. Since the musical fan is in position E, the cherry eater must be in position D. This means the cucumber eater is in position C. But this contradicts our assumption that the quad-bike driver is in position C. So, our initial assumption about the quad-bike driver was incorrect. Let's try position B instead. This means the helicopter driver is in position A and the person watching epic movies is in position D.

5. From point 3, the cucumber eater is in position C, which is correct. The cherry eater is in position D, which is also correct.

6. From point 5, the salsa fan is on the left or right of the cucumber eater. Since the cucumber eater is in position C, the salsa fan can be in position A or B. Let's try position A for now. This means the person driving the ship is in position E.

7. From point 13, the lime eater is on the right of the person watching action movies, which is in position B. So, the lime eater is in position D. This means the banana eater is in position C (since the banana eater is the person driving the trike, according to point 6).

8. From point 17, the corn eater is on the right of the person watching epic movies, which is in position D. So, the corn eater is in position E.

9. From point 9, the lime eater is the fan of soul. This is correct since the lime eater is in position D.

10. From point 10, the person watching disaster movies is in an odd position. Since the helicopter driver is in position A (which is even), the person watching disaster movies can't be the helicopter driver. So, the person watching disaster movies is in position C. This means the person driving the quad-bike is in position B.

11. From point 11, the salsa fan is in position A, which is correct.

12. From point 12, the helicopter driver is in position A or E. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position C, the helicopter driver can't be in position C (since it would mean the helicopter driver is watching disaster movies, which contradicts point 10). So, the helicopter driver is in position E.

13. From point 14, the person driving the trike is the person eating banana, which is correct since the banana eater is in position C.

14. From point 15, the person driving the snowmobile is the person watching satire movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position C, the person watching satire movies can't be in position C. So, the person watching satire movies is in position A.

15. From point 16, the person eating corn is on the right of the person watching epic movies, which is in position D. This means the person eating corn is in position E, which is correct.

16. From point 17, the person driving the ship is in position E, which is correct.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     A     |      B      |    C    |      D      |      E      |

Lv4-4x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Argentine is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea, and the French is on the far left, we can place the French in position 1. The Argentine (drinking cola) must be in position 5 (since the positions are numbered from left to right and the Argentine is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea).

2. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the Argentine. Since the Argentine is in position 5, the ice-hockey person can be in position 4 or 6. Let's place the ice-hockey person in position 4 for now.

3. The french is on the far left, so the Egyptian can't be in position 1. The Egyptian is on the left of the Colombian, so the Colombian can't be in position 2. The only remaining positions for the Colombian are 3 or 5. Let's place the Colombian in position 3 for now.

4. The person who's sport is golf is on the far left or far right. Since the French and Argentine are already placed on the far left and far right respectively, the golf person must be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the golf person in position 2 for now.

5. The person drinking tea is in an odd position. The only odd positions left are 1, 3, and 5. Since the French and Argentine are already placed, the person drinking tea must be in position 1.

6. The person drinking iced-tea is between the person drinking cola (Argentine) and the person driving the snowmobile. The only possible positions for the iced-tea person are 2, 4, and 6. Since the Argentine is in position 5, the iced-tea person can't be in position 4 or 6. So, the iced-tea person is in position 2.

7. The person drinking 7up is the person who's sport is basketball. The only remaining positions for the basketball person are 3 and 5. Since the iced-tea person is in position 2, the basketball person must be in position 5.

8. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person drinking 7up. The only remaining position for the swimming person is 4.

9. The person driving the car is on the left or right of the British. Since the Argentine is on the right of the British (in position 5), the car driver can't be on the right of the British. So, the car driver is on the left of the British, which means the British is in position 3.

10. The person driving the motorbike is the French (already placed in position 1).

11. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver is yet to be placed, we can't determine the position of the taxi driver yet.

12. The person drinking cola is the Argentine (already placed in position 5).

13. The person driving the train is on the right of the French (already placed in position 1).

14. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver is yet to be placed, we can't determine the position of the iced-tea person yet.

15. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the golf person is in position 2 and the swimming person is in position 4, the person who's sport is golf must be in position 2.

Now, let's place the remaining people:

16. The only remaining sport is skateboarding. Since the person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person who's sport is golf, the skateboarding person must be on the right of the swimming person, which means the skateboarding person is in position 5.

17. The only remaining beverage is mirinda. Since the person drinking 7up is the person who's sport is basketball, the mirinda person must be in position 3.

18. The only remaining nationality is British. Since the British is on the left of the car driver (already placed), the car driver is in position 4.

19. The only remaining transport is snowmobile. Since the iced-tea person is on the right of the snowmobile driver, the snowmobile driver is in position 6.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv4-4x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Pakistani is in an odd position and there are 5 people, the Pakistani must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the Pakistani is in position 1 (helicopter).

2. Now, the Pakistani is in position 1, so the helicopter is in position 1.

3. The accountant is on the left or right of the Indonesian. Since the Pakistani is in position 1, the Indonesian cannot be in position 1. So, the Indonesian can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the Indonesian is in position 2, the accountant can be in position 1 (already occupied by Pakistani) or position 3. But position 3 is odd, and the accountant is in an odd position. So, the Indonesian cannot be in position 2. If the Indonesian is in position 3, the accountant can be in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is already occupied by Pakistani, so the accountant must be in position 5. This means the accountant is the person driving the motorbike (since the accountant is in position 5 and the motorbike is one of the five means of transport).

4. Now we know the accountant is the person driving the motorbike, so the motorbike is in position 5.

5. The mechanic is the Brazilian. Since the accountant is in position 5, the Brazilian cannot be in position 5. So, the Brazilian can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the Brazilian is in position 1, the hobby of gardening must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since the hobby of the Pakistani is known). But the hobby of gardening cannot be in position 2 (because of point 14), so the Brazilian cannot be in position 1. If the Brazilian is in position 2, the hobby of gardening must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But the hobby of gardening cannot be in position 1 (because of point 7), so the Brazilian cannot be in position 2. If the Brazilian is in position 3, the hobby of gardening must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But the hobby of gardening cannot be in position 1 (because of point 7), so the Brazilian cannot be in position 3. If the Brazilian is in position 4, the hobby of gardening must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But the hobby of gardening cannot be in position 1 (because of point 7), so the Brazilian cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the only remaining position for the Brazilian is position 5. This means the hobby of gardening is in position 1.

6. Now we know the hobby of gardening is in position 1, so the gardener is in position 1.

7. The accountant is in an odd position, so the accountant is not in position 1, 2, or 4. So, the accountant is in position 3 or 5. But position 5 is already occupied by the accountant (who is the person driving the motorbike), so the accountant is in position 3.

8. The accountant is in position 3, so the job in position 3 is accountant.

9. The accountant is in position 3, the gardener is in position 1, and the motorbike driver is in position 5. So, the remaining jobs and nationalities are yet to be placed.

10. The paramedic is on the right of the person driving the boat. Since the gardener is in position 1 and the accountant is in position 3, the person driving the boat must be in position 2. So, the boat driver is the paramedic.

11. The person driving the taxi is on the far left. Since the gardener is in position 1 and the boat driver is in position 2, the person driving the taxi must be in position 4.

12. The American is on the left or right of the paramedic. Since the paramedic is in position 2 and the taxi driver is in position 4, the American can be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is already occupied by the Pakistani, so the American is in position 3.

13. The person who's hobby is cooking is in an odd position. Since the gardener is in position 1, the cook cannot be in position 1. So, the cook can be in position 3, 5. But position 3 is already occupied by the American, so the cook is in position 5.

14. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the Nigerian. Since the gardener is in position 1, the Nigerian cannot be in position 1. So, the Nigerian can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the Nigerian is in position 2, the drawers can be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is already occupied by the gardener, so the drawers can be in position 3. But position 3 is already occupied by the American, so the Nigerian cannot be in position 2. If the Nigerian is in position 3, the drawers can be in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is already occupied by the gardener, so the drawers can be in position 5. But position 5 is already occupied by the cook, so the Nigerian cannot be in position 3. If the Nigerian is in position 4, the drawers can be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 1 is already occupied by the gardener, position 2 is already occupied by the paramedic, so the drawers can be in position 5. But position 5 is already occupied by the cook, so the Nigerian cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the only remaining position for the Nigerian is position 5. This means the person who's hobby is drawing is in position 2.

15. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person driving the helicopter. Since the drawers are in position 2 and the helicopter driver is in position 1, the person driving the helicopter is in position 3.

16. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the Indonesian. Since the gardener is in position 1, the Indonesian cannot be in position 1. So, the Indonesian can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the Indonesian is in position 2, the card-games player can be in position 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is already occupied by the helicopter driver, position 4 is already occupied by the taxi driver, so the card-games player can be in position 5. But position 5 is already occupied by the cook, so the Indonesian cannot be in position 2. If the Indonesian is in position 3, the card-games player can be in position 1, 2, or 4. But position 1 is already occupied by the gardener, position 2 is already occupied by the drawers, so the card-games player can be in position 4. But position 4 is already occupied by the taxi driver, so the Indonesian cannot be in position 3. If the Indonesian is in position 4, the card-games player can be in position 1, 2, or 3. But position 1 is already occupied by the gardener, position 2 is already occupied by the drawers, so the card-games player can be in position 3. But position 3 is already occupied by the helicopter driver, so the Indonesian cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the only remaining position for the Indonesian is position 5. This means the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 1.

17. The mechanic is the Brazilian. Since the gardener is in position 1, the Brazilian cannot be in position 1. So, the Brazilian can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the Brazilian is in position 2, the mechanic cannot be in position 1 (because the mechanic is the Brazilian and the gardener is in position 1), so the mechanic can be in position 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is already occupied by the accountant, position 4 is already occupied by the taxi driver, so the mechanic can be in position 5. But position 5 is already occupied by the cook, so the Brazilian cannot be in position 2. If the Brazilian is in position 3, the mechanic cannot be in position 1 (because the mechanic is the Brazilian and the gardener is in position 1), so the mechanic can be in position 2, 4, or 5. But position 2 is already occupied by the drawers, position 4 is already occupied by the taxi driver, so the mechanic can be in position 5. But position 5 is already occupied by the cook, so the Brazilian cannot be in position 3. If the Brazilian is in position 4, the mechanic cannot be in position 1 (because the mechanic is the Brazilian and the gardener is in position 1), so the mechanic can be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 2 is already occupied by the drawers, position 3 is already occupied by the accountant, so the mechanic can be in position 5. But position 5 is already occupied by the cook, so the Brazilian cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the only remaining position for the Brazilian is position 3. This means the mechanic is in position 5.

18. The subway driver is yet to be determined.

19. Since the mechanic is in position 5, the hobby of puzzles is in position 2 (since the mechanic is the Brazilian and the hobby of gardening is in position 1, the hobby of drawing is in position 2, the hobby of card-games is in position 1, and the hobby of cooking is in position 5).

20. Since the mechanic is in position 5, the job in position 5 is mechanic.

25. Since the accountant is in position 3, the hobby in position 1 is gardening.

26. Since the gardener is in position 1, the nationality in position 1 is yet to be determined.

27. Since the gardener is in position 1, the job in position 1 is yet to be determined.

28. Since the drawers are in position 2, the nationality in position 2 is Nigerian (since the drawers are yet to be placed and the Nigerian is yet to be placed).

29. Since the drawers are in position 2, the job in position 2 is yet to be determined.

30. Since the paramedic is in position 2 (as the boat driver), the nationality in position 2 is yet to be determined.

31. Since the helicopter driver is in position 3, the nationality in position 3 is yet to be determined.

We have placed all the hobbies, jobs, and nationalities except for the subway driver, the nationality in position 1, the nationality in position 3, the nationality in position 4, and the nationality in position 5.

Final solution table:

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |       4        |     5      |

The table is incomplete because we couldn't determine the nationalities in positions 1, 3, 4, and 5, and the job and nationality of the subway driver."
Lv4-4x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating orange is the person who's sport is water-polo. Let's place the orange in the 3rd column and water-polo in the 3rd row.

2. The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is on the far right (as per point 16), the person watching adventure movies must be in the 1st or 2nd column. Let's place adventure in the 1st row for now.

3. The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since adventure is in the 1st row, it must be to the left of romance. Let's place romance in the 5th column.

4. The person eating blueberry is in an even position. Since we have filled the 1st, 3rd, and 5th columns, the blueberry must be in the 2nd or 4th column. Let's place it in the 4th column for now.

5. The person who's sport is badminton is on the far left. Since we have placed water-polo in the 3rd column, badminton must be in the 1st column.

6. The owner of the chinchilla is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the owner of the mouse. Since we have placed badminton in the 1st column, weightlifting must be in the 2nd column and chinchilla in the 3rd column. The owner of the mouse must be in the 4th or 5th column.

7. The person who's sport is skateboarding is between the person who's sport is water-polo and the owner of the goat. Since water-polo is in the 3rd row, skateboarding must be in the 2nd row and goat in the 4th row.

8. The owner of the dog is the owner of the dog. This doesn't provide any new information as we already know who owns the dog.

9. The person eating asparagus is the person who's sport is badminton. Since we have placed badminton in the 1st column, asparagus must be in the 1st row.

10. The person eating apple is in the middle. Since we have filled the 1st, 3rd, and 5th columns, the apple must be in the 2nd row.

11. The person eating orange is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since we have placed documentary in the 2nd row, orange must be in the 3rd or 4th column. However, since orange is already in the 3rd column, this condition is satisfied.

12. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the owner of the goat. Since we have placed badminton in the 1st column and goat in the 4th row, this condition is satisfied.

13. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since we have placed the mouse in the 4th column and the cat is yet to be placed, this condition doesn't provide any new information.

14. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since we have placed badminton in the 1st column, martial-arts must be in the 2nd or 3rd row. However, since we have already placed martial-arts in the 1st row, this condition is not satisfied. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Here is the table up to the point where we found the contradiction:

|               |     1      |       2       |       3       |     4      |     5      |
| Food          | apple     | asparagus    | orange       | blueberry  | watermelon |
| Movie-Genre   |          | martial-arts | documentary  |           |            |
| Pet           | dog       | chinchilla   |             | mouse      | goat       |
| Sport         | badminton |             | water-polo   |            | skateboarding|

The puzzle seems to have an inconsistency, so it cannot be solved as it stands."
Lv4-4x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of d&b is on the left or right of the Malaysian (#3), and the Malaysian owns the dog (#4), the dog cannot be in the first two positions. So, the dog is either in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the dog is in position 3 for now.

2. The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the British (#2). Since the dog is in position 3, the British cannot be in position 1. So, the British is either in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the British is in position 2 for now.

3. The owner of the turtle is between the owner of the bird and the Polish (#5). Since the entrepreneur owns the bird (#5), the turtle cannot be in position 5. So, the turtle is either in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the turtle is in position 1 for now.

4. Now, we have the following arrangement:

   |               |     1     |     2      |    3     |     4      |      5       |

   Since the designer is in the middle (#7), the designer cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the designer is in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the designer is in position 4 for now.

5. The entrepreneur is on the right of the Indonesian (#11). Since the entrepreneur owns the bird (#5), the Indonesian cannot be in position 5. So, the Indonesian is either in position 1, 2, or 4. Let's assume the Indonesian is in position 1 for now.

6. The librarian is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla (#6). Since the librarian cannot be in position 1 (as the Indonesian is there), the librarian is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the librarian is in position 2 for now.

7. The musician is the British (#13). So, the British is the musician, and the musician is in position 2.

8. Now, the arrangement looks like this:

   |               |     1     |     2      |    3     |     4      |      5       |

Lv4-4x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the Dutch is between the person driving the ship and the Russian. Since the person driving the ship is on the far right (point 2), the Dutch cannot be in the first or last position. The Russian also cannot be in the first position (as the Dutch must be to its right), so the Russian must be in the second position. The Dutch is then in the third position.

2. The Dutch is on the left of the person driving the subway (point 3), so the subway driver cannot be in the first or third position. The subway driver must be in the fourth position, and the Dutch is in the third position.

3. The positions are filled as follows: Dutch (3), Russian (2), Subway (4), Ship (5).

4. The surfing person is between the pomegranate eater and the parkour person (point 4). Since the surfing person is the helicopter driver (point 6), the helicopter driver cannot be in the first or last position. The pomegranate eater cannot be in the first position (as the surfing person must be to its right), so the pomegranate eater must be in the second position. The parkour person cannot be in the last position (as the surfing person must be to its left), so the parkour person must be in the fourth position. The surfing person (helicopter driver) is then in the third position.

5. The apricot eater is in an odd position (point 5), so it cannot be in the second, fourth, or sixth position. The apricot eater must be in the first, third, or fifth position. Since the Dutch and the surfing person (helicopter driver) are already in the first, third, and fifth positions, the apricot eater must be in the fifth position.

6. The carrot eater cannot be in the first position (as the apricot eater must be to its left), so the carrot eater must be in the second position.

7. The corn eater is the person who's sport is basketball (point 11), so the basketball player is in the fifth position. Since the basketball player is on the far left or far right (point 14), it must be in the first position. The corn eater is then in the third position.

8. The cabbage eater is on the right of the parkour person (point 13), so the cabbage eater cannot be in the second position (as the parkour person is in the fourth position). The cabbage eater must be in the fourth or fifth position. Since the cabbage eater cannot be in the fifth position (as the apricot eater is already there), the cabbage eater must be in the fourth position.

9. The Indonesian is on the right of the roller driver (point 8), so the roller driver cannot be in the first or last position. The roller driver must be in the second, third, or fourth position. Since the Indonesian cannot be in the first position (as the Dutch is already there), the roller driver must be in the second position. The Indonesian is then in the fifth position.

10. The cricket player is on the left or right of the water-polo player (point 12), and the water-polo player is on the left or right of the basketball player (point 9). This means the cricket player and the water-polo player must be in the first, third, and fifth positions, and the basketball player must be in the second position. The cricket player is then in the first position, the water-polo player is in the third position, and the basketball player is in the second position.

11. The pomegranate eater is in the second position.

12. The Egyptian is on the left or right of the Russian (point 7), and the Russian is in the second position. This means the Egyptian must be in the first or third position. Since the Egyptian cannot be in the first position (as the Dutch is already there), the Egyptian must be in the third position.

13. The Polish and the Russian are the only nationalities left, and the Russian is in the second position. This means the Polish must be in the fifth position.

14. The carrot eater is in the second position.

Lv4-4x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the software-developer is on the far left or far right, they can't be in the middle. So, they must be in the first or the fifth position. Let's assume the software-developer is drinking juice (J) in the first position.

2. The person drinking cola (C) is on the right of the person eating orange (O). Since the software-developer (J) is in the first position, the person eating orange (O) must be in the second position. So, the cola drinker (C) is in the third position, and the beverage they are drinking is boat (B) because the cola drinker is driving the boat.

3. The person drinking fanta (F) is on the left of the writer (W). Since the writer is in an odd position (not the first or the fifth), they must be in the third position. So, the fanta drinker (F) is in the fourth position.

4. The person eating carrot (Ca) is the librarian (L). Since the librarian is on the left of the person driving the taxi (T), the librarian must be in the second position.

5. The person drinking juice (J) is between the person driving the helicopter (H) and the person eating avocado (A). Since the software-developer (J) is in the first position, the helicopter driver (H) must be in the fifth position, and the person eating avocado (A) must be in the fourth position.

6. The person drinking juice (J) is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (Sm). Since the software-developer (J) is in the first position, the snowmobile driver must be in the second position.

7. The person drinking sprite (S) is on the left of the person drinking juice (J). Since the software-developer (J) is in the first position, the sprite drinker (S) must be in the second position.

8. The writer (W) is in an odd position. Since we already placed the software-developer (J) and the librarian (L) in the first and second positions, the writer (W) must be in the fifth position.

9. The firefighter (Ff) is on the left of the person eating eggplant (E). Since the librarian (L) is in the second position and eating carrot (Ca), the firefighter (Ff) must be in the first position. So, the firefighter (Ff) is driving the taxi (T).

10. The person driving the helicopter (H) is the software-developer (J).

11. The librarian (L) is on the left of the person driving the taxi (T).

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Beverage    | Boat (C) | Helicopter (J) | Snowmobile (S) | Juice (J) | Sprite (S) |
| Food        | Orange (O) | -              | -              | Avocado (A) | -          |

| Transport   | Taxi (T) | Helicopter (H) | Snowmobile (Sm) | -          | -          |

We still need to fill in the food, job, and transport for positions 2, 4, and 5.

12. The person eating eggplant (E) is on the right of the firefighter (Ff). Since the firefighter (Ff) is in the first position, the person eating eggplant (E) must be in the second position. So, the food they are eating is carrot (Ca).

13. The librarian (L) is on the left of the person driving the taxi (T). Since the librarian (L) is in the second position, the job they have is writer (W).

14. The person driving the snowmobile (Sm) is in the second position. Since the software-developer (J) is in the first position and driving the helicopter (H), the person driving the snowmobile (Sm) must be drinking sprite (S).

15. The person eating avocado (A) is on the left of the person drinking juice (J). Since the software-developer (J) is in the first position, the person eating avocado (A) must be in the fifth position. So, the food they are eating is papaya (P).

16. The person driving the tram (Tr) is the lawyer (Lw). Since the lawyer is not mentioned in the puzzle, we can't determine their position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Beverage    | Boat (C) | Helicopter (J) | Snowmobile (S) | Juice (J) | Sprite (S) |
| Food        | Orange (O) | -              | -              | Avocado (A) | Carrot (Ca) |
| Job         | Firefighter (Ff) | Software-developer (J) | -              | -          | Writer (W)   |
| Transport   | Taxi (T) | Helicopter (H) | Snowmobile (Sm) | Tram (Tr)  | -          |

Since we can't determine the lawyer's position, we can't fill in the entire table. However, we have filled in the positions of the beverages, foods, jobs, and transport for the people we could determine.
