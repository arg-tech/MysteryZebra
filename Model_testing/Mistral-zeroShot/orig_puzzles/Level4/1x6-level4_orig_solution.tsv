Lv4-1x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the house fan is in an odd position and there are 6 people, the house fan must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

2. If the house fan is in position 1, then the disco fan must be in position 2 (as the house fan is on the left or right of the house fan, and the only available position for disco is to the left of house). This would mean that the rock fan is in position 6 (as the rock fan is to the left of the folk fan, and the only available position for rock is to the right of disco). But this placement violates rule 5 (house is in an odd position, but it's in position 1 which is even). So, house can't be in position 1.

3. If the house fan is in position 3, then the disco fan must be in position 4 (as the house fan is on the right of the folk fan, and the only available position for disco is to the right of folk). This would mean that the rock fan is in position 1 (as the rock fan is to the left of the folk fan, and the only available position for rock is to the left of disco). But this placement violates rule 5 (house is in an odd position, but it's in position 3 which is odd). So, house can't be in position 3.

4. If the house fan is in position 5, then the disco fan must be in position 6 (as the house fan is on the right of the folk fan, and the only available position for disco is to the right of folk). This would mean that the rock fan is in position 2 (as the rock fan is to the left of the folk fan, and the only available position for rock is to the left of disco). This placement satisfies all the rules.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Disco   | Folk | Rock | House | Gospel | Soul  |
#############
|   6       |  2   |  1   |  5    |  3    |  4    |

This solution satisfies all the given rules."
Lv4-1x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 6, we know that the software-developer is between the firefighter and the accountant. So, the firefighter and the accountant cannot be in the first or the last position.

2. From rule 5, the electrician is on the right of the firefighter. So, the firefighter cannot be in the first position.

3. From rule 1, the firefighter is between the software-developer and the electrician. So, the firefighter cannot be in the last position either.

4. Now we know the firefighter is in the middle (positions 2, 4, or 6). Since the chef is not the firefighter (from rule 1), the chef cannot be in the middle either.

5. From rule 2, the chef is on the far left or far right. Since the firefighter is in the middle, the chef must be in the first or the last position.

6. From rule 3, the chef is in an odd position. So, the chef must be in the first position.

7. Now we know the chef is in the first position. From rule 4, the accountant is on the left or right of the project-manager. Since the chef is in the first position, the accountant must be in the second position.

8. From rule 5, the electrician is on the right of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is in the third position, the electrician must be in the sixth position.

9. From rule 6, the software-developer is between the firefighter and the accountant. So, the software-developer must be in the fourth position.

Here is the final solution table:

  |       |  1   |        2        |     3      |         4          |      5      |      6      |

Lv4-1x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the paramedic is between the manager and the bartender, and the manager is in an even position (4th position), the paramedic can't be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. So, the paramedic can only be in the 2nd or 6th position.

2. The bartender is on the right of the engineer. Since the paramedic can't be in the 1st position (as the bartender can't be in the 2nd position), the engineer can't be in the 2nd position either. So, the engineer can only be in the 3rd, 4th, or 6th position.

3. The musician is on the left or right of the manager. Since the manager is in the 4th position and can't be in the 1st or 5th position, the musician can't be in the 1st or 5th position either. So, the musician can only be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 6th position.

4. Now, let's see if we can place the manager in the 4th position. If the manager is in the 4th position, the paramedic can't be in the 2nd position (as the paramedic is between the manager and the bartender). So, the paramedic must be in the 6th position. This means the bartender can't be in the 5th position (as the bartender is on the right of the engineer and the engineer can't be in the 6th position). So, the bartender must be in the 3rd position. This means the engineer can only be in the 5th position.

5. The musician can't be in the 1st position (as the musician is on the left or right of the manager and the manager is in the 4th position), so the musician must be in the 2nd position.

6. The photographer is on the far right, so the photographer must be in the 6th position.

So, the final solution table is:

|       |    1     |     2     |     3     |    4    |    5     |      6       |

Lv4-1x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the goat is not on the far right (since the mouse is), so it can't be in position 1, 2, 5, or 6. Let's assume the goat is in position 3.

2. Since the goat is on the right of the pony, the pony can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. Let's assume the pony is in position 4.

3. Now, the turtle must be between the ferret and the mouse. The ferret can't be in position 1 (since the turtle needs to be to its right), so it can't be in position 6 either (since the mouse is on the far right). So, let's assume the ferret is in position 2. This means the turtle is in position 3 and the mouse is in position 5.

4. The goat is on the left of the cat, so the cat can't be in position 6. Let's assume the cat is in position 1.

5. The only position left for the pony is position 4.

6. The ferret is in position 2, so it's an even position. The positions are numbered 1-6, so the only even positions are 2, 4, and 6. Since the pony is already in position 4, the ferret can't be in position 2 (as we assumed earlier). So, the ferret must be in position 6.

7. The only position left for the cat is position 1.

8. The mouse is in position 5 and the turtle is in position 3.

9. The goat is in position 3 and the pony is in position 4.

|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pear|   |   |   |   |   |   |

2. The person eating pepper is in an even position, so it cannot be in the first position (1). Since there are no other even positions to the right of the pear, the pepper must be in the second position.

|  1  |  2  |   |   |   |   |   |
|-----|-----|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pear| Pepper|   |   |   |   |   |

3. The person eating tomato is on the left of the person eating radish. Since the radish cannot be in the first position (1) or the last position (6) (as the orange is on the far right), the only possible position for the radish is the third position. The tomato must be in the second position from the left, so it goes in the fourth position.

|  1  |  2  |  4  |  3  |   |   |   |

Lv4-1x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the software-developer is in an even position (4), they can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the software-developer is in position 4 for now.

2. The journalist is on the right of the project-manager. Since the project-manager is in position 3 (as per our assumption), the journalist must be in position 5.

3. The project-manager is between the journalist and the engineer. This means the project-manager is in position 3 and the engineer is in position 2 or 4 (since the journalist is in position 5). But we already assumed the engineer is in position 2, so it must be in position 4.

4. The engineer is on the right of the doctor. Since the engineer is in position 4, the doctor must be in position 1.

5. Now, the project-manager is on the left of the journalist. This contradicts our assumption that the project-manager is in position 3 and the journalist is in position 5. So, our initial assumption that the software-developer is in position 4 was incorrect.

Let's try another assumption: the software-developer is in position 6.

1. The software-developer is in position 6, which is an even position.
2. The journalist is on the right of the project-manager. Since the project-manager is the project-manager (position 3), the journalist must be in position 5.
3. The project-manager is between the journalist and the engineer. This means the project-manager is in position 3 and the engineer is in position 2.
4. The engineer is on the right of the doctor. Since the engineer is in position 2, the doctor must be in position 1.
5. The project-manager is on the left of the journalist. This is consistent with our current arrangement.
6. The software-developer is on the right of the journalist. Since the software-developer is in position 6 and the journalist is in position 5, this is also consistent.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv4-1x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea, we can place iced-tea in the first or second position, and milk in the third or fourth position. Let's place iced-tea in the first position and milk in the third position.

   |    1     |  2   |   3   |  4   |   5    |    6     |
   |---------|------|-------|------|--------|----------|
   | iced-tea|      | milk  |      |        | soy-milk |

2. The person drinking coffee is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking cola. Since we have already placed milk and iced-tea, coffee cannot be in the first or sixth position. Also, coffee cannot be in the second position because it must be between two other beverages. So, coffee can only be in the third or fourth position. Let's place coffee in the fourth position.

   |    1     |  2   |   3   |  4   |   5    |    6     |
   |---------|------|-------|------|--------|----------|
   | iced-tea|      | milk  | coffee|       | soy-milk |

3. The person drinking cola is in an even position. Since we have already placed iced-tea, milk, and coffee, cola can only be in the second or sixth position. Let's place cola in the sixth position for now.

   |    1     |  2   |   3   |  4   |   5    |    6     |
   |---------|------|-------|------|--------|----------|
   | iced-tea|      | milk  | coffee|       | cola     | soy-milk |

4. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. Since cola is in the sixth position, fanta can be in the fifth position or any of the first five positions. Let's place fanta in the fifth position for now.

   |    1     |  2   |   3   |  4   |   5    |    6     |
   |---------|------|-------|------|--------|----------|
   | iced-tea|      | milk  | coffee| fanta | cola     | soy-milk |

5. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since we have already placed fanta and milk, this condition is satisfied.

6. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. Since cola is in the sixth position and fanta is in the fifth position, this condition is also satisfied.

Now, let's check the even position for cola again. Since we have placed cola in the sixth position, and the table is filled, the condition for cola being in an even position is satisfied.

Lv4-1x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of photography is between board-games and skydiving, and it's in an even position, it means it can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. However, since photography can't be in the 6th position because skydiving is to its right (rule 4), and it can't be in the 4th position because it's an even position and there's no odd position to its left (rule 2), it must be in the 2nd position.

2. Now we know that photography is in the 2nd position. Since photography is between board-games and skydiving, board-games must be in the 1st position (leftmost) or 3rd position (rightmost) (rule 5). Let's assume it's in the 1st position. This means skydiving must be in the 3rd position.

3. The person with the hobby of skydiving is to the left of the person with the hobby of video-games. Since we've placed skydiving in the 3rd position, video-games must be in the 6th position.

4. Now we know that video-games is in the 6th position. Since fishing is to the left or right of camping (rule 6), and fishing can't be in the 1st position because board-games is there (rule 5), it must be in the 5th position. This means camping must be in the 4th position.

5. Now we know that camping is in the 4th position and fishing is in the 5th position. Since there are no more rules to help us place the remaining hobbies (camping, fishing, and video-games are all accounted for), we can't definitively place the hobbies of board-games and photography. However, we know that board-games is either in the 1st or 3rd position, and photography is in the 2nd position. So, the final solution table could be:

Lv4-1x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the tea drinker is in an odd position (not the first or last), they can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

2. The lemonade drinker is between the juice and cola drinkers. Since the cola drinker cannot be in the first position (as tea is there), and the tea drinker is on the right of the cola drinker, the lemonade drinker must be in position 2. This means the juice drinker is in position 1 and the cola drinker is in position 3.

3. Now we know the positions of tea, lemonade, juice, and cola. The almond-milk drinker cannot be in the first or last position (as per rule 5), so they must be in position 4 or 6. However, if they were in position 6, the tea drinker (who is on the right of the cola drinker) would have no one to their right, which violates rule 6. So, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 4.

4. This leaves position 6 for the lemonade drinker, which is a violation of rule 2 (lemonade must be between juice and cola). So, the lemonade drinker must be in position 6, and the cola drinker must be in position 4.

5. Now we know the positions of tea, lemonade, cola, and almond-milk. The juice drinker must be in position 5, as per rule 1 (tea is in an odd position) and rule 3 (tea is not on the same side as almond-milk).

Lv4-1x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the genres are in a line, and there are 6 of them. So, we can label them from 1 to 6.

2. From point 3, we know that the genres in odd positions are romance and spy movies. Let's label the odd positions as R (for Romance) and S (for Spy). So, R = 1, 3, 5 and S = 2, 4.

3. From point 4, we know that Satire (SAT) is to the right of Documentary (DOC). Since we know the positions of Romance and Spy, Satire can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. But since Satire is on the left or right of Mystery (MYS), it can't be in position 6 (as MYS is on the far right). So, Satire can only be in positions 2 or 4.

4. From point 5, we know that MYS is in position 6.

5. From point 6, we know that R is to the right of MA (Martial Arts). Since R is in position 1, 3, or 5, and MYS is in position 6, MA can only be in positions 2 or 4. But since S is in an odd position and S is to the left of MA, MA can only be in position 4.

6. Now we know that MYS is in position 6, MA is in position 4, and R is in position 1. So, the only remaining genre is SAT. Since S is in an odd position and we already have R in position 1, S must be in position 3.

7. Now we have the following arrangement:
