Lv4-6x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people, so we can label them A to F from left to right.

2. Let's start with nationalities. Since the Indonesian is in an odd position (4), they must be either A, C, or E. The Indonesian is also the fan of rock (17), so they can't be A (since A can't be a fan of rock according to 29). So, Indonesian is either C or E. Let's assume Indonesian is C for now.

3. Since the Malaysian is on the left of the fan of reggae (4), the Malaysian must be A or B. The fan of reggae is the person who's hobby is card-games (17), so the Malaysian is A.

4. The Turkish is on the left or right of the journalist (11), and the journalist is on the left of the person drinking milk (13). So, the Turkish can't be A or B. The Turkish is also not C (since C is the Indonesian), so the Turkish must be D or E. Let's assume Turkish is D for now.

5. The Polish is the librarian (16), so the Polish is in an even position (4). Since the Indonesian and Malaysian are already in odd positions, the Polish must be E.

6. The Spanish is in position 4 (1), so the Spanish is either D or F. The Spanish is also the person drinking lemonade (25), so the Spanish must be F.

7. The Nationality of A is Nigerian (6), and the owner of the mouse is the Nigerian (26). So, the mouse is owned by A.

8. The owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right (28), but we already know the positions of the Indonesian, Malaysian, Turkish, Polish, and Spanish. So, the hedgehog owner must be A or F. Since the Indonesian is not A, the hedgehog owner is F.

9. The owner of the turtle is the person who's hobby is puzzles (9), so the turtle is owned by F.

10. The person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right (19), but we already know the positions of the Indonesian, Malaysian, Turkish, Polish, and Spanish. So, the 7up drinker must be A or F. Since the Indonesian is not A, the 7up drinker is F.

11. The person drinking cola can't be Indonesian (29), so the person drinking cola is either A, C, or E. Since the Indonesian is not A, the person drinking cola is either C or E.

12. The person drinking fanta is the fan of dubstep (21), so the person drinking fanta is either B, D, or F. Since the Turkish is not D, the person drinking fanta is either B or F.

13. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking cola (22), so the person drinking juice is either D or F. Since the person drinking fanta is not F, the person drinking juice is D.

14. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving (3), and the journalist is on the left of the person drinking milk (13). So, the journalist is either A or B. Since the journalist can't be A (since the Turkish is on the left of the journalist), the journalist is B.

15. The owner of the horse is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog (15), so the owner of the horse is F.

16. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is in an odd position (23), but we already know the positions of the Indonesian, Malaysian, Turkish, Polish, Spanish, and the hobbies of A, B, D, and F. So, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is C.

17. The fan of reggae is the person who's hobby is card-games (17), so the person who's hobby is card-games is A.

18. The analyst is the person who's hobby is skydiving (18), so the analyst is D.

19. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the fan of blues (24), but we already know the positions of the Indonesian, Malaysian, Turkish, Polish, Spanish, and the hobbies of A, B, D, and F. So, the person who's hobby is skydiving is C.

20. The analyst is on the right of the fan of reggae (20), so the analyst is C.

21. The fan of blues is on the far left or far right (12), but we already know the positions of the Indonesian, Malaysian, Turkish, Polish, Spanish, and the hobbies of A, B, D, and C. So, the fan of blues is A or F. Since the Indonesian is not F, the fan of blues is A.

22. The person drinking lemonade is the Spanish (25), so the person drinking lemonade is F.

23. The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the Spanish (26), so the person who's hobby is camping is E.

24. The indonesian is on the left or right of the person drinking cola (29), but we already know the positions of the Indonesian, Malaysian, Turkish, Polish, Spanish, and the hobbies of A, B, D, C, F, and E. So, the person drinking cola is either A or E. Since the person drinking fanta is not E, the person drinking cola is A.

Lv4-6x6-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the leftmost position and 6 being the rightmost position).

Lv4-6x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign positions to the people. We'll use even positions for the left side (1, 3, 5,...) and odd positions for the right side (2, 4, 6).

2. Let's start with nationalities. Since the argentine is in an even position (16), they can only be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the argentine is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage (1), the person eating cabbage must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Let's say the person eating cabbage is in position 1. So, the argentine is in position 2.

3. The person driving the roller (21) is Dutch (21), so they are in position 2. This means the roller is on the far left (position 1 or 3). Since the roller is on the far left or far right (3), the roller cannot be on the far left, so it's in position 3. The van (3) is eating kale (3), and the scooter (25) is on the right of the person driving the boat (24), so the boat is in position 1.

4. The person driving the boat (9) is eating zucchini (9), so they are in position 1. This means the person eating zucchini is on the left of the person eating apricot (18).

5. The firefighter (8) is Mexican (17), so they are in position 4. The firefighter is on the right of the Spanish (18), so the Spanish is in position 5.

7. The owner of the frog (20) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (20), so the puzzler is in position 2.

8. The owner of the guinea-pig (6) is in an even position (6), so they are in position 2 or 4. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the musician (14), the musician is in position 3.

9. The person driving the scooter (25) is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games (25), so the card-gamer is in position 1.

10. The entrepreneur (26) is the hiker (26), so they are in position 5.

11. The person eating apricot (18) is on the right of the owner of the rabbit (15), so the rabbit owner is in position 2. Since the rabbit owner is Mexican (17), they are in position 4.

12. The owner of the cat (15) is in an odd position (15), so they are in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the owner of the cat is on the left of the person driving the bus (12), the bus driver is in position 6.

13. The paramedic (23) is on the left or right of the person eating apricot (23), so the paramedic is in position 3.

14. The owner of the rabbit (17) is Mexican (17), so they are in position 4. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the pony (14), so the pony owner is in position 2.

15. The photographer (24) is on the right of the german (24), so the german is in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |       2       |      3       |      4      |     5      |     6      |

Lv4-6x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people with unique constraints. Let's place the doctor on the far left (D) and the librarian on the far right (L). Now we have 5 empty spots.

1. We know the person eating apricot is driving the van (9), so we can place them in position 6.
2. Since the writer is in an even position (2), they cannot be in position 6 (as it's odd). So, the writer must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But since the writer is on the far left or far right (18), they must be in position 1 or 6. However, the writer cannot be in position 1 because the paramedic is on the far left (6), so the writer must be in position 6.
3. The person eating pear is on the left or right of the person eating apricot (3), so they can be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7.
