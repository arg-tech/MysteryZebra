Lv10-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the manager is in the middle, we can fill the middle row with the job ""manager"".

|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     | manager       |            |            |
| Pet     |               |            |            |
| Sport   |               |            |            |

2. The owner of the guinea-pig is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the manager is not the ice-hockey player (from point 1), the person with the job in the first row cannot have a guinea-pig. So, the pet in the first row is either a chinchilla or a fish. Let's assume it's a chinchilla for now.

|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     | manager       |            |            |
| Pet     | chinchilla    |            |            |
| Sport   |               |            |            |

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere between the dressmaker and the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the manager is not the ice-hockey player and the first row is not the ice-hockey player, the ice-hockey player must be in the second or third row. If the ice-hockey player were in the second row, the first row would have to be the dressmaker (because the dressmaker is not the ice-hockey player), which contradicts our assumption that the first row has a chinchilla (since the dressmaker's pet is a dog). So, the ice-hockey player must be in the third row.

|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     | manager       |            | police-officer |
| Pet     | chinchilla    |            | guinea-pig   |
| Sport   |               |            | ice-hockey   |

4. The owner of the fish is not to the left of the manager. This means the fish cannot be in the first row (chinchilla) or the second row (guinea-pig). So, the fish must be in the third row.

|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     | manager       |            | police-officer |
| Pet     | chinchilla    | guinea-pig | fish         |
| Sport   |               |            | ice-hockey   |

5. The dressmaker is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the ice-hockey player is in the third row, the dressmaker must be in the first row.

|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     | dressmaker    |            | police-officer |
| Pet     | chinchilla    | guinea-pig | fish         |
| Sport   | golf          |            | ice-hockey   |

6. The manager is the person who's sport is golf or the person who's sport is golf is the owner of the fish, but not both. Since the manager is the golf player, the fish cannot be owned by the manager. So, the owner of the fish must be the person with the job in the second row.

|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     | dressmaker    | manager    | police-officer |
| Pet     | chinchilla    | fish       | guinea-pig   |
| Sport   | golf          | ice-hockey | ice-hockey   |

7. The table is now filled, but there's a contradiction in the sports column. Ice-hockey is listed twice for the third row. This contradicts the puzzle's rule that each sport is unique. So, there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the sports column is a mistake and each person has a unique sport, the final solution would be:

Lv10-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 3, the Malaysian cannot be in the first position (since the Russian is to the left of the Malaysian). So, the Malaysian can only be in the second or third position.

2. From point 2, the Malaysian cannot be eating garlic and driving the motorbike at the same time. If the Malaysian is in the second position, then the first position must be the person eating garlic (to satisfy point 5). In this case, the Malaysian cannot drive the motorbike (since point 2 is not satisfied). So, the Malaysian must be in the third position, and the first position must be the person driving the motorbike. The second position can be either the person eating garlic or strawberry.

3. From point 4, the person eating strawberry cannot be in the first position (since the person driving the airplane is between the person eating garlic and the person eating strawberry). So, the second position must be the person eating strawberry.

4. Now we know the first position is the person driving the motorbike (Malaysian cannot drive the motorbike), the second position is the person eating strawberry, and the third position is the Malaysian.

5. From point 6, the Russian and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions. Since the Malaysian (driving the motorbike) is in the third position (odd), the Russian must be in an odd position as well. The first position is taken, so the Russian must be in the second position.

6. This means the first position must be the person eating garlic.

7. The nationality, food, and transport for each position are:
   - First position: Garlic (eaten by the Malaysian)
   - Second position: Strawberry (eaten by the Russian)
   - Third position: Malaysian (driving the motorbike)

So, the final solution table is:

|               | Garlic  | Strawberry | Malaysian (M) driving Motorbike (M) |
| Food          |         |            |                                   |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Russian    |                                   |
| Transport     |         |            | Motorbike (M)                      |

Lv10-3x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The librarian is either drinking juice or watching animation, but not both. Let's assume the librarian is watching animation (A). This leaves juice for either the bartender (B) or the nurse (N).

2. The person watching comedy (C) is to the right of the person watching animation. So, C cannot be the librarian (A) or the nurse (N). Therefore, C must be the bartender (B).

3. The person watching spy (S) is to the right of the nurse (N). So, N cannot be the person watching spy. Since we already know that the librarian (A) is not the bartender (B), the only remaining option for the nurse (N) is to drink soy-milk (SM).

4. The person drinking soy-milk (SM) is to the left of the bartender (B). So, B cannot be in the first position. Therefore, B must be in the third position, and SM must be in the second position.

5. The person watching animation (A) is not the bartender (B). Since we know B is in the third position, A cannot be in the first or third position. So, A must be in the second position.

6. The person watching spy (S) is not the librarian (A). Since we know A is in the second position, S cannot be in the first or second position. So, S must be in the third position.

7. The bartender (B) and the person watching animation (A) have different parity positions. Since we know B is in the third position (odd), A must be in the second position (even).

Lv10-3x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different jobs, music-genres, and nationalities. So, each row and each column should have unique values.

2. From rule 2, we know that the freelancer is on the left of the nurse. This means that the jobs in the first two columns must be Freelancer and Nurse, and the third column must be Teacher.

   | Job   | 1   | 2  | 3  |
   |-------|-----|----|----|
   | Music |     |    |    |
   | Nationality |     |    |    |

   Now we know that the first two rows are Freelancer and Nurse.

3. From rule 3, we know that the freelancer is not the fan of salsa. So, the first row cannot be the fan of salsa.

   | Job   | 1   | 2  | 3  |
   |-------|-----|----|----|
   | Music | Ambient | R&B | Salsa |
   | Nationality | Argentine | Colombian | Mexican |

   Now we know that the first row is the Freelancer and not a fan of Salsa, so the first column must be Ambient.

4. From rule 4, we know that the Argentine and the fan of R&B have different parity positions. Since the first row is the Argentine and the first column is Ambient, the second row must be the fan of R&B.

   | Job   | 1   | 2  | 3  |
   |-------|-----|----|----|
   | Music | Ambient | R&B | Salsa |
   | Nationality | Argentine | Colombian | Mexican |

   Now we know that the second row is the fan of R&B and the second column is Colombian.

5. From rule 5, we know that the Colombian and the nurse have different parity positions. Since the second row is the fan of R&B and the second column is Colombian, the third row must be the Nurse.

   | Job   | 1   | 2  | 3  |
   |-------|-----|----|----|
   | Music | Ambient | R&B | Salsa |
   | Nationality | Argentine | Colombian | Mexican |

   Now we know that the third row is the Nurse.

6. From rule 6, we know that the fan of R&B is to the left of the Teacher. Since the second row is the fan of R&B and the third row is the Nurse, the first row must be the Teacher.

   | Job   | 1   | 2  | 3  |
   |-------|-----|----|----|
   | Music | Ambient | R&B | Salsa |
   | Nationality | Argentine | Colombian | Mexican |

   Now we know that the first row is the Teacher.

7. From rule 7, we know that the freelancer is not the fan of Salsa and the fan of Salsa is either the Argentine or the freelancer. Since the first row is the Teacher and the second row is the fan of R&B, the third column must be the fan of Salsa and the first column must be the Freelancer.

   | Job   | 1   | 2  | 3  |
   |-------|-----|----|----|
   | Music | Ambient | R&B | Salsa |
   | Nationality | Argentine | Colombian | Mexican |

   Now we know that the first column is the Freelancer and the third column is the fan of Salsa (Mexican).

8. From rule 8, we know that the Freelancer and the fan of Salsa have the same parity positions. Since the first column is the Freelancer and the third column is the fan of Salsa, they are in the same position, which is a contradiction because they are different nationalities.

   This puzzle has a contradiction and cannot be solved with the given rules.

The final solution table would be:

However, this solution is not valid due to the contradiction in rule 8."
Lv10-3x3-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. We know there are 3 different hobbies, nationalities, and means of transport. So, we can fill in one of each in the first row. Let's start with hobbies: [filmmaking, woodworking, writing].

2. Since the Canadian is in an odd position, they cannot be in the first or third position. So, the Canadian can only be in the second position. Now, we know the hobby in the second position is Canadian, so it must be one of [filmmaking, woodworking]. However, if the Canadian's hobby is filmmaking, then the person to the right of the Nigerian (who we don't know yet) must have a different hobby, which is impossible since there are only 3 hobbies. Therefore, the Canadian's hobby must be woodworking.

3. Now we know the Canadian is in the second position and their hobby is woodworking. This means the hobby in the first position must be filmmaking (since writing cannot be in the first position because the Canadian is not the person driving the tram). So, the first row is [filmmaking, woodworking, writing].

4. The person who's hobby is writing is in an even position. Since the Canadian (who has the hobby of woodworking) is in the second position, the person with the hobby of writing must be in the first or third position. However, if the person with the hobby of writing is in the first position, then the Canadian cannot be the person driving the tram (as per rule 2), which means the Canadian must be driving the trike (since there are only 3 means of transport). But this contradicts the fact that the Canadian is in the second position. Therefore, the person with the hobby of writing must be in the third position.

5. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person with the hobby of writing is in the third position, the person driving the trike must be in the fourth position.

6. Now we know the person driving the trike is in the fourth position. Since there are only 3 means of transport, the person driving the tram must be in the first position, and the person driving the airplane must be in the second position.

7. The nationality of the person in the first position (who is driving the tram) is not Canadian (since the Canadian is in the second position). So, the nationality in the first position can be either Nigerian or Thai. However, if the nationality in the first position is Nigerian, then the person with the hobby of writing (who is in the third position) must be Canadian (since the Canadian is not the person driving the tram), which contradicts our earlier conclusion that the Canadian is in the second position. Therefore, the nationality in the first position must be Thai.

8. Now we know the nationality in the first position is Thai, the nationality in the second position is Canadian, and the nationality in the third position is Nigerian.

9. Finally, we need to fill in the means of transport. Since the Canadian is in the second position and is driving the woodworking tool (which is not a transport), the means of transport in the second position must be the airplane. Since the Thai is in the first position and is driving the tram, the means of transport in the first position must be the tram. Since the Nigerian is in the third position and is not driving any of the transports, the means of transport in the third position must be the trike.

The final solution table is:

|               |       filmmaking      |     woodworking     |      writing       |
| Nationality   |             Thai          |          Canadian      |            Nigerian |

Lv10-3x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Let's place them in the first two spots, so Zucchini is in position 1 and Fanta is in position 2 or 3.

2. The person eating zucchini can be on the left or right of the person eating pomegranate. If Zucchini is in position 1, then Pomegranate can only be in position 2 or 3. If Zucchini is in position 3, then Pomegranate must be in position 1.

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person eating pomegranate. If Pomegranate is in position 1, then Ice-hockey can only be in position 2 or 3. If Pomegranate is in position 2, then Ice-hockey can only be in position 3. If Pomegranate is in position 3, then Ice-hockey can only be in position 2 or 3.

4. The person drinking juice is not to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This means that if Ice-hockey is in position 2, then Juice cannot be in position 1. If Ice-hockey is in position 3, then Juice cannot be in position 1 or 2.

5. The person eating grapes is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. This means that if Fanta is in position 2, then Grapes cannot be in position 1. If Fanta is in position 3, then Grapes cannot be in position 1 or 2.

6. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person eating pomegranate or the person eating pomegranate is the person drinking fanta, but not both. This means that if Pomegranate is in position 1, then Ice-hockey cannot be in position 3. If Pomegranate is in position 2, then Fanta cannot be in position 3.

7. The person eating pomegranate is not to the right of the person drinking juice. This means that if Pomegranate is in position 1, then Juice cannot be in position 3. If Pomegranate is in position 2, then Juice cannot be in position 1 or 3.

8. The person eating grapes is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. This means that if Golf is in position 1, then Grapes cannot be in position 1. If Golf is in position 2, then Grapes can be in position 1 or 3. If Golf is in position 3, then Grapes can only be in position 2.

Now, let's put all the conditions together:

- If Pomegranate is in position 1, then Ice-hockey can only be in position 2, Juice cannot be in position 3, and Grapes can be in position 2 or 3.
- If Pomegranate is in position 2, then Fanta cannot be in position 3, Juice cannot be in position 1 or 3, and Grapes can be in position 1 or 3.

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact position of Ice-hockey, Juice, and Grapes, we can't definitively place them. However, we can exclude some possibilities:

- Fanta cannot be in position 3 because it would violate condition 5.
- Juice cannot be in position 1 because it would violate condition 4.
- Grapes cannot be in position 1 because it would violate condition 5.

So, we know that Fanta is in position 2, and at least one of Pomegranate, Ice-hockey, and Grapes is in position 1. The rest of the positions are not yet determined.

Let's fill in what we know:

|            |    1     |      2      |     3      |
|-----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Beverage   | Pomegranate, Ice-hockey, or Grapes | Fanta | Juice, Ice-hockey, or Grapes |
| Food       | Grapes, Pomegranate, or Zucchini | - | - |
| Sport      | Golf, Ice-hockey, or Rowing | - | - |

We still have some flexibility in the food and sport columns, but we can't determine the exact positions without more information.

Final answer:

Lv10-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 3 different movie-genres (crime, family, sports) and 3 different music-genres (d&b, funk, trance). Let's assign these genres to the rows in the table:

   |               |   1   |     2      |   3    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime | Family   | Sports |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b  | Funk     | Trance |
   | Pet           |      |          |        |

2. The owner of the chinchilla watches family movies, so we can fill in the first column of the Pet row:

   |               |   1   |     2      |   3    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime | Family   | Sports |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b  | Funk     | Trance |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla |          |        |

3. The owner of the pony is to the right of the owner of the chinchilla, so the pony must be in the third column of the Pet row:

   |               |   1   |     2      |   3    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime | Family   | Sports |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b  | Funk     | Trance |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Pony    |        |

4. The fan of funk watches sports movies, so we can fill in the second column of the Movie-Genre row:

   |               |   1   |     2      |   3    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime | Sports   | Sports |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b  | Funk     | Trance |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Pony    |        |

5. The person watching family movies is the fan of trance or the person watching family movies is the owner of the chinchilla, but not both. Since we already know that the owner of the chinchilla watches family movies, the person watching family movies must be the fan of trance. So we can fill in the first column of the Movie-Genre row:

   |               |   1   |     2      |   3    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Trance| Sports   | Sports |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b  | Funk     | Trance |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Pony    |        |

6. The fan of d&b is not to the right of the owner of the pony. Since the pony is in the third column, the fan of d&b must be in the first or second column. But the first column is already filled, so the fan of d&b must be in the second column of the Movie-Genre row:

   |               |   1   |     2      |   3    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime | Trance  | Sports |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b  | Funk     | Trance |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Pony    |        |

7. The fan of funk is to the left of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is in the second column, the fan of funk must be in the first column of the Movie-Genre row:

   |               |   1   |     2      |   3    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime | Funk     | Trance |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b  | Funk     | Trance |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Pony    |        |

8. The last genre, crime, must be in the third column of the Movie-Genre row:

   |               |   1   |     2      |   3    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime | Funk     | Sports |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b  | Funk     | Trance |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Pony    |        |

So the final solution table is:

|               |   1   |     2      |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime | Funk     | Sports |

Lv10-3x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Let's place the climbing sport in the first or second position (1 or 2). If it's in the first position, the hobby of puzzles must be in the third position. If it's in the second position, the hobby of puzzles can be in either the first or third position. Let's assume it's in the first position for now.

2. The person who's hobby is puzzles is the person who's sport is basketball or the person who's sport is basketball is the fan d&b, but not both. Since the hobby of puzzles is in the first position and the sport of basketball can't be in the first position (because it would violate rule 1), the sport of basketball must be in the second position. But this means the fan d&b can't be in the second position (because it would violate rule 5), so the fan d&b must be in the third position.

3. The person who's hobby is skydiving and the fan funk have the same parity positions. Since we know the positions of the hobby of puzzles, the sport of basketball, and the fan d&b, the only remaining positions for skydiving and funk are (1, 2) and (2, 1). Let's try (1, 2) first. If skydiving is in the first position, funk must be in the second position. But this would mean the hobby of writing, which must be between funk and d&b (rule 6), would have to be in the third position, which is already occupied by the fan d&b. So, (1, 2) doesn't work.

4. Now let's try (2, 1). If skydiving is in the second position, funk must be in the first position. This means the hobby of writing can be in either the third position (if the hobby of puzzles is in the first position) or the first position (if the hobby of puzzles is in the second position). In both cases, the hobby of writing can be placed correctly.

5. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since climbing is in the first position and skydiving is in the second position, this rule is satisfied.

6. The person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the fan d&b. Since the fan d&b is in the third position, lacrosse can't be in the first or second position. So, it must be in the third position.

Now we have the following arrangement:

|               |     1     |     2      |     3      |
| Hobby         | Skydiving | Climbing  | Writing    |
| Music-Genre   | Funk     |           |           |
| Sport         |         | Basketball | Lacrosse   |

We still need to fill in the music-genre for climbing and the hobby for funk.

7. The person who's hobby is writing is between the fan funk and the fan d&b. Since the fan d&b is in the third position and the hobby of writing is in the second position, the fan funk must be in the first position.

8. The person who's hobby is puzzles is the person who's sport is electronic. Since we know the positions of the hobby of puzzles, the sport of basketball, the fan d&b, the fan funk, and the hobby of writing, the only remaining hobby for the person who's sport is electronic is puzzles.

9. The person who's hobby is skydiving and the fan funk have the same parity positions. Since we know the positions of skydiving and the fan funk, this rule is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-3x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 movie genres (disaster, drama, epic) and 3 music genres (blues, house, punk), and 3 nationalities (Canadian, Italian, Nigerian), we can assign one of each to each row and column.

2. From rule 1, the person watching house music is to the right of the person watching drama movies. So, we can place house in column 3 and drama in column 2. Let's place drama in row 2 for now.

3. From rule 2, the person watching disaster movies is either to the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since we placed drama in row 2, disaster can be in row 1 or row 3. Let's place disaster in row 1 for now.

4. From rule 4, the Italian is to the right of the person watching drama movies. So, the Italian cannot be in row 1 or row 2. Therefore, the Italian must be in row 3.

5. From rule 5, the Italian is between the Nigerian and the fan of blues. Since the Italian is in row 3, the Nigerian and the fan of blues must be in rows 1 and 2. The Nigerian cannot be in row 2 because the Italian is to the right of the person watching drama movies, so the Nigerian must be in row 1.

6. From rule 6, the Italian is not the fan of house. Since the Italian is in row 3, the fan of house must be in row 1 or row 2. But the fan of house is to the right of the person watching drama movies, so the fan of house cannot be in row 1 (because the Nigerian is there). Therefore, the fan of house is in row 2.

7. From rule 3, the fan of punk is not to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is in row 3, the fan of punk must be in row 1 or row 2. But the fan of house is in row 2, so the fan of punk must be in row 1.

8. Now we know that the nationalities are in the first column, so the Canadian must be in row 1.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster | drama   | house    |
| Music-Genre   | punk    | blues   | ######## |
| Nationality   | canadian| italian | nigerian |

Since we don't have information about the epic movie genre, the music genre for the last column remains unknown."
Lv10-3x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The designer is not the person who's hobby is video-games. So, video-games cannot be in the first row.

2. The project-manager is the person who's hobby is skydiving or the project-manager is the person watching musical movies, but not both. Let's assume the project-manager is the person who does skydiving. In this case, musical movies cannot be in the third column because the project-manager is in the third row. So, musical movies must be in the second column. This means the project-manager is in the third row and skydiving is in the third column.

3. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since we know the project-manager is the person who does skydiving and skydiving is on the right of sudoku, fantasy movies must be in the first column.

4. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. This confirms that the project-manager (skydiving) is in the third row and the second hobby (sudoku) is in the second column.

5. The person watching musical movies is not to the left of the designer. Since we know the designer is not in the first row (because video-games are not in the first row), the designer must be in the second or third row. If the designer was in the second row, musical movies would be in the first column, which contradicts point 3. So, the designer must be in the third row. This means the designer is in the first column (since the project-manager is in the third column and the person watching fantasy movies is in the first column).

6. Now we know the designer is in the first row and the hobby is not video-games. The only remaining hobby for the designer is sudoku.

7. The only remaining hobby for the first column is video-games.

8. The only remaining hobby for the second column is fantasy.

9. The only remaining hobby for the third column is horror.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |    2     |        3        |
