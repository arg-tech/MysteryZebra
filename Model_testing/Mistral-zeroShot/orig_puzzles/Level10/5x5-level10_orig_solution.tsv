Lv10-5x5-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the positions (1-5 from left to right) and nationalities (A-E from A for Australian to E for Indonesian).

2. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking milk is not the Australian (A), so they can't be in position 1. Let's place the milk drinker in position 5 (since position 1 is already taken).

3. From rule 2, the person drinking lemonade is in an even position. Since position 1 is taken, the lemonade drinker can't be in position 2, so they must be in position 4. Since milk is in position 5, lemonade must be in position 4.

4. From rule 3, the person drinking soy-milk is between the Pakistani (E) and the person drinking fanta. Since we know the positions of milk and lemonade, soy-milk can only be in position 2 or 3. If soy-milk is in position 2, the fanta drinker must be in position 1, but that would mean the fanta drinker is the Australian, which contradicts rule 1. So, soy-milk is in position 3.

5. From rule 4, the person eating avocado is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies. Since we know the positions of milk, lemonade, and soy-milk, the only possible positions for avocado are 1, 2, or 5. If avocado is in position 1, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2 or 3. But that would mean the person watching zombie movies is to the left of the Italian (rule 12), which is not possible since the Italian is in position 1 (rule 21). So, avocado can't be in position 1. If avocado is in position 5, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 4. But that would mean the person watching zombie movies is the Australian (rule 12), which contradicts rule 31. So, avocado can't be in position 5. Therefore, avocado must be in position 2.

6. From rule 5, the person eating apple and the person who's hobby is filmmaking have the same parity positions. Since we know the positions of milk, lemonade, soy-milk, and avocado, the only possible positions for apple are 3 or 4. If apple is in position 3, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in position 2 or 5. But that would mean the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the Italian (rule 17), which contradicts rule 26. So, apple can't be in position 3. If apple is in position 4, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in position 2 or 5. But that would mean the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the Italian (rule 17), which is consistent with our previous findings.

7. From rule 6, the person eating broccoli is the person watching superhero movies or the person watching superhero movies is the Chinese, but not both. Since we know the positions of milk, lemonade, soy-milk, avocado, and apple, the only possible positions for broccoli are 1, 2, or 5. If broccoli is in position 1, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But that would mean the person watching superhero movies is the Chinese (rule 6), which is consistent with our previous findings.

8. From rule 7, the person drinking lemonade is the Australian or the person drinking lemonade is the person eating radish, but not both. Since we know the position of lemonade, the person eating radish must be in a different position. The only possible position for radish is 3, since positions 1, 2, and 5 are taken.

9. From rule 8, the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk. Since we know the positions of milk and lemonade, the only possible positions for fanta are 4 or 5. If fanta is in position 4, the person drinking milk must be in position 5, which contradicts rule 8 (since fanta would be to the left of milk). So, fanta must be in position 5.

10. From rule 9, the person eating cherry is the person who's hobby is filmmaking or the person eating cherry is the person drinking fanta, but not both. Since we know the position of fanta, the only possible position for cherry is 2.

11. From rule 10, the person drinking fanta is not to the left of the person eating cherry. Since we know the positions of fanta and cherry, the person watching comedy movies (since the person eating avocado is the Italian, rule 17) must be in position 1.

12. From rule 11, the person eating avocado is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since we know the positions of avocado and fanta, the person watching animation movies (since the Indonesian is in position 1, rule 21) must be in position 3.

13. From rule 13, the person watching comedy movies is in an odd position. Since we know the positions of avocado, fanta, and animation, the only possible position for comedy is 5.

14. From rule 14, the person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the Indonesian. Since we know the positions of animation and comedy, the Indonesian must be in position 2.

15. From rule 15, the person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since we know the positions of board-games and comedy, the only possible position for board-games is 1.

16. From rule 16, the person watching superhero movies is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since we know the positions of superhero and lemonade, the only possible position for superhero is 2.

17. From rule 17, the person eating avocado is the Italian. This is consistent with our previous findings.

18. From rule 18, the Indonesian is the person watching animation movies or the person watching animation movies is the person who's hobby is board-games, but not both. Since we know the positions of Indonesian and animation, the person who's hobby is board-games must be in position 1.

19. From rule 19, the person who's hobby is photography is not to the right of the person drinking fanta. Since we know the positions of photography and fanta, the only possible position for photography is 2.

20. From rule 20, the person eating avocado is not the person watching comedy movies. This is consistent with our previous findings.

21. From rule 21, the Indonesian is on the far left. This is consistent with our previous findings.

22. From rule 22, the person drinking soy-milk is not to the right of the person eating radish. Since we know the positions of soy-milk and radish, the only possible position for soy-milk is 3.

23. From rule 23, the person eating radish is the person drinking milk. This is consistent with our previous findings.

24. From rule 24, the person eating apple and the person watching action movies have different parity positions. Since we know the positions of apple and action, the only possible position for action is 4.

25. From rule 25, the person drinking milk and the person watching action movies have different parity positions. Since we know the positions of milk and action, the only possible position for milk is 5.

26. From rule 26, the person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we know the positions of board-games and filmmaking, the only possible position for filmmaking is 2.

27. From rule 27, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the Australian. Since we know the positions of filmmaking and the Australian, the only possible position for the Australian is 1.

28. From rule 28, the person who's hobby is writing is the person eating avocado or the person who's hobby is writing is the person watching action movies, but not both. Since we know the position of avocado, the person who's hobby is writing must be the person watching action movies. But that would mean the person watching action movies is in position 4, which contradicts rule 24. So, the person who's hobby is writing is the person eating avocado. This is consistent with our previous findings.

29. From rule 29, the person eating radish is the person drinking milk or the person eating radish is the person who's hobby is board-games, but not both. Since we know the positions of milk and radish, the person who's hobby is board-games must be the person drinking milk. This is consistent with our previous findings.

30. From rule 30, the person watching superhero movies is the person eating apple. This is consistent with our previous findings.

31. From rule 31, the person watching animation movies is not the Australian. This is consistent with our previous findings.

The final solution table is:

Lv10-5x5-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the people based on their hobbies. Since there are 5 different hobbies, we can assign the numbers 1 to 5 to them, where 1 is the person with the hobby 'camping', 2 is the person with the hobby 'chess', 3 is the person with the hobby 'collecting', 4 is the person with the hobby 'drawing', and 5 is the person with the hobby 'hiking'.

2. Now, let's assign numbers to the people based on their jobs. Since there are 5 different jobs, we can assign the numbers 1 to 5 to them, where 1 is the doctor, 2 is the firefighter, 3 is the librarian, 4 is the pilot, and 5 is the police-officer.

3. Let's assign numbers to the people based on their sports. Since there are 5 different sports, we can assign the numbers 1 to 5 to them, where 1 is the person who plays golf, 2 is the person who plays lacrosse, 3 is the person who does parkour, 4 is the person who does snowboarding, and 5 is the person who plays volleyball.

4. Let's assign numbers to the people based on their beverages. Since there are 5 different beverages, we can assign the numbers 1 to 5 to them, where 1 is the person drinking cola, 2 is the person drinking fanta, 3 is the person drinking iced-tea, 4 is the person drinking soy-milk, and 5 is the person drinking water.

5. Now, let's use the given clues to fill in the table. I'll use 'X' to represent an unknown position and '?' to represent a position that can be either left or right.

| Beverage    |      1       |       2        |    3    |     4      |      5      |
| Hobby       |              |                |         |            |             |
| Job         |              |                |         |            |             |
| Sport       |              |                |         |            |             |
| Transport   |              | motor          |         |            |             |

6. Let's start with the clues that give us direct information about the positions of certain people:

   - Clue 2: The person who's hobby is camping is on the far left or far right. Since there are 5 people, this means person 1 (hobby: camping) must be either in position 1 or 5.
   - Clue 4: The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere between the person drinking cola and the police-officer. Since we don't know the positions of cola and the police-officer yet, we can't place parkour yet.
   - Clue 9: The firefighter and the person who's sport is golf have the same parity positions. This means they can't be in positions 1, 3, and 5 because there are an odd number of positions. So, they must be in positions 2 or 4.
   - Clue 11: The person who's hobby is collecting is not the person drinking cola. Since we know cola is in position 1 (from clue 2), collecting can't be in position 1.
   - Clue 15: The person who's sport is golf is not to the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we know chess is not in position 1 (from clue 11), golf can't be in position 2.
   - Clue 19: The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the person drinking cola. Since we know cola is in position 1, iced-tea can't be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - Clue 24: The person who's hobby is camping is the person drinking fanta. Since we know camping is in position 1 or 5, fanta must be in position 1 or 5.
   - Clue 29: The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since we know golf is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from clues 9, 15, and 19), iced-tea can't be in position 4 or 5. So, iced-tea must be in position 2.
   - Clue 2: The person who's hobby is camping is on the far left or far right. Since we know fanta (camping) is in position 1, camping must be in position 1.
   - Clue 7: The pilot is the person who's hobby is drawing. Since we know drawing is not in position 1 (from clue 2), the pilot must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Clue 20: The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the pilot. Since we know iced-tea is in position 2 and the pilot can't be in position 1 (from clue 2), the pilot must be in position 5.
   - Clue 13: The person drinking cola is on the far right. Since we know cola is in position 1, it must be in position 5.
   - Clue 6: The pilot is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we know the pilot is in position 5 and lacrosse can't be in position 1, 2, or 3 (from clues 9, 15, and 19), lacrosse must be in position 4.
   - Clue 17: The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since we know lacrosse is in position 4, snowboarding must be in position 3.
   - Clue 16: The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat. Since we know the boat is not in position 1 (from clue 18), the motorbike can't be in position 5. So, the motorbike must be in position 2 or 4.
   - Clue 18: The person driving the bus is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since we know fanta is in position 1, the bus can't be in position 2. So, the bus must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - Clue 28: The firefighter is in an odd position. Since we know the firefighter can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (from clues 9, 11, and 24), the firefighter must be in position 2 or 4.
   - Clue 27: The person driving the bus is not to the left of the firefighter. Since we know the firefighter is in position 2 or 4 and the bus can't be in position 1 (from clue 18), the bus must be in position 3 or 5.
   - Clue 5: The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we know iced-tea is in position 2, parkour can't be in position 3, 4, or 5. So, parkour must be in position 1.
   - Clue 3: The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere between the person drinking cola and the police-officer. Since we know cola is in position 5 and parkour is in position 1, the police-officer must be in position 3.
   - Clue 25: The person who's hobby is collecting is the librarian. Since we know collecting is not in position 1 (from clue 11), the librarian can't be in position 1 either. So, the librarian must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - Clue 26: The person who's hobby is chess is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we know lacrosse is in position 4, chess can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, chess must be in position 5.
   - Clue 14: The person who's hobby is collecting is not the person drinking cola. Since we know cola is in position 5, the librarian (collecting) can't be in position 5 either. So, the librarian must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Clue 12: The person drinking cola and the person who's sport is golf have the same parity positions. Since we know cola is in position 5 and golf is in position 4, they have different parity positions. This is a contradiction, so we need to recheck our assumptions. It seems that cola should be in position 1 instead of position 5 (as per clue 13).
   - Clue 8: The person who's hobby is chess is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we know lacrosse is in position 4, chess can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, chess must be in position 5.
   - Clue 22: The person who's hobby is chess and the pilot have different parity positions. Since we know chess is in position 5 and the pilot is in position 4, they have the same parity positions. This is a contradiction, so we need to recheck our assumptions. It seems that the pilot should be in position 5 instead of position 4 (as per clue 7).
   - Clue 23: The police-officer is not to the right of the person drinking cola. Since we know cola is in position 1, the police-officer can't be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. This is a contradiction, as we have already placed the police-officer in position 3. It seems there is an error in the puzzle, and it's impossible to solve it with the given information.

The final solution table would look like this, but with an error:

| Beverage    |      1       |       2        |    3    |     4      |      5      |
| Hobby       |   chess      |   collecting   | police  |   lacrosse |   pilot     |
| Job         |              |                |         |            |             |
| Sport       |              |                |         |            |             |

However, there seems to be an error in the puzzle, as the police-officer can't be in position 3 according to clue 23."
Lv10-5x5-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people with unique positions. We know that the person eating onion is on the far left or far right (1, 5), and the person watching crime movies is in the middle (3). Let's place them first:

   |               |      1      |      2       |   3    |    4    |       5       |
   | Beverage      |             |              |        |         |               |
   | Food          |             |              |        |         |               |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime       |              |        |         |               |
   | Sport         |             |              |        |         |               |
   | Transport     |             |              |        |         |               |

2. The person eating tomato is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies (3). Since we already have the position of the person watching crime movies, we know that the person watching horror movies must be in position 2 or 4. If the person watching horror movies is in position 2, the person eating tomato must be in position 1 or 3. But this would violate rule 5 (different parity positions). So, the person watching horror movies must be in position 4, and the person eating tomato must be in position 1 or 5. Let's place them:

   |               |      1      |      2       |   3    |    4    |       5       |

6. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person driving the subway (10). Since we already have the position of the person eating avocado (cycling), the person driving the subway must be in position 2. Let's place it:

   |               |      1      |      2       |   3    |    4    |   5    |

8. The person eating cucumber and the person drinking hot-chocolate have the same parity positions (9). Since we already have the position of the person eating cherry (cucumber), the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 2, 4, and 6. But the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in position 6 because the person watching martial-arts movies is the person drinking hot-chocolate (29), and we already have the position of the person watching martial-arts movies. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 4. Let's place it:

   |               |      1      |      2       |   3    |    4    |   5    |

Lv10-5x5-5	"To solve this puzzle, we can use a method called the ""Elimination Method"" or ""Elimination by Process of Elimination"". Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Let's start by listing all the possible combinations for each category.

   Food: eggplant, kiwi, pepper, plum, spinach
   Job: accountant, architect, dancer, entrepreneur, software-developer
   Pet: chinchilla, ferret, fish, guinea-pig, horse
   Sport: badminton, rowing, rugby, surfing, water-polo
   Transport: airplane, jet-ski, motorbike, skateboard, trike

2. Let's start with the Food column. Since we know that the person eating spinach is the owner of the fish (from rule 15), we can replace the Fish row with ""spinach"" and remove ""spinach"" from the Food column. Now we have 4 foods left.

   Food: eggplant, kiwi, pepper, plum

3. Now let's use rule 17 to place ""pepper"" between ""eggplant"" and ""kiwi"".

   Food: eggplant, pepper, kiwi, plum

4. We can use rule 18 to place ""rowing"" on the far left or far right. Let's assume it's on the far left for now.

   Job: accountant, architect, dancer, entrepreneur, software-developer (rowing is accountant)

5. Now we can use rule 14 to determine that the architect cannot be the person playing water-polo. So, the architect must be one of the remaining jobs.

   Job: accountant (rowing), architect, dancer, entrepreneur, software-developer (not water-polo)

6. We can use rule 11 to place the architect between ""spinach"" and the remaining job (not software-developer). Since the architect is not water-polo, the architect must be to the left of the person eating spinach.

   Job: accountant (rowing), architect (left of spinach), dancer, entrepreneur, software-developer (not water-polo)

7. Now we can use rule 16 to place the person eating kiwi and the person driving the trike in different parity positions. Since the person eating spinach is the person driving the trike (from rule 20), the person eating kiwi cannot be in the same parity position as spinach. So, the person eating kiwi must be in an odd position.

   Food: eggplant, pepper, kiwi, plum
   Job: accountant (rowing), architect (left of spinach), dancer, entrepreneur, software-developer (not water-polo)
   Pet: chinchilla, ferret, fish (spinach), guinea-pig, horse
   Sport: badminton, rowing, rugby, surfing, water-polo
   Transport: airplane, jet-ski, motorbike, skateboard, trike (spinach)

8. Now we can use rule 13 to place rugby and kiwi in different parity positions. Since the person eating kiwi is in an odd position, rugby must be in an even position.

   Food: eggplant, pepper, kiwi, plum
   Job: accountant (rowing), architect (left of spinach), dancer, entrepreneur (odd), software-developer (not water-polo)
   Pet: chinchilla, ferret, fish (spinach), guinea-pig, horse
   Sport: badminton, rowing, rugby (even), surfing, water-polo
   Transport: airplane, jet-ski, motorbike, skateboard, trike (spinach)

9. Now we can use rule 21 to place the person eating eggplant to the left of the person driving the motorbike.

   Food: eggplant, pepper, kiwi, plum
   Job: accountant (rowing), architect (left of spinach), dancer, entrepreneur (odd), software-developer (not water-polo)
   Pet: chinchilla, ferret, fish (spinach), guinea-pig, horse
   Sport: badminton, rowing, rugby (even), surfing, water-polo
   Transport: airplane, jet-ski, motorbike (left of eggplant), skateboard, trike (spinach)

10. Now we can use rule 22 to place the owner of the chinchilla and the person driving the motorbike in different parity positions. Since the person driving the motorbike is to the left of the person eating eggplant, the owner of the chinchilla must be in an odd position.

    Food: eggplant, pepper, kiwi, plum
    Job: accountant (rowing), architect (left of spinach), dancer, entrepreneur (odd), software-developer (not water-polo)
    Pet: chinchilla (odd), ferret, fish (spinach), guinea-pig, horse
    Sport: badminton, rowing, rugby (even), surfing, water-polo
    Transport: airplane, jet-ski, motorbike (left of eggplant, odd), skateboard, trike (spinach)

11. Now we can use rule 23 to place the owner of the guinea-pig on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person driving the jet-ski is to the left of the person driving the motorbike (odd), the owner of the guinea-pig must be in an even position.

    Food: eggplant, pepper, kiwi, plum
    Job: accountant (rowing), architect (left of spinach), dancer, entrepreneur (odd), software-developer (not water-polo)
    Pet: chinchilla (odd), ferret, fish (spinach), guinea-pig (even), horse
    Sport: badminton, rowing, rugby (even), surfing, water-polo
    Transport: airplane, jet-ski (left of motorbike), skateboard, trike (spinach)

12. Now we can use rule 24 to place the person who's sport is rowing on the right of the accountant.

    Food: eggplant, pepper, kiwi, plum
    Job: accountant (rowing's right), architect (left of spinach), dancer, entrepreneur (odd), software-developer (not water-polo)
    Pet: chinchilla (odd), ferret, fish (spinach), guinea-pig (even), horse
    Sport: badminton, rowing, rugby (even), surfing, water-polo
    Transport: airplane, jet-ski (left of motorbike), skateboard, trike (spinach)

13. Now we can use rule 26 to place the owner of the ferret on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.

    Food: eggplant, pepper, kiwi, plum
    Job: accountant (rowing's right), architect (left of spinach), dancer, entrepreneur (odd), software-developer (not water-polo)
    Pet: chinchilla (odd), ferret (right of surfing), fish (spinach), guinea-pig (even), horse
    Sport: badminton, rowing, rugby (even), surfing, water-polo
    Transport: airplane, jet-ski (left of motorbike), skateboard, trike (spinach)

14. Now we can use rule 25 to place the architect and the person driving the trike in different parity positions. Since the architect is in an even position, the person driving the trike must be in an odd position. But we already know that the person driving the trike is the person eating spinach (from rule 20), so the person eating spinach must be in an odd position, which contradicts rule 15.

   There seems to be a contradiction in the rules, so the puzzle might not have a unique solution.

The final solution table would be:

   Food: eggplant, pepper, kiwi, plum
   Job: accountant (rowing's right), architect (left of spinach), dancer, entrepreneur (odd), software-developer (not water-polo)
   Pet: chinchilla (odd), ferret (right of surfing), fish (spinach), guinea-pig (even), horse
   Sport: badminton, rowing, rugby (even), surfing, water-polo
   Transport: airplane, jet-ski (left of motorbike), skateboard, trike (spinach)

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the rules, so the puzzle might not have a unique solution."
Lv10-5x5-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions and the corresponding items for each category (Food, Job, Music-Genre, Sport, Transport). We will use the parity of the positions (even or odd) to help us keep track of the order.

Let's start by assigning the parity for the first position (position 1):
1. The person driving the skateboard and the analyst have the same parity positions (9), so the analyst must be in position 1 (odd) and the skateboard driver in position 3 (odd).

Now let's assign the parity for the second position (position 2):
7. The fan punk and the analyst have different parity positions (9), so the fan punk must be in position 2 (even).

Now let's assign the parity for the third position (position 3):
6. The person driving the taxi is not the person eating pineapple (6), so the taxi driver cannot be in position 3. Since the skateboard driver is in position 3, the taxi driver must be in position 5 (odd).

Now let's assign the parity for the fourth position (position 4):
19. The person eating spinach is in an even position (4), so the person eating spinach must be in position 4 (even).

Now let's assign the parity for the fifth position (position 5):
14. The person eating pumpkin is in an odd position (4), so the person eating pumpkin must be in position 5 (odd).

Now let's assign the items for the first position (position 1):
1. The fan folk is the person eating spinach or the fan folk is the person who's sport is weightlifting, but not both. Since the person eating spinach is in position 4, the fan folk cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person in position 1 must be the analyst (since the skateboard driver is already assigned).

Now let's assign the items for the second position (position 2):
22. The person driving the taxi is the fan ambient or the fan ambient is the dancer, but not both. Since the fan ambient cannot be the analyst (position 1), the fan ambient must be in position 2.

Now let's assign the items for the third position (position 3):
The skateboard driver is already assigned (position 3).

Now let's assign the items for the fourth position (position 4):
The person eating spinach is already assigned (position 4).

Now let's assign the items for the fifth position (position 5):
The person eating pumpkin is already assigned (position 5).

Now let's assign the jobs for the first position (position 1):
9. The analyst is on the far left or far right (3), so the analyst must be in position 1 (job: analyst).

Now let's assign the jobs for the second position (position 2):
The dancer is in the middle (11), so the dancer must be in position 2 (job: dancer).

Now let's assign the jobs for the third position (position 3):
The skateboard driver is already assigned (position 3, job: skateboard).

Now let's assign the jobs for the fourth position (position 4):
The person eating spinach is already assigned (position 4, job unknown).

31. From rule 1, the people have 5 different jobs. We have already assigned the French (freelancer), the Malaysian (pilot), and the Indonesian (job unknown). The person driving the trike is the French, so the job of the person driving the train is still unknown. The person driving the motorbike is still unknown as well. The person driving the airplane is in position 2 or 3, and the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 1, 4, or 5. The person who's sport is climbing is in position 2, and the person who's sport is sailing is in position 1.

1. The person driving the train must be the manager since the manager is in position 3, 4, or 5, and the Indonesian is in position 1, the French is in position 3, and the Malaysian is in position 5. So, the manager is the person driving the train.
2. The person driving the motorbike must be the doctor since the doctor is in position 2 or 3, and the Indonesian is in position 1, the French is in position 3, and the Malaysian is in position 5. So, the doctor is the person driving the motorbike.
3. The person driving the airplane must be the photographer since the person driving the airplane is in position 2, and the Indonesian is in position 1, the French is in position 3, the Malaysian is in position 5, the manager is driving the train, and the doctor is driving the motorbike. So, the photographer is the person driving the airplane.
4. The person who's sport is ice-hockey must be the pilot since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 1, 4, or 5, and the Indonesian is in position 1, the French is in position 3, the Malaysian is the pilot (gospel fan), and the manager is driving the train. So, the pilot is the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
5. The person who's sport is climbing must be the freelancer since the person who's sport is climbing is in position 2, and the Indonesian is in position 1, the French is in position 3, the Malaysian is the pilot (gospel fan), the manager is driving the train, the doctor is driving the motorbike, and the photographer is driving the airplane. So, the freelancer is the person who's sport is climbing.
6.

So, the manager is the person who's sport is cricket.
7. The person who's sport is lacrosse must be the doctor since the person who's sport is lacrosse is in position 3 or 5, and the Indonesian is in position 1, the French is in position 3, the Malaysian is the pilot (gospel fan), the manager is driving the train, the doctor is driving the motorbike, the freelancer is the person who's sport is climbing, and the manager is the person who's sport is cricket. So, the doctor is the person who's sport is lacrosse.

Now, let's assign the music-genres:

1. The fan blues is in position 2, so the person with the job of doctor is a fan of blues.
2. The fan rock is in position 1, so the person with the job of photographer is a fan of rock.
3. The fan gospel is the Malaysian (pilot), so the person with the job of pilot is a fan of gospel.
4. The fan hip-hop is in position 3 or 5, and the doctor is in position 3, so the doctor is a fan of hip-hop.
5. The fan classical is in position 4 or 5, and the manager is in position 3, so the manager is a fan of classical.

Now, let's assign the nationalities:

1. The Indonesian is in position 1, so the person with the job of freelancer is Indonesian.
2. The French is in position 3, so the person with the job of manager is French.
3. The Malaysian is in position 5, so the person with the job of pilot is Malaysian.

Finally, let's assign the sports:

1. The person who's sport is climbing is the freelancer, so the freelancer's sport is climbing.
2. The person who's sport is cricket is the manager, so the manager's sport is cricket.
3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the pilot, so the pilot's sport is ice-hockey.
4. The person who's sport is lacrosse is the doctor, so the doctor's sport is lacrosse.
5. The person who's sport is sailing is the person in position 1, but we don't know their job yet.

We still need to assign the job and sport of the person in position 1. Since the person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing, and the freelancer (Indonesian) is the person who's sport is climbing, the person in position 1 must be the person driving the train. Since the manager is a fan of classical music and the manager is driving the train, the person in position 1 must be the manager. So, the manager's sport is sailing.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |     1      |     2      |      3       |     4     |     5     |

Lv10-5x5-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign odd and even positions to the columns. We'll number them from left to right, starting with 1 for the first column (Beverage) and increasing by 2 for each subsequent column (Job, Pet, Sport, Transport).

2. Let's assign jobs, pets, sports, and transports to the rows. We'll use the same numbering system as the columns, starting with 1 for the first row (Fantas) and increasing by 1 for each subsequent row.

3. Now, let's start solving the clues. We'll use the clue numbers to keep track of the order.

   - Clue 1: The person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the person driving the car. This means Lacrosse cannot be in columns 3, 5, or an even column.

   - Clue 2: The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. This means Mirinda and Lemonade must be in adjacent columns.

   - Clue 3: The owner of the bird is between the security-guard and the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we know Lacrosse is not in even columns, the bird cannot be in column 2 (even). Also, the bird cannot be in column 1 (Beverage) because the security-guard must be in an even column (Clue 13). So, the bird must be in column 3, 5, or 7.

   - Clue 4: The person who's sport is golf is not the person drinking fanta. This means Golf cannot be in the same column as Fantas.

   - Clue 5: The person driving the roller is the owner of the fish. Since the fish must be in an even column (Clue 17), the roller must be in an even column.

   - Clue 6: The person driving the roller is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means Roller cannot be in column 5 (since Lacrosse is in column 3).

   - Clue 7: The person who's sport is rugby is in the middle. This means Rugby must be in column 3.

   - Clue 8: The person driving the roller is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means Roller cannot be in column 5 (since Lacrosse is in column 3).

   - Clue 9: The analyst is the person who's sport is volleyball. This means Volleyball must be in an odd column.

   - Clue 10: The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means Fanta cannot be in column 1 (since Hot-chocolate is in column 3).

   - Clue 11: The owner of the bird is in an odd position. We already know the bird is in column 3.

   - Clue 12: The owner of the lizard is not to the left of the person driving the ship. This means Lizard cannot be in column 1, 3, or 5.

   - Clue 13: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. This means Hot-chocolate and Jet-ski must be in adjacent columns.

   - Clue 14: The person drinking fanta is the person driving the ship or the person driving the ship is the person who's sport is golf, but not both. This means Fanta cannot be in column 6 (since Golf is in column 4).

   - Clue 15: The person driving the car is the owner of the chinchilla or the person driving the car is the person who's sport is lacrosse, but not both. This means Chinchilla cannot be in column 3 (since Lacrosse is in column 3).

   - Clue 16: The security-guard is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since we know the ship is in an even column, the security-guard must be in an odd column.

   - Clue 17: The owner of the fish is in an even position. We already know the fish is in column 4.

   - Clue 18: The owner of the lizard and the person driving the jet-ski have different parity positions. We know the fish (jet-ski) is in an even column, so the lizard must be in an odd column.

   - Clue 19: The person driving the bus is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship. This means Bus cannot be in column 4 (since Ship is in column 4).

   - Clue 20: The person who's sport is cycling is the person drinking lemonade. This means Cycling must be in an odd column (since Lemonade is in column 5).

   - Clue 21: The owner of the bird is the person driving the car or the social-worker is the owner of the bird, but not both. This means the social-worker cannot be in column 3 (since the bird is in column 3).

   - Clue 22: The person who's sport is cycling is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade. This means Cycling cannot be in column 5.

   - Clue 23: The teacher and the person who's sport is lacrosse have different parity positions. We already know Lacrosse is in column 3 (odd), so the teacher must be in an even column.

   - Clue 24: The person driving the ship and the owner of the chinchilla have the same parity positions. We know the ship is in an even column, so the chinchilla must be in an even column.

   - Clue 25: The person driving the car is not to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. This means Car cannot be in column 2 (since Chinchilla is in column 4).

   - Clue 26: The person driving the ship and the social-worker have the same parity positions. We know the ship is in an even column, so the social-worker must be in an even column.

   - Clue 27: The person driving the ship and the owner of the chinchilla have the same parity positions. We already know this.

   - Clue 28: The person driving the car is not to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. This means Car cannot be in column 2 (since Chinchilla is in column 4).

   - Clue 29: The person drinking fanta is not to the left of the person driving the ship. This means Fanta cannot be in column 2 (since Ship is in column 4).

   - Clue 30: The person drinking iced-tea and the person driving the jet-ski have the same parity positions. We know the jet-ski is in an odd column (since Hot-chocolate is in an even column), so Iced-tea must be in an odd column.

   - Clue 31: The social-worker is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. This means Golf cannot be in column 1 (since the social-worker must be in an even column).

   - Clue 32: The person who's sport is volleyball is not to the right of the person drinking fanta. This means Volleyball cannot be in column 5 (since Fanta is in column 3).

   - Clue 33: The person who's sport is golf is on the left of the owner of the bird. This means Golf must be in column 1 (since the bird is in column 3).

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Beverage    | Fantas  | Hot-chocolate | Iced-tea | Lemonade | Mirinda |
|------------|--------|--------------|---------|----------|--------|
| Job         | Golf   | Social-worker | Teacher | Analyst  | Journalist |

| Sport       | Cycling| Rugby        | Volleyball| Lacrosse | Golf   |
| Transport   | Bus    | Jet-ski      | Roller  | Car      | Ship   |

This is the final solution table:

Now let's start filling in the table:

| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Cola      | Fanta      | Sprite     | 7up        |
| Food          | Kale       | Corn      | Pineapple  | Lime       | Pepper     |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific | Action    | Thriller   | Romance    | Superhero  |
| Nationality   | American   | Thai      | Egyptian   | Australian | Russian    |
| Transport     | Bike       | Trike     | Helicopter | Scooter    | Van        |

From clues 1, 2, 3, and 12, we know that the Thai is in position 5, the American is in position 6, and the Russian is in position 2 or 3 or 4. Since the Thai is in position 5, the Australian must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 13, we know that the person drinking fanta is in an even position, so it cannot be in position 1 or 3. Therefore, the person drinking fanta is in position 4 or 6. Since the Thai is in position 5, the person driving the trike cannot be the Thai, so it must be in position 2 or 4.

From clue 18, we know that the Thai is in an even position, so the person driving the trike must be in position 4. Therefore, the person driving the helicopter is in position 5, and the person driving the scooter is in position 2.

From clue 9, we know that the Egyptian is in position 1 or 3. Since the person driving the scooter is in position 2, the Egyptian cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 1.

From clue 24, we know that the person watching romance movies is somewhere between the person eating kale and the person eating lime. Since the person eating kale is in position 1 and the person drinking sprite is in position 1, the person eating lime must be in position 3.

From clue 29, we know that the person watching romance movies is somewhere between the person eating kale and the person eating lime, so the person watching action movies must be in position 2.

From clue 23, we know that the person drinking cola is not to the right of the person eating corn, so the person drinking cola must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the person driving the scooter is in position 2 and the person driving the trike is in position 4, the person drinking cola cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 26, we know that the person eating pineapple is on the left or right of the person drinking cola, so the person drinking cola must be in position 1. Therefore, the person driving the helicopter is in position 5, the person driving the scooter is in position 2, the person driving the trike is in position 4, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3, the person drinking fanta is in position 6, the person drinking sprite is in position 1, the person eating kale is in position 1, the person eating lime is in position 3, the person watching action movies is in position 2, the person watching romance movies is in position 3, the person watching scientific movies is in position 5, the person watching thriller movies is in position 4, the person eating corn is in position 1, the person eating pineapple is in position 5, the person eating pepper is in position 4, and the person eating Australian is in position 1.

Here is the final solution table:
