Lv10-7x6-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by assigning the nationalities to the positions. From rule 39, 40, and 48, we know that the Australian, Egyptian, and Colombian are in positions 1, 4, and 6 respectively (since they can be on the left or right of the person eating lime). The Chinese cannot be in position 1 or 6 (rules 25, 38, and 39), so they must be in position 5. The Japanese can't be in position 1 (rule 25), so they must be in position 2. The Malaysian can't be in position 1 or 6 (rule 33), so they must be in position 3. The Egyptian cannot be in position 6 (rule 39), so they must be in position 2.

Since the Malaysian is in position 3, they cannot be drinking water (as it would violate rule 24, which states that the jet-ski driver cannot be to the left of the Japanese, who is in position 2). So, the Malaysian must be eating garlic in position 3.

6. From rule 41, the Japanese is to the left of the fan folk. Since the Japanese is in position 2, the fan folk must be in position 5.

Lv10-7x6-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. Let's start by placing the people with unique conditions. The person who's hobby is singing is the owner of the dog (6), the fan folk is in an even position (33), the fan metal is not to the left of the fan jazz (34), the person drinking water is not to the right of the fan metal (33), and the fan dubstep is the owner of the goldfish (47).

2. From 16, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not the person who's sport is tennis (6). So, the person who's sport is tennis cannot be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the person drinking sprite is in an even position (13), the person who's sport is tennis must be in an odd position. Let's place tennis in position 1 (as it's the only odd position left).

3. From 14, the photographer is between the person drinking juice and the owner of the goat. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 5 (an even position), the person drinking juice must be in an odd position. Let's place juice in position 3. Now, the photographer must be in position 4.

4. From 24, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is not in position 1 (as tennis is there), the entrepreneur must be in position 2. So, the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 8.

5. From 26, the project-manager is the owner of the goat. Since the photographer is in position 4, the goat must be in position 6.

6. From 28, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the person eating cherry. Since the person eating cherry is on the right of the person drinking sprite (31), the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in position 6.

7. From 29, the person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position 8 (as the fan dubstep is there), the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 7.

8. From 30, the person eating cranberry is somewhere to the right of the person eating cherry. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6, the person eating cherry must be in position 5. So, the person eating cranberry is in position 6.

9. From 31, the person drinking sprite is on the right of the person eating cherry. So, the person drinking sprite is in position 1.

10. From 35, the person eating cranberry is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the person who's sport is tennis is in position 1, the person who's sport is rugby must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 1, the person who's sport is rugby cannot be in position 1 or 3 (due to parity). So, the person who's sport is rugby must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6, the person who's sport is rugby cannot be in position 6 (due to parity). So, the person who's sport is rugby must be in position 4.

11. Continuing with the parity conditions, we can place the doctor (odd position) in position 3, the person who's hobby is camping (even position) in position 2, and the person who's hobby is skydiving (odd position) in position 5.

12. From 18, the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person eating spinach have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6 (odd), the person eating spinach must be in position 4 (odd).

13. From 19, the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the fan punk have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6 (odd), the fan punk must be in position 5 (even).

14. From 20, the owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere between the doctor and the person eating cranberry. Since the doctor is in position 3 and the person eating cranberry is in position 6, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 4 or 5. Since the fan punk is in position 5, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 4 (as the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6). So, the owner of the guinea-pig is the project-manager.

15. From 21, the person who's sport is rugby and the doctor have the same parity positions. Since the doctor is in position 3, the person who's sport is rugby must be in position 3.

16. From 22, the photographer is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 5. So, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the software-developer.

17. From 23, the person who's sport is rugby is somewhere between the fan jazz and the fan metal. Since the fan metal is in position 8 and the person who's sport is rugby is in position 3, the fan jazz must be in position 2.

18. From 25, the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the person who's sport is rugby is in position 3, the person who's hobby is skydiving can be in position 2 or 4. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6, the person who's hobby is skydiving cannot be in position 6 (due to parity). So, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 2.

19. From 27, the entrepreneur is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2, the entrepreneur must be in position 6. So, the person who's sport is skateboarding is in position 8.

Since the person who's sport is tennis is in position 1, the person who's sport is handball cannot be in position 1 or 3 (due to parity). So, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6, the person who's sport is handball cannot be in position 6 (due to parity). So, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 2. Now, the person eating cranberry must be in position 4, and the person eating artichoke must be in position 3.

21. From 37, the owner of the goat is not to the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 1, the owner of the goat must be in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 6, the owner of the goat cannot be in position 6 (due to parity). So, the owner of the goat must be in position 2.

22. From 38, the owner of the turtle is the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is in position 6, the owner of the turtle is in position 6.

Lv10-7x6-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. Let's start by assigning the nationalities to the positions. Since the colombian and the fan blues have the same parity positions (even or odd), and the colombian can't be in position 1 or 6 (rule 41 and 42), the colombian must be in position 2 or 5. If the colombian is in position 2, the fan blues must be in position 4 or 6 (rule 2). However, the fan blues can't be in position 6 because the person driving the motorbike is the person who's hobby is fishing (rule 15), and the motorbike can't be in position 6 (rule 10). So, the colombian is in position 2, and the fan blues is in position 4.

   | Nationality   | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------------|----|--|--|--|--|--|
   | Colombian    |    | X |   | X |   |   |
   | Other        |    |   |   |   |   | X |

2. The Dutch and the fan blues have the same parity positions (rule 52), so the Dutch must be in position 1, 3, or 5. The Dutch can't be in position 1 because the person driving the motorbike is the person who's hobby is fishing (rule 15), and the motorbike can't be in position 1 (rule 10). The Dutch can't be in position 5 because the social-worker is in an odd position (rule 5), and the social-worker can't be in position 3 (rule 35). So, the Dutch is in position 3.

   | Nationality   | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

3. The brazilian can't be in position 1 or 6 (rule 41 and 42), and the brazilian can't be in position 2 because the colombian is in position 2 (rule 1). So, the brazilian must be in position 3, 4, or 5. The brazilian can't be in position 5 because the social-worker is in an odd position (rule 5), and the social-worker can't be in position 3 (rule 35). So, the brazilian is in position 4.

4. The polish can't be in position 1 or 6 (rule 41 and 42), and the polish can't be in position 2 because the colombian is in position 2 (rule 1). So, the polish must be in position 3, 4, or 5. The polish can't be in position 3 because the Dutch is in position 3 (rule 2). So, the polish is in position 5.

5. The Italian can't be in position 1 or 6 (rule 41 and 42), and the Italian can't be in position 2 because the colombian is in position 2 (rule 1). So, the Italian must be in position 3, 4, or 5. The Italian can't be in position 3 because the Dutch is in position 3 (rule 2). The Italian can't be in position 5 because the polish is in position 5 (rule 4). So, the Italian is in position 4.
