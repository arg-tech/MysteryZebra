Lv10-6x4-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign variables to each category and person (B for beverage, F for food, H for hobby, M for movie-genre, G for music-genre, N for nationality). We'll use numbers 1-4 for each category and a letter (A, B, C, D) for each person.

2. From the given information, we know that there are 4 different options for each category. So, B = {coffee, lemonade, milk, sprite}, F = {apple, papaya, radish, spinach}, H = {chess, filmmaking, hiking, sudoku}, M = {documentary, mystery, spy, thriller}, G = {classical, funk, gospel, soul}, N = {argentine, brazilian, indian, pakistani}.

3. Let's start with the nationalities. From rule 10, the person watching spy movies is on the far left, so N1 = pakistani. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the brazilian or the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the fan gospel, but not both. Since we already know N1, let's assume H1 = filmmaking. So, N2 = brazilian. From rule 17, N3 ≠ gospel. From rule 11, N4 ≠ brazilian. So, N4 = argentine.

4. From rule 2, the indian is on the left of the person eating apple. So, N2 < F2. From rule 13, the person drinking sprite is between the indian and the person eating papaya. So, F2 < B2 < F3.

5. From rule 3, the person drinking lemonade and the person watching mystery movies have the same parity positions. Since we know B2 and M3, let's assume B2 = lemonade and M3 = mystery. From rule 16, the person eating papaya is the person who's hobby is filmmaking or the person eating papaya is the person watching spy movies, but not both. So, H3 = filmmaking or H3 = spy.

6. From rule 4, the fan classical is somewhere between the fan soul and the person eating radish. So, G1 < G4 < F4. From rule 5, the fan classical is the person watching documentary movies or the fan classical is the person eating apple, but not both. Since we know M1 and F2, let's assume G1 = classical and F4 = apple.

7. From rule 6, the fan gospel is not to the right of the fan soul. So, G4 ≠ soul. From rule 9, the person drinking coffee is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. So, B4 > M4. From rule 15, the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the fan gospel. So, F3 > G4.

8. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere between the person who's hobby is sudoku and the person drinking sprite. So, H2 = hiking or H2 = sudoku or H2 = sprite. From rule 8, the person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. So, H1 < H3.

9. From rule 14, the fan classical is not to the right of the person drinking sprite. So, G1 < B2. From rule 18, the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the fan soul. So, F3 > G4.

10. From rule 19, the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. So, H2 < H4.

11. From rule 12, the person eating apple is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies. So, F4 > M1. From rule 18, the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the fan soul. So, F3 > G4.

13. From rule 9, the person drinking coffee is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. So, B4 > M4. From rule 15, the person drinking sprite is not to the right of the fan gospel. So, B2 < G4.

14. From rule 6, the fan gospel is not to the right of the fan soul. So, G4 ≠ soul. From rule 19, the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. So, H2 < H4.

15. From rule 14, the fan classical is not to the right of the person drinking sprite. So, G1 < B2. From rule 18, the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the fan soul. So, F3 > G4.

16. From rule 13, the person drinking sprite is between the indian and the person eating papaya. So, F2 < B2 < F3.

17. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere between the person who's hobby is sudoku and the person drinking sprite. So, H2 = hiking or H2 = sudoku or H2 = sprite. From rule 8, the person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. So, H1 < H3.

18. From rule 12, the person eating apple is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies. So, F4 > M1. From rule 18, the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the fan soul. So, F3 > G4.

Lv10-6x4-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the first position, 4 being the fourth position).

2. From rule 1, we know that the person eating pineapple is in position 4.

3. From rule 2, the person driving the subway is either to the left or right of the person eating pineapple (positions 1, 2, or 3). Let's assume for now that it's in position 1 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

4. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is dancing is in position 2 (left of the person eating nectarine, which we'll assign to position 3).

5. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is woodworking is not the person driving the jet-ski and is not the writer. Since we don't know who the writer is yet, let's assume the woodworker is in position 4 for now.

6. From rule 5, the person drinking milk is either the fan of indie or the fan of indie is the person who's hobby is cooking, but not both. Since we don't know who the fan of indie is yet, let's assume the person drinking milk is in position 1.

7. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 3 (left of the person who's hobby is cooking).

8. From rule 7, the architect is in position 4 (right of the person driving the airplane).

9. From rule 8, the person driving the jet-ski is either the person drinking soy-milk or the fan of indie, but not both. Since we already assigned the fan of indie to position 1, let's assume the person driving the jet-ski is in position 2.

10. From rule 9, the person driving the helicopter and the person who's hobby is cooking have the same parity positions. Since the cook is in position 3, the helicopter driver must be in an odd position (1 or 3). Let's assume the helicopter driver is in position 3 for now.

11. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is dancing is the analyst or the person drinking fanta is the person who's hobby is dancing, but not both. Since we already assigned the dancer to position 2, the person drinking fanta must be the analyst (position 1).

12. From rule 11, the fan of indie cannot be in position 1 (since the analyst is there). So, the fan of indie must be in position 4.

13. From rule 13, the person eating nectarine is the fan of indie.

14. From rule 14, the person driving the jet-ski and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions. Since the jet-ski driver is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 4.

15. From rule 15, the person driving the helicopter is in position 3.

16. From rule 16, the person eating pineapple is the analyst.

17. From rule 17, the person eating peas is not to the right of the fan of techno. Since the fan of techno is in position 4, the person eating peas must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But position 3 is occupied by the cook, and position 2 is occupied by the dancer, so the person eating peas must be in position 1.

18. From rule 18, the person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk (which is a contradiction, so our assumption about the jet-ski driver being in position 2 was incorrect). Let's try position 3 instead.

19. From rule 19, the fan of jazz is the person eating raspberry.

20. From rule 20, the person driving the helicopter is to the right of the fan of techno. Since the helicopter driver is in position 3 and the fan of techno is in position 4, this is satisfied.

21. From rule 21, the person driving the helicopter is the person who's hobby is dancing, which contradicts our current assignment of the helicopter driver (position 3). This means our assumption about the helicopter driver being the dancer was incorrect. Let's try position 1 instead.

22. From rule 22, the person driving the airplane is the fan of jazz or the person driving the airplane is the person who's hobby is filmmaking, but not both. Since we already assigned the fan of jazz to position 4, the person driving the airplane must be the person who's hobby is filmmaking (position 3).

Now, let's check our assumptions:
1. The person eating pineapple is in position 4 (correct)
2. The person driving the subway is in position 1 (correct)
3. The person who's hobby is dancing is in position 2 (correct)
4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in position 4 (correct)
5. The person drinking milk is in position 1 (correct)
6. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 3 (correct)
7. The architect is in position 4 (correct)
8. The person driving the jet-ski is in position 3 (correct)
9. The person drinking soy-milk is in position 4 (correct)
10. The person driving the helicopter is in position 1 (correct)
11. The person eating nectarine is the fan of indie (correct)
12. The person driving the jet-ski and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions (correct)
13. The person driving the helicopter and the person eating pineapple have the same parity positions (correct)
14. The person eating pineapple is the analyst (correct)
15. The person eating peas is in position 1 (correct)
16. The person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk (correct)
17. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the fan of techno (correct)
18. The person driving the helicopter is the person who's hobby is dancing (correct)
19. The person eating raspberry is the fan of jazz (correct)
20. The person driving the helicopter is to the right of the fan of techno (correct)
21. The person driving the airplane is the fan of jazz or the person driving the airplane is the person who's hobby is filmmaking, but not both (correct)

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |     4     |

Lv10-6x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person in the table based on their job, music-genre, nationality, pet, sport, and transport. We will use the numbers in the clues to indicate the relative positions of the people.

Let's start by assigning variables to each person:

A - Analyst
D - Designer
S - Scientist
SD - Software Developer

M1, M2, M3, M4 - Music-Genre (Disco, Electronic, Gospel, Punk)
N1, N2, N3, N4 - Nationality (Colombian, Malaysian, Nigerian, Turkish)
P1, P2, P3, P4 - Pet (Goldfish, Hedgehog, Horse, Lizard)
S1, S2, S3, S4 - Sport (Basketball, Cricket, Cycling, Surfing)
T1, T2, T3, T4 - Transport (Boat, Bus, Motorbike, Roller)

We will use the clues to deduce the relationships between these variables.

1. The person driving the bus is not the fan disco (T2 ≠ M1)
2. The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the left of the fan punk (P2 < M3)
3. The designer is the person driving the motorbike or the designer is the Colombian, but not both (D = T3 or N3, D ≠ N3)
4. The person who's sport is surfing is not the software-developer (S3 ≠ SD)
5. The scientist is on the left or right of the Colombian (S ≤ N3 or S ≥ N3)
6. The owner of the hedgehog and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions (P2 and T3 have the same parity)
7. The Turkish is on the right of the fan disco (N4 > M1)
8. The owner of the lizard is the software-developer or the software-developer is the person who's sport is cricket, but not both (SD = P4 or S4 = Cricket, SD ≠ P4 and SD ≠ S4)
9. The fan gospel is on the left or right of the fan punk (M2 ≤ M3 or M2 ≥ M3)
10. The owner of the lizard is not the fan electronic (P4 ≠ M2)
11. The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat (S1 < T4)
12. The person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller (T4 > T3)
13. The fan gospel is the person who's sport is cricket or the fan gospel is the owner of the goldfish, but not both (M3 = S4 or M3 = P1, M3 ≠ P1 and M3 ≠ S4)
14. The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goldfish (S3 < P1)
15. The fan electronic is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing (M2 < S3)
16. The designer is the Nigerian or the designer is the person who's sport is cricket, but not both (D = N2 or S2, D ≠ N2 and D ≠ S2)
17. The person driving the bus is the owner of the goldfish or the owner of the goldfish is the fan gospel, but not both (T2 = P1 or P1 = M3, T2 ≠ P1 and P1 ≠ M3)
18. The person driving the boat is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish (T4 < P1)
19. The fan electronic is between the fan disco and the analyst (M2 < A and A < M1)
20. The person who's sport is basketball and the designer have the same parity positions (S1 and D have the same parity)
21. The analyst and the person driving the roller have different parity positions (A ≠ T3)
22. The owner of the lizard and the analyst have the same parity positions (P4 and A have the same parity)
23. The person driving the boat is not the software-developer (T4 ≠ SD)
24. The Nigerian is somewhere to the left of the Malay (N2 < N4)
25. The owner of the goldfish and the fan punk have different parity positions (P1 and M3 have different parity)

Now let's use these relationships to deduce the positions of each variable:

1. From clue 1, we know T2 ≠ M1. Since there are only 4 music genres, M1 must be one of M2, M3, or M4. Let's assume M1 = M2 (for now).
2. From clue 2, P2 < M3. Since P2 is a pet and there are only 4 pets, P2 must be one of P1, P3, or P4. Let's assume P2 = P3 (for now).
3. From clue 3, D = T3 or N3, D ≠ N3. Since D is a job and there are only 4 jobs, D must be one of A, S, or SD. Let's assume D = A (for now).
4. From clue 4, S3 ≠ SD. Since S is a job and there are only 4 jobs, S must be one of A, D, or S. Let's assume S = S (for now).
5. From clue 5, S ≤ N3 or S ≥ N3. Since S is a job and N3 is the Colombian, S cannot be the Colombian. So, S ≥ N3.
6. From clue 6, P2 and T3 have the same parity. Since P2 = P3 and T3 = T2 (from our assumptions), P2 and T2 have the same parity.
7. From clue 7, N4 > M1 (assuming M1 = M2). Since N4 is a nationality and there are only 4 nationalities, N4 must be one of N1, N2, or N3. Let's assume N4 = N1 (for now).
8. From clue 8, SD = P4 or S4 = Cricket, SD ≠ P4 and SD ≠ S4. Since SD is a job and P4 is a pet, SD cannot be the pet. So, S4 = Cricket.
9. From clue 9, M2 ≤ M3 or M2 ≥ M3. Since M2 = M1 (our assumption), M1 ≤ M3.
10. From clue 10, P4 ≠ M2. Since P4 is a pet and M2 = M1 (our assumption), P4 ≠ M1.
11. From clue 11, S1 < T4. Since S1 is a sport and T4 is a transport, S1 cannot be the transport. So, T4 = T1, T2, or T3. Let's assume T4 = T1 (for now).
12. From clue 12, T4 > T3. Since T4 = T1 (our assumption), T3 = T2.
13. From clue 13, M3 = S4 or M3 = P1, M3 ≠ P1 and M3 ≠ S4. Since M3 = M1 (our assumption), M1 = S4.
14. From clue 14, S3 < P1. Since S3 = S (our assumption), P1 > S.
15. From clue 15, M2 < S3. Since M2 = M1 (our assumption), M1 < S.
16. From clue 16, D = N2 or S2, D ≠ N2 and D ≠ S2. Since D = A (our assumption), A ≠ N2 and A ≠ S2.
17. From clue 17, T2 = P1 or P1 = M3, T2 ≠ P1 and P1 ≠ M3. Since T2 = T3 (our assumption), P1 = M3.
18. From clue 18, T4 < P1. Since T4 = T1 (our assumption), P1 > T1.
19. From clue 19, M2 < A and A < M1. Since M2 = M1 (our assumption), A is in the middle.
20. From clue 20, S1 and D have the same parity. Since S1 = S (our assumption), D is either S or S1. Since D ≠ S (our assumption), D = S1.
21. From clue 21, A ≠ T3. Since T3 = T2 (our assumption), A ≠ T2.
22. From clue 22, P4 and A have the same parity. Since P4 = P1 (our assumption), A is even.
23. From clue 23, T4 ≠ SD. Since T4 = T1 (our assumption), SD is not T1, T2, or T3.
24. From clue 24, N2 < N4. Since N4 = N1 (our assumption), N2 = N3.
25. From clue 25, P1 and M3 have different parity. Since P1 = P3 (our assumption), M3 is odd.

Now let's check our assumptions:

1. M1 = M2 is incorrect because M3 is odd, so M1 must be M3.
2. P2 = P3 is incorrect because P2 and P3 have the same parity, but P2 = P3 would make them both even. So, P2 = P4 and P3 = P1.
3. D = A is incorrect because D ≠ S (our assumption). So, D = S or SD. Since D ≠ S (our assumption), D = SD.
4. S = S is correct.
5. S ≥ N3 is correct.
6. P2 and T2 have the same parity is correct.
7. N4 > M1 is correct.
8. SD = P4 is correct.
9. M1 ≤ M3 is correct.
10. P4 ≠ M1 is correct.
11. S1 < T4 is correct.
12. T4 > T3 is correct.
13. M3 = S4 is correct.
14. S3 < P1 is correct.
15. M2 < S3 is correct.
16. D ≠ N2 and D ≠ S2 is correct.
17. T2 = P1 is correct.
18. T4 < P1 is correct.
19. M2 < A and A < M1 is correct.
20. S1 and D have the same parity is correct.
21. A ≠ T2 is correct.
22. P4 and A have the same parity is correct.
23. T4 ≠ SD is correct.
24. N2 < N4 is correct.
25. P1 and M3 have different parity is correct.

Now we have the following assignments:

A - Software Developer
D - Designer
S - Scientist
SD - Analyst

M1 - Punk
M2 - Disco
M3 - Gospel
M4 - Electronic

N1 - Colombian
N2 - Nigerian

Lv10-6x4-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions and items for each category. Let's start by assigning variables to each category and position.

1. Beverage: B1, B2, B3, B4
2. Food: F1, F2, F3, F4
3. Job: J1, J2, J3, J4
4. Pet: P1, P2, P3, P4
5. Sport: S1, S2, S3, S4
6. Transport: T1, T2, T3, T4

Now let's use the clues to fill in the table:

1. The lawyer is not the person drinking iced-tea: J1 ≠ B1
2. The librarian is not to the left of the librarian: J3 ≠ F3
3. The person eating peas and the person drinking tea have different parity positions: (F3 ≠ B3) or (F4 ≠ B4)
4. The person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing: F2 = S3 or F4 = S3
5. The person driving the scooter is not the owner of the turtle: T3 ≠ P3
6. The person drinking soy-milk is between the person who's sport is badminton and the person who's sport is surfing: (S1 < B2 < B3) or (B2 < S2 < B3)
7. The person who's sport is surfing is the owner of the pony or the person who's sport is surfing is the person drinking sprite, but not both: S4 = P2 or S4 = B4, but not both
8. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski: B1 ≠ T2
9. The person who's sport is surfing is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk: S4 ≠ B2
10. The person eating peas and the owner of the rabbit have the same parity positions: (F3 ≠ F4) or (P3 ≠ P4)
11. The librarian is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk: J3 > B2
12. The mechanic is the person who's sport is baseball: J4 = S2
13. The person who's sport is badminton is not the owner of the pony: S1 ≠ P2
14. The owner of the dog and the person eating radish have different parity positions: P1 ≠ F4
15. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish: B1 > F4
16. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person drinking sprite: T2 > B4
17. The owner of the turtle is between the person eating cucumber and the person drinking tea: P3 ≤ F2 and P3 ≤ B3
18. The lawyer is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski: J1 ≤ T2 or J1 ≥ T2
19. The person driving the jet-ski is not to the right of the person who's sport is baseball: T2 < J4
20. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite: B2 > B4
21. The person driving the skateboard and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions: T4 ≠ P4
22. The person driving the jet-ski is not the mechanic: T2 ≠ J4

Now we have a system of equations and inequalities to solve. We can start by assigning values to the food and beverages based on their parity positions. Since F3 and F4 have different parity positions, let F3 be an odd position and F4 be an even position. Similarly, let B3 be an odd position and B4 be an even position.

Now we can assign values to the jobs, pets, sports, and transports based on the given clues.

1. J1 = Designer (since the lawyer is not the person drinking iced-tea)
2. J2 = Lawyer (since the mechanic is the person who's sport is baseball)
3. J3 = Librarian (since the librarian is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk)
4. J4 = Mechanic (since the person driving the jet-ski is not the mechanic)
5. P1 = Dog (since the owner of the dog and the person eating radish have different parity positions)
6. P2 = Pony (since the person who's sport is surfing is the owner of the pony or the person who's sport is surfing is the person drinking sprite)
7. P3 = Turtle (since the owner of the turtle is between the person eating cucumber and the person drinking tea)
8. P4 = Rabbit (since the person driving the skateboard and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions)
9. S1 = Badminton (since the person who's sport is badminton is not the owner of the pony)
10. S2 = Baseball (since the mechanic is the person who's sport is baseball)
11. S3 = Sailing (since the person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing)
12. S4 = Surfing (since the person who's sport is surfing is the owner of the pony or the person who's sport is surfing is the person drinking sprite)
13. T1 = Jet-ski (since the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person drinking sprite)
14. T2 = Motorbike (since the lawyer is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski and the mechanic is not the person driving the jet-ski)
15. T3 = Scooter (since the person driving the scooter is not the owner of the turtle)
16. T4 = Skateboard (since the person driving the skateboard and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions)

Lv10-6x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 columns and 5 rows, so each person/item is in a unique position. Let's label the positions from left to right and top to bottom as A1, B1, C1, D1, E1 for the first row, A2, B2, C2, D2, E2 for the second row, and so on.

2. From the given information, we can start filling in some positions:
   - The bartender is on the far left (A1)
   - The japanese is on the right of the person drinking sprite (E1 or E2)
   - The dancer is somewhere to the right of the argentine (B1 or C1 or D1 or E1)
   - The owner of the horse is not the person who's sport is rowing (not A2, B2, C2, D2)
   - The owner of the lizard is not to the left of the australian (not A2, B2)
   - The japanese is somewhere to the right of the owner of the cat (C2 or D2 or E2)

3. Let's assume the japanese is in position E1. Then the person drinking sprite must be in position D1. Now we have:
   - A1: bartender
   - B1: argentine
   - C1: dancer (to the right of argentine)
   - D1: person drinking sprite
   - E1: japanese

4. The owner of the horse is not in the first row, so it must be in the second row. Since the japanese is to the right of the horse, the horse can only be in position A2, B2, or C2. But the horse is not the person who's sport is rowing, so it can't be in A2 or C2. So, the horse is in B2.

5. The owner of the lizard is not to the left of the australian, so the lizard can't be in A2, B2, or C2. It must be in D2 or E2. But the lizard and the person drinking sprite have different parity positions, so the lizard can't be in E2 (since the sprite is in D1). So, the lizard is in D2.

6. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere between the nigerian and the person drinking sprite. Since the nigerian is in E1 and the sprite is in D1, the hot-chocolate can only be in C1 or D1. But the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in an odd position, and the person who's sport is golf is on the right of the owner of the bird, so the hot-chocolate can't be in D1. So, the hot-chocolate is in C1.

7. The person who's hobby is baking is in an even position. Since the bartender is in position A1 (odd), the hobby of baking can't be in the first row. So, the hobby of baking is in the second row. But the hobby of baking is not the videographer (since they have different parity positions), so the hobby of baking is in D2.

8. The person who's sport is badminton is not to the left of the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard is in D2, the sport of badminton can't be in A2, B2, or C2. So, the sport of badminton is in E2.

9. The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the horse is in B2 and the golf can't be in A2 or C2, the golf can only be in A1 or B1. But the golf can't be in A1 (since the bartender is there), so the golf is in B1.

10. The person who's hobby is collecting is not the argentine. Since the argentine is in B1, the hobby of collecting can't be in the first row. So, the hobby of collecting is in the second row. But the hobby of collecting is not the hobby of baking (since they have different parity positions), so the hobby of collecting is in A2 or C2. But the hobby of collecting is not the hobby of magic-tricks (since they have the same parity positions), so the hobby of collecting is in C2.

11. The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard is in D2, the sport of lacrosse can only be in E2, E3, or E4. But the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in an odd position, and the person who's sport is golf is on the right of the owner of the bird, so the sport of lacrosse can't be in E2. So, the sport of lacrosse is in E3 or E4.

12. The firefighter and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions. Since the firefighter can't be in the first row (bartender is there), the firefighter can only be in the second row. But the firefighter can't be in C2 (since the hobby of collecting is there), so the firefighter is in A2 or E2. But the firefighter can't be in E2 (since the hobby of collecting is there), so the firefighter is in A2.

13. The person who's sport is golf is the nigerian or the person drinking sprite is the person who's sport is golf, but not both. Since the nigerian is in E1 and the sprite is in D1, the person drinking sprite can't be the person who's sport is golf. So, the nigerian is the person who's sport is golf.

14. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in an odd position. Since the firefighter is in A2, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in B3, C3, D3, or E3. But the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not the person drinking sprite (since they have different parity positions), so the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not in E3. So, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in B3, C3, or D3. But the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not the person who's hobby is collecting (since they have the same parity positions), so the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in C3.

15. The person who's sport is rowing is not the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (since they have different parity positions). Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in C3, the person who's sport is rowing can only be in A4, B4, D4, or E4. But the person who's sport is rowing is not the person who's hobby is baking (since they have different parity positions), so the person who's sport is rowing is not in A4. So, the person who's sport is rowing is in B4, D4, or E4. But the person who's sport is rowing is not the person who's hobby is collecting (since they have different parity positions), so the person who's sport is rowing is not in E4. So, the person who's sport is rowing is in D4.

16. The person who's hobby is skydiving is not determined yet. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in C3, the person who's hobby is skydiving can only be in A4, B4, or E4. But the person who's hobby is skydiving is not the person who's hobby is collecting (since they have different parity positions), so the person who's hobby is skydiving is not in E4. So, the person who's hobby is skydiving is in A4 or B4. But the person who's hobby is skydiving is not the person who's hobby is baking (since they have different parity positions), so the person who's hobby is skydiving is not in A4. So, the person who's hobby is skydiving is in B4.

17. The person who's sport is badminton is in E2.
18. The person who's hobby is collecting is in C2.
19. The person who's job is videographer is not determined yet. Since the person who's hobby is baking is in D2, the person who's job is videographer can only be in A3, B3, or E3. But the person who's job is videographer is not the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (since they have different parity positions), so the person who's job is videographer is not in B3. So, the person who's job is videographer is in A3 or E3. But the person who's job is videographer is not the person who's hobby is collecting (since they have different parity positions), so the person who's job is videographer is not in E3. So, the person who's job is videographer is in A3.
20. The person who's nationality is australian is not determined yet. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is in B4, the person who's nationality is australian can only be in A1, A2, C1, C2, D1, or D2. But the person who's nationality is australian is not the person who's hobby is baking (since they have different parity positions), so the person who's nationality is australian is not in A1 or D1. So, the person who's nationality is australian is in A2, C2, or D2. But the person who's nationality is australian is not the person who's hobby is collecting (since they have different parity positions), so the person who's nationality is australian is not in C2. So, the person who's nationality is australian is in D2.

Lv10-6x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 odd and 3 even positions. Let's label the positions from left to right as 1 (far left), 2, 3 (far right), 4, 5, 6, 7.

2. The person driving the boat is on the far right (3).

3. The owner of the hedgehog is in an odd position (3, 5, or 7). Let's assume it's 7 for now.

4. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the fan metal (3 or 5). Since the boat is on the far right, the fan metal must be on the left (1).

5. The person eating cabbage is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog (not 7). So, the owner of the frog is either 1, 2, 4, or 6. Since the hedgehog owner is 7 and we can't have two pets in the same column, the frog owner can't be 7. So, the frog owner is either 1, 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume it's 2 for now.

6. The fisherman is on the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the grapefruit eater can't be 3. So, the grapefruit eater can be 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's 4 for now.

7. The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is swimming (not 7). So, the swimmer can't be 7. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the swimmer can't be 3. So, the swimmer can be 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's 5 for now.

8. The person driving the quad-bike is the fan rock. So, the rock fan can't be 1, 2, 4, or 7 (since the hedgehog owner and the boat driver are already assigned). So, the rock fan is 3 or 6. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the rock fan can't be 3. So, the rock fan is 6.

9. The person driving the quad-bike is the owner of the frog. So, the frog owner is 6.

10. The person driving the motorbike is the fan metal or the person eating apricot, but not both. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the apricot eater can't be 3. So, the apricot eater can be 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's 1 for now.

11. The paramedic is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the cyclist can't be 3. So, the cyclist can be 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's 5 for now.

12. The paramedic and the person who's sport is swimming have the same parity positions. Since the paramedic is on the left of the cyclist (odd position), the swimmer must also be on an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7). Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the swimmer can't be 3. So, the swimmer is 1 or 5. Since the paramedic is already assigned to 5, the swimmer is 1.

13. The owner of the hedgehog is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming. So, the hedgehog owner can't be 1, 3, 5, or 7. So, the hedgehog owner is 2 or 4. Since the frog owner is 6, the hedgehog owner can't be 6. So, the hedgehog owner is 2.

14. The paramedic is on the far left or far right. Since the paramedic is already assigned to 5, the paramedic is on the far left (1).

15. The person driving the boat is the fan punk. So, the punk fan can't be 1, 2, 4, or 7 (since the hedgehog owner, the paramedic, and the boat driver are already assigned). So, the punk fan is 3 or 6. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the punk fan can't be 3. So, the punk fan is 6.

16. The teacher is not to the left of the person driving the boat. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the teacher can't be 1, 2, 4, or 6. So, the teacher is 3, 5, or 7. Since the hedgehog owner is 2 and the paramedic is 1, the teacher can't be 1 or 2. So, the teacher is 3, 5, or 7. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the teacher can't be 3. So, the teacher is 5 or 7. Since the swimmer is 1, the teacher can't be 7. So, the teacher is 5.

17. The person driving the motorbike is the fan metal or the person eating apricot, but not both. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the apricot eater can't be 3. So, the apricot eater can be 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Since the teacher is 5, the apricot eater can't be 5. So, the apricot eater is 1, 2, 4, or 6. Since the paramedic is 1 and the hedgehog owner is 2, the apricot eater can't be 1 or 2. So, the apricot eater is 4 or 6. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the apricot eater can't be 6. So, the apricot eater is 4.

18. The person who's sport is soccer is the paramedic or the owner of the turtle is the person who's sport is soccer, but not both. Since the paramedic is the soccer player, the turtle owner can't be the soccer player. So, the turtle owner can be 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the turtle owner can't be 3. So, the turtle owner is 1, 5, or 7. Since the swimmer is 1, the turtle owner can't be 1. So, the turtle owner is 5 or 7. Since the teacher is 5, the turtle owner can't be 5. So, the turtle owner is 7.

19. The person eating cabbage is on the right of the person eating mango. Since the apricot eater is 4 and the mango eater can't be 1 (since the paramedic is 1), the mango eater can be 2, 3, 5, or 6. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the mango eater can't be 3. So, the mango eater can be 2, 5, or 6. Since the teacher is 5, the mango eater can't be 5. So, the mango eater is 2 or 6. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the mango eater can't be 6. So, the mango eater is 2.

20. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the paramedic is the soccer player, the basketball player can't be 1. So, the basketball player can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7. Since the boat driver (fishing) is on the far right, the basketball player can't be 3. So, the basketball player can be 2, 4, 5, or 7. Since the teacher is 5, the basketball player can't be 5. So, the basketball player is 2, 4, or 7. Since the swimmer is 1, the basketball player can't be 7. So, the basketball player is 2 or 4. Since the hedgehog owner is 2 and the frog owner is 6, the basketball player can't be 2. So, the basketball player is 4.

Lv10-6x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can represent them as P1, P2, P3, and P4 from left to right.

2. We also know the parity positions for some people and their associated activities. Let's assign odd numbers to the odd-positioned people and even numbers to the even-positioned people.

3. From point 12, we know the Mexican (P4) is on the far left, so P4 = Mexican.

4. From point 10, we know the person with the hobby of traveling (P1) is on the far left. So, P1 = traveling.

5. From point 18, we know the owner of the ferret (P3) is somewhere to the left of the owner of the frog. Since P4 is the Mexican and we know his position, P3 must be to the left of P4. So, P3 can only be P2 or P1.

6. From point 19, we know the person with the hobby of photography (P2 or P3) is on the right of the person with the hobby of traveling (P1). So, P2 cannot be P1, so P2 = photography.

7. From point 11, we know the owner of the cat (P2 or P3) is on the left of the person watching romance movies. Since P1 is traveling and P4 is Mexican, P2 or P3 must be to the right of P4. So, P2 cannot be P4, and P3 = cat.

8. From point 20, we know the owner of the cat (P3) is the social-worker. So, P3 = social-worker.

9. From point 21, we know the paramedic (P1, P2, or P4) is in an even position. Since P1 and P4 are already assigned, P2 = paramedic.

10. From point 15, we know the person with the hobby of traveling (P1) is not to the right of the owner of the cat (P3). So, P1 cannot be P4, and P1 = paramedic.

11. Now we have a contradiction because P1 is both paramedic and traveling, but point 13 states that the engineer or the person watching documentary movies is the engineer, but not both. Since P1 is paramedic, the person watching documentary movies must be the engineer. So, P4 = engineer.

12. From point 14, we know the person eating cabbage (P2, P3, or P4) is the person watching horror movies. Since P4 is the engineer, P2 or P3 must be watching horror movies. But P3 is the social-worker, so P2 = horror.

13. From point 16, we know the designer (P1, P2, or P4) is the person eating cabbage. Since P2 is horror, P4 = designer.

14. From point 17, we know the engineer (P4) and the person eating carrot have the same parity positions. Since P4 is an even position, the person eating carrot must be odd, which means P1 = carrot.

15. From point 6, we know the person eating carrot (P1) and the person watching documentary movies have the same parity positions. Since P1 is carrot, the person watching documentary movies is odd, which means P3 = documentary.

16. From point 5, we know P3 is to the left of P4. Since P3 is documentary and P4 is designer, P3 cannot be P2 (because P2 is photography and photography is to the right of traveling). So, P3 = P2.

17. Now we have a contradiction because P3 is both documentary and photography. However, we can deduce that P3 must be documentary because P3 is to the left of P4, and P4 is the designer. So, P3 = documentary and P2 = photography.

18. From point 18, we know the owner of the ferret (P3) is somewhere to the left of the owner of the frog. Since P3 is documentary, the owner of the frog must be P4.

19. From point 19, we know the person with the hobby of photography (P2) is on the right of the person with the hobby of traveling (P1). Since P1 is paramedic and P2 is photography, P4 must be traveling.

20. From point 2, we know the person with the hobby of photography (P2) is the Pakistani. Since P2 is photography and P4 is traveling, P1 must be the American (because the American is watching documentary movies, and P1 and P3 are odd positions).

21. From point 7, we know the American (P1) is watching documentary movies. Since P1 is paramedic, P3 must be the social-worker (because P3 is to the left of P4, and P4 is traveling).

22. From point 8, we know the person watching romance movies is not to the right of the person with the hobby of photography (P2). Since P2 is photography and P4 is traveling, P4 cannot be the person watching romance movies. So, P3 = romance.

23. From point 4, we know the person watching horror movies is the designer (P4). Since P4 is designer and P3 is romance, P1 must be the person watching drama movies (because P1 and P3 are odd positions).

24. From point 1, we know there are 4 different types of food. Since we have assigned all the people, the person eating nectarine must be P2 (because P1 is paramedic, P2 is photography, P3 is romance, and P4 is designer).

So, the final solution table is:

This table represents the final solution to the puzzle."	{'food': ['', '', '', ''], 'hobby': ['paramedic', 'photography', 'designer', 'traveling'], 'job': ['', '', '', ''], 'movie-genre': ['drama', 'documentary', 'horror', 'romance'], 'nationality': ['', '', '', ''], 'pet': ['', '', '', '']}	True	3	False
Lv10-6x4-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person and their corresponding characteristics. Let's start by assigning variables to each person and their characteristics:

1. F1: Food (cucumber, eggplant, orange, tomato)
2. H1: Hobby (collecting, cooking, puzzles, woodworking)
3. J1: Job (freelancer, nurse, security-guard, writer)
4. M1: Music-Genre (indie, punk, rock, trance)
5. P1: Pet (dog, fish, frog, turtle)
6. S1: Sport (badminton, skiing, volleyball, water-polo)

We will use the following variables to represent the positions:

- P1, P2, P3, P4 for the people from left to right
- F1, F2, F3, F4 for the foods
- H1, H2, H3, H4 for the hobbies
- J1, J2, J3, J4 for the jobs
- M1, M2, M3, M4 for the music-genres
- P1, P2, P3, P4 for the pets
- S1, S2, S3, S4 for the sports

Now let's use the given clues to deduce the positions:

1. The freelancer is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting (J1 < H3)
2. The fan rock is not to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking (M3 ≤ H2)
3. The writer is between the person who's sport is volleyball and the person eating orange (J3 > S2 < J2 or J3 < S2 > J2)
4. The freelancer is not to the right of the writer (J1 ≤ J3)
5. The person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (F1 ≈ H3)
6. The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog (F1 > P1)
7. The person who's sport is water-polo is not to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball (S4 > S2)
8. The person who's sport is badminton is the person who's hobby is cooking or the person who's sport is badminton is the security-guard, but not both (S1 = H2 or S1 = J4, but not both)
9. The owner of the fish is on the left or right of the person eating tomato (P2 ≈ F4)
10. The writer and the fan indie have different parity positions (J3 ≠ M2)
11. The owner of the dog is on the far left (P1 = F1)
12. The owner of the dog is somewhere to the left of the fan indie (P1 < M2)
13. The person who's sport is volleyball is not to the right of the person eating eggplant (S2 < F3)
14. The person eating orange is not the person who's sport is water-polo (F2 ≠ S4)
15. The fan punk and the person who's sport is volleyball have different parity positions (M3 ≠ S2)
16. The person who's sport is water-polo and the writer have the same parity positions (S4 ≈ J3)
17. The fan trance is not to the left of the person eating orange (M4 > F2)
18. The nurse is somewhere between the person who's sport is skiing and the person who's hobby is collecting (J2 > S3 > J1 or J2 < S3 < J1)
19. The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing (P4 ≈ S3)
20. The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball (S3 > S2)
21. The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking (S4 < H2)

Now we can start filling in the table with the deduced positions:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |
| Food          | P1 (dog)   |           |           |                |
| Hobby         |           |           | H3        | H1            |
| Job           | J1 (freelancer) | J2 (nurse) | J3 (writer) | J4 (security-guard) |
| Music-Genre   |           |           | M3 (punk) | M4 (trance)   |
| Pet           | P1 (dog)   | P2 (fish)  |           | P4 (turtle)   |
| Sport         | S1 (badminton) | S2 (volleyball) |           | S3 (skiing)   |

We still have some variables that are not yet assigned values: F2 (orange), S4 (water-polo), and H2 (cooking).

From clue 8, we know that S1 = H2 or S1 = J4, but not both. Since J4 is already assigned, S1 must be equal to H2. So, H2 = S1 = badminton.

Now we can fill in the table with the remaining values:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |
| Food          | P1 (dog)   | F2 (orange) |           | P4 (turtle)   |
| Hobby         |           |           | H3        | H2 (badminton) |
| Job           | J1 (freelancer) | J2 (nurse) | J3 (writer) | J4 (security-guard) |
| Music-Genre   |           | M3 (punk)  | M4 (trance)|           |
| Pet           | P1 (dog)   | P2 (fish)  |           | P4 (turtle)   |
| Sport         | S1 (badminton) | S2 (volleyball) |           | S3 (skiing)   |

Now we can use the remaining clues to further deduce the positions of F2 and S4:

- The person eating orange is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog (F2 > P1)
- The person who's sport is water-polo is not to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball (S4 > S2)

Since P1 is already assigned, F2 must be to the right of P1. Since S4 > S2, we can place S4 to the right of S2. So, we can place F2 between P1 and S2, and S4 to the right of S2.

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |
| Food          | P1 (dog)   | F2 (orange) | S2 (volleyball) | P4 (turtle)   |
| Hobby         |           |           | H3        | H2 (badminton) |
| Job           | J1 (freelancer) | J2 (nurse) | J3 (writer) | J4 (security-guard) |
| Music-Genre   |           | M3 (punk)  | M4 (trance)|           |
| Pet           | P1 (dog)   | P2 (fish)  |           | P4 (turtle)   |
| Sport         | S1 (badminton) | S2 (volleyball) | S3 (skiing) | S4 (water-polo) |

Now we have a complete table with all the variables assigned values:

Step 44: The person who's hobby is traveling (T) is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water (W), so W cannot be in position 1. Therefore, W must be in position 2 or 3. Since W is not in position 2 (as T is already there), W must be in position 3.

Step 45: The person who's hobby is traveling (T) is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water (W), so T must be in position 1 or 2. Since T is already in position 2 (as confirmed in the previous steps), this step is redundant.

Step 46: The person who's hobby is filmmaking (F) is not to the right of the software-developer (SD), so SD cannot be in position 4. Therefore, SD must be in position 3.

Step 47: The person who's hobby is filmmaking (F) is not to the right of the software-developer (SD), so F cannot be in position 4. Therefore, F must be in position 2 or 3. Since F is already in position 3 (as confirmed in the previous steps), F cannot be in position 4. Therefore, F must be in position 3. This step is a repetition of the previous step, but it confirms the placement of F.

Lv10-6x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and an even position is position 4, the person watching drama movies is in position 4. Let's place Drama in the fourth row and fourth column.

2. The person drinking tea cannot be to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the first column is occupied, the person drinking tea cannot be in the second column. So, the person drinking tea is in the first, third, or fourth column. Since the person watching drama is in the fourth column, the person drinking tea cannot be in the fourth column. So, the person drinking tea is in the first or third column.

3. The person drinking tea is on the left of the person driving the trike. Since the person driving the trike cannot be in the fourth column (as the person watching drama is there), the person driving the trike is in the first, second, or third column. Since the person drinking tea is in the first or third column, the person driving the trike cannot be in the first column. So, the person driving the trike is in the second or third column.

4. The person who's hobby is drawing and the fan of hip-hop have the same parity positions. Since the person drawing is not in the first column (as the person drinking tea is there), the person drawing is in the second or fourth column. Since the person watching drama is in the fourth column, the person drawing is in the second column. Since the person drawing cannot be to the right of the person drinking soy-milk (as the person drinking tea is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk), the person drinking soy-milk is in the first column.

5. The person eating spinach is on the far left. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in the first column, the person eating spinach is in the first row.

6. The person who's hobby is drawing is the person watching drama or the person watching drama is the person drinking tea, but not both. Since the person watching drama is in the fourth row and fourth column, the person watching drama cannot be the person drinking tea (as the person drinking tea is in the first or third column). So, the person watching drama is the person drawing.

7. The person driving the train is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the person driving the trike is in the second column, the person driving the train is in the first column. Since the person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies (which is not in the first row), the person driving the train cannot be in the first row. So, the person driving the train is in the second row.

8. The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is in the third column, the person watching satire movies is in the first or fourth column. Since the person watching drama is in the fourth column, the person watching satire movies is in the first column.

9. The person who's hobby is video-games and the person eating mango have different parity positions. Since the person eating mango is in the first row, the person who's hobby is video-games is in the second, third, or fourth row. Since the person driving the train is in the second row, the person who's hobby is video-games is not in the second row. So, the person who's hobby is video-games is in the third or fourth row.

10. The fan classical is not to the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is in the first or third column, the fan classical is not in the first column. So, the fan classical is in the third column.

11. The person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies. Since the person watching epic movies is in the first row, the person driving the boat is in the second, third, or fourth row. Since the person driving the train is in the second row, the person driving the boat is not in the second row. So, the person driving the boat is in the third or fourth row.

12. The person watching western movies is between the person driving the trike and the person eating potato. Since the person driving the trike is in the second column and the person eating potato is not in the first row, the person watching western movies is in the second row.

13. The person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person drawing is in the second column, the person eating grapefruit is in the first or third column. Since the person eating spinach is in the first row, the person eating grapefruit is not in the first row. So, the person eating grapefruit is in the third column.

14. The person drinking lemonade is not the person driving the car. Since the person driving the car is the person who's hobby is drawing (from point 20), the person drinking lemonade is not the person who's hobby is drawing.

15. The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is in the first or third column, the person drinking lemonade is in the first column.

16. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike. Since the person driving the trike is in the second column, the person drinking tea is in the first column.

17. The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is in the third column, the person watching satire movies is in the first or fourth column. Since the person watching drama is in the fourth column, the person watching satire movies is in the first column.

18. The fan dubstep is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in the first column and the person eating spinach is in the first row, the fan dubstep is in the fourth column.

19. The person driving the car is the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person driving the car is not the person drinking lemonade (from point 14), the person driving the car is the person who's hobby is drawing.

20. The person who's hobby is sudoku and the fan of reggae have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is in the second column, the person who's hobby is sudoku is in the first or third column. Since the fan dubstep is in the fourth column, the person who's hobby is sudoku is in the first column. Since the person eating spinach is in the first row, the fan of reggae is in the second row.
