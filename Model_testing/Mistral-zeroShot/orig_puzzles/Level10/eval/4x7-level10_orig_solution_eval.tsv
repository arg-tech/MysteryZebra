Lv10-4x7-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's assign numbers to the positions in the table:

|               |      1      |    2    |     3      |     4     |      5      |    6    |      7       |
| Food          |             |         |            |           |             |         |              |
| Music-Genre   |             |         |            |           |             |         |              |
| Nationality   |             |         |            |           |             |         |              |
| Sport         |             |         |            |           |             |         |              |

Now, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. Assign the nationalities to the positions:
   - The Colombian plays soccer, so we can place them in position 1 (Soccer).
   - The Japanese is not the Colombian, so they can't be in position 1. They can be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. Since the Japanese is not to the left of the person who's sport is cycling (#8), they can't be in position 2 or 4. So, they can be in position 6 or 7. The Japanese is not to the right of the person who's sport is soccer (#12), so they can't be in position 7. So, the Japanese is in position 6.
   - The Italian is not to the left of the Japanese (#29), so they can't be in position 1 or 2. They can be in position 3, 4, 5, or 7. Since the Italian is not to the left of the person who's sport is cycling (#29), they can't be in position 3. So, they can be in position 4, 5, or 7. The Italian is not to the right of the person who's sport is handball (#37), so they can't be in position 7. So, the Italian is in position 4.
   - The Egyptian is on the right of the fan gospel (#13), so they can't be in position 1 or 2. They can be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the Egyptian is not to the left of the person who's sport is cycling (#29), they can't be in position 3. So, they can be in position 4, 5, or 6. The Egyptian is not to the left of the person who's sport is climbing (#39), so they can't be in position 4. So, the Egyptian is in position 5 or 6. Since the Egyptian is not to the left of the person who's sport is handball (#37), they can't be in position 6. So, the Egyptian is in position 5.
   - The Thai is not to the left of the Italian (#41), so they can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. They can be in position 5, 6, or 7. The Thai is not to the left of the person who's sport is handball (#37), so they can't be in position 5. So, the Thai is in position 6 or 7. The Thai is not to the left of the person who's sport is soccer (#20), so they can't be in position 6. So, the Thai is in position 7.
   - The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the fan metal (#25), so they can't be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. They can be in position 6 or 7. The Mexican is not to the left of the person who's sport is handball (#37), so they can't be in position 6. So, the Mexican is in position 7.
   - The Chinese is the fan gospel or the Chinese is the person eating watermelon, but not both (#10). Since the Chinese is not the fan gospel (#13), the Chinese is the person eating watermelon. So, the Chinese is in position 1 or 7. Since the Chinese is not to the right of the person who's sport is soccer (#28), they can't be in position 7. So, the Chinese is in position 1.

2. Assign the sports to the positions:
   - The Colombian plays soccer, so we already know that.
   - The person who's sport is cycling is the Chinese or the fan ambient is the person who's sport is cycling, but not both (#22). Since the Chinese is not the person who's sport is cycling (#1), the fan ambient is the person who's sport is cycling. So, the person who's sport is cycling is in position 2.
   - The person who's sport is climbing is on the far left (#14), so they are in position 1.
   - The person who's sport is handball is not to the left of the person eating papaya (#37), so they can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. They can be in position 5, 6, or 7. The person who's sport is handball is not to the left of the Thai (#37), so they can't be in position 5. So, the person who's sport is handball is in position 6 or 7. The person who's sport is handball is not to the left of the person who's sport is soccer (#37), so they can't be in position 6. So, the person who's sport is handball is in position 7.
   - The person who's sport is badminton and the fan ambient have different parity positions (#7), so they can't be in the same position. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in position 2, the person who's sport is badminton can't be in position 2. So, the person who's sport is badminton is in position 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

   - The fisherman is on the far left (position 1).
   - The fan rock is on the left or right of the coach (positions 1, 3, 5, or 7). Let's place the fan rock for now (we'll check the coach later).
   - The journalist is the person drinking 7up (position 1).

Lv10-4x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. From rule 12, we know that the hobby of hiking is in an odd position. Let's assume position 1, 3, or 5 are odd positions.

2. From rule 21, the filmmaking hobby is to the left of the malaysian. If hiking is in position 1, then filmmaking can't be in position 2 (since the malaysian can't be in position 1). So, hiking can't be in position 1. If hiking is in position 3, then filmmaking can't be in position 1 or 2. If hiking is in position 5, then filmmaking can't be in position 1, 2, or 4. So, let's assume hiking is in position 3.

Lv10-4x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the parity (even or odd) of each person's position.
- Since the rat is in the middle (position 4), the parity of positions 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 is even, and the parity of positions 2, 4, and 6 is odd.

Step 2: Place the people with known positions.
- From rule 33, we know the rat is in position 4.
- From rule 24, we know the pony is not to the left of the person driving the airplane, so the person driving the airplane is in position 1 or 3. Since the pilot is to the left of the person driving the airplane (rule 30), the person driving the airplane is in position 1, and the pilot is in position 3.
- From rule 13, we know the person driving the bike is to the left of the librarian, so the librarian is in position 2.
- From rule 8, we know the entrepreneur is to the right of the owner of the horse, and since the owner of the horse is in position 1 or 3 (as the person driving the airplane is in position 1), the entrepreneur is in position 5 or 7.
- From rule 12, we know the engineer is to the right of the owner of the horse, so the owner of the horse is in position 2 or 4. If the owner of the horse is in position 2, the engineer is in position 3, and the entrepreneur is in position 5 or 7. If the owner of the horse is in position 4, the engineer is in position 1, and the entrepreneur is in position 6 or 8.
- From rule 11, we know the owner of the ferret is not to the left of the person who's sport is basketball, and since the person who's sport is basketball is in an odd position (rule 20), the owner of the ferret is in an even position, which means it's not in position 1, 3, or 7. So, the owner of the ferret is in position 2, 4, or 6.
- From rule 18, we know the person who's sport is golf is in an odd position. Since the owner of the ferret is in an even position, the person who's sport is golf is not the owner of the ferret. So, the person who's sport is golf is in position 5 or 7, and the owner of the ferret is in position 2, 4, or 6.
- From rule 10, we know the person who's sport is golf is the entrepreneur. So, the entrepreneur is in position 5 or 7, the owner of the ferret is in position 2, 4, or 6, and the owner of the horse is in position 1 or 3.
- From rule 16, we know the owner of the ferret is not to the left of the engineer. Since the engineer is in position 1 (if the owner of the horse is in position 2) or position 5 (if the owner of the horse is in position 4), the owner of the ferret is not in position 2 or 4. So, the owner of the ferret is in position 6, and the owner of the horse is in position 1.
- From rule 15, we know the engineer is not to the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the person who's sport is rugby is in an even position (rule 36), the engineer is not in position 6 or 8. So, the engineer is in position 2 or 4, and the entrepreneur is in position 5 or 7.

1. The person who's sport is soccer is in an odd position##4
   - Since there are 7 positions, the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7.

2. the fan disco is on the left or right of the fan funk##3
   - Let's assume the fan disco is on the left of the fan funk. This means the fan disco must be in position 1, 3, or 5, and the fan funk must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7.

3. the person who's sport is snowboarding is not to the left of the person driving the scooter##8
   - Since the person who's sport is soccer is in an odd position, and the fan disco is on the left of the fan funk, the person who's sport is snowboarding cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, it must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7.

   - Let's assume the person driving the roller is in position 1. Then, the person who's sport is rowing cannot be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. However, since the person who's sport is soccer is in an odd position, the person who's sport is rowing must be in position 3, 5, or 7. But this would mean the person driving the roller is in an even position, which contradicts the given clue. So, the person driving the roller cannot be in position 1.
   - Now, let's assume the person driving the roller is in position 2. Then, the person who's sport is rowing cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. But this would mean the person who's sport is rowing must be in position 4, 6, or 2 itself (since the person driving the roller is rowing). However, this would mean the person driving the roller is not in an even position, which contradicts the given clue. So, the person driving the roller cannot be in position 2 either.
   - Therefore, the person driving the roller must be in position 3, 5, or 7.

5. the person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the fan hip-hop##8

Lv10-4x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign a number to each category (Food, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality) and each person (1 to 7 from left to right).

2. We can start by placing the people based on the given information. For example, we know the British is on the far right (Nationality 7), so we can place them there.

3. We can also place the Australian (Fan Funk) next to the British (Fan Funk is the Australian, so they must be adjacent) or on the left of the Thai (Australian is on the left or right of the Thai). Let's place the Australian first, so we have:

   |               |    1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |     5      |    6    |    7    |
   | Food          |           |           |           |           |            |         |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |           |           |           |            |         |         |
   | Music-Genre   | Funk     |           |           |           |            |         |         |
   | Nationality   | Australian|           |           |           |            |         |         |

4. Now, we know the Thai is not to the right of the Spanish (Thai and Spanish have different parity positions), so the Spanish must be to the right of the Thai. Let's place the Spanish next to the Thai:

   |               |    1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |     5      |    6    |    7    |
   | Food          |           |           |           |           |            |         |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |           |           |           |            |         |         |
   | Music-Genre   | Funk     |           |           |           |            |         |         |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Thai      |           |           |            |         |         |

5. The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies (Malaysian is the person watching spy movies or the Malaysian is the person eating apricot, but not both). Since the British and Australian are already taken, the Malaysian must be on the left of the person eating apricot. Let's place the Malaysian there:

   |               |    1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |     5      |    6    |    7    |

Lv10-4x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's identify the unique elements for each category:

1. Movie-Genres: animation, disaster, epic, family, martial-arts, satire, time-travel
2. Music-Genres: country, dubstep, folk, jazz, r&b, reggae, trance
3. Nationalities: brazilian, colombian, dutch, egyptian, french, nigerian, pakistani
4. Sports: baseball, biathlon, golf, handball, swimming, tennis, weightlifting

Now, let's start solving the puzzle:

1. The Colombian is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies. This means the Colombian cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the far left or far right. Since there are only 7 positions, it must be in position 1 or 7. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.
3. The person watching satire movies is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the weightlifter is in position 1, the tennis player must be in position 2 or 3. Let's assume it's in position 2 for now.
4. The fan dubstep is somewhere to the left of the fan r&b. This means the dubstep fan cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7.
5. The fan trance is not to the right of the fan r&b. This means the trance fan cannot be in positions 6 or 7.
6. The fan country is between the person watching family movies and the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the weightlifter is in position 1 and the tennis player is in position 2, the family movies fan must be in position 3, and the martial-arts fan must be in position 4 or 5. Let's assume it's in position 4 for now.
7. The fan reggae is not to the right of the person watching family movies. This means the reggae fan cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7.
8. The fan trance is the person watching family movies or the fan trance is the person who's sport is biathlon, but not both. Since the family movies fan is in position 3, the trance fan cannot be in position 3. So, the biathlon player must be in position 3.
9. The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the satire movies fan is in position 2 and the biathlon player is in position 3, the epic movies fan must be in position 4 or 5. Let's assume it's in position 4 for now.
10. The fan trance and the person watching epic movies have different parity positions. Since the trance fan is in position 3 (biathlon player) and the epic movies fan is in position 4, they have different parity positions (even and odd).
11. The pakistani and the fan folk have the same parity positions. Since the biathlon player is in position 3 (odd), the pakistani and the fan folk must be in even-numbered positions.
12. The pakistani is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the biathlon player is in position 3, the swimming player must be in position 5 or 6. Let's assume it's in position 5 for now.
13. The pakistani and the person who's sport is baseball have different parity positions. Since the biathlon player is in position 3 (odd) and the swimming player is in position 5 (even), the baseball player must be in an odd-numbered position.
14. The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the swimming player is in position 5, the golf player must be in position 6 or 7.
15. The person watching family movies is somewhere between the egyptian and the person watching animation movies. Since the biathlon player is in position 3, the Egyptian cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. If the Egyptian is in position 4, the family movies fan would be in position 3, which is already occupied by the biathlon player. So, the Egyptian must be in position 5 or 6. Let's assume it's in position 5 for now. This means the animation movies fan must be in position 7.
16. The fan r&b is the person who's sport is baseball. Since the swimming player is in position 5, the baseball player must be in position 6.
17. The fan country is not to the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the swimming player is in position 5, the golf player is in position 6, and the baseball player is in position 6 (r&b fan), the country fan cannot be in positions 6 or 7.
18. The brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the animation movies fan is in position 7, the time-travel movies fan must be in position 6. This means the brazilian cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
19. The person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the fan folk. Since the biathlon player is in position 3, the fan folk cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. If the fan folk is in position 4, the time-travel movies fan would be in position 3, which is already occupied by the biathlon player. So, the fan folk must be in position 5 or 6. Let's assume it's in position 5 for now. This means the brazilian must be in position 7.
20. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the fan folk. Since the fan folk is in position 5, the biathlon player must be in position 6.
21. The person watching satire movies is not the dutch. Since the biathlon player is in position 6, the dutch cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.
22. The person who's sport is tennis and the fan folk have the same parity positions. Since the biathlon player is in position 6 (odd), the tennis player must be in an even-numbered position.
23. The fan trance is somewhere between the egyptian and the fan folk. Since the biathlon player is in position 6, the Egyptian cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7. If the Egyptian is in position 6, the fan trance would be in position 5, which is already occupied by the fan folk. So, the Egyptian must be in position 7. This means the fan trance is in position 6.
24. The dutch is not to the right of the colombian. Since the biathlon player is in position 6, the colombian cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7. If the colombian is in position 6, the dutch would be in position 7, which is not allowed because the dutch cannot be to the right of the colombian. So, the colombian must be in position 1.
25. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the french. Since the biathlon player is in position 6, the french cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7. If the french is in position 6, the weightlifter would be in position 5, but the weightlifter is in position 1. So, the french must be in position 7.
26. The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the biathlon player is in position 6, the swimming player is in position 5, and the weightlifter is in position 1, the golfer must be in position 6.
27. The person watching epic movies is not the egyptian. Since the biathlon player is in position 6, the Egyptian is in position 7, and the weightlifter is in position 1, the epic movies fan cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7. If the epic movies fan is in position 6, the fan trance would be in position 5, but the fan trance is already in position 6. So, the epic movies fan must be in position 2.
28. The person watching satire movies is not the person who's sport is golf. Since the biathlon player is in position 6, the golfer is in position 6, and the epic movies fan is in position 2, the satire movies fan cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. If the satire movies fan is in position 7, the fan reggae would be in position 6, but the fan reggae is not to the right of the person watching family movies (position 3). So, the satire movies fan must be in position 4.
29. The person watching animation movies is on the far right. Since the biathlon player is in position 6, the weightlifter is in position 1, the golfer is in position 6, the epic movies fan is in position 2, the satire movies fan is in position 4, and the Egyptian is in position 7, the animation movies fan must be in position 5.

Here is the final solution table:

   The music-genre, nationality, and sports information are still missing.

To find the missing information, you can use the given clues and the positions we've determined for the movie genres. For example, since the colombian is in position 1, the fan of the genre to the left of the colombian cannot be country, dubstep, reggae, or trance because those fans are to the left of the fan r&b (position 6). So, the fan of the genre in position 1 must be either folk or jazz. Similarly, you can find the missing information for the other positions."	{'movie-genre': ['colombian', 'tennis', 'biathlon', 'satire', 'country', 'golf', 'animation'], 'music-genre': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'nationality': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'sport': ['weightlifting', '', '', '', '', '', '']}	True	2	False
