Lv10-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 jobs, 3 movie-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 means of transport. So, each row represents one person, and each column represents one attribute of that person.

2. From rule 1, we know the nationalities: Australian, Egyptian, and German. Let's assign them to the Nationality column as A, E, and G respectively.

3. From rule 2, the person driving the taxi is the German (G), so we can assign Taxi to the Transport column for the G row.

4. From rule 3, the Australian (A) is not to the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since we already know the German (G) is watching adventure movies and driving a taxi, the A row cannot be above the G row.

5. From rule 4, the Egyptian (E) is not to the left of the bartender. Since we don't know the job of the E row yet, we can't place it yet. But we know it's not above the A row.

6. From rule 5, the person watching family movies is the Egyptian or the bartender, but not both. Since we already know the G row is watching adventure movies, the E row cannot be watching family movies. So, the E row must be watching either adventure or martial-arts movies. Let's assume it's watching adventure movies for now. This means the A row cannot be watching family movies either, so it must be watching either adventure or martial-arts movies.

7. From rule 6, the designer is not to the left of the Egyptian. Since we know the E row is watching adventure movies, the designer cannot be in the first two rows. So, the designer must be the third person.

8. From rule 7, the person watching martial-arts movies and the person driving the taxi have different parity positions. Since we know the G row is driving the taxi, the martial-arts person cannot be in the G row. So, the martial-arts person must be the A or E row. Since the A row cannot be watching family movies, it must be watching martial-arts movies.

9. From rule 9, the designer is between the person driving the taxi and the Australian. Since we know the G row is driving the taxi and the A row is the designer, the A row must be in the middle.

10. From rule 10, the designer is not to the right of the Egyptian. Since we know the E row is watching adventure movies and the A row is the designer, the E row must be on the left of the A row.

Now we have the following arrangement:

|               |     1     |      2       |      3       |
| Job           | Designer | Bartender   | Photographer |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts | Adventure  | Family      |
| Nationality   | Australian | Egyptian   | German      |
| Transport     | Car      | Van        | Taxi       |

However, this arrangement violates rule 8 (the bartender is on the left or right of the person driving the car). To satisfy this rule, we need to swap the Bartender and Photographer rows.

So, the final solution is:

Lv10-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 movie-genres (family, romance, sports), 3 music-genres (house, jazz, salsa), 3 nationalities (argentine, italian, japanese), and 3 pets (dog, ferret, fish).

2. From rule 2, the owner of the ferret is on the far left. Let's place the ferret owner in the first column and the nationality of the ferret owner in the third row (since there are 3 nationalities and we need to place the ferret owner on the far left). Let's assume the ferret owner is Argentine (argentine, ferret, 1).

3. From rule 8, the Italian is on the left or right of the Argentine. Since the ferret owner is on the far left, the Italian cannot be on the far right. So, the Italian must be in the second column (2).

4. From rule 9, the Argentine is watching romance movies. So, we place romance in the first row and the Argentine nationality in the first column (romance, argentine, 1).

5. From rule 7, the fan of house music is on the far left. Since the ferret owner is already on the far left, the fan of house music must be in the second row (house, 2, _).

6. From rule 3, the fan of salsa is not to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is in the second column, the fan of salsa cannot be in the third column. So, the fan of salsa is in the first column (salsa, _, _).

7. From rule 1, the owner of the dog is not to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is in the second column, the owner of the dog must be in the first column (dog, _, _).

8. From rule 4, the owner of the dog is on the left of the fan of salsa. Since the owner of the dog is in the first column, the fan of salsa must be in the third column (salsa, _, 3).

9. From rule 5, the argentine is the person watching romance movies or the person watching romance movies is the owner of the ferret, but not both. Since we have already placed the Argentine as the owner of romance, the person watching romance movies cannot be the ferret owner. So, the person watching romance movies is in the third column (romance, argentine, 3).

10. From rule 10, the person watching family movies is not to the left of the owner of the dog. Since the owner of the dog is in the first column, the person watching family movies must be in the second or third column. However, since the person watching romance movies is in the third column, the person watching family movies must be in the second column (family, _, 2).

11. From rule 6, the owner of the ferret is not to the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in the third column, the owner of the ferret must be in the first or second column. But since the owner of the dog is already in the first column, the owner of the ferret must be in the second column (ferret, _, 2).

12. From rule 8, the Italian is on the left or right of the Argentine. Since the Argentine is in the first column and the Italian is in the second column, the Italian is on the right of the Argentine.

13. From rule 1, the owner of the sports movie is not the Argentine, Italian, or the owner of the dog. Since the Argentine and the Italian are already placed, and the owner of the dog is the person in the first column, the owner of sports must be in the third column (sports, _, 3).

Lv10-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating banana is not both a fan of metal and a fan of horror movies, we can place the banana in any position except the first two (as the first two are reserved for the metal and horror fans according to the next clues). Let's place the banana in the third position.

2. The fan of soul is to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the banana is not in the first two positions, the fan of soul must be in the first position. So, the first row is:

   | Food          | Banana      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Soul        |
   | Music-Genre   |            |
   | Nationality   |            |

3. The fan of electronic is to the left of the fan of soul. Since the fan of soul is in the first position, the fan of electronic must be in the zeroth position (outside the table, to the left of the first row). So, the first row becomes:

   | Food          | Banana      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Soul        |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic  |
   | Nationality   |            |

4. The person watching horror movies is in an even position. Since the banana and the fan of soul are already placed, the horror fan must be in the second position. So, the second row is:

   |               | Banana     | Horror    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Soul       |          |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic |         |
   | Nationality   |           |         |

5. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian cannot be to the left of the person eating cranberry (clue 6), the adventure fan must be in the first position. So, the first row becomes:

   | Food          | Banana     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure  |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic |
   | Nationality   |           |

6. The person eating cranberry is the Australian (clue 7). So, the third row is:

   |               |            |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |
   | Music-Genre   |            |
   | Nationality   | Australian |

7. The person eating peach is the fan of metal (clue 9). Since the fan of metal cannot be to the right of the person eating peach (clue 5), the peach must be in the second position. So, the second row is:

   |               | Peach      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure  |
   | Music-Genre   | Metal      |
   | Nationality   |           |

8. The fan of soul is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the fan of soul is in the first position and the musical fan is in the third position, the musical fan must be in the second or fourth position. However, the musical fan cannot be in the fourth position because the fan of electronic is already there (clue 3). So, the musical fan must be in the second position. So, the second row becomes:

   |               | Peach      | Musical   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure  |          |
   | Music-Genre   | Metal      |          |
   | Nationality   |           |         |

9. The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person eating peach (clue 3). Since the peach is in the second position, the musical fan cannot be in the fourth position. So, the musical fan must be in the third position. So, the third row becomes:

   |               |            |
   | Movie-Genre   |            | Musical   |
   | Music-Genre   |            |          |
   | Nationality   | Australian |         |

10. The brazilian is not to the left of the person eating cranberry (clue 6). Since the cranberry is in the third position, the Brazilian cannot be in the first or second position. So, the Brazilian must be in the fourth position. So, the fourth row becomes:

   |               |            |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |
   | Music-Genre   |            |

Lv10-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 hobbies, 3 music-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 pets, we can assign each of them a number from 1 to 3. Let's start by assigning hobbies:

   Hobby: [card-games, drawing, rock-climbing]

2. Now let's assign music-genres. Since the fan of pop and the person who has card-games as a hobby have the same parity positions, we can assign them the same number. Let's assign pop to position 1 (odd) and card-games to position 3 (odd). The remaining genre is metal, so it goes to position 2 (even).

   Music-Genre: [pop, metal, hip-hop]

3. Since the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, and there are only 3 positions, the pony cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the pony is in position 2. Let's assign the nationality of the person in position 2 as Malaysian (M). The remaining nationalities are Italian (I) and Nigerian (N). Since the Italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the Malaysian, the Italian cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the Italian is in position 3 and the Nigerian is in position 1.

   Nationality: [I, M, N]

4. Since the owner of the goat is the fan of metal or the fan of metal is the Malaysian, but not both, the fan of metal cannot be Malaysian. So, the fan of metal is either Italian or Nigerian. Let's assign metal to the Italian (position 3). The remaining music-genre, hip-hop, goes to position 1 (the only remaining position for the fan of hip-hop).

   Music-Genre: [pop, hip-hop, metal]

5. Since the owner of the goat is not the person who's hobby is drawing, the goat cannot be in position 3 (where the Italian is). So, the goat is either in position 1 or 2. But the goat cannot be in position 1 because the Italian is there (and the Italian is not the owner of the goat). So, the goat is in position 2.

   Pet: [F, G, P]

6. Since the owner of the ferret is the fan of pop, the ferret is in the same position as the fan of pop (position 3).

   Pet: [F, G, P]

7. Now we know the positions of the pets, so we can find the hobbies. Since the pony is in position 2, the hobby in position 2 is rock-climbing. The remaining hobbies are card-games and drawing. Since the Italian is in position 3 and the fan of metal is in position 3, the hobby in position 3 cannot be drawing (because the Italian is not the owner of the goat, which is the hobby drawing). So, the hobby in position 3 is card-games. The remaining hobby, drawing, goes to position 1.

   Hobby: [drawing, card-games, rock-climbing]

8. We already know that the owner of the ferret is the fan of pop (position 3), so the ferret is in position 3.

   Pet: [F, G, P]

9. Since the owner of the goat is in position 2, the goat is in position 2.

   Pet: [F, G, P]

10. Since the Italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the Malaysian, the Italian cannot be in position 1 or 3. The Malaysian is in position 2, so the Italian is in position 3. The remaining nationality, Nigerian, goes to position 1.

   Nationality: [I, M, N]

11. Since the fan of hip-hop is in position 1, the music-genre in position 1 is hip-hop. The remaining music-genres, pop and metal, go to positions 2 and 3 respectively.

   Music-Genre: [hip-hop, pop, metal]

12. Since the owner of the pony is in position 2, the hobby in position 2 is rock-climbing. The remaining hobbies, card-games and drawing, go to positions 1 and 3 respectively.

   Hobby: [drawing, card-games, rock-climbing]

Lv10-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, and means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 3 for each category.

2. Since the person watching action movies is on the far right, let's assign action to the rightmost cell in the Movie-Genre row.

3. From point 2, we know that the person watching action movies cannot be the person driving the ship (since the ship is on the left side). So, let's assign the ship to any of the first two cells in the Transport row (not the rightmost one). Let's assign it to the first cell for now.

4. The person driving the ship is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski. So, the jet-ski cannot be in the first two cells of the Transport row. Let's assign it to the third cell.

5. The person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the ship is in the first cell, the zombie movies cannot be in the second or third cells. Let's assign it to the first cell for now.

6. The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since cooking is one of the hobbies, the scooter cannot be in the rightmost cell. Let's assign it to the first cell.

7. The person who's hobby is chess and the person driving the jet-ski have different parity positions. Since the jet-ski is in the third cell, chess cannot be in the first or third cell. Let's assign it to the second cell.

8. The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the photographer. Since the ship is in the first cell and the jet-ski is in the third cell, the photographer cannot be in the second cell (because of the parity rule with chess). So, the photographer must be in the first or third cell. But the ship is in the first cell, so the photographer must be in the third cell.

9. The person driving the ship is not the photographer (point 6). So, the job of the person in the first cell cannot be photographer. Let's assign it to musician.

10. The only job left is photographer, so it must be in the third cell.

11. The only hobby left is gardening. Let's assign it to the second cell.

12. The only movie-genre left is sports. Let's assign it to the second cell (since it cannot be to the right of the person driving the ship, and the ship is in the first cell).

2. We know that the ambient fan is in the middle, so they are in position 3.

3. The documentary movie watcher cannot be to the right of the Egyptian, so the Egyptian must be in position 1 or 2. Since the fantasy movie watcher is in position 1, the Egyptian cannot be there. So, the Egyptian is in position 2.

4. The classical fan is the British, so the British is in position 3.

5. The Malaysian and the fanta drinker have different parity positions. Since we already have an odd position (British), the fanta drinker must be in an even position (either 1 or 2). However, we know the fantasy movie watcher is in position 1, so the fanta drinker must be in position 2.

6. The fan of classical music is to the left of the fanta drinker, so the classical fan must be in position 1.

Lv10-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the police-officer is in the middle, we can fill the middle row with 'Police-Officer'.

2. From rule 7, the electrician is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up. Since the police-officer is in the middle, the electrician can only be in the first or second column. But the electrician can't be in the first column because the person drinking 7up can't be the musician (rule 3), and the only job left for the first column is the musician, which contradicts rule 7. So, the electrician is in the second column.

3. Now, the person drinking 7up is the electrician. Since the electrician is in the second column, the musician can't be in the second column (rule 3). So, the musician is in the first column.

| Nationality   |             |                | German   |

5. From rule 6, the german is the person eating mango or the person drinking water is the german, but not both. Since the german is already eating water, the mango must be eaten by someone else. So, mango is in the first column.

|               |      1      |       2        |    3     |
| Beverage      | 7up         | Sprite        | Water    |

| Nationality   | German      |                |          |

6. From rule 8, the person eating mango is somewhere between the thai and the indian. Since the german is eating mango and is in the first column, the thai and indian must be in the second and third columns respectively.

|               |      1      |       2        |    3     |
| Beverage      | 7up         | Sprite        | Water    |
| Food          | Mango       | Asparagus     | Avocado  |
| Job           | Police-Officer| Electrician   | Musician |
| Nationality   | German      | Thai          | Indian   |

7. From rule 9, the german is somewhere to the right of the indian. Since the german is in the first column and the indian is in the third column, this rule is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is drawing is to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Let's place them in the following order:
   - Hobby: Drawing
   - Sport: Basketball

2. From rule 5, the person eating peas is on the left or right of the person eating radish. Since we already placed the person eating radish, let's place the person eating peas:
   - Food: Radish, Peas (either left or right of radish)

3. From rule 3, the person eating radish is between the person drinking cola and the person drinking juice. Since we don't know the order yet, let's place the beverages:
   - Beverage: Cola, Juice, Lemonade (radish is between cola and juice)

4. From rule 6, the person eating peas and the person doing rowing have the same parity positions. Since we already placed the person eating peas, let's place the person doing rowing:
   - Sport: Rowing

5. From rule 2, the person doing basketball is to the left of the person doing rowing. Since we already placed the person doing rowing, let's place the person doing basketball:
   - Sport: Basketball, Rowing

6. From rule 1, the person doing basketball is to the right of the person doing video-games. Since we already placed the person doing basketball, let's place the person doing video-games:
   - Hobby: Video-games

7. From rule 8, the person doing camping is to the right of the person eating nectarine. Since we haven't placed the person doing camping yet, let's place the person eating nectarine:
   - Food: Nectarine

8. From rule 7, the person drinking cola is the person eating radish or the person doing video-games, but not both. Since we already placed the person doing video-games, the person drinking cola must be the person eating radish. So, let's swap the positions of cola and radish:
   - Beverage: Radish (cola), Cola, Lemonade

9. Now, we have filled all the positions except for the person doing camping and the person doing tennis. Since we know the positions of all other elements, we can deduce the position of the person doing camping and tennis.
   - Sport: Basketball, Rowing, Tennis, Camping

10. Finally, we have filled all the positions. Here is the final solution table:

    |            |      1      |     2      |    3    |

So, the final solution table is:

| Food       | Nectarine | Radish (peas) | Peas |
| Hobby      | Drawing | Video-games | Camping |

Lv10-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, music-genres, and nationalities. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 3 for each category.

2. From rule 1, the fan of ambient is not to the right of the Spanish. This means the nationality of the fan of ambient cannot be 3 (Spanish). So, the nationalities are 1, 2, and 3.

3. From rule 2, the Argentine is somewhere between the fan of jazz and the Spanish. This means the nationality of the fan of jazz cannot be 3 (Spanish). Also, the Argentine cannot be the Spanish (rule 7), so the nationalities are 1, 2, and we'll temporarily assign the fan of jazz as 3 for now.

4. From rule 4, the fan of house is in the middle. Since we have 3 nationalities, the fan of house must be the second one. So, the nationalities are 1, 2, and 3, and the fan of house is 2.

5. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is woodworking is the security-guard. Since we know the nationalities and the fan of house, the security-guard cannot be the fan of house (rule 9), so the security-guard must be either 1 or 3. Let's assign the security-guard as 3 for now.

6. From rule 6, the argentine is not the dressmaker and the dressmaker is not the fan of ambient. Since we know the nationalities and the fan of house, the dressmaker cannot be the fan of house (rule 9), so the dressmaker must be either 1 or 2. Let's assign the dressmaker as 1 for now.

7. From rule 8, the Spanish is not the fan of writing and the fan of writing is not the fan of jazz. Since we know the nationalities, the fan of writing must be either 1 or 3. But the Spanish cannot be the fan of writing (rule 8), so the fan of writing is 3.

8. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since we know the hobbies of the security-guard (woodworking) and the dressmaker (not baking), the person who bakes must be 1. So, the hobbies are 1, 2, and 3.

9. From rule 9, the electrician is on the left or right of the fan of jazz. Since we know the hobbies and the fan of jazz is 2, the electrician cannot be 1 (baking) or 3 (woodworking). So, the electrician must be 2.

10. Now we have all the assignments:

   |               |     1      |      2      |       3        |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Electrician | Woodworking    |
   | Job           | Dressmaker |            | Security-guard  |
   | Music-Genre   |          | House      | Ambient        |
   | Nationality   | Argentine | German     | Spanish        |

   However, we still need to find the music-genre for the Argentine and the Dressmaker.

11. From rule 8, the Spanish is not the fan of writing, so the fan of writing must be the Dressmaker. Since the Dressmaker is 1, the fan of writing is 1 (Baking). This means the music-genre of the Dressmaker is Jazz (since the fan of writing is the fan of jazz).

12. From rule 6, the argentine is not the dressmaker, so the argentine is the fan of ambient.

So, the final solution table is:
