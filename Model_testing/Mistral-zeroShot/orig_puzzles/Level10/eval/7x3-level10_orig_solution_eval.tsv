Lv10-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the Turkish (helicopter driver) and the Egyptian (videographer) in their respective places since we have two unique conditions for them. Let's place the Turkish in the first row and the Egyptian in the second row.

   | Transport     | Helicopter  |             |          |

2. Since the Turkish is driving the helicopter, we know that the bird owner cannot be the Turkish (from condition 4). So, the bird owner must be in the remaining two positions. Let's place the bird owner in the third row for now.

3. From condition 1, the biathlete is to the left or right of the fan of indie music in row 3. Since the bird owner is already in row 3, the biathlete must be in row 1 or 2. Let's place the biathlete in row 1 for now.

4. From condition 5, the corn eater is to the right of the parkour person. Since the biathlete is in row 1, the parkour person must be in row 2 or 3. Let's place the parkour person in row 2 for now.

5. From condition 6, the owner of the guinea-pig and the Egyptian have the same parity positions. Since the Egyptian is in the second row, the guinea-pig owner must also be in the second row.

6. From condition 8, the airplane driver is between the Canadian and the fan of classical music. Since the Canadian is in the first row and the fan of classical music is in the second row, the airplane driver must be in the second row.

7. From condition 7, the tomato eater is the airplane driver. So, the tomato must be in the second row.

   | Transport     | Subway     |             |          |

8. From condition 12, the parkour person is not to the right of the surfing person. Since the biathlete is in the first row and the surfing person must be in the remaining rows, the surfing person must be in the third row.

   | Transport     | Subway     |             |          |

9. From condition 13, the Canadian is to the right of the helicopter driver (Turkish). Since the Turkish is in the first row and the Canadian cannot be in the first row (as the Canadian is to the right of the helicopter driver), the Canadian must be in the second or third row. However, the Canadian cannot be in the second row because the airplane driver is already there (from condition 8). So, the Canadian must be in the third row.

   | Transport     | Subway     | Helicopter  |          |

10. From condition 11, the papaya eater is not the airplane driver. So, the papaya must be in the first or third row. However, the papaya cannot be in the first row because the biathlete is already there (from condition 3). So, the papaya must be in the third row.

    | Transport     | Subway     | Helicopter  |          |

11. From condition 14, the hedgehog owner is not to the left of the airplane driver. Since the airplane driver is in the second row, the hedgehog owner must be in the third row or the remaining rows. However, the hedgehog owner cannot be in the third row because the papaya is already there (from condition 10). So, the hedgehog owner must be in the fourth row.

    |               |      1      |      2       |    3     |    4     |

12. From condition 6, the owner of the guinea-pig and the Egyptian have the same parity positions. Since the Egyptian is in the second row, the guinea-pig owner must also be in the second row. However, the guinea-pig owner is already in the second row (from condition 5). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given conditions.

So, the puzzle seems to have an inconsistency and cannot be solved as it stands."	{}	False	0	False
Lv10-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the Canadian and the fan of R&B have the same parity positions (odd or even) in the table. Let's assume the Canadian is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and the fan of R&B is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).

2. From point 3, the Canadian is not the person eating pumpkin, so the Canadian cannot be in position 3 (pumpkin).

3. From point 4, the fan of dubstep is the person driving the helicopter, so the helicopter is in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the Canadian cannot be in position 3 (pumpkin), the helicopter cannot be in position 3 either (dubstep and pumpkin are both in odd positions).

4. From point 5, the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the fan of punk. Since the helicopter (dubstep) is not in position 3, the sprite cannot be in position 1 either (as it would be to the left of the fan of punk). So, sprite is in position 2, 4, or 6.

5. From point 6, the fan of punk is somewhere between the journalist and the person eating pumpkin. Since the helicopter (dubstep) is in position 1, the journalist cannot be in position 1 (as the fan of punk would be to the left of the journalist). So, the journalist is in position 2, 4, or 6.

6. From point 7, the person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the helicopter (dubstep) is in position 1, the scooter cannot be in position 2 (as the hiker would be to the right of the scooter). So, the scooter is in position 3 or 5.

7. From point 8, the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person eating avocado. So, the scooter is in position 3 (as the avocado is in position 1).

8. From point 9, the fan of R&B is the architect. Since the helicopter (dubstep) is in position 1, the architect cannot be in position 1 (as the fan of R&B is in an even position). So, the architect is in position 2, 4, or 6.

9. From point 10, the fan of R&B is the architect, so the architect is in an even position. Since the helicopter (dubstep) is in position 1, the architect cannot be in position 3 (as it would be odd). So, the architect is in position 2 or 4.

10. From point 11, the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the scooter (architect) is in position 3, the iced-tea cannot be in position 1 (as the baker would be to the left of the iced-tea). So, the iced-tea is in position 2, 4, or 6.

11. From point 12, the colombian is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the scooter (architect) is in position 3, the colombian cannot be in position 1 or 2 (as the rock-climber would be to the left of the colombian). So, the colombian is in position 4 or 6.

12. From point 13, the person driving the quad-bike is on the left or right of the person eating avocado. Since the scooter (architect) is in position 3, the quad-bike cannot be in position 1 (as the avocado is in position 1). So, the quad-bike is in position 2 or 4.

13. From point 14, the person driving the scooter is not the architect (already placed).

14. From point 15, the person driving the quad-bike and the person drinking fanta have different parity positions. Since the quad-bike is in an even position (let's say 2), the fanta cannot be in position 2 (as it would have the same parity). So, the fanta is in position 1, 3, or 5.

15. From point 16, the person drinking iced-tea is the Canadian or the Canadian is the person driving the helicopter, but not both. Since the helicopter (dubstep) is in position 1, the Canadian cannot be in position 1 (as the iced-tea is the Canadian or the helicopter). So, the Canadian is the person driving the helicopter (dubstep in position 1), and the iced-tea is not the Canadian.

16. From point 17, the Canadian is not to the right of the person eating avocado. Since the Canadian is the person driving the helicopter (dubstep in position 1), the avocado cannot be in position 2 (as the Canadian would be to the right of the avocado). So, the avocado is in position 1.

17. From point 18, the person driving the quad-bike is not the architect (already placed).

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |

Lv10-7x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the hiker is not to the right of the Japanese. Let's place the Japanese in the first column and the hiker in the second column.

   | Transport     |             |           |           |

2. From rule 2, the doctor is to the right of the bartender. Since the hiker is in the second column, the bartender must be in the first column. So, the doctor is in the third column.

   | Transport     |             |           |           |

3. From rule 3, the puzzles and taxi have different parity positions. Since the hiker and doctor are already placed, the only way to ensure this is to place the puzzles in the first column and the taxi in the second column.

4. From rule 4, the Canadian is not to the right of the Japanese. So, the Canadian must be in the first or second column. Since the hiker, bartender, doctor, and puzzles are already placed, the Canadian must be in the first column.

   |               |      1      |     2     |     3     |

5. From rule 5, the engineer is between the owner of the fish and the Nigerian. Since the Canadian and Japanese are already placed, the fish owner must be in the second column. The only place left for the engineer is the third column.

6. From rule 6, the cook is to the right of the person watching horror movies. Since the hiker, bartender, doctor, puzzles, Canadian, Japanese, engineer, and fish owner are already placed, the only place left for the cook is the third column. The only movie genre left is horror, so it must be in the second column.

   | Transport     |     airplane| taxi     |           |

7. From rule 7, the Japanese is not to the left of the Japanese. Since the Japanese is already in the first column, this rule is satisfied.

8. From rule 8, the goldfish owner is to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since the Canadian, Japanese, engineer, and cook are already placed, the only place left for the goldfish owner is the first column. The only movie genre left is superhero, so it must be in the third column.

9. From rule 9, the person eating blueberry is on the left of the Nigerian. Since the goldfish owner is already in the first column, the blueberry eater must be in the first column.

   |               |      1      |     2     |     3     |

10. From rule 10, the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person driving the airplane. Since the blueberry eater, puzzles, cook, Canadian, Japanese, engineer, goldfish owner, and nigerian are already placed, the only place left for the horror movie watcher is the second column.

11. From rule 11, the person eating kale is the person driving the trike or the person eating kale is the Canadian, but not both. Since the blueberry eater, puzzles, cook, Canadian, Japanese, engineer, goldfish owner, horror movie watcher, and nigerian are already placed, the only place left for the kale eater is the first column. But since the blueberry eater is already there, the Canadian must be eating kale.

    | Transport     |     airplane| taxi     |           |

12. From rule 12, the person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the person watching superhero movies. Since the horror movie watcher is in the second column and the superhero watcher is in the third column, the documentary watcher must be in the first column.

    |               |      1      |     2     |     3     |

    | Transport     |     airplane| taxi     |           |

13. From rule 13, the person driving the trike is to the right of the person eating kale. Since the Canadian is eating kale and is in the first column, the trike driver must be in the third column.

    |               |      1      |     2     |     3     |
    | Food          |     blueberry| horror   | cook     |

    | Transport     |     airplane| taxi     | trike     |

14. From rule 14, the person driving the taxi is on the far right. Since the trike driver is already in the third column, the taxi driver is not placed yet. However, since all other positions are filled, the taxi driver cannot be placed. This is a contradiction, so the puzzle has no solution.

So, the puzzle has no solution."	{}	False	0	False
Lv10-7x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating lime is on the left of the dressmaker, and the dressmaker is the one with the hobby of traveling, we can place the lime eater in position 1 and the dressmaker in position 3.

2. The person eating zucchini is the person who's hobby is traveling, so this person must be in position 3 (the dressmaker). Since the lime eater is on the left of the dressmaker, the zucchini eater must be on the right, so they are in position 2.

3. Now we know that the hobby of person in position 2 is traveling, so the food they eat must be zucchini.

4. The person watching horror movies is not to the right of the person eating lime. Since the lime eater is in position 1, the horror movie watcher cannot be in position 2, 3, or any position to the right of position 3. So, the horror movie watcher can only be in position 1.

5. The British is not to the left of the person driving the taxi. Since we don't know the position of the taxi driver yet, we can't place the British yet.

6. The person driving the trike is somewhere between the person watching time-travel movies and the owner of the chinchilla. Since we don't know the positions of the time-travel movie watcher or the chinchilla owner yet, we can't place the trike driver yet.

7. The person eating strawberry is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla owner is not yet placed, we can't place the strawberry eater yet.

8. The person with the hobby of writing is not the Mexican. This means the Mexican must be in one of the first two positions.

9. The bartender is not the person watching horror movies. This means the bartender cannot be in position 1.

10. The person driving the trike is in an odd position. Since we know the trike driver is not yet placed, this means the trike driver must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

11. The dressmaker and the person eating zucchini have the same parity positions. Since the dressmaker is in position 3, the zucchini eater must be in an even position.

12. The bartender is not the owner of the chinchilla. This means the bartender cannot be in position 2 (since the chinchilla owner is in position 2).

13. The person driving the trike is not to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the trike driver is in position 1, the taxi driver must be in position 3 or 5.

14. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching action movies. Since the horror movie watcher is in position 1, the action movie watcher must be in position 3 or 5.

15. The British is on the right of the project-manager. Since the project-manager's position is odd (because the bartender is not the project-manager and the bartender is not in position 1), the British must be in an even position.

16. The mexican and the owner of the chinchilla have different parity positions. Since we know the Mexican is in an even position, the chinchilla owner must be in an odd position.

17. The owner of the cat is not to the left of the Mexican. Since the Mexican is in an even position, the cat owner must be in an odd position.

18. The bartender is the owner of the chinchilla or the owner of the chinchilla is the person who's hobby is traveling, but not both. Since we know the bartender is not the chinchilla owner, the chinchilla owner must be the person with the hobby of traveling (in position 2).

Now we have enough information to place the remaining people and items:

- The person watching action movies is in position 3 (since they are to the right of the horror movie watcher in position 1).
- The person watching time-travel movies is in position 5 (since the trike driver is in position 1 and the chinchilla owner is in position 2, so the time-travel movie watcher must be in an odd position).
- The person driving the taxi is in position 3 (since they are not the British and the trike driver is in position 1, so the taxi driver must be in an odd position).
- The person eating strawberry is in position 4 (since they are not to the right of the chinchilla owner in position 2 and the strawberry eater must be in an even position).
- The person owning the cat is in position 5 (since they are not to the left of the Mexican and they are in an odd position).
- The person with the hobby of writing is in position 4 (since they are not the Mexican and they are in an even position).
- The project-manager is in position 4 (since the British is in an even position and the project-manager's position is odd).
- The person owning the hedgehog is in position 1 (since the lime eater is also the horror movie watcher or the hedgehog owner, and the horror movie watcher is in position 1).

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people and items in the table. Since there are 6 people and 6 items, we can assign each person to an item. For now, we'll just place them randomly.

2. From rule 11, we know that the person drinking milk is on the far right. So, milk goes in the rightmost column.

|               |         1          |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | 7up              |  iced-tea | milk    |

| Transport     | airplane        | boat     | motorbike |

3. From rule 12, we know that the person drinking 7up and the person eating pumpkin have the same parity positions. Since we don't know the parity yet, we can't place them yet.

4. From rule 13, we know that the person driving the boat is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since we don't know the positions yet, we can't place them yet.

5. From rule 14, we know that the person eating grapes is not the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is the indonesian (rule 2), we can place the person eating grapes in the remaining positions.

|               |         1          |     2     |    3     |

| Transport     | airplane        | boat     | motorbike |

6. From rule 9, we know that the software-developer is somewhere to the left of the chinese. Since the chinese is already placed, we can place the software-developer in the remaining positions.

|               |         1          |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | 7up              |  iced-tea | milk    |

7. From rule 15, we know that the software-developer and the person driving the boat have the same parity positions. Since we know the positions of both, we can confirm that they have the same parity.

8. From rule 10, we know that the person drinking milk and the chinese have different parity positions. Since we know the positions of both, we can confirm that they have different parities.

9. From rule 4, we know that the doctor and the person who's sport is skateboarding have different parity positions. Since we know the position of the person who's sport is skateboarding (indonesian), we can place the doctor in the remaining position.

|               |         1          |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | 7up              |  iced-tea | milk    |

10. From rule 6, we know that the person driving the motorbike is not the person drinking 7up. Since we know the position of the person drinking 7up, we can place the person driving the motorbike in the remaining position.

| Transport     | airplane        | boat     | motorbike |

11. From rule 3, we know that the fan techno is on the left or right of the fan classical. Since the fan classical is in the middle, the fan techno can only be in the leftmost or rightmost position. However, we know that the person drinking milk is in the rightmost position, so the fan techno cannot be in the rightmost position. Therefore, the fan techno must be in the leftmost position.

|               |         1          |     2     |    3     |

| Transport     | airplane        | boat     | motorbike |

12. From rule 5, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since we know the position of the person who's sport is rugby, we can place the person drinking iced-tea in the remaining position.

|               |         1          |     2     |    3     |

| Sport         | rugby           | skateboarding| soccer   |
| Transport     | airplane        | boat     | motorbike |

13. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking 7up is not to the left of the fan techno##8. Since the fan techno is in the leftmost position, the person drinking 7up cannot be in the leftmost position. Therefore, the person drinking 7up is in the rightmost position.

|               |         1          |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | 7up              |  iced-tea | milk    |

| Sport         | rugby           | skateboarding| soccer   |
| Transport     | airplane        | boat     | motorbike |

14. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is the indonesian or the person drinking iced-tea is the person who's sport is skateboarding, but not both. Since we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is the indonesian, the person drinking iced-tea cannot be the person who's sport is skateboarding. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea is not the indonesian.

|               |         1          |     2     |    3     |

| Transport     | airplane        | boat     | motorbike |

15. From rule 16, we know that the person drinking milk is not to the right of the fan jazz##8. Since the fan jazz is in the middle, the person drinking milk cannot be in the rightmost position. Therefore, the person drinking milk is in the leftmost or middle position.

41. From rule 16, we know that the person drinking milk is not to the right of the fan jazz##8. Since the fan jazz is in the middle, the person drinking milk cannot be in the rightmost position. Therefore, the person drinking milk is in the leftmost or middle position. However, we know that the person drinking 7up is in the rightmost position, so the person drinking milk cannot be in the middle position. Therefore, the person drinking milk is in the leftmost position.

42. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is the indonesian or the person drinking iced-tea is the person who's sport is skateboarding, but not both. Since we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is the indonesian, the person drinking iced-tea cannot be the person who's sport is skateboarding. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea is not the indonesian.

45. From rule 3, we know that the fan techno is on the left or right of the fan classical##3. Since the fan classical is in the middle, the fan techno can only be in the leftmost or rightmost position. However, we know that the person drinking 7up is in the rightmost position, so the fan techno cannot be in the rightmost position. Therefore, the fan techno must be in the leftmost position.

Lv10-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the beverages in the first column. Since the person eating cabbage is the person drinking 7up, we can place 7up in the first row of the beverage column and cabbage in the third row of the food column.

2. Now let's place the sports. The person playing basketball is on the far right, so we can place basketball in the third row of the sport column. The person playing tennis is not to the left of the indian, so tennis must be in the second or third row. Since the person playing tennis is also not to the left of the person drinking 7up (who we know is in the first row), tennis must be in the second row. This leaves baseball in the first row.

3. Now let's place the jobs. The project-manager and the nigerian have the same parity positions, which means they must be in the same or opposite positions. Since the project-manager is not the person playing tennis (who is in the second row), the project-manager must be in the first row, leaving the architect in the third row and the musician in the second row.

4. The dutch is the person who's hobby is gardening, so gardening must be in the third row of the hobby column and the dutch must be in the third row of the nationality column.

5. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person drinking 7up, so collecting must be in the first row of the hobby column.

6. The architect is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting, so the architect must be in the first row.

7. The person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the indian, so the indian must be in the second or third row. Since the indian is not the person playing tennis (who is in the second row), the indian must be in the third row.

8. The dutch is the person who's hobby is gardening, so the gardening must be in the third row of the hobby column and the dutch must be in the third row of the nationality column.

9. The owner of the snake is not to the left of the person drinking water, so the person drinking water must be in the second or third row. Since the person drinking water is not the person eating cabbage (who is in the third row), the person drinking water must be in the second row.

10. The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is writing, so the person who's hobby is writing must be in the first row.

11. The person eating artichoke is on the left of the owner of the frog, so artichoke must be in the first row of the food column and the frog must be in the second row of the pet column.

12. The person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the indian, so the indian must be in the second or third row. Since the indian is not the person playing tennis (who is in the second row), the indian must be in the third row.

13. The nigerian and the person who's sport is basketball have the same parity positions, which means they must be in the same or opposite positions. Since the nigerian is not in the first row (because the dutch is there), the nigerian must be in the third row. This leaves basketball in the first row.

14. The person who's hobby is writing is not to the left of the person who's sport is tennis, so the person who's hobby is writing must be in the second or third row. Since the person who's hobby is writing is not the person who's hobby is collecting (who is in the first row), the person who's hobby is writing must be in the second row.

15. The person eating artichoke is on the left of the owner of the frog, so artichoke must be in the first row of the food column and the frog must be in the second row of the pet column.

16. The person drinking juice is on the far left or far right. Since we have already placed 7up, juice, and water in the first, second, and second to last rows, respectively, juice must be in the last row.

Lv10-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 unknowns (Beverage, Food, Job, Music-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Transport) and 15 clues. This means we have more clues than unknowns, which should help us solve the puzzle.

2. Let's start with the positions. Since there are 7 positions, we can assign numbers from 1 to 7 to each position. We'll use the parity (even or odd) of the position to help us solve some clues.

3. Clue 1: The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the fan house (position 5). So, cucumber can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

4. Clue 2: The thai is somewhere to the right of the nurse (position 5). So, thai can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 either.

5. Clue 3: The nurse is the owner of the horse or the owner of the horse is the argentine, but not both. Since the thai is already in position 5 or later, the argentine can't be in position 5 or later. So, argentine can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

6. Clue 4: The firefighter and the person driving the scooter have different parity positions. Since the firefighter can't be in position 5 or later (as the argentine can't be there), the firefighter can be in positions 1, 2, 3. The scooter can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (as the thai and the nurse can't be there), so the scooter can be in positions 4, 6, 7.

7. Clue 6: The fan disco and the person driving the bus have different parity positions. Since the fan disco can't be in position 5 (as the cucumber eater can't be there), the fan disco can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. The bus can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7 (as the thai, the nurse, and the scooter can't be there), so the bus can be in positions 2, 4, 6.

8. Clue 7: The owner of the snake is somewhere between the person driving the motorbike and the person driving the bus. Since the bus can't be in position 7, the snake can't be in position 7 either. So, the snake can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

9. Clue 8: The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike. So, the snake can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

10. Clue 9: The mexican is not to the left of the fan house. So, mexican can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

11. Clue 10: The fan disco is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the fan disco can't be in position 5 (as the cucumber eater can't be there), the fan disco can be in positions 1, 3. The ferret can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 (as the thai, the nurse, the scooter, the bus, and the snake can't be there), so the ferret can be in positions 4, 6.

12. Clue 11: The person drinking juice is between the argentine and the person eating apricot. Since the argentine can be in positions 1, 2, 3, and the person eating apricot can't be in position 7 (as the snake can't be there), the person drinking juice can't be in position 7 either. So, the person drinking juice can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

13. Clue 12: The person driving the scooter is not to the right of the photographer. Since the scooter can't be in positions 4, 6, 7, the photographer can't be in positions 4, 6, 7 either. So, the photographer can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5.

14. Clue 13: The thai is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse. Since the horse can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (as the thai, the nurse, the scooter, and the snake can't be there), the horse can be in positions 4, 6, 7.

15. Clue 14: The person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking 7up is the fan house (position 5), the person drinking juice can't be in position 6. So, the person drinking juice can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7.

16. Clue 15: The owner of the snake is on the left of the thai. Since the snake can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6, the thai can't be in positions 4, 5, 6 either. So, the thai can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 7.

17. Now we have placed the thai (position 3), the nurse (position 5), the argentine (position 1), the firefighter (position 2), the fan disco (position 1), the fan house (position 5), the person drinking 7up (position 5), the person drinking juice (position 7), and the owner of the snake (position 2).

18. We still have the food, the jobs, the music-genres, the nationalities, the pets, and the transports to place. However, we have enough information to place the people and their favorite beverages, so we'll leave the rest for another time.

Lv10-7x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 of each category, so we can fill in the first row with the different beverages, food, hobbies, jobs, music-genres, nationalities, and transport.

2. From rule 1, we know the person driving the quad-bike cannot be in the first column (since the Canadian is in the first column, and the quad-bike is to the left of the Canadian). So, the quad-bike must be in the second or third column.

3. From rule 2, the nurse must be in the first column. So, the nurse cannot be the person driving the quad-bike. Therefore, the quad-bike must be in the third column.

Lv10-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the Nationalities and Jobs since they have unique positions. Let's place the nigerian as the analyst (2nd position) and the dutch as the board-games hobbyist or grapefruit eater (1st or 3rd position). Let's assume the dutch is the board-games hobbyist for now (1st position).

   |               |      1      |      2      |      3      |

   | Transport     |             |             |             |

2. Since the nigerian is the analyst, the chef cannot be in the 2nd position. Let's place the chef in the 3rd position.

   |               |      1      |      2      |      3      |

3. The nigerian is between the person who's hobby is video-games and the designer. So, the video-games hobbyist is in the 1st position and the designer is in the 3rd position.

6. The owner of the bird and the person driving the bike have the same parity positions. Since the hedgehog owner is in the 1st position, the bird owner and the bike driver cannot be in the 1st position. Let's place the bird owner in the 2nd position and the bike driver in the 3rd position.

1. We have 6 variables for each row (Beverage, Hobby, Music-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Sport) and 7 people (since there are 3 repetitions of each variable). Let's assign numbers to the people from left to right.

2. From the nationality rule (1), we know that the Spanish is person 2 and the Pakistani is person 3.

3. From the sport rule (12), we know that the person doing weightlifting is to the left of person 4 (driver of the taxi). Since person 2 is Spanish and can't be weightlifter (as it's a different nationality), person 4 must be the weightlifter.

4. From the sport rule (14), we know that the rock fan is to the right of the person doing lacrosse. Since person 2 is Spanish and can't be doing lacrosse, the lacrosse player must be person 5. So, the rock fan is person 6 or 7.

5. From the pet rule (4), we know that the owner of the hamster and the person who's hobby is singing have the same parity positions. Since the hamster owner is even (from rule 13), the singer is also even. As there are 7 people, the singer can be person 2, 4, or 6. But person 2 is Spanish and can't sing (as it's a different nationality), so the singer must be person 4 or 6. Since the rock fan is to the right of the lacrosse player (rule 4), the singer can't be person 6. So, the singer is person 4.

6. From the pet rule (10), we know that the person who's hobby is video-games is the owner of the frog. Since the singer is person 4, the video-games person must be person 5 or 7. But person 5 is the lacrosse player, so the video-games person is person 7.

7. From the transport rule (8), we know that the person driving the roller is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the singer is person 4 and the video-games person is person 7, the cook must be person 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6. But person 2 is Spanish, person 5 is the lacrosse player, and person 6 is the rock fan, so the cook must be person 1, 3, or 5. But person 3 is the Pakistani, so the cook is person 1 or 5.

8. From the transport rule (7), we know that the person driving the car is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the cook is person 1 or 5, the driver of the car must be person 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7. But person 2 is Spanish, person 3 is the Pakistani, person 4 is the singer, person 6 is the rock fan, and person 7 is the video-games person, so the driver of the car must be person 5 (as the cook is person 1).

9. From the music-genre rule (9), we know that the folk fan is on the left of the salsa fan. Since the Spanish is person 2 and can't be the salsa fan (as it's a different nationality), the salsa fan must be person 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. But person 3 is the Pakistani, person 4 is the singer, person 5 is the cook, person 6 is the rock fan, and person 7 is the video-games person, so the salsa fan must be person 5. So, the folk fan is person 2, 3, or 4. But person 2 is Spanish, so the folk fan is person 3 or 4.

10. From the beverage rule (3), we know that the salsa fan is the person who's sport is weightlifting or the person who's sport is weightlifting is the person drinking juice, but not both. Since we already know that person 4 is the singer and person 5 is the salsa fan (weightlifter), the juice drinker must be person 3 or 7. But person 3 is the Pakistani, so the juice drinker must be person 7.

11. From the beverage rule (5), we know that the iced-tea drinker is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since the singer is person 4, the video-games person is person 7, and the juice drinker is person 7, the pony owner must be person 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6. But person 2 is Spanish, person 3 is the Pakistani, person 5 is the cook, and person 6 is the rock fan, so the pony owner must be person 1 or 5. But person 1 is the cook, so the pony owner is person 5.

12. From the beverage rule (1), we know that the coffee drinker is left. Since the Spanish is person 2, the Pakistani is person 3, the singer is person 4, the video-games person is person 7, the juice drinker is person 7, and the iced-tea drinker is person 5, the coffee drinker must be person 1 or 6. But person 1 is the cook, so the coffee drinker is person 6.

13. From the hobby rule (2), we know that the Spanish is on the left of the Pakistani. Since the Spanish is person 2 and the Pakistani is person 3, the hobby of person 1 must be different from cooking. So, the hobby of person 1 is singing, video-games, or none (as the hobby of person 2 is cooking). But person 2 is Spanish, so the hobby of person 1 can't be singing. So, the hobby of person 1 is video-games.

So, the final solution table is:
