Lv10-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 unknowns (Beverage, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport) and 3 known variables for each (3 beverages, 3 jobs, 3 movie-genres, 3 music-genres, 3 pets, 3 sports). Let's assign numbers to each variable for easier reference.

   |               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
   | Beverage      | A       | B          | C          |
   | Job           | D       | E          | F          |
   | Movie-Genre   | G       | H          | I          |
   | Music-Genre   | J       | K          | L          |
   | Pet           | M       | N          | O          |
   | Sport         | P       | Q          | R          |

2. Let's start with the sport constraints:
   - Golf is not to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig (P is not greater than N+1)
   - The person who's sport is golf is on the left of the fan metal (P is less than K)
   - The coach is the person watching zombie movies or the coach is the owner of the hedgehog, but not both (D is either Q or O, but not both)
   - The fan punk is the person who's sport is tennis (L is Q)
   - The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis (P is greater than Q)
   - The person who's sport is water-polo and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions (R and B have the same parity, i.e., both are even or both are odd)
   - The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk (R is less than A) or the owner of the guinea-pig is the person drinking almond-milk (N is A) but not both
   - The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis (P is greater than Q)

3. Now let's consider the pet constraints:
   - The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo (A is less than R) or the owner of the guinea-pig is the person drinking almond-milk (N is A) but not both

4. Let's consider the movie-genre constraints:
   - The person watching action movies is the person drinking soy-milk (H is B)

5. Let's consider the music-genre constraints:
   - The fan folk is on the left of the doctor (J is less than F)
   - The person drinking almond-milk is the person who's sport is water-polo or the owner of the guinea-pig is the person drinking almond-milk, but not both (A is R or N is A, but not both)

6. Now let's consider the beverage constraints:
   - The person drinking almond-milk is the person who's sport is water-polo or the owner of the guinea-pig is the person drinking almond-milk, but not both (A is R or N is A, but not both)
   - The person who's sport is water-polo and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions (R and B have the same parity, i.e., both are even or both are odd)

7. Since we have more constraints than unknowns, we can't solve this puzzle uniquely. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the given information:

   - Since the person drinking soy-milk watches action movies (H=B), and action movies are different from the other genres (G, I, and J), we can deduce that G, I, and J are unique to their columns.
   - Similarly, since the fan punk is the person who's sport is tennis (L=Q), and tennis is different from the other sports (P, R, and Q), we can deduce that P, R, and Q are unique to their columns.
   - Since the person drinking almond-milk is the person who's sport is water-polo or the owner of the guinea-pig is the person drinking almond-milk, but not both (A is R or N is A, but not both), we can deduce that A, R, and N are unique to their columns.
   - Since the fan folk is on the left of the doctor (J is less than F), we can deduce that J and F are in the first two columns.
   - Since the coach is the person watching zombie movies or the coach is the owner of the hedgehog, but not both (D is either Q or O, but not both), we can deduce that D, Q, and O are unique to their columns.

8. With these deductions, we can start filling in the table:

   |               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
   | Beverage      | A       | B          | C          |
   | Job           | D       | E          | F          |
   | Movie-Genre   | G       | H          | I          |
   | Music-Genre   | J       | K          | L          |
   | Pet           | M       | N          | O          |
   | Sport         | P       | Q          | R          |

   However, we still can't fill in the remaining values uniquely due to the lack of constraints.

The final solution table would look like this:

#############
|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | A       | B          | C          |
| Job           | D       | E          | F          |
| Movie-Genre   | G       | H          | I          |
| Music-Genre   | J       | K          | L          |
| Pet           | M       | N          | O          |
| Sport         | P       | Q          | R          |
#############

This solution table represents one possible arrangement of the given variables that satisfies all the given constraints, but there may be other arrangements as well due to the lack of unique constraints."	{'beverage': ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'job': ['d', 'e', 'f'], 'movie-genre': ['g', 'h', 'i'], 'music-genre': ['j', 'k', 'l'], 'pet': ['m', 'n', 'o'], 'sport': ['p', 'q', 'r']}	True	0	False
Lv10-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 13, the pilot is in an odd position. Let's assume the positions are numbered 1 (leftmost) to 6 (rightmost). So, the pilot is either 1, 3, or 5. If the pilot is 1, then the dog owner cannot be 2 (rule 1), so the dog owner is 3 or 5. But if the dog owner is 5, then the photographer (rule 5) would have to be 4, which contradicts rule 7 (photographer is to the left of the lizard owner). So, the pilot is 3, and the dog owner is 1 or 5.

2. From rule 12, the person drinking fanta is to the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since the pilot is 3, the skateboard driver cannot be 3, so they are 1, 2, 4, or 5. If the skateboard driver is 1, then the person drinking fanta is 2, and the person driving the taxi (rule 8) is 3. But this means the basketball player (rule 8) is 4 or 5, and the only possible position for the lizard owner (rule 3 and 4) is 2, which contradicts rule 1 (dog owner is to the left of the pilot). So, the skateboard driver is not 1. If the skateboard driver is 2, then the person drinking fanta is 3, and the person driving the taxi is 4. But this means the basketball player is 5, and the only possible position for the lizard owner (rule 3 and 4) is 1, which contradicts rule 1 (dog owner is to the left of the pilot). So, the skateboard driver is not 2. If the skateboard driver is 4, then the person drinking fanta is 5, and the person driving the taxi is 3. But this means the basketball player is 1, and the only possible position for the lizard owner (rule 3 and 4) is 2, which contradicts rule 1 (dog owner is to the left of the pilot). So, the skateboard driver is not 4. If the skateboard driver is 5, then the person drinking fanta is 1, and the person driving the taxi is 3. But this means the basketball player is 2, and the only possible position for the lizard owner (rule 3 and 4) is 4, which contradicts rule 1 (dog owner is to the left of the pilot). So, the skateboard driver is not 5. Therefore, the skateboard driver is 6.

3. Now we know the skateboard driver is 6, so the person drinking fanta is 1. The person driving the taxi is 3, so the basketball player is 2. The dog owner is 1 (rule 1), so the lizard owner (rule 3 and 4) is 5.

4. The hobby of the person at position 1 is drawing (rule 9), the job is lawyer (rule 10), the pet is a dog (rule 1), the sport is badminton (rule 2), and the transport is boat (we'll find out later).

5. The person at position 2 is the basketball player, so the job is pilot (rule 8). The hobby is fishing (rule 14), the pet is a lizard (rule 3 and 4), the sport is not badminton (rule 2), and the transport is taxi (rule 8).

6. The person at position 3 is the taxi driver (rule 8), so the sport is basketball (rule 8). The job is not lawyer (rule 10), so it's either lawyer or photographer. Since the photographer and the dog owner have the same parity positions (rule 5), and the dog owner is 1, the photographer cannot be 3. So, the job is lawyer, and the hobby is video-games (rule 3). The pet is a mouse (we'll find out later), and the transport is boat (we'll find out later).

7. The person at position 4 is the photographer (rule 3), so the hobby is video-games. The job is not lawyer (rule 10), so it's either lawyer or pilot. Since the pilot is 2, the job is lawyer. The pet is the lizard (rule 3 and 4), the sport is not badminton (rule 2), and the transport is skateboard (we'll find out later).

8. The person at position 5 is the lizard owner (rule 3 and 4), so the hobby is not drawing (rule 9). The job is not lawyer (rule 10), so it's either lawyer or pilot. Since the pilot is 2 and the lawyer is 4, the job is pilot. The sport is not badminton (rule 2), and the transport is boat (we'll find out later).

9. The person at position 6 is the skateboard driver (rule 12), so the sport is not rowing (rule 11). The hobby is not fishing (rule 14), the job is not lawyer (rule 10), and the pet is the mouse (we'll find out later).

Now we have to find the remaining information:

10. The transport of the person at position 1 is boat (we'll find out how). The transport of the person at position 2 is taxi (rule 8). The transport of the person at position 3 is boat (since the lawyer cannot be the skateboard driver, and the taxi driver is 3). The transport of the person at position 4 is skateboard (rule 4). The transport of the person at position 5 is boat (since the pilot cannot be the skateboard driver, and the taxi driver is 3). The transport of the person at position 6 is skateboard (since the skateboard driver is 6).

11. The pet of the person at position 1 is a dog (rule 1). The pet of the person at position 2 is a lizard (rule 3 and 4). The pet of the person at position 3 is a mouse (since the lawyer cannot be the skateboard driver, and the taxi driver is 3). The pet of the person at position 4 is the photographer (rule 3), so the pet is a lizard. The pet of the person at position 5 is a lizard (rule 3 and 4). The pet of the person at position 6 is a mouse (since the skateboard driver is 6).

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage    | Hobby       | Job         | Pet         | Sport       | Transport   |

Lv10-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people for each category, we can assign numbers 1, 2, 3 to each category. We'll start by assigning the beverages, food, and music-genres.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|
   | cola (1)     | onion (1)     | ambient (1)  |
   | juice (2)    | papaya (2)    | electronic (2)|
   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      |

2. Now let's assign the nationalities. We know the thai is not to the right of the person drinking cola, so the thai cannot be 2 or 3. The Egyptian can be on the far left or far right, so we'll try both possibilities:

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
   | cola (1)     | onion (1)     | ambient (1)  | Egyptian (1)  |
   | juice (2)    | papaya (2)    | electronic (2)| Thai (3)     |
   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | French (2)    |

   and

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
   | cola (1)     | onion (1)     | ambient (1)  | Egyptian (3)  |
   | juice (2)    | papaya (2)    | electronic (2)| Thai (1)     |
   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | French (2)    |

3. The person drinking water and the french have different parity positions, so the person drinking water cannot be the French. So, the French must be the person drinking cola (1).

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
   | cola (1)     | onion (1)     | ambient (1)  | French (1)    |
   | juice (2)    | papaya (2)    | electronic (2)| Thai (3)     |
   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | Egyptian (2)  |

4. The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the fan ambient. Since the French is the fan ambient, the dog cannot be the Egyptian.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
   | cola (1)     | onion (1)     | ambient (1)  | French (1)    | Dog (2)       |
   | juice (2)    | papaya (2)    | electronic (2)| Thai (3)     | Hedgehog (3) |
   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | Egyptian (2)  | Horse (1)     |

5. The person drinking water and the french have different parity positions, so the person drinking water cannot be the Egyptian. But we already know that the Egyptian is not the owner of the dog, so the Egyptian must be the owner of the horse.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
   | cola (1)     | onion (1)     | ambient (1)  | French (1)    | Dog (2)       |
   | juice (2)    | papaya (2)    | electronic (2)| Thai (3)     | Hedgehog (3) |
   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | Egyptian (1)  | Horse (3)     |

6. The Egyptian is on the far left or far right. Since the Egyptian is the owner of the horse, which is on the far right, the Egyptian must be on the far left.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           | Sport         |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
   | cola (1)     | onion (1)     | ambient (1)  | Egyptian (1)  | Dog (2)       | Baseball (2)  |
   | juice (2)    | papaya (2)    | electronic (2)| Thai (3)     | Hedgehog (3) | Cricket (3)   |
   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | French (2)    | Horse (3)     | Ice-hockey (1)|

7. The person eating onion is on the left of the person drinking juice.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           | Sport         | Food          |

   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | French (2)    | Horse (3)     | Ice-hockey (1)| radish (3)    |

8. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left or far right. Since the French is the owner of the horse, which is on the far right, the person playing ice-hockey cannot be the French. So, the person playing ice-hockey is the Egyptian.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           | Sport         | Food          |

   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | French (2)    | Horse (3)     | Ice-hockey (3)| radish (3)    |

9. The person eating papaya is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the Egyptian is the person playing ice-hockey, the person eating papaya cannot be the Thai.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           | Sport         | Food          |

   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | French (2)    | Horse (3)     | Ice-hockey (1)| radish (3)    |

10. The fan ambient is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since the Egyptian is the fan ambient and the Thai is eating papaya, which is to the left of the person drinking juice, the Thai cannot be the person drinking juice.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           | Sport         | Food          | Beverage      |

   | juice (2)    | papaya (2)    | electronic (2)| Thai (3)     | Hedgehog (3) | Cricket (3)   | juice (2)     | juice (2)    |
   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | French (2)    | Horse (3)     | Ice-hockey (1)| radish (3)    | water (3)    |

11. The Egyptian is on the far left or far right. Since the Egyptian is the fan ambient and the Thai is not the person drinking juice, the Thai cannot be on the far left. So, the Thai is on the far right.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           | Sport         | Food          | Beverage      |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
   | cola (1)     | onion (1)     | ambient (1)  | Egyptian (1)  | Dog (2)       | Baseball (2)  | onion (1)     | cola (1)     |
   | juice (2)    | papaya (2)    | electronic (2)| Thai (3)     | Hedgehog (3) | Cricket (3)   | juice (2)     | juice (2)    |
   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | French (2)    | Horse (3)     | Ice-hockey (1)| radish (3)    | water (3)    |

12. The person drinking water and the french have the same parity positions. Since the French is the person drinking cola, the person drinking water must be the Egyptian.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           | Sport         | Food          | Beverage      |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
   | cola (1)     | onion (1)     | ambient (1)  | Egyptian (1)  | Dog (2)       | Baseball (2)  | onion (1)     | cola (1)     |

   | water (3)    | radish (3)    | pop (3)      | French (2)    | Horse (3)     | Ice-hockey (1)| radish (3)    | water (3)    |

13. The person drinking water is not the thai. But we already know that the person drinking water is the Egyptian, which contradicts the Thai being on the far right. This means the Thai must be on the far left.

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           | Sport         | Food          | Beverage      |

36. The person drinking water and the french have the same parity positions. Since the French is the person drinking cola, the person drinking water must be the Egyptian. But we already know that the person drinking water is the Egyptian, which contradicts the Egyptian being the owner of the horse. This means the Egyptian must be the owner of the dog.

Lv10-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 variables (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet) and 3 instances for each. Let's assign numbers to each variable and instance:

   - Beverage: 1 (Fanta), 2 (Tea), 3 (Water)
   - Food: 4 (Cranberry), 5 (Lime), 6 (Pomegranate)
   - Hobby: 7 (Camping), 8 (Filmmaking), 9 (Puzzles)
   - Movie-Genre: 10 (Martial-Arts), 11 (Musical), 12 (Thriller)
   - Nationality: 13 (British), 14 (Chinese), 15 (Egyptian)
   - Pet: 16 (Cat), 17 (Chinchilla), 18 (Pony)

2. From rule 1, we know the Egyptian is to the right of the person eating pomegranate. So, let's place the Egyptian in position 6 (rightmost) and the pomegranate eater in position 5 (left of Egyptian).

3. From rule 2, the Egyptian and the person watching musical movies have the same parity positions. Since the Egyptian is in position 6, the musical movie watcher must be in an even position. Let's place the musical movie watcher in position 4 (since positions 2 and 6 are taken).

4. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is camping is the person drinking fanta or the Egyptian is the person who's hobby is camping, but not both. Since the Egyptian is in position 6 and we placed the fanta drinker in an even position (4), the Egyptian must be the camper (hobby 7).

5. From rule 4, the owner of the cat is not the person who's hobby is camping. Since the Egyptian is the camper, the cat owner cannot be in positions 1-5. So, the cat owner must be in position 6 (Egyptian) or position 7 (rightmost). But position 7 is already taken by the pet, so the cat owner is the Egyptian (position 6).

6. From rule 6, the person drinking tea is the owner of the cat. So, the tea drinker is the Egyptian (position 6).

7. From rule 7, the owner of the cat is on the far right. This is already satisfied as the cat owner is the Egyptian (position 6).

8. From rule 8, the British is not to the left of the person eating cranberry. Since the cranberry eater is in position 4, the British cannot be in positions 1-3. So, the British is in position 5.

9. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the filmmaker is in position 4 and the thriller watcher is yet to be placed, the filmmaker cannot be in positions 5-7. So, the thriller watcher is in position 5 and the filmmaker is in position 4.

10. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person watching musical movies. But we already placed the musical movie watcher in position 4. This is a contradiction, so let's assume the filmmaker watches thriller movies instead (position 5).

11. From rule 11, the owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the camper is the Egyptian (position 6), the pony owner must be in position 7 or 8. But position 7 is already taken by the pet, so the pony owner is in position 8.

12. From rule 12, the chinese is on the far left. So, the chinese is in position 1.

13. From rule 5, the person eating lime is the owner of the pony or the owner of the pony is the chinese, but not both. Since the pony owner is in position 8, the lime eater cannot be in position 8. So, the lime eater is in position 2 or 3. But position 2 is already taken, so the lime eater is in position 3.

14. From rule 6, the person drinking tea is the owner of the cat. But we already placed the tea drinker in position 6 (Egyptian). This is a contradiction, so let's assume the tea drinker is the person eating lime (position 3).

15. From rule 6, the person drinking tea is the owner of the cat. So, the cat owner is the person eating lime (position 3). But we already placed the cat owner in position 6 (Egyptian). This is a contradiction.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a contradiction in the given rules, and it's not possible to solve the puzzle as it stands.

Final solution table (assuming the contradiction is resolved):

Lv10-6x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 people and positions are numbered from 1 to 6, the person with the hobby of puzzles is in position 4 (even number).

2. Let's assign the nationalities to the first three positions: Dutch (1), American (3), and Polish (5) or Polish (2), American (4), Dutch (6) (we'll figure out the exact order later).

3. Since the Dutch is on the far left (position 1), the American must be in position 3 or 5, and the Polish in position 2 or 6. Let's assume the American is in position 3 and the Polish in position 2.

4. The manager is not to the left of the photographer (position 5 or 6), so the manager cannot be the American (position 3). Therefore, the manager must be the Polish (position 2) and the photographer is the American (position 6).

5. The owner of the frog is not to the left of the person eating orange. Since the Dutch (frog owner) is in position 1 and the person eating orange cannot be in position 1 (because the Dutch is on the far left), the person eating orange must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, since the American (eating orange) is in position 6, the person eating orange cannot be in position 2 (because the manager is in position 2). So, the person eating orange must be in position 4.

6. The Dutch is the owner of the frog (position 1).

7. The fan of salsa is somewhere between the person eating orange (position 4) and the person with the hobby of video-games. Since the American (eating orange) is in position 6 and the Polish (video-games) is in position 2, the fan of salsa can only be in position 3 or 5. However, since the Polish (position 2) is not the fan of salsa (rule 3), the fan of salsa must be in position 3.

8. The person eating cauliflower is on the far right (position 6).

9. The manager (American) is the owner of the bird. Since the manager is in position 6, the bird owner must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, since the Dutch (frog owner) is in position 1, the bird owner cannot be in position 1. So, the bird owner must be in position 3 or 5. But the American (manager) is already in position 6, so the bird owner must be in position 3.

10. The American is not to the right of the photographer (position 6), so the photographer (American) cannot be in position 6. Therefore, the photographer (American) must be in position 5.

11. The American (eating orange) and the person with the hobby of video-games have the same parity positions. Since the American is in position 6 (odd) and the Polish (video-games) is in position 2 (even), the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 4 (even).

12. The hobby of the person in position 1 (Dutch) is puzzles (rule 1).

13. The person in position 2 (Polish) has the hobby of video-games.

14. The person in position 3 (American) eats cauliflower.

15. The person in position 4 eats orange and has the hobby of traveling (since the American and Polish have other hobbies).

16. The person in position 5 (American) is a photographer.

17. The person in position 6 (American) eats orange.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-6x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the nationalities in the first column since we know that the person driving the subway is not Chinese and the person eating watermelon is Chinese. So, we can place the Chinese in the second or third row. Let's place them in the second row for now.

   | Pet          |     |     |     |
   | Transport    |     |     |     |

   Since the Chinese can't be the driver of the subway, they can't be in the second row. So, they must be in the third row.

   | Nationality   | 1   | 2   | 3   |

3. The fan of dubstep can't be to the left of the owner of the hamster according to rule 2. So, the hamster can't be in the first column.

- The journalist is in the first column, so the job of the person in the first row must be journalist.
- The person driving the helicopter is in the first row, so the job of the person in the second row must be paramedic (as the journalist is already placed).
- The person driving the subway is the Brazilian, so the job of the person in the third row must be analyst (as the journalist and paramedic are already placed).

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-6x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 variables (Beverage, Hobby, Job, Music-Genre, Sport, Transport) and each has 3 unique values. Let's assign a number to each unique value for each variable:

   Beverage: 1 - iced-tea, 2 - soy-milk, 3 - tea
   Hobby: 1 - dancing, 2 - hiking, 3 - writing
   Job: 1 - bartender, 2 - freelancer, 3 - paramedic
   Music-Genre: 1 - disco, 2 - folk, 3 - salsa
   Sport: 1 - baseball, 2 - basketball, 3 - volleyball
   Transport: 1 - motorbike, 2 - roller, 3 - subway

2. From rule 1, we know that the bartender, freelancer, paramedic, dancer, hiker, writer, baseball player, basketball player, volleyball player, disco fan, folk fan, salsa fan, motorbike driver, roller driver, and subway driver are all unique.

3. From rule 2, the paramedic is not the fan of writing, so the paramedic can be either 1, 2, or 3 for the hobby.

4. From rule 3, the bartender is not to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. This means the volleyball player cannot be in the first two positions. So, the volleyball player can be either 2 or 3.

5. From rule 4, the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the fan salsa. Since the volleyball player is not in the first two positions, the baseball player must be in the third position. So, baseball = 3, and salsa fan = 1.

6. From rule 5, the person driving the roller is not the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the volleyball player is in the second or third position, the roller driver cannot be in the first position. So, the roller driver can be either 2 or 3.

7. From rule 6, the person drinking tea is not to the right of the person driving the roller. Since the roller driver cannot be in the first position, the tea drinker also cannot be in the first position. So, the tea drinker can be either 2 or 3.

8. From rule 7, the person drinking soy-milk is the fan of folk or the person driving the roller, but not both. Since the roller driver cannot be in the first position, the soy-milk drinker must be in the first position. So, soy-milk = 1, and folk fan = 2 or 3.

9. From rule 8, the freelancer is on the left or right of the bartender. Since the bartender is not in the first position (due to the tea drinker and soy-milk drinker), the freelancer can be either 1 or 3.

10. From rule 9, the person who's sport is basketball is not to the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the freelancer can be in the first position, the basketball player must be in the second or third position.

11. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is hiking is between the paramedic and the person drinking soy-milk. Since the soy-milk drinker is in the first position, the hiker can be either 2 or 3.

12. From rule 11, the person drinking tea is not to the right of the person driving the roller. Since the roller driver is in the second position, the tea drinker cannot be in the third position. So, the tea drinker can be either 1 or 2.

13. From rule 12, the fan of disco is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person driving the motorbike. Since baseball is in the third position, the disco fan can be either 1 or 2.

14. Now we have two possibilities for the positions of the hiker, basketball player, and tea drinker. Let's check each possibility:

    Possibility 1:
    Hiker = 2, Basketball = 3, Tea = 1
    This satisfies all the rules.

    Possibility 2:
    Hiker = 3, Basketball = 2, Tea = 2
    This also satisfies all the rules.

15. Since both possibilities satisfy all the rules, we cannot determine the exact positions for the hiker, basketball player, and tea drinker.

The final solution table with the given information is:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |

Lv10-6x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people and their jobs. Since the accountant is to the right of the cat owner (5), and the entrepreneur is not the cat owner (10), the cat owner must be the entrepreneur. So, let's place the entrepreneur as the cat owner.

2. The accountant cannot be the cat owner (1), so the accountant must be the owner of either the goldfish or the horse. Let's place the accountant as the horse owner for now.

3. The entrepreneur is not the horse owner (4), so the horse owner must be the person driving the bike. Let's place the horse owner as the bike driver.

4. Now, the entrepreneur is the cat owner. The entrepreneur cannot be the person eating pumpkin (14), so the person eating pumpkin must be the teacher. Let's place the teacher as the pumpkin eater.

5. The teacher cannot be the person driving the quad-bike (9), so the quad-bike driver must be the person drinking sprite. Let's place the sprite drinker as the quad-bike driver.

6. The quad-bike driver is drinking sprite (5), so the sprite drinker has the same parity position as the quad-bike driver. Since the bike driver and the horse owner have the same parity (3), the sprite drinker must be in an odd position.

7. The sprite drinker is the quad-bike driver and is in an odd position (5), so the other odd positions are 1 and 3. The teacher is eating pumpkin (4), so the teacher is in an even position. This means the fanta drinker must be in position 1.

8. The fanta drinker is the cat owner (2), so the cat owner is in position 1. This means the 7up drinker must be in position 3.

9. The 7up drinker is the fan electronic (13), so the fan electronic is in position 3.

10. The goldfish owner must be in an even position (10), so the goldfish owner is either the accountant or the teacher. Since the accountant is the horse owner (2), the goldfish owner must be the teacher.

11. The teacher is eating pumpkin (4), so the pumpkin eater is in position 2. The grapefruit eater must be in position 1 (11), so the grapefruit eater is the fanta drinker (cat owner).

12. The teacher is eating pumpkin (4), so the teacher is in an even position. The accountant is the horse owner (2), so the accountant is in an odd position. This satisfies condition 12.

13. The fan disco is not to the right of the pumpkin eater (7), so the fan disco must be in position 3.

14. The entrepreneur is the cat owner (1), so the entrepreneur is not the horse owner (4). This satisfies condition 14.

15. The 7up drinker is the fan electronic (13), so the 7up drinker is in position 3. This satisfies condition 15.

16. The sprite drinker is the quad-bike driver (5), so the sprite drinker is in position 1. The fan disco is in position 3 (13), so the fan disco and the sprite drinker have the same parity positions. This satisfies condition 16.

17. The only remaining item is the food for position 1. Since the grapefruit eater is the fanta drinker (cat owner), the food for position 1 must be grapefruit.

The final solution table is:

Lv10-6x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's assign variables to each category and person (1, 2, 3) and each category value (A for almond-milk, C for coffee, J for juice). We'll also assign job values (D for doctor, F for firefighter, S for social-worker, SW for social-worker). Similarly, we'll assign movie-genre values (H for horror, M for martial-arts, S for sports), music-genre values (D for d&b, H for hip-hop, P for punk), and nationality values (C for Canadian, F for French, T for Turkish). Lastly, we'll assign transport values (S for subway, T for taxi, T for train).

2. From the given information, we can start filling in some possibilities:
   - Beverage: A, C, J
   - Job: D, F, S
   - Movie-Genre: H, M, S
   - Music-Genre: D, H, P
   - Nationality: C, F, T
   - Transport: S, T, T

3. Now let's solve the clues:

   1. The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the right of the fan punk:
      Since we know the music genres, we can place punk (P) in the first or second position. If P is in the first position, then S (sports) must be in the third position. If P is in the second position, then S can be in the first or third position. Let's assume P is in the first position for now.

   2. The french is the person watching martial-arts movies or the person drinking juice is the french, but not both:
      Since we know the nationalities and movie genres, we can place F in the second or third position. If F is in the second position, then M (martial-arts) must be in the second position as well. If F is in the third position, then J (juice) must be in the third position. Let's assume F is in the second position for now.

   3. The firefighter is not to the left of the person drinking coffee:
      Since we know the jobs and beverages, we can place F in the second or third position. If F is in the second position, then C (coffee) must be in the first or third position. If F is in the third position, then C must be in the second position. Let's assume F is in the second position for now.

   4. The canadian is between the firefighter and the person drinking almond-milk:
      Since we know the nationalities and beverages, C must be in the second position.

   5. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person driving the subway:
      Since we know the transports, we can place one of them in the first position and the other in the second or third position. Let's place S (subway) in the first position for now.

   6. The person driving the taxi is not to the right of the person drinking almond-milk:
      Since we know the transports and beverages, the taxi (T) cannot be in the third position.

   7. The person driving the train is the person drinking coffee:
      Since we know the transports and beverages, C (coffee) must be in the second position.

   8. The social-worker is the person driving the subway:
      Since we know the jobs and transports, the subway (S) must be driven by S (social-worker).

   9. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi:
      Since we know the movie genres and transports, the taxi (T) cannot be in the first position.

   10. The person watching sports movies is not to the right of the person drinking almond-milk:
      Since we know the movie genres and beverages, S (sports) cannot be in the third position.

   11. The person driving the train is the person drinking coffee:
      This is already confirmed in step 7.

   12. The french is not the doctor:
      Since we know the jobs and nationalities, D (doctor) cannot be in the second position.

   13. Now we have the following possibilities:
      - First position: S (subway), P (punk), D (doctor)
      - Second position: F (French, martial-arts), C (coffee, train), S (social-worker)
      - Third position: T (taxi), S (sports), J (juice)

   14. From the remaining possibilities, we can place S (sports) in the third position since it cannot be in the first or second position.

   15. Now we can place T (taxi) in the second position since it cannot be in the first position and must be to the left of S (sports).

   16. Finally, we can place P (punk) in the first position since it cannot be in the second or third position.

The final solution table is:

2. Since the Indonesian and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions##9, the cat owner must be either the first or the third person. Let's assume the cat owner is the first person (Indonesian). So, the cat owner's pet is mirinda (from rule 11).

3. The police-officer is not the Indonesian (from rule 7), so the police-officer must be either the second or the third person. Let's assume the police-officer is the second person (Japanese).

   |               |      1      |       2        |     3      |

4. The analyst is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking (from rule 2), so the analyst must be the first person (Indonesian).

5. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea##5. Since the Indonesian (analyst) is not watching family movies (from rule 6), the person watching family movies must be the second person (Japanese).

6. The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games##5. Since the Indonesian (analyst) does not have a hobby of chess or board-games, the person with the hobby of chess must be the third person (Russian).

8. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster##3. Since the Indonesian (analyst) does not own a hamster, the person with the hobby of board-games must be the first or the third person. However, the first person (Indonesian) already has a hobby, so the person with the hobby of board-games must be the third person (Russian).

9. The police-officer is the indonesian or the police-officer is the person who's hobby is cooking, but not both0. Since we already placed the police-officer as the second person (Japanese), the police-officer is not the Indonesian. So, the person who's hobby is cooking must be the Indonesian (first person).

10. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left or far right##3. Since we already placed the person with the hobby of board-games as the third person (Russian), the person with the hobby of cooking must be the first person (Indonesian).
