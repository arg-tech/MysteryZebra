Lv10-3x6-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions based on the given conditions. We know that the positions have odd and even parity, so we can start by assigning an odd number to the person who's sport is weightlifting (1, 3, 5, or 7). Let's assign it position 5 for now.

2. The person who's sport is weightlifting cannot be to the left of the person who's sport is basketball (2, 4, or 6), so the sport of person 2 is basketball.

3. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 18), the goldfish must be in position 3, 5, or 7. If the goldfish is in position 3, then the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 1 or 5. However, this would violate rule 4 (different parity positions for badminton and the snake), so the goldfish cannot be in position 3. If the goldfish is in position 5, then the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 1 or 7. But this would violate rule 14 (the person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the owner of the snake), so the goldfish cannot be in position 5 either. Therefore, the goldfish must be in position 7. This means the person who's sport is lacrosse is in position 1.

4. The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since the person who's sport is basketball is in position 2, the person who's sport is badminton cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 13). So, the person who's sport is badminton is in position 3, 5, or 7. However, if the person who's sport is badminton is in position 3, then the person drinking tea must be in position 1 or 5, but this would violate rule 6 (the person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton). If the person who's sport is badminton is in position 5, then the person drinking tea must be in position 1, 3, or 7. But this would violate rule 7 (the person drinking tea is not the person who's sport is badminton). Therefore, the person who's sport is badminton must be in position 7. This means the person drinking tea is in position 3.

5. The person drinking coffee is the owner of the goldfish or the person drinking coffee is the person who's sport is badminton, but not both. Since we already know the person who's sport is badminton is in position 7 and the goldfish is in position 7, the person drinking coffee cannot be in position 7. So, the person drinking coffee is in position 1, 3, 5, or 6. However, if the person drinking coffee is in position 1, then the person drinking tea would be in position 3, which would violate rule 6. If the person drinking coffee is in position 3, then the person drinking tea would be in position 1, which would violate rule 7. If the person drinking coffee is in position 5, then the person drinking tea would be in position 3, which is correct. But this would violate rule 10 (the person drinking coffee is the owner of the goldfish, which is not the case). Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 6.

6. The person drinking water is the owner of the goldfish. This is already known from rule 16.

7. The person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person who's sport is basketball is in position 2, the person who's sport is rowing must be in position 1.

8. The owner of the cat is not to the right of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is in position 4 (because the person drinking fanta is not the owner of the rat, and the person drinking fanta cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5 due to rules 13 and 18), the owner of the cat must be in position 2 or 6. However, if the owner of the cat is in position 2, then the person who's sport is rowing would be to the right of the owner of the cat, which is not allowed. Therefore, the owner of the cat is in position 6.

9. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the owner of the snake or the owner of the snake is the person drinking fanta, but not both. Since we already know the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 5, the owner of the snake cannot be in position 5. So, the owner of the snake is in position 1, 3, 7, or the person drinking fanta is in position 1, 3, 7. However, if the owner of the snake is in position 1, then the person who's sport is weightlifting would be to the left of the owner of the snake, which is not allowed. If the owner of the snake is in position 3, then the person who's sport is weightlifting would be to the right of the owner of the snake, which is not allowed. If the owner of the snake is in position 7, then the person who's sport is weightlifting would be to the left of the owner of the snake, which is not allowed. Therefore, the person drinking fanta is in position 1, 3, or 5. But this would violate rule 13 (the person drinking cola is not to the left of the owner of the cat, which is in position 6). So, the person drinking fanta must be in position 5.

10. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is in position 6, the person drinking cola cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the person drinking cola is in position 2, 4, or 7. However, if the person drinking cola is in position 2, then the person who's sport is rowing would be to the right of the person drinking cola, which is not allowed. If the person drinking cola is in position 4, then the person drinking tea would be to the left of the person drinking cola, which is not allowed. If the person drinking cola is in position 7, then the person who's sport is weightlifting would be to the left of the person drinking cola, which is not allowed. Therefore, the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

11. The person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the owner of the snake. Since the owner of the snake is in position 5, the person who's sport is weightlifting cannot be in position 1, 3, or 7. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 2, 4, or 6. However, if the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 2, then the person who's sport is basketball would be to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting, which is not allowed. If the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 4, then the person drinking tea would be to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting, which is not allowed. If the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 6, then the person drinking tea would be to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting, which is correct.

12. The owner of the bird is somewhere between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the owner of the dog. Since the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 6, the owner of the bird must be in position 4 or 5. However, if the owner of the bird is in position 4, then the person drinking tea would be to the left of the owner of the bird, which is not allowed. Therefore, the owner of the bird is in position 5.

13. The person drinking juice is the owner of the rat or the person drinking juice is the person who's sport is rowing, but not both. Since the person who's sport is rowing is in position 1, the person drinking juice cannot be in position 1. So, the person drinking juice is in position 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7. However, if the person drinking juice is in position 2, then the person who's sport is rowing would be to the right of the person drinking juice, which is not allowed. If the person drinking juice is in position 3, then the person drinking cola would be to the left of the person drinking juice, which is not allowed. If the person drinking juice is in position 4, then the person drinking tea would be to the left of the person drinking juice, which is not allowed. If the person drinking juice is in position 6, then the person who's sport is weightlifting would be to the left of the person drinking juice, which is not allowed. If the person drinking juice is in position 7, then the person who's sport is weightlifting would be to the right of the person drinking juice, which is correct. But this would violate rule 18 (the owner of the rat and the person drinking juice have different parity positions). Therefore, the person drinking juice must be in position 6.

14. The owner of the rat and the person drinking juice have different parity positions. Since the owner of the rat is in position 4, the person drinking juice must be in position 2, 3, or 5. However, if the person drinking juice is in position 2, then the person who's sport is rowing would be to the right of the person drinking juice, which is not allowed. If the person drinking juice is in position 3, then the person drinking cola would be to the left of the person drinking juice, which is not allowed. Therefore, the person drinking juice must be in position 5.

15. The person drinking fanta is in position 5. This is already known.

16. The person drinking water is the owner of the goldfish. This is already known.

17. The owner of the snake is in position 1. This is already known.

18. The owner of the rat and the person drinking juice have different parity positions. Since the person drinking juice is in position 5, the owner of the rat must be in position 2, 3, or 4. However, if the owner of the rat is in position 2, then the person who's sport is rowing would be to the right of the owner of the rat, which is not allowed. If the owner of the rat is in position 3, then the person drinking cola would be to the left of the owner of the rat, which is not allowed. Therefore, the owner of the rat is in position 4.

19. The person who's sport is rowing is in position 1. This is already known.

20. The owner of the bird is in position 5. This is already known.

21. The owner of the dog is somewhere between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the owner of the bird. Since the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 6 and the owner of the bird is in position 5, the owner of the dog must be in position 5 or 6. However, if the owner of the dog is in position 5, then the person who's sport is weightlifting would be to the right of the owner of the dog, which is not allowed. Therefore, the owner of the dog is in position 6.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv10-3x6-2	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. We can start by placing the fan of disco on the far left (position 1) as per condition 9.

2. Since the fan of disco is on the far left, the fan of dubstep cannot be to its right (condition 5). So, the fan of dubstep can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6. However, it cannot be in position 6 because the owner of the dog, who plays water-polo (condition 2), cannot be on the far right (condition 19). So, the fan of dubstep can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. The fan of techno cannot be in position 1 (left of the fan soul) and cannot be in position 6 (condition 11). So, the fan of techno can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. The owner of the hamster cannot be the person who's sport is skiing (condition 13). So, the owner of the hamster can be in any position except position 3.

9. The person who's sport is sailing can be on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket (condition 10). Since the owner of the rabbit cannot be the person who's sport is sailing (condition 14), the person who's sport is sailing cannot be in position 1 (left of the owner of the rabbit). So, the person who's sport is sailing can only be in position 2 or 4.

10. The person who's sport is cycling and the owner of the rabbit have the same parity positions (condition 16). Since the owner of the rabbit can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4, the person who's sport is cycling can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 as well.

11. The owner of the dog plays water-polo (condition 2). Since the fan of dubstep cannot be to the left of the fan techno (condition 23), the owner of the dog cannot be in position 2 (since the fan of techno can only be in positions 2 or 4). So, the owner of the dog can only be in position 4.

12. The fan of techno cannot be in position 2 (since the owner of the dog plays water-polo and the fan of techno cannot be to the right of the fan dubstep). So, the fan of techno must be in position 4.

13. Since the fan of techno is in position 4, the fan of soul cannot be in position 4 (since the fan of soul cannot be to the right of the fan techno). So, the fan of soul must be in position 2.

14. Since the fan of techno is in position 4, the fan of indie cannot be in position 4 (since the fan of indie cannot be in the same position as the fan of techno). So, the fan of indie must be in position 2.

15. Since the fan of indie is in position 2, the fan of dubstep cannot be in position 2 (since the fan of dubstep cannot be to the left of the fan soul). So, the fan of dubstep must be in position 3.

16. Since the fan of dubstep is in position 3, the fan of disco cannot be in position 3 (since the fan of disco is on the far left). So, the fan of disco must be in position 1.

17. Since the fan of disco is in position 1, the fan of punk cannot be in position 1 (since the fan of punk cannot be the person who's sport is skiing). So, the fan of punk must be in position 5.

18. Since the fan of punk is in position 5, the owner of the rat cannot be in position 5 (since the fan of indie cannot be the owner of the rat). So, the owner of the rat must be in position 6.

19. Since the owner of the rat is in position 6, the person who's sport is water-polo cannot be in position 6 (since the owner of the dog plays water-polo and the owner of the dog cannot be to the right of the owner of the rat). So, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 2.

20. Since the person who's sport is water-polo is in position 2, the fan of techno cannot be in position 4 (since the fan of techno is the person who's sport is lacrosse or the owner of the chinchilla, but not both, and the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in an odd position). So, the fan of techno must be in position 2.

21. Since the fan of techno is in position 2, the owner of the chinchilla cannot be to the left of the fan techno (since the owner of the chinchilla cannot be to the left of the fan techno). So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 4.

Lv10-3x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the Spanish (Potato) in an odd position (position 1, 3, 5, or 6) because of rule 8. Let's place them in position 1 for now.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality |  |   |   |   |   |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

2. Since the Spanish is in position 1, the Potato is placed in column 1. Now we know that the Spanish is eating Potato.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   |   |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

3. Rule 3 tells us that the owner of the Pony is not to the left of the owner of the Pony, so the Pony cannot be in the first three positions. Let's place the Pony in position 4.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----|---|---| Pony |   |   |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   |   |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

4. Rule 10 tells us that the owner of the Cat is between the Egyptian and the person eating Potato. Since the Spanish is eating Potato, the Cat cannot be in the first three positions. Let's place the Cat in position 5.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----|---|---| Pony | Cat |   |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   |   |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

5. Rule 16 tells us that the Egyptian is on the left or right of the owner of the Ferret. Since the Cat is in position 5, the Egyptian cannot be in the first four positions. Let's place the Egyptian in position 6.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----|---|---| Pony | Cat | Egyptian |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   |   |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

6. Rule 18 tells us that the person eating Zucchini is somewhere to the left of the owner of the Dog. Since the Egyptian is in position 6, the Dog cannot be in the last three positions. Let's place the Dog in position 2.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----| Dog | Pony | Cat | Egyptian |   |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   |   |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

7. Rule 11 tells us that the owner of the Dog is not the person eating Raspberry. Since the Dog is in position 2, the Raspberry cannot be in the first two positions. Let's place the Raspberry in position 3.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----| Dog | Raspberry | Pony | Cat | Egyptian |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   |   |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

8. Rule 19 tells us that the owner of the Mouse is on the right of the Thai. Since the Raspberry is in position 3, the Thai cannot be in the first three positions. Let's place the Thai in position 5.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----| Dog | Raspberry | Pony | Mouse | Egyptian |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   | Thai |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

9. Rule 14 tells us that the Spanish is on the left or right of the person eating Garlic. Since the Raspberry is in position 3, the Garlic cannot be in the first three positions. Let's place the Garlic in position 6.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----| Dog | Raspberry | Pony | Mouse | Garlic |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   | Thai |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

10. Rule 9 tells us that the Spanish is on the left or right of the person eating Garlic. Since the Garlic is in position 6, the Spanish cannot be in the first five positions. Let's place the Spanish in position 1.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----| Dog | Raspberry | Pony | Mouse | Garlic |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   | Thai |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

11. Rule 15 tells us that the Spanish and the owner of the Cat have different parity positions. Since the Spanish is in position 1 and the Cat is in position 5, they have different parity, so the Cat cannot be in position 5. Let's swap the Cat and the Garlic.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----| Dog | Raspberry | Pony | Garlic | Cat |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   | Thai |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

12. Rule 20 tells us that the owner of the Dog is not the Spanish and the person eating Zucchini is not the owner of the Dog. Since the Dog is in position 2 and the Spanish is in position 1, the person eating Zucchini cannot be in the first two positions. Let's place the Zucchini in position 3.

   | Food  | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |-------|-----| Dog | Zucchini | Pony | Garlic | Cat |
   | Nationality | Spanish |   |   |   | Thai |   |
   | Pet |   |   |   |   |   |   |

13. Rule 13 tells us that the Thai is not the owner of the Dog. Since the Dog is in position 2, the Thai cannot be the owner of the Dog.

   Movie-Genre: 1 - Not specified, 2 - Mystery, 3 - Disaster, 4 - Satire, 5 - Not specified, 6 - Hiking or Spy

Since we don't have enough information to determine the hobby or movie genre for the person drinking water, we can't fill in those cells. However, we can fill in the rest of the table with the information we have. The final solution table is:

#############

Lv10-3x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people, and each has a unique favorite beverage, hobby, and sport. Let's label the columns with the beverages and the rows with the hobbies.

   |            | A | B | C | D | E | F |
   | Beverage   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   | Hobby      | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   | Sport      |   |   |   |   |   |   |

2. From rule 1, we know the beverages: almond-milk, coffee, iced-tea, juice, soy-milk, tea. Let's fill in the beverages in the table.

   |            | A | B | C | D | E | F |
   | Beverage   | almond-milk | coffee | iced-tea | juice | soy-milk | tea |
   | Hobby      | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   | Sport      |   |   |   |   |   |   |

3. From rule 2, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person who's sport is surfing. Since there are only 5 people between iced-tea and surfing, skiing must be in column D or E.

4. From rule 3, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is in an even position. Since there are 6 people, the only even positions are columns B, C, and F. However, climbing cannot be in column F because rule 6 states that the person drinking almond-milk is the person who's sport is climbing, and almond-milk is in column A. So, climbing must be in column B or C.

5. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking soy-milk and the person who's hobby is photography have different parity positions. Since photography is in an odd position (rule 15), soy-milk cannot be in column B (where climbing is). So, soy-milk must be in column A, D, E, or F. But since climbing is in column B, soy-milk cannot be in column B either. So, soy-milk must be in column D, E, or F.

6. From rule 7, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is on the far left. So, surfing must be in column A.

7. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is not the person who's hobby is gardening. Since gardening is hobby 1 (rule 1), and we know that surfing is in column A, skiing cannot be in column A. So, skiing must be in column B, C, D, E, or F. But since climbing is in column B, skiing cannot be in column B. So, skiing must be in column C, D, E, or F.

8. From rule 9, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is not to the left of the person who's sport is surfing. So, skiing cannot be in column D (since surfing is in column A). So, skiing must be in column E or F.

9. From rule 10, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea is in column B, rugby must be in column C, D, E, or F. But since climbing is in column B, rugby cannot be in column B. So, rugby must be in column C, D, E, or F.

10. From rule 11, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is the person who's sport is climbing, and climbing is in column B. So, almond-milk is in column B.

11. From rule 12, we know that the person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since coffee is in column C, juice must be in column D, E, or F. But since climbing is in column B, juice cannot be in column B. So, juice must be in column D, E, or F.

12. From rule 13, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is not to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since coffee is in column C, skiing cannot be in column D, E, or F. So, skiing must be in column C.

13. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since tea is in column F, writing must be in column E or F. But since soy-milk is in column D, writing cannot be in column D. So, writing must be in column E or F.

14. From rule 15, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since card-games is hobby 2, rock-climbing must be in column 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since surfing is in column A, rock-climbing cannot be in column 1. So, rock-climbing must be in column 2, 3, or 4.

15. From rule 16, we know that the person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since surfing is in column A, juice cannot be in column A. So, juice must be in column B, C, D, E, or F. But since climbing is in column B, juice cannot be in column B. So, juice must be in column C, D, E, or F.

16. From rule 17, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since rock-climbing is in column 2, 3, or 4, writing must be in column 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since surfing is in column A, writing cannot be in column 1. So, writing must be in column 2, 3, or 4.

17. From rule 18, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is to the right of the person drinking juice. Since juice is in column C, D, E, or F, water-polo must be in column D, E, or F. But since climbing is in column B, water-polo cannot be in column B. So, water-polo must be in column D, E, or F.

18. From rule 19, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is not the person who's hobby is gardening. Since gardening is hobby 1, skiing cannot be hobby 1. So, skiing is not in column 1.

19. From rule 20, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is not to the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since surfing is in column A, skiing cannot be in column A, B, or C. So, skiing must be in column D, E, or F.

20. From rule 21, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is not to the left of the person drinking tea. Since tea is in column F, almond-milk cannot be in column F. So, almond-milk is not in column F.

At this point, we have the following information:
- Surfing is in column A
- Climbing is in column B
- Almond-milk is in column B
- Skiing is in column C
- Coffee is in column C
- Tea is in column F

We still have some hobbies and sports to place, but we have enough information to fill in the beverages:

|            | A | B | C | D | E | F |
| Beverage   | surfing | climbing | coffee | juice | soy-milk | tea |
| Hobby      |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Sport      |   |   |   |   |   |   |

We can now use the remaining rules to fill in the hobbies and sports. However, the puzzle becomes quite complex at this point, and it's not feasible to solve it by hand. I would recommend using a computer program or a spreadsheet to solve the remaining part of the puzzle.

The final solution table would look like this:

Lv10-3x6-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign positions to the people based on the given clues. We'll use even numbers for left positions and odd numbers for right positions.

2. From clue 5, we know that the person who collects is on the far right, so they are in position 6.

3. From clue 21, we know that the person eating zucchini is on the right of the person eating lettuce. Since the collector is on the far right, the person eating lettuce must be in position 5.

4. From clue 22, we know that the person eating cabbage is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since the collector is on the far right, the boat driver must be in position 1 or 2. Let's say the boat driver is in position 1 (boat).

5. From clue 19, we know that the taxi driver is not to the left of the boat driver. So, the taxi driver must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. But from clue 17, we know that the person who dances is to the left of the taxi driver. Since the collector is on the far right, the dancer must be in position 2. So, the taxi driver must be in position 3.

6. From clue 18, we know that the person eating lettuce and the person who plays card-games have different parity positions. Since the person eating lettuce is in position 5 (even), the person playing card-games must be in position 1, 3, or 7 (odd). But from clue 7, we know that the person eating lettuce is to the right of the bus driver. So, the bus driver must be in position 2.

7. From clue 8, we know that the person eating plum is not the driver of the car. Since the collector is on the far right, the car driver must be in position 4.

8. From clue 13, we know that the person eating plum is not to the left of the boat driver. So, the person eating plum must be in position 6.

9. From clue 14, we know that the person eating corn is to the right of the person eating plum. So, the person eating corn must be in position 5 or 6. But from clue 12, we know that the person eating corn is not to the left of the person who travels. Since the collector is on the far right, the traveler must be in position 1, 2, or 3. If the traveler is in position 1, then the person eating corn must be in position 6. If the traveler is in position 2, then the person eating corn must be in position 5. If the traveler is in position 3, then there's no solution because the collector is on the far right. Let's assume the traveler is in position 2.

10. From clue 16, we know that the person eating cabbage is between the person playing card-games and the person eating lettuce. Since the bus driver is in position 2 and the person eating lettuce is in position 5, the person eating cabbage must be in position 3.

11. From clue 11, we know that the bus driver is on the left or right of the person playing sudoku. Since the person playing sudoku must be in an odd position (from clue 6), the bus driver cannot be in position 1 (already assigned to the boat driver). So, the bus driver must be in position 3, and the person playing sudoku must be in position 5.

12. From clue 15, we know that the person who sings is to the right of the person playing sudoku. Since the person playing sudoku is in position 5, the person who sings must be in position 6.

13. From clue 10, we know that the person eating corn is in position 6. Since the person eating plum is in position 6, the person eating corn must be eating plum. But from clue 8, we know that the person eating plum is not the driver of the car. This is a contradiction, so there's no solution to this puzzle.

So, there's no valid solution to this puzzle.

Lv10-3x6-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the dancer or the person eating carrot is the person who's hobby is drawing, but not both. Let's assume the dancer is the one with drawing as a hobby (D). Then, the person eating carrot (C) cannot have drawing as a hobby.

2. From rule 2, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the designer (D). Since D is already placed, let's place the person with puzzles as P.

3. From rule 3, we know that the person eating raspberry (R) is somewhere between C and the dressmaker (M). Since D is to the left of P, and P is not C, R cannot be to the left of P. So, R must be to the right of P.

4. From rule 4, we know that the chef (C) is on the left of D. Since D is already placed, C can only be in the first three positions.

5. From rule 5, we know that the person eating zucchini (Z) is not to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking (W). Since W is not yet placed, Z cannot be in the first three positions.

6. From rule 6, we know that the person eating lime (L) and M have different parity positions. Since M is not yet placed, L cannot be in an even position.

7. From rule 7, we know that W is on the far left or far right. Since W cannot be in the first three positions (due to Z), W must be in the last three positions.

8. From rule 8, we know that W is not to the left of D. Since D is already placed, W must be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

9. From rule 9, we know that the dancer (D) is somewhere to the left of R. Since D is already placed, R must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

10. From rule 10, we know that the person eating pineapple (Pn) is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing (W). Since W is in positions 4, 5, or 6, Pn must be in positions 5 or 6.

11. From rule 11, we know that W is somewhere between C and W. Since C is in the first three positions and W is in positions 4, 5, or 6, W must be in position 5.

12. From rule 12, we know that R is between W and C. Since W is in position 5 and C is in the first three positions, R must be in position 3.

13. From rule 13, we know that the security-guard (S) is between M and W. Since W is in position 5 and M is to the right of R (in position 3), S can only be in position 4.

14. From rule 14, we know that W is not to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (Rc). Since Rc is not yet placed, W cannot be in positions 5 or 6. So, W is in position 4.

15. From rule 15, we know that K and D have different parity positions. Since D is in an odd position (1st), K must be in an even position (2nd or 6th).

16. From rule 16, we know that C is not the person who's hobby is puzzles (P). Since P is in position 2, C cannot be in position 1 (as it would be to the left of D). So, C must be in position 3.

17. From rule 17, we know that the coach (Co) is not to the left of D. Since D is in position 1, Co cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, Co must be in position 4 or 5.

18. From rule 18, we know that K is in the first position. Since C is in position 3, K must be in position 1.

19. From rule 19, we know that Rc is to the right of D. Since D is in position 1, Rc must be in position 6.

20. From rule 20, we know that the designer (D) is not to the left of S. Since S is in position 4, D cannot be in position 3 or 4. So, D must be in position 5.

21. From rule 21, we know that the person eating carrot (C) is not to the right of D. Since D is in position 5, C cannot be in position 6. So, C must be in position 2.

22. From rule 22, we know that D is not to the right of W. Since W is in position 4, D cannot be in position 5 or 6. So, D must be in position 3.

23. From rule 23, we know that W is to the right of Pn. Since Pn is in position 5, W must be in position 6.

24. From rule 24, we know that the coach (Co) and W have the same parity positions. Since W is in position 6, Co must be in position 4.

25. From rule 25, we know that Z is on the left or right of C. Since C is in position 3, Z can only be in position 1 or 2. However, Z cannot be in position 1 (as K is already there), so Z must be in position 2.

26. From rule 26, we know that the designer (D) is not to the left of M. Since M is not yet placed, D cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, D is in position 3, 4, or 5. But D is already placed in position 3, so M must be in position 2.

27. From rule 27, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing (D) is not to the right of C. Since C is in position 2, D cannot be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, D must be in position 1.

28. From rule 28, we know that R is not to the right of D. Since D is in position 1, R cannot be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, R must be in position 6.

29. From rule 29, we know that the person who's hobby is writing (W) is on the far left or far right. Since D is already in the first position, W must be in position 6. However, this contradicts rule 6, as L and M have the same parity positions, and both are already placed in even positions (2 and 4).

There seems to be a contradiction in rule 6 and rule 29. The given rules do not allow for a valid solution.

Lv10-3x6-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the jobs to the positions. From rule 17, the electrician is to the left of the musician, so we can place the electrician in position 1 (leftmost). From rule 18, the electrician is also to the left of the person watching superhero movies, so the superhero movies can't be in position 1. Let's place superhero movies in position 6 (rightmost).

2. From rule 16, the person who's sport is snowboarding is not to the right of the person watching superhero movies, so snowboarding can't be in position 6. Let's place snowboarding in position 5.

3. From rule 14, the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since we placed superhero movies in position 6, fantasy movies can't be in position 6. Let's place fantasy movies in position 4.

4. From rule 22, the person watching fantasy movies is the person who's sport is cricket. So, cricket is in position 4.

5. From rule 15, the lawyer is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing, which is in position 5. So, the lawyer is in position 6.

6. From rule 13, the security-guard is to the right of the person who's sport is cricket (which is in position 4). So, the security-guard can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. The security-guard can't be in position 6 because the lawyer is there. So, the security-guard is in position 5.

7. From rule 20, the security-guard is the person watching crime movies, so crime movies are in position 5.

8. From rule 1, the person who's sport is handball and the entrepreneur have the same parity positions. Since we placed handball in position 5, entrepreneur must be in an odd position. The only odd positions left are 1, 3, and 5. But the entrepreneur can't be in position 5 (already taken by the security-guard), so the entrepreneur is in position 3.

9. From rule 21, the security-guard is the security-guard, so we already know who that is.

10. From rule 19, the security-guard is not to the left of the chef. So, the chef is in position 2.

11. From rule 11, the person who's sport is handball is between the person watching superhero movies (position 6) and the person who's sport is rowing (position 5). So, handball is in position 4.

12. From rule 12, the person watching thriller movies is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since we placed disaster movies to the left of thriller movies in our initial guesses, this rule is satisfied.

13. From rule 13, the security-guard is to the right of the person who's sport is cricket (which is in position 4). So, the entrepreneur (in position 3) must be the person who's sport is basketball, cycling, or handball. But from rule 9, the person who's sport is handball is not the musician, so the entrepreneur can't be the musician either. So, the entrepreneur must be the person who's sport is cycling.

14. From rule 10, the person watching superhero movies is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling. So, cycling is in position 3.

15. From rule 15, the lawyer is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing (which is in position 5). So, the lawyer must be the person who's sport is basketball, cricket, or handball. But from rule 9, the person who's sport is handball is not the musician, so the lawyer can't be the musician either. So, the lawyer must be the person who's sport is basketball.

16. From rule 16, the person who's sport is snowboarding is not to the left of the person watching superhero movies (which is in position 6). So, snowboarding can't be in position 5 (to the left of position 6). So, snowboarding is in position 1.

17. From rule 8, the person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies (which is in position 6). Since we placed snowboarding in position 1 (to the left of position 6), thriller movies can't be in position 1. So, thriller movies are in position 2.

18. From rule 8, the person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies (which is in position 6). Since we placed thriller movies in position 2, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 4.

19. From rule 3, the entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the electrician (which is in position 1). So, the entrepreneur can't be in position 2 (to the left of the electrician). So, the entrepreneur is in position 3.

20. From rule 7, the person watching adventure movies is the security-guard or the person watching adventure movies is the person who's sport is cricket, but not both. Since we already placed the security-guard in position 5 and the person who's sport is cricket in position 4, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 6.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-3x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person eating pineapple is not in the first or sixth position (since the person driving the trike is not the person eating potato). So, the possible positions for pineapple are 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. From rule 2, the person eating lettuce is in an even position (since the person eating lettuce is on the right of the owner of the mouse, and the owner of the mouse must be in an odd position due to rule 13). So, the possible positions for lettuce are 1, 2, 4, or 6.

3. From rule 3, the person eating pineapple and the person driving the car have different parity positions. Since pineapple is either 2, 3, 4, or 5, the car cannot be in those positions. So, the car can only be in position 1 or 6. Since the car is also the person eating carrot (rule 18), the person eating carrot must be in position 1 or 6, and the person eating carrot cannot be in the same position as pineapple (rule 1). So, the person eating carrot is in position 6, and the person eating pineapple is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. From rule 4, the person eating cucumber is not in the first position (since the person driving the car is to the right of the person eating cucumber). So, the possible positions for cucumber are 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

5. From rule 5, the person eating carrot is not the owner of the goldfish. Since the person eating carrot is in position 6, the goldfish cannot be the owner of the person in position 6. So, the goldfish can be the owner of any of the remaining people.

6. From rule 6, the person driving the ship is not in the first position (since the person driving the ship is between the person driving the car and the person driving the trike, and the person driving the car is in position 6). So, the possible positions for the ship are 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. From rule 7, the owner of the hamster is not to the left of the owner of the fish. Since the owner of the fish cannot be in position 6 (rule 5), the owner of the hamster cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the owner of the hamster can be in position 4, 5, or 6.

8. From rule 8, the person eating lettuce is to the right of the person eating cabbage. Since lettuce is in an even position, cabbage must be in an odd position. So, the possible positions for cabbage are 1, 3, or 5.

9. From rule 9, the owner of the fish is to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the ship is not in position 1 (rule 6), the owner of the fish cannot be in position 1 either. So, the owner of the fish can be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

10. From rule 10, the person eating pineapple is the person driving the ship or the person eating pineapple is the owner of the rat, but not both. Since the person eating pineapple is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5, and the owner of the rat can be in any position, this rule does not provide any additional information.

11. From rule 11, the person driving the trike is not the person eating potato. Since the person eating pineapple is not in position 6 (rule 3), the person eating potato cannot be in position 6 either. So, the person eating potato can be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

12. From rule 12, the owner of the hamster is on the right of the person driving the trike. Since the owner of the hamster can be in position 4, 5, or 6, and the person driving the trike is not in position 6 (rule 11), the person driving the trike can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

13. From rule 13, the owner of the mouse and the person driving the train have different parity positions. Since the owner of the mouse can be in position 1, 3, or 5, the person driving the train can be in position 2, 4, or 6.

14. From rule 14, the person eating carrot is between the person eating lettuce and the person eating cucumber. Since lettuce is in an even position and cucumber can be in any position, the person eating carrot must be in an odd position. Since the person eating carrot is in position 6, the person eating lettuce must be in position 4, and the person eating cucumber must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

15. From rule 15, the owner of the snake and the person driving the ship have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the ship can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5, the owner of the snake can also be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

16. From rule 16, the person eating cucumber is to the right of the person driving the train. Since the person driving the train can be in position 2, 4, or 6, and the person eating cucumber can be in position 2, 3, or 5, this rule does not provide any additional information.

17. From rule 17, the person driving the bike is to the left of the person driving the trike. Since the person driving the trike can be in position 1, 2, or 3, the person driving the bike can be in position 4, 5, or 6.

18. From rule 18, the person driving the car is the person eating carrot, which we already know is in position 6.

19. From rule 19, the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person driving the trike. Since the person driving the trike can be in position 1, 2, or 3, the person driving the skateboard can be in position 4, 5, or 6.

20. From rule 20, the owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat can be in any position, this rule does not provide any additional information.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

  |             |    1     |    2     |   3    |     4     |    5    |     6      |
