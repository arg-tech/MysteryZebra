Lv10-4x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 12, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person watching animation movies. Let's place them in position 1 (leftmost) or 5 (rightmost).

2. From rule 11, we know that the fan r&b is on the far left or far right. If the fan r&b is in position 1, then the person watching animation movies cannot be in position 5 (since rule 12), so the fan r&b must be in position 5.

3. From rule 16, we know that the journalist is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the fan r&b is in position 5, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 2 or 4. If the journalist is in position 1, then the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 4, and the person watching animation movies must be in position 3. If the journalist is in position 5, then the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 2, and the person watching animation movies must be in position 4.

4. From rule 19, we know that the musician is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is either in position 2 or 4, the musician can only be in position 1, 2, or 3. If the musician is in position 1, then the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 5, and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 2. If the musician is in position 2, then the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 4, and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 1. If the musician is in position 3, then the person who's hobby is cooking can be in any position.

5. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 1, 2, or 4, and the person watching animation movies is in position 3 or 4, the person watching disaster movies can only be in position 2.

6. From rule 15, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 1, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. From rule 18, we know that the fan r&b is not the coach. Since the coach must be either the person watching horror movies (rule 9) or the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (rule 9), the coach cannot be in position 1, 2, or 5. So the coach must be in position 3 or 4.

8. From rule 4, we know that the coach is not to the left of the nurse. Since the coach is in position 3 or 4, the nurse must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

9. From rule 1, we know that the people have 5 different hobbies. Since we have placed the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, the person who's hobby is cooking, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, and the coach, the remaining hobby must be in position 5.

10. From rule 10, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not to the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 2, the person watching animation movies must be in position 3 or 4.

11. From rule 22, we know that the person watching disaster movies is in an even position. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 2, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 4.

12. From rule 23, we know that the person watching spy movies is the videographer. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 1, the fan hip-hop (left of the person watching spy movies, rule 20) must be in position 2. The person watching spy movies (videographer) must be in position 3.

13. From rule 13, we know that the fan dubstep is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks or the fan dubstep is the person watching animation movies, but not both0. Since the fan dubstep cannot be the person watching animation movies (rule 12), the fan dubstep must be the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

14. From rule 7, we know that the person watching animation movies and the fan ambient have different parity positions. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 3 or 4, the fan ambient must be in position 1 or 5.

15. From rule 5, we know that the fan ambient and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions. Since the fan ambient is in position 1 or 5, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 5.

16. From rule 17, we know that the person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 2 (rule 12), the person who's hobby is singing can be in position 1 or 3.

17. From rule 3, we know that the fan dubstep is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the person who's hobby is singing is in position 1 or 3, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 2.

18. From rule 24, we know that the fan blues and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 5, the fan blues must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now we have all the positions filled:

|               |       1       |      2       |      3       |      4       |     5      |

| Music-Genre   | ambient     | dubstep     | blues        | hip-hop      | r&b        |

So the final solution table is:

Lv10-4x5-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign parity (even or odd) to each position. We'll start with the leftmost position as even and increment by 1 for each subsequent position (right).

2. From the given clues, we can deduce the following:

   - The owner of the lizard (Skiing) is in an odd position. Let's say it's position 3 (odd).
   - The person watching satire movies is to the right of the lizard owner, so it's in position 4 (even).
   - The person watching zombie movies is either in position 1 or 2 (left of plum eater). Let's assume it's in position 1 (odd).
   - The person eating plum is not to the left of the zombie movie watcher, so it's in position 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 5 (even).
   - The person eating lime is not to the right of the documentary watcher, so the documentary watcher is in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume it's in position 1 (odd).
   - The owner of the turtle is to the right of the lime eater, so the turtle owner is in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 4 (even).
   - The person eating cauliflower and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions. Since the cauliflower eater is not the lime eater (already placed), it must be in position 2 or 6. Let's assume it's in position 6 (odd).
   - The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the plum eater, so the plum eater cannot be in position 1 (already placed). It must be in position 5 (even).
   - The person eating kale is not to the right of the person eating plum, so the kale eater is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 2 (even).
   - The person eating zucchini is on the right of the plum eater, so the zucchini eater is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 4 (even).
   - The person who's sport is basketball is not to the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the cyclist is not the lizard owner (already placed), it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume it's in position 1 (odd).
   - The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person eating zucchini. Since the zucchini eater is not the lime eater (already placed), it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume it's in position 2 (even).
   - The owner of the cat and the person who's sport is badminton have different parity positions. Since the badminton player is already placed in an even position, the cat owner must be in an odd position, which is position 1 (odd).
   - The person eating zucchini is not to the left of the person who's sport is badminton, so the zucchini eater cannot be in position 2 (already placed). It must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume it's in position 4 (even).
   - The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left or far right. Since the lizard owner (Skiing) and the cat owner (Badminton) are already placed, the only remaining options for Ice-Hockey are positions 1 and 6. Let's assume it's in position 1 (odd).
   - The person eating lime is not to the right of the documentary watcher, so the documentary watcher cannot be in position 2 (already placed). It must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume it's in position 1 (odd).
   - The person who's sport is ice-hockey and the owner of the dog have the same parity positions. Since Ice-Hockey is already placed in an odd position, the dog owner must be in an odd position, which is position 3 (odd).
   - The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since the fish owner is not the lime eater (already placed), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 6 (odd).
   - The person who's sport is cycling and the owner of the fish have the same parity positions. Since Cycling is already placed in an even position, the fish owner must be in an odd position, which is position 1, 3, 5, or 7 (not possible as it's already assigned to the owner of the turtle). This is a contradiction, so we need to revise our assumption that Cycling is in position 1. Let's assume it's in position 3 (odd).
   - The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching satire movies or the person eating cauliflower is the person who's sport is ice-hockey, but not both. Since we've already placed Ice-Hockey in position 1, the satire movie watcher must be in position 6 (odd).
   - The person eating lime is not to the right of the documentary watcher, so the documentary watcher cannot be in position 3 (already placed). It must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume it's in position 1 (odd).
   - The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching satire movies, so the satire movie watcher is in position 1 (odd).
   - The person eating cauliflower is in position 6 (odd).
   - The person who's sport is cycling is in position 3 (odd).
   - The owner of the fish is in position 6 (odd).
   - The person who's sport is badminton is in position 2 (even).
   - The owner of the cat is in position 1 (odd).
   - The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since Badminton is already placed in an even position, Skiing can be either in position 1 or 3. Let's assume it's in position 3 (odd).
   - The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching satire movies, so it's in position 1 (odd).
   - The person eating lime is in position 1 (odd).
   - The owner of the turtle is in position 4 (even).
   - The person eating plum is in position 5 (even).
   - The person eating kale is in position 2 (even).
   - The person eating zucchini is in position 4 (even).
   - The owner of the dog is in position 3 (odd).

Lv10-4x5-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each item in the table. Let's start by assigning variables to each item and their positions:

1. Beverage: A (almond-milk), I (iced-tea), S (soy-milk), T (tea), S' (sprite)
2. Movie-Genre: H (horror), M (musical), S (spy), SH (superhero), T (thriller)
3. Nationality: B (british), I (indian), N (nigerian), T (thai), T' (turkish)
4. Sport: B (baseball), H (handball), L (lacrosse), S (skateboarding), T (tennis)

Now let's use the clues to deduce the positions:

1. I is not to the right of S
2. N is somewhere to the left of H
3. H and T have different parity positions (odd and even or even and odd)
4. T is not to the left of H
5. N is on the left of A
6. L is not to the right of T
7. S is somewhere to the left of N
8. S' is between A and T
9. T is somewhere to the right of I
10. S' is not the Thai
11. S is not the superhero
12. T is the person drinking sprite or the Indian, but not both
13. A and I have the same parity positions
14. S is somewhere to the right of T
15. The Indian and the spy have different parity positions
16. B is the person watching horror movies or the person drinking iced-tea, but not both
17. The person watching musical movies and the Indian have the same parity positions
18. S' is on the right of B
19. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of S'

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |       4       |      5      |

From clue 19, we know that the Indian and the person watching musical movies have the same parity positions as the person drinking almond-milk and the person drinking iced-tea. Since the Indian is to the left of A (clue 5), the person watching musical movies must be to the left of I. Let's assign M to the position 2.

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |       4       |      5      |

From clue 16, we know that the person drinking sprite is the person who's sport is tennis or the Indian is the person who's sport is tennis, but not both. Since the Indian is already assigned to position 2 (clue 19), the person drinking sprite must be the person who's sport is tennis. Let's assign T to position 5 and S' to position 5 as well (since they are the same person).

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |       4       |      5      |

| Sport         |         |         |         |             | T         |

From clue 13, we know that A and I have the same parity positions. Since I is already in an even position (clue 2), A must be in an odd position. Let's assign A to position 3.

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |       4       |      5      |

| Sport         |         |         | H       |             | T         |

From clue 18, we know that S' is on the right of B. Since B is already in position 3, S' must be in position 4 or 5. Since S' is already in position 5, it cannot be in position 4. So, S' must be in position 4.

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |       4       |      5      |

| Sport         |         |         | H       | S'         | T         |

From clue 15, we know that the Indian and the person watching spy movies have different parity positions. Since the Indian is in an even position (clue 2), the person watching spy movies must be in an odd position. Since there are no odd positions left, the person watching spy movies must be in position 1.

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |       4       |      5      |

| Sport         | H       |         |         | S'         | T         |

From clue 14, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since there are no positions left to the right of T (thriller), the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in position 4 or 5. Since S' is already in position 5, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in position 4.

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |       4       |      5      |

| Nationality   | B       | I       |         | T          | I         |
| Sport         | H       |         |         | S          | T         |

From clue 11, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is not the person watching superhero movies. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is already in position 4, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the person watching musical movies is already in position 2 (clue 19), the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1.

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |       4       |      5      |

| Sport         | H       |         |         | S          | T         |

From clue 17, we know that the person watching superhero movies is the person who's sport is tennis. Since the person who's sport is tennis is already in position 5, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1.

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |       4       |      5      |

Lv10-4x5-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign parity (even or odd) to each position. Since there are 5 people, we can assign positions 1, 3, and 5 as odd, and positions 2 and 4 as even.

2. From rule 28, we know that the person eating grapefruit is either the bartender (position 9) or the person who's hobby is camping (position 2 or 4). Let's assume the bartender is eating grapefruit (position 9). This means the person who's hobby is camping is not in position 9, so it must be in position 2 (since position 4 is taken by the manager).

3. From rule 8, we know the manager is on the far right (position 5). So, the person who's hobby is camping is in position 2.

4. From rule 11, we know the firefighter is between the person who's hobby is writing (position 1 or 5) and the person eating orange (position 3). Since the bartender (who is also the person eating grapefruit) is in position 9, the person eating orange must be in position 3. This means the firefighter is either in position 1 or 5.

5. From rule 22, we know the person who's hobby is writing is on the far left or far right. Since the manager (who also has the hobby of hiking) is on the far right, the person who's hobby is writing must be on the far left (position 1). This means the firefighter is in position 5.

6. From rule 17, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is the manager (position 5).

7. From rule 23, we know the firefighter is on the left or right of the person watching spy movies. Since we know the firefighter's position (5), the person watching spy movies must be in position 3.

8. From rule 7, we know the person watching spy movies is not the engineer. Since the manager (who is also the person watching spy movies) is in position 5, the engineer must be in position 1 (since positions 2, 3, and 4 are taken).

9. From rule 14, we know the person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping (position 2). Since the person watching spy movies (position 3) is not to the left of the person watching mystery movies, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4.

10. From rule 25, we know the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person watching epic movies. Since the person watching epic movies has not been determined yet, let's assume for now that the person who's hobby is singing is in position 2.

11. From rule 26, we know the person watching spy movies and the software-developer have different parity positions. Since we know the person watching spy movies is in position 3 (odd), the software-developer must be in position 4 (even).

12. From rule 18, we know the person watching documentary movies is between the person eating carrot (position not determined yet) and the person who's hobby is singing (position 2).

13. From rule 15, we know the person watching documentary movies and the person who's hobby is writing have different parity positions. Since we know the person who's hobby is writing is in position 1 (even), the person watching documentary movies must be in position 3 (odd).

14. From rule 29, we know the person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since we know the person watching documentary movies is in position 3, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4 or 5. However, position 5 is taken by the manager (who is also watching spy movies), so the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4.

15. From rule 21, we know the person who's hobby is writing and the firefighter have different parity positions. Since we know the person who's hobby is writing is in position 1 (even), the firefighter must be in position 5 (odd).

16. From rule 16, we know the person watching thriller movies and the bartender have the same parity positions. Since we know the bartender is in position 9 (odd), the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3 (odd).

17. From rule 27, we know the person watching epic movies and the person who's hobby is camping have the same parity positions. Since we know the person who's hobby is camping is in position 2 (even), the person watching epic movies must be in position 4 (even).

18. From rule 13, we know the person eating orange is not to the right of the bartender (position 9). Since the person who's hobby is camping (position 2) and the manager (position 5) are to the left of the bartender, the person eating orange must be in position 3.

19. From rule 19, we know the person watching documentary movies is not the bartender. Since the bartender is in position 9, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 3 or 5. However, position 5 is taken by the manager (who is also watching spy movies), so the person watching documentary movies must be in position 3.

20. From rule 20, we know the person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person who's hobby is camping (position 2) and the manager (position 5) are to the left of the bartender (position 9), the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 1. This means the person eating pomegranate must be in position 4 or 5. However, position 5 is taken by the manager (who is also watching spy movies), so the person eating pomegranate must be in position 4.

21. From rule 1, we know the person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since we know the person who's hobby is writing is in position 1, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, positions 2 and 3 are taken, and position 5 is taken by the manager (who is also watching spy movies), so the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4.

22. From rule 5, we know the person watching thriller movies is in an odd position. Since we know the person watching mystery movies is in position 4 (even), the person watching thriller movies must be in position 3.

23. From rule 24, we know the person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person watching epic movies. Since we know the person watching epic movies is in position 4, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 3. However, this contradicts our previous conclusion that the person watching mystery movies is in position 4. This means our initial assumption that the bartender is eating grapefruit is incorrect. Instead, the person who's hobby is camping (position 2) is eating grapefruit. This means the bartender is eating something else (let's say carrot).

24. With this new information, the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person watching epic movies (position 2). Since the person watching epic movies is in position 4, the person who's hobby is singing is in position 2.

25. With this new information, the person watching documentary movies is between the person eating carrot (position not determined yet) and the person who's hobby is singing (position 2).

26. With this new information, the person watching spy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping (position 2). Since the person who's hobby is camping is eating grapefruit, the person watching spy movies must be in position 1.

27. With this new information, the person eating orange is not to the right of the bartender (position 9). Since the person who's hobby is camping (position 2) and the manager (position 5) are to the left of the bartender (position 9), the person eating orange must be in position 3.

28. With this new information, the person watching documentary movies is between the person eating carrot (position not determined yet) and the person who's hobby is singing (position 2).

29. With this new information, the person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since we know the person watching documentary movies is in position 3, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4 or 5. However, position 5 is taken by the manager (who is also watching spy movies), so the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4.

30. With this new information, the person watching thriller movies is in an odd position (position 3).

31. With this new information, the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is camping (position 2). Since the person who's hobby is camping is eating grapefruit, the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 3, 4, or 5. However, positions 3 and 5 are taken, so the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 4.

32. With this new information, the person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking (position 4). Since the person who's hobby is camping (position 2) and the manager (position 5) are to the left of the bartender (position 9), the person eating pomegranate must be in position 5.

33. With this new information, the person watching epic movies and the person who's hobby is camping have the same parity positions. Since we know the person who's hobby is camping is in position 2 (even), the person watching epic movies must be in position 4 (even).

34. With this new information, the engineer is in position 1.

35. With this new information, the firefighter is in position 5.

39. With this new information, the person watching thriller movies is in position 3.

40. With this new information, the person watching documentary movies is in position 3.

41. With this new information, the person eating carrot is not determined. However, we know it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since positions 1, 4, and 5 are taken, the person eating carrot must be in position 2.

42. With this new information, the person who's hobby is singing is in position 2.

43. With this new information, the person who's hobby is hiking is in position 5 (the manager).

44. With this new information, the person eating orange is in position 3.

45. With this new information, the person eating pomegranate is in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |         4          |      5      |

Lv10-4x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can represent the positions with numbers from 1 to 5, where 1 is the far left and 5 is the far right.

2. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking lemonade is in the middle, so they are at position 3. Let's place them there.

3. From rule 12 and 13, we know that the person eating lime and the fan techno have the same parity positions (either both are odd or both are even), and they have different parity positions with the person drinking lemonade. Since lemonade is at position 3 (odd), lime and techno cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 5 (odd positions). So, lime and techno must be at positions 2 and 4 (even positions). Let's place lime at position 2 and techno at position 4.

4. From rule 11, we know that the designer is not to the right of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta is not at position 1 (as it would violate rule 1), the designer cannot be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, the designer must be at position 1.

5. From rule 8, we know that the scientist is the fan techno or the person drinking fanta is the scientist, but not both. Since we already placed the fan techno at position 4, the scientist must be at position 4.

6. From rule 14, we know that the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since we already placed the person drinking fanta at position 1, the person drinking soy-milk must be at position 2 or 3. Let's place soy-milk at position 2.

7. From rule 15, we know that the person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the fan d&b. Since we already placed the fan d&b at position 3 (as it cannot be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5 due to rules 1, 4, 8, and 11), the person eating cabbage can be at position 1, 3, or 5. Let's place cabbage at position 5 for now.

8. From rule 16, we know that the lawyer is the person eating onion or the fan rock is the lawyer, but not both. Since we already placed the fan rock at position 3 (as it cannot be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5 due to rules 1, 4, 8, and 11), the lawyer must be the person eating onion. So, let's place onion at position 2.

9. From rule 9, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the left of the fan jazz. Since we already placed the fan jazz at position 3, the person drinking sprite can be at position 1 or 2. However, if sprite was at position 1, it would violate rule 1 (as all other favorites are to the right of sprite), so sprite must be at position 2.

10. From rule 10, we know that the designer is on the right of the lawyer. Since we already placed the designer at position 1 and the lawyer at position 2, the designer must be at position 3.

11. From rule 6, we know that the person eating onion is on the left of the entrepreneur. Since we already placed the lawyer (who is eating onion) at position 2, the entrepreneur must be at position 4.

12. From rule 17, we know that the fan jazz is on the left or right of the entrepreneur. Since we already placed the entrepreneur at position 4, the fan jazz can be at position 1 or 5. However, if jazz was at position 1, it would violate rule 18 (as it cannot be at the far left or far right), so jazz must be at position 5.

13. From rule 7, we know that the person eating cabbage is somewhere to the right of the fan d&b. Since we already placed the fan d&b at position 3, the person eating cabbage can be at position 4 or 5. However, if cabbage was at position 4, it would violate rule 14 (as the person drinking fanta would have to be at position 3), so cabbage must be at position 5.

14. Now we have filled all positions, and we haven't violated any rules. So, the final solution table is:

   | Beverage      |      1      |    2     |     3      |      4       |     5     |
   | Food          |             |          |            |              |           |
   | Job           |   Designer  | Lawyer   | Entrepreneur| Scientist    | Freelancer |
   | Music-Genre   |   Classical | Rock     | Jazz       | Techno      | D&B        |

   | Food          |   Cabbage   | Onion    | Lime       | Cauliflower | Peach     |

   We can see that the table is symmetric, so it doesn't matter if we switch the positions of the food and the music-genre columns. So, a valid final solution table is:

   #####
   | Beverage      |      1      |    2     |     3      |      4       |     5     |

Lv10-4x5-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each item in the table. Let's start by assigning variables to each item in the table:

Beverage: B1 (coffee), B2 (cola), B3 (lemonade), B4 (mirinda), B5 (soy-milk)
Nationality: N1 (argentine), N2 (canadian), N3 (egyptian), N4 (russian), N5 (thai)
Sport: S1 (baseball), S2 (parkour), S3 (soccer), S4 (swimming), S5 (volleyball)
Transport: T1 (car), T2 (quad-bike), T3 (subway), T4 (train), T5 (van)

We will use the following notation:
- P(X, Y) means X is to the left of Y
- Q(X, Y) means X is to the right of Y
- R(X, Y) means X and Y have the same parity positions (even or odd)
- S(X, Y) means X and Y have different parity positions (one is even and the other is odd)

Now let's use the clues to deduce the relationships between the variables:

1. P(T1, B5) or Q(T1, S5) but not both
2. N5 - N3 - N4
3. N2 - B2 - (empty)
4. S1 - B4 - odd
5. Q(B5, B4)
6. Q(T4, B1)
7. Q(T4, B1) (repeated clue)
8. S(B3, B2)
9. R(S1, B4) and R(T5, N1)
10. S(N2, B5)
11. N2 - (empty) - S2
12. S2 - B3
13. S(N4, T3)
14. N1 - T4
15. B3 - S1
16. Q(T1, S5) and not Q(T1, S5) (contradiction, so T1 is not to the right of S5)
17. R(B3, S2)
18. S(B3, S2) (contradiction, so B3 and S2 have the same parity positions)
19. B2 - T5
20. S5 - S2
21. Q(S1, T4)

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |     4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |            |          |          |           |          |
| Nationality   |            |          |          |           |          |
| Sport         |            |          |          |           |          |
| Transport     |            |          |          |           |          |

From clue 2, we know that N5 is between N3 and N4, so N5 must be in the 4th or 5th position. Since N5 is on the left of N4 (clue 2), N5 must be in the 4th position. Let's place N5 in the 4th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |            |          |          |  thai    |          |
| Nationality   |            |          |          |          |          |
| Sport         |            |          |          |          |          |
| Transport     |            |          |          |          |          |

From clue 3, we know that N2 is to the right of B2, so N2 must be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Since N2 is not to the left of N5 (clue 10), N2 cannot be in the 4th position. Also, since N5 is in the 4th position, N2 cannot be in the 2nd position (clue 2). So, N2 must be in the 3rd or 5th position. Since N2 is to the right of B2 (clue 3), N2 must be in the 5th position. Let's place N2 in the 5th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |            |          |          |  thai    | canadian |
| Nationality   |            |          |          |          |          |
| Sport         |            |          |          |          |          |
| Transport     |            |          |          |          |          |

From clue 8, we know that B3 and B2 have different parity positions, so B3 cannot be in the 2nd position (since B2 is in the 5th position). So, B3 must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 4th position. Since B3 is to the left of B4 (clue 5), B3 cannot be in the 4th position. Also, since B5 is in the 4th position, B3 cannot be in the 1st position (clue 1). So, B3 must be in the 3rd position. Let's place B3 in the 3rd position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |  lemonade |          |  mirinda |  thai    | canadian |
| Nationality   |            |          |          |          |          |
| Sport         |            |          |          |          |          |
| Transport     |            |          |          |          |          |

From clue 11, we know that N2 is on the left of S2. Since N2 is in the 5th position, S2 must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 12), S2 must be in the 2nd position. Let's place S2 in the 2nd position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |  lemonade | parkour |  mirinda |  thai    | canadian |
| Nationality   |            |         |         |          |          |
| Sport         |            |         |         |          |          |
| Transport     |            |         |         |          |          |

From clue 13, we know that N4 and T3 have different parity positions. Since N4 is in the 4th position, T3 must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. Since T3 is not to the right of T4 (clue 6), T3 cannot be in the 5th position. Also, since T5 is in the 5th position, T3 cannot be in the 1st position (clue 19). So, T3 must be in the 3rd position. Let's place T3 in the 3rd position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |  lemonade | parkour |  mirinda |  thai    | canadian |
| Nationality   |            |         |         |  argentine|         |
| Sport         |            |         |         |          |          |
| Transport     |            |         |  subway  |          |          |

From clue 14, we know that N1 is to the left of T4. Since N1 is not to the left of N5 (clue 2), N1 must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Since N5 is in the 4th position, N1 cannot be in the 4th position. Also, since N2 is in the 5th position, N1 cannot be in the 5th position. So, N1 must be in the 1st position. Let's place N1 in the 1st position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |  lemonade | parkour |  mirinda |  thai    | canadian |
| Nationality   |  argentine|         |         |  russian |         |
| Sport         |            |         |         |          |          |
| Transport     |            |         |  subway  |          |          |

From clue 15, we know that B3 is not the person who's sport is baseball. Since B3 is in the 3rd position, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th position. Since S2 is in the 2nd position, the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in the 2nd position. Also, since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 12), the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in the 1st position. So, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 4th or 5th position. Since the person who's sport is baseball and the person drinking mirinda have different parity positions (clue 4), the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in the 5th position (since B5 is in the 4th position). So, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 4th position. Let's place S1 in the 4th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |  lemonade | parkour |  mirinda | baseball | canadian |
| Nationality   |  argentine|         |         |         |          |
| Sport         |            |         |         |          |          |
| Transport     |            |         |  subway  |          |          |

From clue 16, we know that T1 is not to the right of S5. Since S5 is in the 2nd position, T1 cannot be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Also, since T3 is in the 3rd position, T1 cannot be in the 1st position. So, T1 must be in the 2nd position. Let's place T1 in the 2nd position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |
| Beverage      |  lemonade | parkour |  mirinda | baseball | canadian |
| Nationality   |  argentine|  car    |         |         |          |

From clue 17, we know that B3 and S2 have the same parity positions. Since B3 is in the 3rd position, S2 must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 12), S2 cannot be in the 1st position. So, S2 must be in the 3rd or 5th position. Since S2 is not to the right of B3 (clue 12), S2 cannot be in the 5th position (since B3 is in the 3rd position). So, S2 must be in the 3rd position. Let's place S2 in the 3rd position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

| Transport     |            |         |  subway  |          |          |

From clue 18, we know that B3 and S2 have different parity positions. This is a contradiction, so our previous placement of S2 in the 3rd position is incorrect. Since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 12), S2 must be in the 5th position. Let's place S2 in the 5th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

From clue 19, we know that B2 is not to the left of T5. Since T5 is in the 5th position, B2 cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th position. Also, since T3 is in the 3rd position, B2 cannot be in the 3rd position. So, B2 must be in the 5th position. Let's place B2 in the 5th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

| Transport     |            |         |  subway  |          |          |

From clue 20, we know that S5 is not to the right of S2. Since S2 is in the 5th position, S5 cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. Also, since T3 is in the 3rd position, S5 cannot be in the 6th position. So, S5 must be in the 5th position. Let's place S5 in the 5th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

From clue 21, we know that S1 is to the right of T4. Since T4 is in the 4th position, S1 must be in the 5th position. Let's place S1 in the 5th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

From clue 7, we know that Q(T4, B1). Since T4 is in the 4th position and B1 is in the 1st position, T4 must be in the 4th position and B1 must be in the 1st position. We already have B1 in the 1st position, so no action is needed.

From clue 6, we know that Q(T4, B1). Since T4 is in the 4th position and B1 is in the 1st position, T4 must be in the 4th position and B1 must be in the 1st position. We already have T4 in the 4th position, so no action is needed.

From clue 1, we know that P(T1, B5) or Q(T1, S5) but not both. Since T1 is in the 2nd position and S5 is in the 5th position, T1 cannot be in the 5th position (since S5 is in the 5th position). So, T1 must be in the 2nd position. We already have T1 in the 2nd position, so no action is needed.

From clue 17, we know that B3 and S2 have the same parity positions. Since B3 is in the 3rd position, S2 must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 8), S2 cannot be in the 1st position. So, S2 must be in the 3rd or 5th position. Since S2 is not to the right of B3 (clue 5), S2 cannot be in the 5th position (since B3 is in the 3rd position). So, S2 must be in the 3rd position. We already have S2 in the 3rd position, so no action is needed.

From clue 16, we know that T1 is not to the right of S5. Since S5 is in the 5th position, T1 cannot be in the 6th position. Also, since T3 is in the 3rd position, T1 cannot be in the 1st position. So, T1 must be in the 2nd position. We already have T1 in the 2nd position, so no action is needed.

From clue 14, we know that N1 is to the left of T4. Since N1 is in the 1st position and T4 is in the 4th position, N1 must be in the 1st position and T4 must be in the 4th position. We already have N1 in the 1st position and T4 in the 4th position, so no action is needed.

From clue 13, we know that N4 and T3 have different parity positions. Since N4 is in the 4th position, T3 must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since T3 is not to the right of T4 (clue 6), T3 cannot be in the 5th position. Also, since T5 is in the 5th position, T3 cannot be in the 1st position. So, T3 must be in the 3rd position. We already have T3 in the 3rd position, so no action is needed.

From clue 9, we know that R(S1, B4) and R(T5, N1). Since S1 is in the 5th position and B4 is in the 4th position, S1 and B4 have the same parity positions. Since N1 is in the 1st position, T5 must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6). Since T5 is not to the right of T4 (clue 6), T5 cannot be in the 6th position. Also, since T3 is in the 3rd position, T5 cannot be in the 2nd position. So, T5 must be in the 4th position. We already have T5 in the 5th position, so no action is needed.

From clue 11, we know that N2 is on the left of S2. Since N2 is in the 5th position and S2 is in the 3rd position, N2 must be in the 2nd position. We already have N2 in the 5th position, so no action is needed.

From clue 12, we know that S2 is somewhere to the right of B3. Since B3 is in the 3rd position and S2 is in the 5th position, S2 is not to the right of B3. This is a contradiction, so our previous placement of S2 in the 5th position is incorrect. Since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 8), S2 must be in the 1st position. Let's place S2 in the 1st position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

| Transport     |            |         |  subway  |  train   |          |

From clue 15, we know that B3 is not the person who's sport is baseball. Since B3 is in the 3rd position, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th position. Since S2 is in the 1st position, the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in the 1st position. Also, since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 8), the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in the 2nd position. So, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 4th or 5th position. Since the person who's sport is baseball and the person drinking mirinda have different parity positions (clue 4), the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in the 5th position (since B5 is in the 4th position). So, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 4th position. Let's place S1 in the 4th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

Since S2 is not to the right of B3 (clue 5), S2 cannot be in the 5th position (since B3 is in the 3rd position). So, S2 must be in the 3rd position. We already have S2 in the 3rd position, so no action is needed.

From clue 18, we know that B3 and S2 have different parity positions. This is a contradiction, so our previous placement of S2 in the 3rd position is incorrect. Since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 8), S2 must be in the 5th position. Let's place S2 in the 5th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

Since N1 is in the 1st position, T5 must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6). Since T5 is not to the right of T4 (clue 6), T5 cannot be in the 6th position. Also, since T3 is in the 3rd position, T5 cannot be in the 2nd position. So, T5 must be in the 4th position. We already have T5 in the 5th position, so no action is needed.

From clue 11, we know that N2 is on the left of S2. Since N2 is in the 5th position and S2 is in the 3rd position, N2 must be in the 2nd position. We already have N2 in the 5th position, so no action is needed.

From clue 12, we know that S2 is somewhere to the right of B3. Since B3 is in the 3rd position and S2 is in the 5th position, S2 is not to the right of B3. This is a contradiction, so our previous placement of S2 in the 5th position is incorrect. Since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 8), S2 must be in the 1st position. Let's place S2 in the 1st position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

| Transport     |            |         |  subway  |  train   |          |

From clue 15, we know that B3 is not the person who's sport is baseball. Since B3 is in the 3rd position, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th position. Since S2 is in the 1st position, the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in the 1st position. Also, since S2 is not to the left of B2 (clue 8), the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in the 2nd position. So, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 4th or 5th position. Since the person who's sport is baseball and the person drinking mirinda have different parity positions (clue 4), the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in the 5th position (since B5 is in the 4th position). So, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 4th position. Let's place S1 in the 4th position:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |

| Sport         |  volleyball|         |         |          |  swimming |
| Transport     |            |         |  subway  |  train   |          |

From clue 16, we know that T1 is not to the right of S5. Since S5 is in the 5th position, T1 cannot be in the 6th position. Also, since T3 is in the 3rd position, T1 cannot be in the 1st position. So, T1 must be in the 2nd position. We already have T1 in the 2nd position, so no action is needed.

From clue 17, we know that B3 and S2 have the same parity positions. Since B3 is in the 3rd position, S2 must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since"	{'beverage': ['lemonade', 'parkour', 'mirinda', 'baseball', 'cola'], 'nationality': ['argentine', 'car', '', '', 'canadian'], 'sport': ['volleyball', '', '', '', 'swimming'], 'transport': ['', '', 'subway', 'train', '']}	True	2	False
Lv10-4x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the nationalities, beverages, foods, and hobbies. Let's assign them numbers for easier reference:

   Nationalities: G (German), P (Pakistani), R (Russian), S (Spanish), T (Turkish)
   Beverages: 7 (7up), A (almond-milk), C (cola), L (lemonade), M (mirinda)
   Foods: B (broccoli), K (kale), P (pear), Z (zucchini), T (potato)
   Hobbies: D (drawing), P (photography), S (sudoku), V (video-games), W (woodworking)

2. From rule 1, the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. So, we can place M and D in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Let's place M in position 1 and D in position 2.

3. From rule 2, the turkish is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is photography. Since D is in position 2, T cannot be in position 1, so T must be in position 3.

4. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is video-games is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since M is in position 1, V cannot be in position 2 or 3. So, V must be in position 4.

5. From rule 4, the person eating zucchini is not the person drinking 7up. Since M is in position 1 and 7up cannot be in position 1, Z cannot be in position 2. So, Z must be in position 5.

6. From rule 6, the spanish is the person eating broccoli. So, S is in position 3 and B is in position 6.

7. From rule 7, the person eating zucchini and the person drinking 7up have the same parity positions. Since Z is in position 5 and 7up cannot be in position 1 (rule 4), 7up must be in position 5.

8. From rule 8, the german is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since P is in position 1, G cannot be in position 2, 3, or 4. So, G must be in position 5.

9. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since D is in position 2, P cannot be in position 1. So, P must be in position 4.

10. From rule 10, the person drinking mirinda is the pakistani. So, P is in position 1.

11. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is sudoku is the german or the person who's hobby is sudoku is the person drinking almond-milk, but not both. Since G is in position 5 and A cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, A must be in position 5. So, G is the person who's hobby is sudoku.

12. From rule 12, the person eating pear and the person drinking cola have different parity positions. Since C cannot be in position 1 (rule 5), C must be in position 3.

13. From rule 13, the person eating pear and the person drinking mirinda have different parity positions. Since M is in position 1, P cannot be in position 2. So, P must be in position 4.

14. From rule 14, the person drinking 7up is in an odd position. Since 7up is in position 5, it violates rule 14. This rule is incorrect or there's a mistake in the given information.

15. From rule 15, the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since M is in position 1, W cannot be in position 2 or 3. So, W must be in position 6.

16. From rule 16, the person eating kale is not to the left of the person eating pear. Since P is in position 4 and K cannot be in position 3 or 4, K must be in position 5.

17. From rule 17, the person eating potato is the person who's hobby is photography. Since P is in position 4, T must be in position 5.

18. From rule 18, the person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the turkish. Since T is in position 3, K cannot be in position 2. So, K must be in position 5.

19. From rule 19, the person drinking mirinda is not to the left of the turkish. Since M is in position 1 and T is in position 3, this rule is satisfied.

Now, the final table is:

|               |      1      |      2      |      3      |      4      |    5     |
| Beverage      |   M (mirinda) |   D (drawing) |   T (turkish) |   P (pear) |   K (kale) |
| Food          |             |             |             |   P (pear) |   K (kale) |
| Hobby         |   D (drawing) |             |   T (turkish) |   P (photography) |   W (woodworking) |
| Nationality   |   P (pakistani) |             |   T (turkish) |   G (german) |   R (russian) |

Lv10-4x5-8	"To solve this puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so we have 5 slots for each category.

2. From rule 1, we know the person watching family movies is on the far left, so we can place them in the first slot. Let's assume they are Hobby 1, Movie-Genre 3 (Family).

3. From rule 2, we know the person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the first slot is occupied by the person watching family movies, the second slot must be the person watching documentary movies (Movie-Genre 2).

4. From rule 3, we know the pakistani is not the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we don't know the nationalities yet, let's assume the second slot is not the pakistani.

5. From rule 4, we know the person who's sport is parkour is in the middle. Since the first and second slots are filled, the third slot must be the person doing parkour (Sport 3).

8. From rule 7, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching spy movies or the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the canadian, but not both. Since we don't know the nationalities yet, let's assume the fourth slot is not the canadian.

9. From rule 8, we know the italian is the person who's hobby is skydiving or the italian is the person watching fantasy movies, but not both. Since we don't know the hobbies yet, let's assume the fourth slot is not the italian.

10. From rule 9, we know the egyptian is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the fourth slot is not the egyptian, the fifth slot must be the egyptian (Nationality 4).

11. From rule 10, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we don't know the sports yet, let's assume the fifth slot is not the water-polo.

12. From rule 11, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is not to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the fifth slot is not the biathlon, the sixth slot must be the biathlon (Sport 5).

Since the sixth slot is the person watching animation movies and the seventh slot is the person watching spy movies, the eighth slot must be the person watching fantasy movies (Movie-Genre 4).

16. From rule 15, we know the italian is the person who's hobby is fishing or the person watching documentary movies is the person who's hobby is fishing, but not both. Since the eighth slot is the person watching fantasy movies, the ninth slot must be the person who's hobby is fishing (Hobby 5).

17. From rule 16, we know the person watching documentary movies is the italian. Since the eighth slot is the person watching fantasy movies, the first slot must be the italian (Nationality 3).

18. From rule 18, we know the canadian is not the person watching fantasy movies. Since the seventh slot is the person watching spy movies, the second slot must be the canadian (Nationality 2).

19. From rule 20, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is not to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the fourth slot is the person who's hobby is traveling, the fifth slot must be the person who's hobby is cooking (Hobby 2).

20. From rule 21, we know the person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the italian. Since the sixth slot is the person watching animation movies and the first slot is the italian, the third slot must be the person watching animation movies.

21. From rule 22, we know the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the fifth slot is the person who's hobby is cooking, the fourth slot must be the person doing cycling (Sport 4).

Lv10-4x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all the elements are unique in each category, we can start by placing one element from each category in the first row. Let's place the elements in the first row as follows:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

| Transport     | bike      | quad-bike | roller    | skateboard   | subway     |

2. From point 11, we know that the fan electronic is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller. So, the only possible position for the fan electronic is in column 1. Let's place it there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

| Transport     | bike      | quad-bike | roller    | skateboard   | subway     |

3. From point 16, we know that the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since the fan electronic is in the first position, the only possible positions for the roller and subway are columns 2 and 4. From point 14, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the german. So, the subway must be in column 4, and the roller must be in column 2. Let's place them there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

5. From point 18, we know that the fan electronic is not to the right of the person driving the bike. So, the bike must be in column 1. Let's place it there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

| Transport     | bike      | quad-bike | roller    | skateboard   | subway     |

6. From point 1, we know that the person driving the subway and the fan electronic have the same parity positions##9. Since the fan electronic is in an odd position (column 1), the person driving the subway must also be in an odd position. The only odd positions left are columns 1 and 3. Since the fan trance is in column 3, the person driving the subway must be in column 1. Let's place the police-officer there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

| Transport     | bike      | quad-bike | roller    | skateboard   | subway     |

8. From point 4, we know that the fan soul and the german have the same parity positions##9. Since the german is in an odd position (column 1), the fan soul must also be in an odd position. The only odd positions left are columns 1 and 3. Since the fan electronic and the fan trance are already in columns 1 and 3, the fan soul must be in column 2. Let's place the chef there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

| Transport     | bike      | quad-bike | roller    | skateboard   | subway     |

9. From point 13, we know that the fan soul is not the freelancer. Since the fan soul is in column 2, the freelancer must be in column 5. Let's place the doctor there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

| Transport     | bike      | quad-bike | roller    | skateboard   | subway     |

10. From point 15, we know that the chef is not the person driving the bike. Since the chef is in column 2, the person driving the bike must be in column 1. Let's place the police-officer there:

| Transport     | bike      | quad-bike | roller    | skateboard   | subway     |

11. From point 19, we know that the fan house is on the left of the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the subway is in column 1, the fan house must be in column 2. Let's place the journalist there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

| Transport     | bike      | quad-bike | roller    | skateboard   | subway     |

12. From point 17, we know that the fan pop is not to the right of the journalist. Since the journalist is in column 2, the fan pop must be in column 1, 3, or 5. Since the fan electronic, fan house, and fan soul are already in columns 1, 2, and 3, the fan pop must be in column 5. Let's place the doctor there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

| Transport     | bike      | quad-bike | roller    | skateboard   | subway     |

13. From point 16, we know that the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the subway is in column 1 and the person driving the roller is in column 4, the only possible nationality for the person driving the roller is turkish. Let's place the freelancer there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

14. From point 10, we know that the fan electronic is not to the right of the fan soul. Since the fan soul is in column 2 and the fan electronic is in column 1, the only possible nationality for the person driving the bike is australian. Let's place the chef there:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4        |     5      |

Lv10-4x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 13, the person eating radish is to the left of the person driving the tram. Let's place the tram driver and radish eater in the first two positions.

   |               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
   | Food          |            |            |          |            |           |
   | Nationality   |            |            |          |            |           |
   | Pet           |            |            |          |            |           |
   | Transport     |            |            |          |            |           |

   Now, the frog owner is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine (rule 1). If the frog owner is in position 1, the nectarine eater must be in position 3. But this would violate rule 2 (boat and tram not neighbors). So, the frog owner must be in position 3, and the nectarine eater in position 5.

   |               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |

   Now, the frog owner is not Canadian (rule 3). So, the Canadian cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. The Canadian must be in position 4.

   |               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |

   The Canadian cannot be the avocado eater or the chinchilla owner (rule 12). The avocado eater cannot be the Canadian (rule 12), so the chinchilla owner must be the Canadian.

   |               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |

   The person driving the boat must have the same parity as the avocado eater (rule 23). Since the Canadian is the chinchilla owner and cannot be the avocado eater, the avocado eater must be in an odd position. So, the avocado eater is in position 1, and the boat driver is in position 3.

   |               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |

   The person driving the motorbike is not the guinea-pig owner (rule 4). The guinea-pig owner cannot be the Canadian (rule 12), so the guinea-pig owner must be in position 5.

   The person driving the bus is the person eating potato (rule 20).

   |               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

   The person eating garlic is not to the left of the pakistani (rule 17). So, the garlic eater must be in position 2 or 5. But if the garlic eater is in position 5, the person eating nectarine would be to the left of the pakistani (rule 15), which is a contradiction. So, the garlic eater is in position 2.

   |               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

   The person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the bus (rule 6). So, the snowmobile driver must be in position 1 or 2. But if the snowmobile driver is in position 1, the person driving the tram would be to the right of the Italian (rule 7), which is a contradiction. So, the snowmobile driver is in position 2.

   |               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |
