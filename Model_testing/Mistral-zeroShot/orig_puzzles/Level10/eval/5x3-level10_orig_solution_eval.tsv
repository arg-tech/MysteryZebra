Lv10-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can represent their positions as A (1st), B (2nd), and C (3rd).

2. Let's assign the beverages: Cola (C), Soy-milk (B), Tea (A) based on condition 10 and 13.

3. Now let's assign the hobbies: Card-games (C), Filmmaking (A), Video-games (B) based on conditions 8, 11, and 12.

4. Let's assign the jobs: Architect (A), Fisherman (C), Police-officer (B) based on conditions 1, 3, 6, and 7.

5. Now let's assign the nationalities: Chinese (A), French (B), Spanish (C) based on condition 4.

6. Finally, let's assign the transport: Airplane (A), Motorbike (C), Tram (B) based on conditions 2, 5, and 9.

Lv10-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the positions with odd numbers are golf and d&b (given in point 1), we can place them in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since there are 3 different movie-genres). Let's place golf in position 1 and d&b in position 3 for now.

2. The hedgehog owner is on the left or right of the trike driver (point 2). Since we don't know the position of the trike driver yet, we can't place the hedgehog owner yet.

3. The turtle owner is on the right of the fan blues (point 3). Since we don't know the position of the fan blues yet, we can't place the turtle owner yet.

4. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching sports movies (point 4). Since we don't know the position of sports movies yet, we can't place ice-hockey yet.

5. The person watching crime movies is on the far left (point 5). Let's place crime movies in position 1 for now.

6. The fan d&b is not to the right of the person driving the van (point 6). Since we don't know the position of the van yet, we can't place the fan d&b yet.

7. The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby (point 7). Since golf is in position 1, let's place rugby in position 3 for now.

8. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the fan d&b or the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching crime movies, but not both (point 8). Since we can't place ice-hockey yet, we can't use this information yet.

9. The person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the airplane (point 9). Let's place trike in position 2 and airplane in position 4 for now.

10. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far right (point 10). Since we can't place ice-hockey yet, we can't use this information yet.

11. The person driving the airplane is the fan blues (point 11). Since we placed the airplane in position 4, we can place the fan blues in position 4.

Now let's revisit point 8. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the fan d&b or the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching crime movies, but not both. Since we placed ice-hockey in position 5 and crime movies in position 1, the person who's sport is ice-hockey can't be the fan d&b (because they can't be in position 3, which is the only position left for d&b). So, the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be the person watching crime movies.

Now we can place ice-hockey in position 1 (since the person watching crime movies is on the far left), and d&b in position 3.

Since the person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby (point 7), and we placed golf in position 1 and rugby in position 3, golf must be on the left of rugby. So, let's swap them: golf in position 3 and rugby in position 1.

Now we can place sports in position 2. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching sports movies, sports movies must be in position 1. But we already placed ice-hockey in position 1. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Lv10-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 constraints for each category (Food, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Sport, Transport), and each category has 3 unique items. So, each item can have 2 constraints left to be determined.

2. From constraint 6, we know the person eating pepper is on the far left or far right. Since there are 5 positions, this means the person eating pepper must be in position 1 or 5.

3. From constraint 11, the person eating papaya is between the polish and the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the polish is not the first position (from constraint 3), the person eating papaya cannot be in position 1. So, the person eating papaya must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. From constraint 10, the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person eating pepper. Since the person eating papaya is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5, and the person eating pepper is in position 1 or 5, the person eating pepper must be in position 5.

5. Now we know the person eating pepper is in position 5, so the person eating papaya must be in position 2.

6. From constraint 3, the french is somewhere between the thai and the polish. Since the thai is not the first position and the person eating papaya is in position 2, the french must be in position 3.

7. From constraint 9, the polish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the french is in position 3, the polish cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the polish must be in position 4 or 5. If the polish is in position 5, the person who's sport is golf must be in position 1, but this contradicts constraint 8 (the person driving the bike is not to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding). So, the polish must be in position 4.

8. Now we know the polish is in position 4, so the person who's sport is golf must be in position 1.

9. From constraint 5, the person driving the van is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the polish is in position 4 and the person who's sport is golf is in position 1, the person driving the van must be in position 2 or 3.

10. From constraint 8, the person driving the bike is not to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person who's sport is golf is in position 1 and the person driving the van is in position 2 or 3, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in position 4 or 5. But this contradicts constraint 11 (the person eating papaya is between the polish and the person who's sport is snowboarding). So, the person driving the van must be in position 3.

11. Now we know the person driving the van is in position 3, so the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in position 5.

12. From constraint 2, the person who's sport is snowboarding and the person driving the jet-ski have the same parity positions. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 5 and the person driving the jet-ski cannot be in position 1 (from constraint 1), the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 3.

13. From constraint 4, the thai is not the person eating plum. Since the person eating papaya is in position 2 and the person driving the jet-ski is in position 3, the thai must be in position 1 or 4 or 5. But this contradicts constraint 12 (the thai is not the person driving the jet-ski). So, the thai must be in position 4.

14. Now we know the thai is in position 4, so the person eating plum must be in position 5.

15. From constraint 7, the person watching scientific movies is not the person eating pepper. Since the person eating pepper is in position 5 and the person eating plum is in position 5, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But this contradicts constraint 6 (the person eating pepper is on the far left or far right). So, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 2 or 3. But this also contradicts constraint 7 (the person watching scientific movies is not the person eating pepper). There seems to be a contradiction here.

However, if we assume that the person watching scientific movies is in position 2, all other constraints can be satisfied. So, the final solution table would be:

```
|               |      1       |   2    |     3      |

Lv10-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the German is the videographer (from rule 10), we know that the videographer cannot be drinking mirinda (from rule 1, as the German is watching romance movies or is the person drinking mirinda, and we don't want both). So, the videographer must be drinking either juice or hot-chocolate.

2. The German is on the left of the person drinking juice (from rule 2). So, the videographer cannot be on the left of the person drinking juice. Therefore, the videographer must be on the right of the person drinking juice.

3. The person watching western movies is on the right of the videographer (from rule 3). Since the videographer is on the right of the person drinking juice, the person watching western movies must be on the right of the person drinking juice as well.

4. The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate (from rule 7). Since the videographer is on the right of the person drinking juice, and the person watching western movies is on the right of the person drinking juice, the person driving the snowmobile must be on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

5. The person watching western movies is not to the right of the Dutch (from rule 5). Since the person watching western movies is on the right of the person drinking juice, the Dutch must be on the left of the person drinking juice.

6. The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person drinking juice (from rule 6). Since the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, the person drinking juice must be on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

7. The person driving the ship is the person drinking hot-chocolate or the person drinking hot-chocolate is the German (from rule 7). Since the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be the German (as the German is the videographer). Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be driving the ship.

8. The person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the videographer (from rule 8). Since the videographer is the German and the German is on the left of the person drinking juice, the person watching adventure movies must be on the left of the person drinking juice.

9. The librarian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike (from rule 9). Since the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, the person driving the bike must be on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Therefore, the person driving the bike cannot be the person drinking juice (as the person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate). So, the librarian must be the person drinking juice.

10. Now we know the librarian is drinking juice, the videographer is the German, the person watching western movies is on the right of the person drinking juice (German), the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking juice (Librarian), and the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. The only remaining spot for the person driving the bike is the top left, and the only remaining beverage for the person driving the bike is mirinda.

Lv10-5x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different items in each category, so we can fill in the categories with their respective unique items.

2. From rule 1, we know that the fan techno is on the far right. So, techno must be in the third column.

   | Transport     | bike     | helicopter    | jet-ski  |

3. From rule 2, the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. This means helicopter must be in the first column, and swimming must be in the second or third column. Since swimming can't be in the third column (because techno is there), it must be in the second column.

4. From rule 3, the person who's sport is swimming is the fan techno or the owner of the goldfish is the person who's sport is swimming, but not both. Since we already placed swimming in the second column, techno must be in the second row (because it's the fan of techno). This means the person who's sport is swimming is in the first row. But since swimming can't be in the first column (because helicopter is there), it must be in the third column. This means the person who's sport is swimming is in the first row and third column, which contradicts rule 2 (the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming). This means our initial placement of swimming in the second column was incorrect. Swimming must be in the second column, and the person who's sport is swimming is in the first row.

5. From rule 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. This means hot-chocolate can't be in the first column (because bike is there). So, hot-chocolate must be in the second or third column. Since it can't be in the third column (because techno is there), it must be in the second column.

9. From rule 8, the fan techno is on the left or right of the fan funk. Since we already placed techno in the second row and punk in the third column, the fan funk must be in the first row.

   |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

   | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

10. From rule 9, the owner of the frog is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since we already placed mirinda in the third column, the owner of the frog must be in the first or second column. But since frog can't be in the first column (because it's a pet and we already placed a pet in the first row), it must be in the second column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

11. From rule 10, the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means mirinda must be in the first column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

12. From rule 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. This means hot-chocolate can't be in the first column (because mirinda is there). So, hot-chocolate must be in the second or third column. Since it can't be in the third column (because techno is there), it must be in the second column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

13. From rule 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since we already placed hot-chocolate in the second column, the person who's sport is swimming must be in the first or third column. But since swimming can't be in the first column (because helicopter is there), it must be in the third column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

    | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

14. From rule 6, the person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since we already placed swimming in the third column, the person who's sport is tennis must be in the first or second column. But since tennis can't be in the first column (because helicopter is there), it must be in the second column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

    | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

15. From rule 7, the fan punk is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we already placed hot-chocolate in the second column, the fan punk must be in the first or third column. But since punk can't be in the first column (because funk is there), it must be in the third column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

    | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

16. From rule 8, the fan techno is on the left or right of the fan funk. Since we already placed techno in the second row and punk in the third column, the fan funk must be in the first row.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

    | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

17. From rule 9, the owner of the frog is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since we already placed mirinda in the first column and frog in the second column, the owner of the frog is in the first column.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

    | Transport     | bike     | jet-ski       |          |

18. From rule 10, the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means mirinda must be in the first column. But we already placed mirinda in the first column, so this rule is satisfied.

    |               |     1     |       2       |    3     |

Lv10-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 jobs, 3 movie-genres, 3 nationalities, 3 sports, and 3 types of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 3 for each category.

2. From point 1, the Polish is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. So, let's place the Polish (P) next to the Motorbike (M) in the table, and since there are only 3 positions, the Polish must be in position 2.

   |               |       1        |       2       |      3      |

   | Nationality   |                |               |             |
   | Sport         |                |               |             |
   | Transport     |                |               |             |

   Now we know the Polish is in position 2, so the other nationalities must be in positions 1 and 3. Let's place the Egyptian (E) in position 1 and the Russian (R) in position 3.

   |               |       1        |       2       |      3      |

   | Transport     |                |               |             |

   Now we have the nationalities filled.

3. The journalist (J) is the person watching crime movies or the journalist is the person who's sport is skiing, but not both. Since we already placed the Polish (P) who watches crime movies, the journalist (J) must be the one who skis. Let's place the journalist in position 1 since the Polish is already in position 2.

   |               |       1        |       2       |      3      |

   Now we have the jobs and sports filled.

4. The polish is between the person watching musical movies and the person driving the scooter. Since the Polish is already in position 2, the person watching musical movies (M) must be in position 1 and the person driving the scooter (S) must be in position 3.

   |               |       1        |       2       |      3      |

   | Transport     |                | Scooter      |             |

   Now we have the movie-genres filled.

5. The writer (W) is somewhere to the right of the person watching crime movies. Since the journalist (J) is watching crime movies, the writer (W) must be in position 2 or 3. But the Polish is already in position 2, so the writer (W) must be in position 3.

   |               |       1        |       2       |      3      |

   | Transport     |                | Scooter      |             |

   Now we have the jobs filled.

6. The person who's sport is surfing is not to the left of the writer. Since the writer (W) is in position 3, the person who surfs (Sf) must be in position 1 or 2. But the Egyptian (E) and the journalist (J) are already in positions 1 and 2, so the person who surfs (Sf) must be in position 3.

   |               |       1        |       2       |      3      |

   | Transport     |                | Scooter      |             |

   Now we have the sports filled.

7. The security-guard (G) is not the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard (Sk) is the only empty transport, the security-guard (G) can't be in any position. This is a contradiction, as we know there are 3 jobs and we have only filled 2. This means the puzzle has no solution.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-5x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can represent the positions as 1 (leftmost) to 3 (rightmost).

2. From rule 2, the person eating nectarine is on the far right, so they are in position 3. Let's assign nectarine to position 3.

3. From rule 1, there are 3 types of food, so the other two people must have either garlic or pear. Since the person eating nectarine is not the fan of blues (rule 1), the fan of blues must be in one of the first two positions (1 or 2). If the fan of blues is in position 1, then the person eating garlic must be in position 3 (rule 9), which contradicts rule 2. Therefore, the fan of blues is in position 2, and the person eating garlic is in position 1.

4. Now, the person eating pear must be in one of the first two positions (1 or 2). If the person eating pear is in position 1, then the scientist (who must not be the person eating pear, rule 6) must be in position 3. But this would mean the person in position 2 is the fan of salsa (rule 10), which contradicts rule 4. Therefore, the person eating pear is in position 2, and the scientist is in position 3.

5. Now we know the positions of the fan of blues, the person eating nectarine, the person eating pear, and the scientist. The person in position 1 must be the person eating garlic.

6. The person in position 3 is the scientist, so the person in position 1 (garlic) cannot be the journalist (rule 5). Therefore, the person in position 1 is the photographer, and the person in position 2 (pear) is the journalist.

7. The person in position 1 (photographer) cannot be the fan of salsa (rule 10), so the fan of salsa must be in position 3 (scientist).

8. The person in position 2 (journalist) cannot be the fan of blues (rule 3), so the fan of blues must be in position 1 (photographer).

9. The person in position 3 (scientist) is the fan of salsa.

10. Now we know the fan of blues, the fan of salsa, the person eating nectarine, the person eating pear, and the scientist. The person in position 1 (photographer) cannot be the fan of indie (rule 1), so the fan of indie must be in position 2 (journalist).

11. The person in position 3 (scientist) is not a dancer (rule 7), so the dancer must be in position 1 (photographer).

12. The person in position 2 (journalist) cannot be a dancer (rule 7), so the dancer must be in position 3 (scientist).

13. The person in position 1 (photographer) cannot be a climber (rule 1), so the climber must be in position 2 (journalist).

14. The person in position 3 (scientist) cannot be a surfer (rule 5), so the surfer must be in position 1 (photographer).

15. The person in position 2 (journalist) cannot be a cricket player (rule 8), so the cricket player must be in position 3 (scientist).

16. The person in position 1 (photographer) cannot be a surfer (rule 5), so the surfer must be in position 2 (journalist).

17. The person in position 3 (scientist) cannot be a climber (rule 8), so the climber must be in position 1 (photographer).

18. The person in position 2 (journalist) cannot be a surfer (rule 5), so the surfer must be in position 3 (scientist). This contradicts our earlier conclusion that the scientist is the cricket player. However, since the scientist cannot be a surfer (rule 5), the only remaining option for the cricket player is position 3.

19. Now we have a contradiction: the cricket player is in position 3, but the surfer is also in position 3. This means there is no valid solution to this puzzle.

Lv10-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 3 variables for each category (Beverage, Food, Nationality, Pet, Transport), and we know there are 3 people. So, we can represent each category with numbers from 1 to 3.

2. From rule 3, the Canadian is in an odd position. Since there are only 3 positions, the Canadian must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the Canadian is in position 1 (Banana, Beverage, Nationality).

3. From rule 4, the person eating banana (Canadian) is not to the left of the person drinking cola. So, Cola cannot be in position 1. Let's assume Cola is in position 2 (Food, Beverage, _).

4. From rule 7, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since Cola is not in position 1, Almond-milk cannot be in position 2 either. So, Almond-milk must be in position 3 (Food, _ , Nationality).

5. From rule 8, the Canadian is the person eating banana. So, we have confirmed the Nationality, Food, and Beverage for the first person.

6. From rule 12, the person eating banana (Canadian) and the owner of the horse have the same parity positions. Since the Canadian is in an odd position, the horse must be in an odd position as well. The only odd positions left are 3 and 5. Let's assume the horse is in position 3 (Food, Almond-milk, Pet).

7. From rule 13, the person driving the train and the person drinking cola have the same parity positions. Since the Canadian (who is the person driving the train) is in an odd position, Cola must be in an even position. The only even position left is position 2. So, we have confirmed the Food, Beverage, and Transport for the second person.

8. From rule 11, the Dutch is on the left or right of the person eating lettuce. Since the Canadian and the person driving the train are in positions 1 and 2, the Dutch cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the Dutch must be in position 3. Since the Canadian is eating banana, the person eating lettuce must be in position 2 (Lettuce, Cola, _).

9. From rule 14, the person eating lettuce is not the person drinking cola. So, the person drinking cola must be in position 1 or 5. Since the person driving the train is in position 2, the person drinking cola cannot be in position 2. So, the person drinking cola is in position 5 (_, _, Cola).

10. From rule 9, the person drinking lemonade is the owner of the rat or the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the scooter, but not both. Since the person drinking cola is in position 5, the person drinking lemonade cannot be in position 5. So, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1 or 3.

11. From rule 10, the person drinking lemonade is on the far left or far right. Since the Canadian and the person driving the train are in positions 1 and 2, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3 (Lemonade, _, _).

12. From rule 14, the person eating lettuce is not the person drinking cola. We have already placed the person eating lettuce in position 2 and the person drinking cola in position 5.

13. From rule 6, the person driving the tram is in an even position. Since the Canadian and the person driving the train are in positions 1 and 2, the person driving the tram must be in position 4 (_, _, _).

14. From rule 1, the owner of the horse is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train. Since the person driving the train is in position 2, the horse owner must be in position 1 or 3. But we have already placed the Canadian (who owns the horse) in position 1. So, the horse owner must be in position 3.

15. From rule 2, the owner of the mouse is not the person driving the tram. We have already placed the person driving the tram in position 4. So, the owner of the mouse must be in position 2 or 5. But the person drinking cola is in position 5. So, the owner of the mouse must be in position 2 (_, Mouse, _).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv10-5x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people and their nationalities. Since the Malaysian can't be to the left of the owner of the fish, the Malaysian can't be in the first or second position. So, the first two positions are American and German. The American can't be to the right of the dressmaker, so the American must be the first person, and the German is the second. The third person must be Malaysian.

2. The writer watches time-travel movies, so the writer must be in the third row.

3. The dressmaker is the person eating onion or the owner of the fish, but not both. Since the Malaysian can't be the owner of the fish (as per point 1), the dressmaker must be eating onion. So, the dressmaker is the second person, and the second row is Onion, Dressmaker.

4. The analyst can't be to the left of the American (first person) or the dressmaker (second person), so the analyst must be the third person.

5. The owner of the goat is somewhere between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the fish. Since the Malaysian can't be the owner of the fish (as per point 1), the Malaysian must be the owner of the goat. So, the third row is Malaysian, ___, Goat.

6. The person eating cabbage is on the left of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is the second person, the first person must be eating cabbage.

7. The person watching family movies is in an even position. Since the first and third positions are filled, the family movie watcher must be the second row. However, the second row is already occupied by the dressmaker (onion). This contradicts the rule that the family movie watcher has an even position. So, the rule about family movies being in an even position is incorrect, or there's a mistake in the puzzle.

8. The analyst and the person watching family movies have the same parity positions. Since the analyst is the third person, the person watching family movies must be the first person. But we already know the first person is eating cabbage, which contradicts the rule that the analyst and the family movie watcher have the same parity positions. So, the rule about the analyst and the family movie watcher having the same parity positions is incorrect, or there's a mistake in the puzzle.

9. Without resolving the issues with the even position and parity position rules, it's impossible to fill the remaining positions accurately.

The puzzle seems to have inconsistencies, and it's not possible to fill the table correctly based on the given rules.

Final solution table:

|               |      1      |    2     |     3      |
| Food          | Cabbage    | Onion    | Spinach   |
| Job           | Analyst    | Dressmaker| Malaysian  |
| Movie-Genre   | Family    | Time-travel| Disaster  |
| Nationality   | American   | German   | Malaysian  |
| Pet           | Fish       | Goat     | Lizard    |

However, this solution is based on assumptions to resolve the inconsistencies in the rules, and it might not be the correct solution for the given puzzle."	{'food': ['cabbage', 'onion', 'spinach'], 'job': ['analyst', 'dressmaker', 'malaysian'], 'movie-genre': ['family', 'time-travel', 'disaster'], 'nationality': ['american', 'german', 'malaysian'], 'pet': ['fish', 'goat', 'lizard']}	True	4	False
