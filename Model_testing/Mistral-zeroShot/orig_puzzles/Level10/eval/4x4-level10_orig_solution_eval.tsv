Lv10-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, and transport are unique, we can assign them to the rows and columns in a way that each cell contains a unique value. Let's start by assigning the jobs to the rows.

   | Job   | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Transport |
   |-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | 1 (Designer) | | | |
   | 2 (Engineer) | | | |
   | 3 (Nurse) | | | |
   | 4 (Security-Guard) | | | |

   Now let's assign the movie-genres to the columns. Since the person watching martial-arts movies has the same parity positions as the fan of classical music (1st and 3rd or 2nd and 4th), we can assign martial-arts to the 1st and 3rd columns and classical to the 2nd and 4th columns.

   | Job   | Martial-Arts | Satire | Scientific | Zombie |
   |-------|--------------|--------|-----------|--------|
   | 1 (Designer) | X | | | |
   | 2 (Engineer) | | | | |
   | 3 (Nurse) | | | | |
   | 4 (Security-Guard) | | | | |

   Now let's assign the music-genres to the columns. Since the fan of blues is on the left or right of the person driving the ship, we can assign blues to the 1st and 3rd columns and classical to the 2nd and 4th columns (already assigned). Since the fan of disco is not to the right of the fan of blues, we can assign disco to the 1st column (already assigned) and hip-hop to the 2nd column.

   | Job   | Martial-Arts | Satire | Scientific | Zombie |
   |-------|--------------|--------|-----------|--------|
   | 1 (Designer) | X (Blues) | | | |
   | 2 (Engineer) | | Hip-Hop | | |
   | 3 (Nurse) | | | | |
   | 4 (Security-Guard) | | | | |

   Now let's assign the transport to the columns. Since the person driving the roller is the person watching zombie movies or the person watching zombie movies is the designer, but not both, we can assign roller to the 3rd column (Zombie) and the designer is already assigned to the 1st column (Martial-Arts). Since the person driving the roller is the security-guard or the person watching zombie movies is the person driving the roller, but not both, we can assign roller to the 3rd column (Zombie) and the security-guard is already assigned to the 4th column (not determined yet). Since the person driving the roller is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship, we can assign ship to the 2nd column (Satire). Since the person driving the tram is the engineer and the person driving the tram has the same parity positions as the engineer (1st and 3rd or 2nd and 4th), we can assign tram to the 2nd column (Satire).

   | Job   | Martial-Arts | Satire (Tram) | Scientific | Zombie (Roller) |
   |-------|--------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
   | 1 (Designer) | X (Blues) | | | |
   | 2 (Engineer) | | X (Tram) | | |
   | 3 (Nurse) | | | | |
   | 4 (Security-Guard) | | | | |

   Now let's assign the remaining jobs and movie-genres. Since the person watching satire movies is on the far left, we can assign satire to the 1st column (Martial-Arts) and the engineer is already assigned to the 2nd column (Satire). Since the person watching satire movies is the engineer, the remaining job is the nurse. Since the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the fan disco, we can assign scientific to the 4th column (Security-Guard). Since the security-guard is already assigned to the 4th column, the remaining movie-genre is zombie.

   | Job   | Martial-Arts (Satire) | Satire (Tram) | Scientific | Zombie (Roller) |
   |-------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
   | 1 (Designer) | X (Blues) | | | |
   | 2 (Engineer) | X (Satire) | X (Tram) | | |
   | 3 (Nurse) | | | | X |
   | 4 (Security-Guard) | | | X (Scientific) | |

   Now let's assign the remaining music-genres. Since the fan disco is not to the right of the nurse, we can assign disco to the 3rd column (Zombie). Since the fan disco is not to the right of the security-guard, we can assign hip-hop to the 4th column (Security-Guard).

   | Job   | Martial-Arts (Satire) | Satire (Tram) | Scientific | Zombie (Roller, Disco) |
   |-------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------|------------------------|
   | 1 (Designer) | X (Blues) | | | X (Disco) |
   | 2 (Engineer) | X (Satire) | X (Tram) | | |
   | 3 (Nurse) | | | | X |
   | 4 (Security-Guard) | | | X (Scientific) | X (Hip-Hop) |

   Finally, since the person driving the ship is not the designer and the person driving the ship is not the person watching zombie movies, the remaining transport is boat for the nurse.

   | Job   | Martial-Arts (Satire) | Satire (Tram) | Scientific | Zombie (Roller, Disco) |
   |-------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------|------------------------|
   | 1 (Designer) | X (Blues) | | | X (Disco) |
   | 2 (Engineer) | X (Satire) | X (Tram) | | |
   | 3 (Nurse) | | | | X | Boat |
   | 4 (Security-Guard) | | | X (Scientific) | X (Hip-Hop) |

   The final solution table is:

   #####
   | Job   | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Transport |
   |-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | Designer | Martial-Arts (Satire) | Blues | Disco (Roller) |
   | Engineer | Satire | Hip-Hop | Tram |
   | Nurse | Scientific | | Boat | Zombie |
   | Security-Guard | | Scientific | | Hip-Hop |

Lv10-4x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 9, we know that the person watching satire movies is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Let's place the satire movie fan on the rightmost position (4). Since the person watching animation movies is not to the left of the person watching satire movies (rule 1), the animation movie fan must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the animation movie fan in position 1 for now.

2. From rule 2, the person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies. So, milk must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's place it in position 2 for now.

3. From rule 3, the doctor and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions. Since the doctor can't be in position 1 (because it's occupied by the animation movie fan), the doctor must be in position 3 or 4. If the doctor is in position 3, soy-milk must be in position 2, but that would violate rule 2 (milk is already in position 2). So, the doctor must be in position 4, and soy-milk must be in position 3.

4. From rule 5, the project-manager is on the right of the doctor. So, the project-manager must be in position 4 or 3. Since the project-manager can't be in position 4 (because it's occupied by the doctor), the project-manager must be in position 3.

5. From rule 13, the person watching mystery movies is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person watching satire movies. Since the satire movie fan is in position 4, the mystery movie fan must be in position 2 or 3. Let's place it in position 2 for now.

6. From rule 10, the person eating blueberry is not the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea is not yet placed, let's place it in position 1 for now. This means the blueberry eater must be in position 3 or 4.

7. From rule 12, the person eating carrot is somewhere between the chef and the doctor. Since the doctor is in position 4 and the chef can't be in position 4 (because it would violate rule 6), the chef must be in position 3. This means the carrot eater must be in position 2 or 3. Since position 2 is already occupied by the mystery movie fan, the carrot eater must be in position 3.

8. From rule 8, the chef is not to the right of the person eating spinach. Since the carrot eater is in position 3, the spinach eater must be in position 1 or 2. Let's place the spinach eater in position 1 for now.

9. From rule 11, the person watching disaster movies and the person drinking 7up have the same parity positions. Since 7up is in position 1 (animation movie fan), disaster movies must be in position 3 or 4. Since the doctor and project-manager are already in positions 3 and 4, disaster movies must be in position 3.

10. From rule 14, the person watching animation movies is the journalist or the journalist is the person drinking 7up, but not both. Since the animation movie fan is the journalist (in position 1), the 7up drinker can't be the journalist. So, the 7up drinker must be in position 3 (disaster movies).

11. From rule 15, the person drinking 7up and the person eating blueberry have the same parity positions. Since 7up is in position 3 (disaster movies), the blueberry eater must be in position 4.

12. From rule 16, the person drinking milk is in an even position. Since positions 2 and 4 are already occupied, the milk drinker must be in position 1.

13. From rule 17, the person drinking milk and the person eating spinach have different parity positions. Since milk is in position 1 and spinach is in position 1 (already placed), this rule is a contradiction. However, if we swap the positions of milk and spinach, the rule is satisfied. So, let's swap them: spinach eater is in position 1, and milk drinker is in position 3.

14. From rule 18, the person eating strawberry is on the far right. Since the project-manager is in position 3 and the doctor is in position 4, the strawberry eater must be in position 4.

Final solution table:

| Beverage      |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | 7up      |  milk          | soy-milk |            |
| Food          |           |                |          | strawberry |
| Job           |           |                |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | mystery       | disaster |            |

This table satisfies all the given rules."	{'beverage': ['7up', 'milk', 'soy-milk', ''], 'food': ['', '', '', 'strawberry'], 'job': ['', '', '', ''], 'movie-genre': ['animation', 'mystery', 'disaster', '']}	True	4	False
Lv10-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and an even position is position 4, the person watching disaster movies is in position 4. Let's place it there.

   |               |     1     |    2     |      3      |    4     |

   | Pet           |           |          |             |          |

2. The person watching sports movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing (position 6 is not 2).

3. The nigerian is somewhere between the owner of the ferret and the person watching sports movies. Since the person watching sports movies is not in position 2 (which is the only even position left), the nigerian cannot be in position 2 either. So, the nigerian is in position 3 or 4. If the nigerian is in position 3, the person watching sports movies must be in position 2 (as the nigerian is between the owner of the ferret and the person watching sports movies). But this would mean the person watching sports movies is the person who's hobby is fishing, which is not possible according to rule 2. So, the nigerian is in position 4.

4. The person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the egyptian. Since the egyptian is in position 4, the person watching time-travel movies is not in positions 1, 2, or 3.

5. The person watching animation movies is not in position 1 (as the person watching disaster movies is in position 4, and there should be another person between them according to rule 1).

6. The person who's hobby is chess is between the owner of the turtle and the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 4, the person watching animation movies cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the person watching animation movies is in position 3.

7. The british is not to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 3, the british cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the british is in position 4.

8. The person who's hobby is chess is not to the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. So, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 1.

9. The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the nigerian. So, the person who's hobby is singing is in position 2 or 4. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is in position 1, the person who's hobby is singing cannot be in position 1. So, the person who's hobby is singing is in position 4.

   | Pet           | Ferret?  |         |             |          |

10. The owner of the turtle is between the owner of the lizard and the british. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is in position 1, the owner of the turtle cannot be in position 1 or 4. So, the owner of the turtle is in position 2 or 3. But since the person who's hobby is chess is in position 1, the owner of the turtle cannot be in position 1. So, the owner of the turtle is in position 3.

   | Pet           | Ferret?  | Turtle   |             |          |

11. The person who's hobby is fishing and the nigerian have the same parity positions. Since the nigerian is in position 4, the person who's hobby is fishing is also in an even position. But we have already placed the person watching disaster movies in position 4, so the person who's hobby is fishing is the person watching disaster movies.

   | Pet           | Ferret?  | Turtle   |             |          |

12. The person who's hobby is traveling is the person watching sports movies or the person who's hobby is traveling is the owner of the turtle, but not both. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is already in position 1, it cannot be the owner of the turtle in position 3. So, the person who's hobby is traveling is the person watching sports movies.

13. The person watching sports movies is not to the right of the egyptian. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is in position 1 (and is watching sports movies), the person watching sports movies is in position 1.

14. The owner of the lizard is not in position 1 (as the person who's hobby is traveling is in position 1). The owner of the lizard is also not in position 4 (as the person watching disaster movies is in position 4). So, the owner of the lizard is in position 2 or 3. But since the person who's hobby is chess is in position 1, the owner of the lizard cannot be in position 1. So, the owner of the lizard is in position 3.

Lv10-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's assign the movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and sports to the people. We know there are 4 people, so we'll use the numbers 1 to 4 to represent them.

   - Movie-Genres: Documentary, Drama, Mystery, Thriller (in any order)
   - Music-Genres: Dubstep, Gospel, Punk, R&B (in any order)
   - Pets: Chinchilla, Dog, Frog, Pony (in any order)
   - Sports: Climbing, Lacrosse, Tennis, Water-polo (in any order)

2. From rule 1, we know that each person prefers a unique movie-genre, music-genre, pet, and sport. So, we can start by assigning one of each to each person. Let's start with the movie-genres:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          |          |            |             |
   | Pet           |          |          |            |             |
   | Sport         |          |          |            |             |

3. Now, let's assign the music-genres. Since we know that the fan of Dubstep is not to the left of the person who's sport is Tennis, Dubstep can't be assigned to person 1 (since Tennis is assigned to person 4). So, let's assign Dubstep to person 2:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          | Dubstep |            |             |
   | Pet           |          |          |            |             |
   | Sport         |          |          |            |             |

4. Now, let's assign the pets. From rule 1, we know that the person who's sport is Tennis is the owner of the Frog. So, let's assign Tennis to person 4 and Frog to the same person:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          | Dubstep |            | R&B |
   | Pet           |          |          | Chinchilla | Frog |
   | Sport         |          |          |            | Tennis |

5. Now, let's assign the remaining pets. Since the owner of the Chinchilla is the fan of Punk or the owner of the Chinchilla is the person who's sport is Water-polo, but not both, we can't assign Water-polo to person 1 (since we've already assigned Tennis to person 4). So, let's assign Water-polo to person 3:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          | Dubstep | Punk | R&B |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla |          | Frog | Dog |
   | Sport         |          |          | Water-polo | Tennis |

6. Now, let's assign the remaining pets. Since the owner of the Dog can't be the person watching Thriller movies (rule 3), it must be person 1 or person 2. Let's assign the Dog to person 1:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          | Dubstep | Punk | R&B |
   | Pet           | Dog | Chinchilla | Frog |          |
   | Sport         |          |          | Water-polo | Tennis |

7. Now, let's assign the remaining pets. Since the person watching Mystery movies is somewhere between the owner of the Dog and the owner of the Chinchilla (rule 8), it must be person 2 or person 3. Let's assign the Frog to person 2 and the Chinchilla to person 3:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          | Dubstep | Punk | R&B |
   | Pet           | Dog | Frog | Chinchilla |          |
   | Sport         |          |          | Water-polo | Tennis |

8. Now, let's assign the remaining sports. From rule 4, we know that the person watching Thriller movies is on the right of the owner of the Dog. So, let's assign Tennis to person 4 and Thriller to person 3:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          | Dubstep | Punk | R&B |
   | Pet           | Dog | Frog | Chinchilla |          |
   | Sport         |          |          | Water-polo | Tennis |

9. Now, let's assign the remaining sports. From rule 7, we know that the person watching Drama movies is on the left of the person who's sport is Tennis. Since Tennis is assigned to person 4, the person watching Drama movies must be person 1 or person 2. Let's assign Climbing to person 1 and Lacrosse to person 2:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama (Climbing) | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          | Dubstep | Punk | R&B |
   | Pet           | Dog | Frog | Chinchilla |          |
   | Sport         | Climbing | Lacrosse | Water-polo | Tennis |

10. Now, let's assign the remaining music-genres. From rule 11, we know that the fan of R&B is not the person who's sport is Water-polo. So, let's assign R&B to person 2:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama (Climbing) | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          | R&B | Punk | Gospel |
   | Pet           | Dog | Frog | Chinchilla |          |
   | Sport         | Climbing | Lacrosse | Water-polo | Tennis |

11. Finally, let's assign the remaining music-genres. Since the person watching Mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of Gospel (rule 9), it must be person 1 or person 2. Let's assign Gospel to person 1:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama (Climbing) | Mystery (Gospel) | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   | Punk | R&B | Gospel | Dubstep |
   | Pet           | Dog | Frog | Chinchilla |          |
   | Sport         | Climbing | Lacrosse | Water-polo | Tennis |

12. Now, let's assign the remaining music-genres. Since the person watching Documentary movies is not the person who's sport is Water-polo (rule 5), it must be person 1 or person 2. Let's assign Dubstep to person 2:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Drama (Climbing) | Mystery (Gospel) | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   | Punk | Dubstep | Gospel |          |
   | Pet           | Dog | Frog | Chinchilla |          |
   | Sport         | Climbing | Lacrosse | Water-polo | Tennis |

13. Now, let's assign the remaining music-genre. Since the person watching Drama movies is on the left of the person who's sport is Tennis (rule 7), it must be person 1. So, let's assign Punk to person 1:

   |               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary (Punk) | Drama (Climbing) | Mystery (Gospel) | Thriller |
   | Music-Genre   |          | Dubstep | Gospel |          |
   | Pet           | Dog | Frog | Chinchilla |          |
   | Sport         | Climbing | Lacrosse | Water-polo | Tennis |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the row and column headers with the numbers 1 to 4.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person watching scientific movies is to the right of the person drinking coffee. So, we can place the coffee drinker in column 1 or 2, and the scientific movie watcher in column 3 or 4.

3. From rule 2, the person drinking juice is between the person watching zombie movies and the person drinking sprite. Since the scientific movie watcher is in column 3 or 4, the person watching zombie movies must be in column 1 or 2, and the person drinking juice must be in the gap between them. So, the juice drinker is in column 2.

4. From rule 3, the person doing biathlon is the person drinking sprite or the person watching scientific movies, but not both. Since the scientific movie watcher is in column 3 or 4, the sprite drinker/biathlete must be in column 1 or 2. Let's place the sprite drinker/biathlete in column 1 for now.

5. From rule 4, the person doing climbing and the person watching scientific movies have different parity positions. Since the scientific movie watcher is in column 3, the climber must be in column 4.

6. From rule 5, the American is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the scientific movie watcher is in column 3, the American cannot be in column 4. So, the American must be in column 1, 2, or 3.

7. From rule 6, the person doing ice-hockey is to the right of the American. So, the American cannot be in column 1, and the ice-hockey player must be in column 2, 3, or 4.

8. From rule 7, the person drinking juice is not to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the juice drinker is in column 2, the milk drinker must be in column 3 or 4.

9. From rule 8, the person drinking juice is to the left of the Mexican. So, the Mexican must be in column 3 or 4.

10. From rule 9, the person doing climbing is on the left or right of the person doing biathlon. Since the biathlete/sprite drinker is in column 1, the climber can only be in column 2 or 4. However, from rule 15, the Italian and the person watching zombie movies have the same parity positions. Since the zombie movie watcher is in column 1, the Italian must be in column 3. So, the climber cannot be in column 2, and must be in column 4.

11. From rule 10, the person drinking coffee is not the person watching fantasy movies. Since the fantasy movies are not listed yet, let's place the fantasy movie watcher in column 3 or 4.

12. From rule 11, the person watching zombie movies is to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since the coffee drinker is in column 1, the zombie movie watcher must be in column 2 or 4. However, from rule 8, the Mexican is in column 3, so the zombie movie watcher cannot be in column 4. So, the zombie movie watcher is in column 2.

13. From rule 12, the person drinking coffee is not to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the juice drinker is in column 2, the coffee drinker must be in column 1, 3, or 4. However, from rule 6, the ice-hockey player is in column 2, so the coffee drinker cannot be in column 2. Since the American is in column 1, the coffee drinker must be in column 3 or 4.

14. From rule 13, the person doing climbing is not to the left of the Italian. Since the Italian is in column 3, the climber must be in column 4.

15. From rule 14, the American is not to the right of the person doing climbing. Since the climber is in column 4, the American cannot be in column 3 or 4. So, the American is in column 1 or 2.

Now, let's place the remaining items:
- The milk drinker must be in column 3, as per rule 8.
- The person watching fantasy movies can be in column 3 or 4, but since the American is in column 1, the fantasy movie watcher must be in column 4.
- The person doing ice-hockey is in column 2, as per rule 7.
- The Mexican is in column 3, as per rule 9.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-4x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can label them A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. From rule 6, the fan pop is on the far left, so A is the fan pop.

3. From rule 10, the owner of the pony is on the far right, so D is the owner of the pony.

4. From rule 12, the person eating asparagus is on the far right, so D is eating asparagus.

5. From rule 7, the fan country is somewhere between B (traveling) and C (unknown hobby). Since the fan country can't be A (pop), it must be either B or C.

6. From rule 8, the owner of the goat is not the fan country, so it can't be B. Therefore, the fan country is C, and C is the owner of the goat. So, C is eating something and owns a goat.

7. From rule 5, the owner of the goat is in an even position. Since D is the far right, and C is the owner of the goat, C must be in position 2 (even) and B is in position 3 (odd).

8. From rule 1, the owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the fan gospel. Since A is the fan pop and D is the fan country, A and D can't be the owner of the rat. So, B or C could be the owner of the rat. Since C is the owner of the goat and can't be the owner of the rat (rule 8), B must be the owner of the rat. So, B is eating something and owns a rat.

9. From rule 9, the person eating lemon and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions. Since B is eating lemon (from rule 8) and C is the rock-climber (from rule 5), B and C have the same parity positions. Since B is in position 3 (odd), C must be in position 1 (odd).

10. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the fan country. Since C is the fan country, B (traveling) must be in position 2.

11. From rule 11, the person eating cucumber and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions. Since C is the rock-climber (in position 1) and D is the pony owner (in position 4), A must be eating cucumber (in position 3).

12. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is video-games is the fan pop or the owner of the goat, but not both. Since C is the fan pop and the owner of the goat, A can't be the fan pop. So, A must be the person who's hobby is video-games.

13. From rule 9, the person eating lemon and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions. Since B is eating lemon (in position 2) and A is the rock-climber (in position 1), A and B have the same parity positions. Since A is in position 1 (odd), B must be in position 3 (odd).

14. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is traveling is the person eating lemon. Since B is the traveler and eating lemon (in position 2), B must be eating lemon.

Lv10-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and an odd number of them eat cauliflower (1), the person who doesn't eat cauliflower must be in an even position. The person who eats cauliflower and the person who does puzzles cannot be in the same position because they have different parity positions. So, let's place the cauliflower eater in position 1 (odd) and the puzzles person in position 2 (even).

2. Photography is between rock-climbing and skydiving, so let's place rock-climbing in position 3 and photography in position 4. Skydiving must be in position 5, 6, 7, or 8. Since photography is to the left of the cauliflower eater (position 1), skydiving cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, skydiving can be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7. Let's place skydiving in position 5 for now.

3. The van driver is not to the left of the skateboard driver, so the skateboard driver must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the cauliflower eater is in position 1 and the rock-climber is in position 3, the skateboard driver must be in position 2. This means the van driver is in position 4.

4. Rock-climbing is to the left of photography, so the skateboard driver (who is also the rock-climber) is in position 3 and the photography person is in position 4.

5. Avocado is not to the right of grapes, so let's place avocado in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the cauliflower eater is in position 1, the avocado eater cannot be in position 1. So, avocado can be in position 2, 3, or 4. Let's place avocado in position 2 for now.

6. Photography is to the left of the cauliflower eater, so the cauliflower eater is in position 3 or 4. Since the avocado eater is in position 2, the cauliflower eater cannot be in position 2. So, the cauliflower eater is in position 4. This means the avocado eater is in position 1.

7. Skydiving is between potato and thriller movies, so potato is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Thriller movies are in position 8. Since the cauliflower eater is in position 4, potato cannot be in position 4. So, potato can be in position 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7. Let's place potato in position 1 for now.

8. Spy movies are to the left of superhero movies, so spy movies are in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the avocado eater is in position 1, spy movies cannot be in position 1. So, spy movies can be in position 2, 3, or 4. Let's place spy movies in position 2 for now.

9. The potato eater is the person watching thriller movies or the person watching thriller movies is the puzzles person, but not both. Since the potato eater is in position 1 and the puzzles person is in position 2, the person watching thriller movies cannot be in position 1. So, the person watching thriller movies is in position 8. This means the potato eater is in position 1.

10. Skydiving is between potato and thriller movies, so skydiving is in position 5, 6, or 7. Since the potato eater is in position 1 and the thriller movie watcher is in position 8, skydiving can be in position 5, 6, or 7. Let's place skydiving in position 5.

11. Avocado and spy movies have the same parity positions, so they cannot be in the same positions. Since avocado is in position 1 and the potato eater (who is also the thriller movie watcher) is in position 1, spy movies cannot be in position 1. So, spy movies can be in position 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7. Let's place spy movies in position 3 for now.

12. The subway driver is the person watching thriller movies, so the subway driver is in position 8.

13. The taxi driver is to the right of the superhero movie watcher, so the superhero movie watcher is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the avocado eater is in position 1, the superhero movie watcher cannot be in position 1. So, the superhero movie watcher can be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's place superhero movies in position 2 for now.

14. The taxi driver is to the right of the superhero movie watcher, so the taxi driver is in position 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since the cauliflower eater is in position 4, the taxi driver cannot be in position 4. So, the taxi driver can be in position 3, 5, 6, or 7. Let's place the taxi driver in position 3 for now.

15. The only remaining position for the superhero movie watcher is position 6.

Now, let's check the consistency of the positions:
- The person eating cauliflower is in position 4 (even), and the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 2 (even), which satisfies condition 1.
- The person who's hobby is photography is in position 4, which is between position 3 (rock-climbing) and position 5 (skydiving), satisfying condition 2.
- The person driving the van is in position 4, which is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard (position 2), satisfying condition 3.
- The person driving the skateboard (rock-climbing) is in position 2, and the person who's hobby is photography is in position 4, which satisfies condition 4.
- The person eating avocado is in position 1, and the person eating grapes is not in position 2 (since avocado is in position 1), which satisfies condition 5.
- The person who's hobby is photography is in position 4, which is to the left of the person eating cauliflower (position 3), satisfying condition 6.
- The person driving the van is in position 4, which is not to the left of the person watching superhero movies (position 2), satisfying condition 13.
- The person driving the subway is in position 8, which is the person watching thriller movies, satisfying condition 12.
- The person watching spy movies is in position 3, and the person eating avocado is in position 1, which have the same parity positions, satisfying condition 11.
- The person watching superhero movies is in position 6, which is to the right of the person watching superhero movies, satisfying condition 13.
- The person driving the taxi is in position 3, which is to the right of the person watching superhero movies (position 2), satisfying condition 13.
- The person watching spy movies is in position 3, and the person watching superhero movies is in position 6, so the person watching thriller movies (who is also the potato eater) is in position 1. This satisfies condition 9 because the potato eater is not the person driving the subway (position 8).
- The person watching spy movies is in position 3, and the person eating avocado is in position 1, which have different parity positions, satisfying condition 11.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv10-4x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the genres, sports, and means of transport to the positions.

1. Since there are 4 different genres, sports, and means of transport, we can assign them to the columns and rows as follows:

   |               |     1      |     2     |    3    |    4    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action    | Drama    | Romance | Western |
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-Hop   | House    | Jazz    | Reggae  |
   | Sport         | Badminton | Rowing   | Skiing  | Volleyball |
   | Transport     | Bike     | Car     | Jet-Ski | Scooter |

2. Now let's solve the clues:

   From clue 1, the person who's sport is rowing and the person driving the car have different parity positions. Since rowing is in position 2 and car is in position 3, rowing cannot be in position 3. So, rowing is in position 2 and car is in position 1 (odd positions) or position 4 (even positions).

   From clue 2, the person who's sport is badminton is on the left or right of the fan hip-hop. Since badminton is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, and hip-hop is in position 1, badminton cannot be in position 1. So, badminton is in position 2, 3, or 4. If badminton is in position 2, then hip-hop must be in position 4. But this would violate clue 20, so badminton must be in position 3 or 4. If badminton is in position 3, then hip-hop must be in position 1. But this would violate clue 19, so badminton must be in position 4. So, badminton is in position 4, and hip-hop is in position 1.

   From clue 3, the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere between the person who's sport is volleyball and the fan reggae. Since volleyball is in position 2 and reggae is in position 3, jet-ski can be in position 1, 2, or 3. But if jet-ski is in position 1, it would violate clue 15. So, jet-ski is in position 2 or 3. If jet-ski is in position 2, it would violate clue 16, so jet-ski is in position 3.

   From clue 4, the person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since rowing is in position 2, volleyball can be in position 1, 2, or 3. But if volleyball is in position 1, it would violate clue 7. So, volleyball is in position 3.

   From clue 5, the person who's sport is skiing is not the person watching drama movies. Since drama is in position 2, skiing cannot be in position 2. So, skiing is in position 1, 3, or 4. But if skiing is in position 1, it would violate clue 11. So, skiing is in position 3 or 4. But if skiing is in position 4, it would violate clue 6. So, skiing is in position 3.

   From clue 6, the person who's sport is rowing is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies. Since action is in position 1, rowing cannot be in position 1. So, rowing is in position 2, 3, or 4. But if rowing is in position 2, it would violate clue 1. So, rowing is in position 3 or 4. But if rowing is in position 4, it would violate clue 18. So, rowing is in position 3.

   From clue 7, the fan hip-hop is not to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since volleyball is in position 3, hip-hop cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, hip-hop is in position 4.

   From clue 8, the person watching action movies is not the person who's sport is skiing. Since action is in position 1 and skiing is in position 3, the person watching action movies cannot be in position 1. So, the person watching action movies is in position 2 or 4. But if the person watching action movies is in position 2, it would violate clue 6. So, the person watching action movies is in position 4.

   From clue 9, the person who's sport is badminton is the person driving the bike or the fan jazz is the person who's sport is badminton, but not both. Since badminton is in position 4 and the person driving the bike cannot be in position 3 (because of clue 3), the person driving the bike must be in position 1 or 2. But if the person driving the bike is in position 1, it would violate clue 15. So, the person driving the bike is in position 2. This means the fan jazz must be in position 4 (because badminton is in position 4).

   From clue 10, the person watching action movies is not the fan jazz. Since the person watching action movies is in position 4, the fan jazz cannot be in position 4. So, the fan jazz is in position 1, 2, or 3. But if the fan jazz is in position 1, it would violate clue 14. So, the fan jazz is in position 2 or 3. But if the fan jazz is in position 3, it would violate clue 19. So, the fan jazz is in position 2.

   From clue 11, the person driving the bike is not the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person driving the bike is in position 2 and skiing is in position 3, the person who's sport is skiing cannot be in position 2. So, the person who's sport is skiing is in position 1, 3, or 4. But if the person who's sport is skiing is in position 1, it would violate clue 11. So, the person who's sport is skiing is in position 4.

   From clue 12, the person watching western movies and the person driving the jet-ski have the same parity positions. Since jet-ski is in position 3 and skiing is in position 4, the person watching western movies is in position 1 or 3. But if the person watching western movies is in position 1, it would violate clue 17. So, the person watching western movies is in position 3.

   From clue 13, the person watching western movies is not the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the person watching western movies is in position 3 and volleyball is in position 3, the person watching western movies cannot be in position 3. So, the person watching western movies is in position 1.

   From clue 14, the fan jazz is not to the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since badminton is in position 4 and jazz is in position 2, the fan jazz cannot be in position 1. So, the fan jazz is in position 3.

   From clue 15, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the bike. Since jet-ski is in position 3 and bike is in position 2, jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the bike.

   From clue 16, the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the fan house. Since jet-ski is in position 3 and house is in position 4, jet-ski is in position 2. But this would violate clue 3, so jet-ski is in position 3. This means the person driving the bike is in position 1.

   From clue 17, the person watching western movies is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since western movies are in position 1 and rowing is in position 3, the person who's sport is rowing is in position 4.

   From clue 18, the person who's sport is badminton is not to the right of the fan reggae. Since badminton is in position 4 and reggae is in position 3, the person who's sport is badminton cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the person who's sport is badminton is in position 3.

   From clue 19, the fan house is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. Since the person driving the bike is in position 1, the fan house cannot be in position 1. So, the fan house is in position 2, 3, or 4. But if the fan house is in position 2, it would violate clue 20. So, the fan house is in position 4.

   From clue 20, the person who's sport is badminton is on the left or right of the fan house. Since badminton is in position 3 and house is in position 4, badminton is in position 2. But this would violate clue 2, so badminton is in position 4. This means the fan house is in position 1.

   So, the final solution table is:

   |               |     1      |     2     |    3    |    4    |

Lv10-4x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and an even number of them drink soy-milk and have sudoku as a hobby, they cannot occupy the same position. Let's assume soy-milk is in position 1 and sudoku is in position 3 (odd positions).

2. Tea is to the left of Mirinda (position 2).

3. Parkour cannot be in position 1 (since it's related to cherry or camping, and we haven't placed cherry or camping yet). Let's place parkour in position 4.

4. Tea is not to the right of Papaya. So, Tea cannot be in position 4 (since it's to the left of Mirinda and Parkour is in position 4). So, Tea must be in position 2.

5. Parkour and Lemon have the same parity positions. Since we know Parkour is in position 4, Lemon must be in an even position (let's place it in position 2).

6. Papaya is to the right of Soccer.

7. 7up is between Sudoku and Garlic. Since we know Sudoku is in position 3 and Lemon is in position 2, 7up can only be in position 1 or 4. But since Tea is in position 2 and we need an odd position for 7up, it must be in position 4.

8. Sudoku is on the left or right of Camping. Since we know Sudoku is in position 3 and Lemon is in position 2, Camping can only be in position 1 or 4. But since Tea is in position 2 and we need an odd position for Camping, it must be in position 1.

9. Tea is on the left or right of Soccer. Since Tea is in position 2 and Soccer is to the right of Papaya (position 3), Soccer must be in position 4.

10. Golf is in an even position. Since we know Tea is in position 2, Golf cannot be in position 1 or 3 (odd positions). So, Golf must be in position 4.

11. Golf is to the left of Lemon.

12. Reading is not to the left of Soy-milk.

13. Cherry is on the left or right of Parkour. Since we know Parkour is in position 4, Cherry can only be in position 1 or 3. But since Tea is in position 2 and we need an odd position for Cherry, it must be in position 1.

14. Lemon is to the left of Sudoku.

15. Garlic is to the left of Reading.

Now, let's place the food, hobbies, and sports:

|            |       1       |    2    |    3    |    4     |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk     | Tea     | Mirinda | 7up      |
| Food       | Cherry       | Lemon   | Papaya  | Garlic   |
| Hobby      | Camping      | Reading | Sudoku  | Rock-climbing|
| Sport      | Parkour      | Soccer  | Golf    | Handball  |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|            |       1       |    2    |    3    |    4     |
