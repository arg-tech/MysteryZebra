Lv10-6x7-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the parity (even or odd) of each person's position.
- Since there are 7 people, the parity of the positions alternates (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0).

Step 2: Assign the people to their respective categories based on the given clues.

Step 3: Arrange the people in the table according to their positions and the information gathered in Step 2.

Here's the solution:

| Beverage      | Food          | Hobby         | Job           | Music-Genre   | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| fanta        | broccoli      | dancing      | analyst      | dubstep       | bike         |
| iced-tea     | carrot        | manager      | pilot         | house         | helicopter   |
| lemonade     | lemon         | hiking       | mechanic      | trance        | car          |
| milk         | strawberry    | woodworking  | software-dev  | pop           | skateboard    |
| sprite       | lime          | fishing      | security-guard| techno        | quad-bike     |

| tea          | radish        | writing      | manager       | funk          | bus           |

The table above is the final solution. The parity of the positions is indicated by the even/odd numbers in the first row. The rest of the table is filled based on the given clues."	{'beverage': ['food', 'hobby', 'job', 'music-genre', 'transport'], 'fanta': ['broccoli', 'dancing', 'analyst', 'dubstep', 'bike'], 'iced-tea': ['carrot', 'manager', 'pilot', 'house', 'helicopter'], 'lemonade': ['lemon', 'hiking', 'mechanic', 'trance', 'car'], 'milk': ['strawberry', 'woodworking', 'software-dev', 'pop', 'skateboard'], 'sprite': ['lime', 'fishing', 'security-guard', 'techno', 'quad-bike'], 'soy-milk': ['pear', 'singing', 'designer', 'salsa', 'tram'], 'tea': ['radish', 'writing', 'manager', 'funk', 'bus']}	False	0	False

2. Now we can place the Indian (5) in an odd position (3 or 5 or 7) because the Pakistani (3) is in an even position (4). Let's place the Indian (5) in position 7 (Volleyball).

3. The Thai (6) must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7), so they can't be in position 4 (Sailing) or 7 (Volleyball). Let's place the Thai (6) in position 1 (Badminton).

Lv10-6x7-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the parity (even or odd) of each person's position.
Parity is determined by the number of people to the left of a person. If the number of people to the left is even, the person is in an even position. If the number of people to the left is odd, the person is in an odd position.

Step 2: Assign each person a number from 1 to 7 based on their parity and the given information.

Step 3: Assign each person a beverage, food, hobby, movie-genre, nationality, and transport based on the given information.

Here's the solution:

Step 1:
1. Trike: Odd (to the right of papaya)
2. Train: Even
3. Garlic: Even or Odd (left or right of family movies)
4. Milk: Even
5. Lemonade: Even
6. Hot-chocolate: Odd (not to the right of soy-milk)
7. Almond-milk: Even or Odd (different parity with action movies)

Step 2:
1. Trike: 3 (Odd)
2. Train: 2 (Even)
3. Garlic: 5 or 6 (Odd)
4. Milk: 4 (Even)
5. Lemonade: 1 (Even)
6. Hot-chocolate: 6 (Odd)
7. Almond-milk: 5 or 7 (Even or Odd)

Step 3:
1. Beverage: soy-milk (Australian or singer, but not both, so Australian)
2. Food: artichoke (family movies driver or reader, but not both, so family movies driver)
3. Hobby: gardening (trike driver and gardener have different parity, so gardener)
4. Movie-Genre: action (almond-milk drinker and action have different parity, so action)
5. Nationality: British (left or right of van driver)
6. Transport: train (not soy-milk drinker)

Continue this process until you have filled out the entire table. The final solution is:

```

Lv10-6x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a simplified version of the puzzle with some initial assumptions and deductions:

1. We know the number of items in each category, so we can fill in the categories with the given options.

|               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4      |     5      |     6     |       7       |

| Hobby         | chess       | fishing      | gardening    | puzzles     | reading    | skydiving  | traveling     |
| Job           | analyst     | chef         | designer     | electrician  | entrepreneur| manager   | videographer  |
| Music-Genre   | d&b         | electronic   | folk         | gospel      | pop        | rock       | soul          |

2. From rule 1, we know the snake owner is the person eating banana. So, banana is in position 3.

|               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4      |     5      |     6     |       7       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | hot-chocolate| iced-tea    | juice       | sprite     | water    | banana       |
| Food          | apple       | avocado     | banana      | garlic      | kiwi       | raspberry | pomegranate  |
| Hobby         | chess       | fishing      | gardening    | puzzles     | reading    | skydiving  | traveling     |
| Job           | analyst     | chef         | designer     | electrician  | entrepreneur| manager   | videographer  |
| Music-Genre   | d&b         | electronic   | folk         | gospel      | pop        | rock       | soul          |

3. From rule 2, the entrepreneur is not to the right of the designer. So, entrepreneur is in position 2 or 1.

4. From rule 3, the fan d&b is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, d&b is in position 1 or 2.

5. From rule 4, the fan rock is not to the left of the owner of the fish. Since the fish is in position 5, the fan rock cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, rock is in position 6 or 7.

6. From rule 5, the manager is the person who's hobby is chess. Since chess is in position 1 or 2, the manager is in position 1 or 2.

7. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since traveling is in position 7, puzzles cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, puzzles is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

8. From rule 7, the person eating kiwi is not to the right of the person eating garlic. Since garlic is in position 3, kiwi cannot be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7. So, kiwi is in position 1, 2, or 3.

9. From rule 8, the fan pop is the person eating apple or the person drinking juice is the fan pop, but not both. Since apple is in position 1, 2, or 3, and juice is in position 4, 5, or 6, the fan pop cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. So, the fan pop is in position 5 or 7.

10. Continue this process for the remaining rules.

After solving all the rules, you should be able to fill in the table with the correct positions for each item. The final solution table will be:

Lv10-6x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step will be the best approach. I'll try to solve it here:

1. Let's start by assigning the food, jobs, movie-genres, pets, and sports to the people. We'll use numbers to represent the positions in the table.

   - Position 1: Broccoli, Doctor, Action, Cat, Baseball (Firefighter)
   - Position 2: Cherry, Lawyer, Satire, Bird, Rugby
   - Position 3: Lemon, Nurse (Frog), Family, Dog, Ice-hockey
   - Position 4: Orange, Software-developer (Snowmobile), Animation, Guinea-pig, Skiing
   - Position 5: Potato, Librarian, Fantasy, Turtle, Basketball
   - Position 6: Strawberry, Musician, Spy, Lizard, Weightlifting
   - Position 7: Pepper, Firefighter (Lizard), Superhero, Fish, Lacrosse

2. Now let's check the parity positions for the people driving boats and the owner of the frog (Nurse). Since the person driving the boat is in an even position (58), the owner of the frog (Nurse) must be in an odd position.

3. The person driving the boat is the person watching spy movies (22), so the person watching spy movies is in position 2.

4. The person watching animation movies and the person driving the boat have different parity positions (4), so the person watching animation movies must be in an odd position. Since the person driving the boat is in position 2 (even), the person watching animation movies is in position 1 (odd).

5. The person watching animation movies is the owner of the frog (Nurse) (60).

6. The owner of the frog is the person eating lemon (53).

7. The person eating lemon is the nurse (60).

8. The person eating lemon is not to the right of the owner of the dog (52). Since the nurse (eating lemon) is in position 3, the dog owner must be in position 2 (Lawyer) or position 4 (Software-developer). However, the software-developer drives the snowmobile (61), so the dog owner must be the Lawyer (Position 2).

9. The lawyer is not the owner of the turtle (32). Since the turtle owner is not the doctor (5), the turtle owner must be the Librarian (Position 5).

10. The person driving the boat is in an even position (58), so the person driving the boat is not the firefighter (Position 7, odd). The firefighter must be the person owning the lizard (Position 7).

11. The firefighter is on the right of the musician (44). Since the firefighter is the lizard owner (Position 7), the musician must be in position 6.

12. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies (19). Since the person watching fantasy movies is the basketball player (Position 5), the baseball player must be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, the baseball player can't be in position 1 (Broccoli) or 2 (Cherry), so the baseball player is the doctor (Position 3).

13. The person driving the tram is not to the left of the person watching basketball (13). Since the basketball player is in position 5, the tram driver must be in position 6 or 7. However, the tram driver can't be in position 7 (Lizard owner), so the tram driver is in position 6 (Musician).
