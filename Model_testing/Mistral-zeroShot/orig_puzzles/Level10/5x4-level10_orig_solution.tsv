Lv10-5x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the number of items in each category, so we can fill in the number of rows for each category.

|               |     1     |    2     |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           |          |          |            |
| Job           |           |          |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Pet           |           |          |          |            |

2. From rule 11, we know the scientist is on the far left, so we can fill in the first row with Scientist.

|               |     1     |    2     |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           |          |          |            |
| Job           | Scientist |           |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Pet           |           |          |          |            |

3. From rule 19, we know the fan indie is not to the right of the fan r&b. Since the scientist is on the far left, the fan r&b must be in the second or third position. If the fan r&b was in the second position, the fan indie would have to be in the fourth position, which violates rule 1 (the person drinking milk is the fan r&b or the person drinking milk is the designer, but not both). So, the fan r&b must be in the third position.

|               |     1     |    2     |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           | Designer| Fan r&b  |            |
| Job           | Scientist |           |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Pet           |           |          |          |            |

4. Now, the designer must be in the second position, and the person drinking milk must be in the first or fourth position. If the person drinking milk was in the first position, the fan r&b would be to the left of the analyst, violating rule 2. So, the person drinking milk must be in the fourth position.

|               |     1     |    2     |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | Milk     | Designer| Fan r&b  |            |
| Job           | Scientist |       |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Pet           |           |          |          |            |

5. The person drinking fanta can't be the owner of the turtle (rule 15), so it must be in the first, second, or third position. If it was in the first position, the fan salsa would have to be in the fourth position, which violates rule 22 (the engineer is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda). So, the person drinking fanta must be in the second or third position. If it was in the third position, the fan salsa would have to be in the first position, which violates rule 10 (the person drinking fanta is the fan salsa or the person drinking fanta is the person watching animation movies, but not both). So, the person drinking fanta must be in the second position.

|               |     1     |    2     |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | Milk     | Fan fanta| Fan r&b  |            |
| Job           | Scientist | Designer|         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Pet           |           |          |          |            |

6. The fan salsa can't be the person drinking fanta (rule 21), so it must be in the first, third, or fourth position. If it was in the first position, the person drinking fanta would be the person watching animation movies (rule 10), which violates rule 16 (the person watching family movies is between the fan gospel and the fan indie). So, the fan salsa must be in the third or fourth position. If it was in the fourth position, the person drinking mirinda would have to be the engineer (rule 22), which violates rule 4 (the engineer is not to the right of the fan indie). So, the fan salsa must be in the third position.

|               |     1     |    2     |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | Milk     | Fan fanta| Fan r&b  | Fan salsa  |

| Pet           |           |          |          |            |

7. The person drinking mirinda can't be the engineer (rule 22), so it must be in the first, second, or fourth position. If it was in the first position, the fan salsa would have to be in the third position, which violates rule 19 (the fan indie is not to the right of the fan r&b). So, the person drinking mirinda must be in the second or fourth position. If it was in the fourth position, the engineer would have to be in the third position, which violates rule 4 (the engineer is not to the right of the fan indie). So, the person drinking mirinda must be in the second position.

|               |     1     |    2     |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | Milk     | Fan fanta| Fan r&b  | Fan salsa  |
| Job           | Scientist | Engineer |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |          |          |            |
| Pet           |           |          |          |            |

8. The person drinking tea can't be the engineer (rule 4), so it must be in the first, second, or fourth position. If it was in the first position, the fan salsa would have to be in the third position, which violates rule 19 (the fan indie is not to the right of the fan r&b). So, the person drinking tea must be in the second or fourth position. If it was in the fourth position, the person drinking mirinda would have to be the designer (rule 2), which violates rule 9 (the designer is not to the right of the person drinking milk). So, the person drinking tea must be in the second position.

|               |     1     |    2     |    3     |     4      |

14. The person watching romance movies can't be to the left of the owner of the turtle (rule 13), so it must be in the third or fourth position. If it was in the fourth position, the person drinking mirinda would have to be the owner of the turtle (rule 15), which violates rule 6 (the person drinking fanta is not the owner of the turtle). So, the person watching romance movies must be in the third position.

17. The owner of the turtle can't be to the right of the fan r&b (rule 17), so it must be in the first or second position. If it was in the first position, the person drinking fanta would have to be the designer (rule 12), which violates rule 12 (the designer is not to the right of the person drinking milk). So, the owner of the turtle must be in the second position.

18. The person watching spy movies must be somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony (rule 8). Since the owner of the turtle is in the second position, the owner of the pony must be in the first position.

If it was in the first position, the person drinking fanta would have to be the engineer (rule 3), which violates rule 1 (the person drinking milk is the fan r&b or the person drinking milk is the designer, but not both). So, the owner of the pony must be in the second position.

20. The person watching animation movies must be to the right of the scientist (rule 20), so it must be in the third or fourth position. If it was in the third position, the person drinking fanta would have to be the fan salsa (rule 10), which violates rule 19 (the fan indie is not to the right of the fan r&b). So, the person watching animation movies must be in the fourth position.

62. The person drinking tea can't be to the right of the person drinking mirinda (rule 7), so it must be in"
Lv10-5x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the positions of the person who does puzzles and the person watching family movies have the same parity (odd or even). Let's label the positions as P1, P2, P3, and P4, where P1 is the far left position.

2. From rule 2, the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking sprite, so their positions are P3 and P4. Since there are only 4 positions, the person drinking sprite must be in P1 or P2.

3. From rule 3, the person drinking lemonade is not to the left of the Indonesian, so the Indonesian is in P1 or P2. If the Indonesian is in P1, then the person drinking sprite is in P2 and the person drinking lemonade is in P3 or P4. However, this violates rule 1, so the Indonesian must be in P2. This means the person drinking sprite is in P1.

4. From rule 4, the Indonesian is on the left or right of the American. Since the Indonesian is in P2, the American must be in P1 or P3.

5. From rule 5, the person who does chess is somewhere between the person watching thriller movies and the person who writes. Since the Indonesian is in P2 and the person watching family movies is between the Spanish and the person drinking lemonade (rule 7), the person watching thriller movies must be in P3. This means the person who does chess is in P2, P3, or P4. However, the person who does chess cannot be in P4 because the person who writes is the fan of funk (rule 9), and there are only 4 music genres, so the person who does chess must be in P2. This means the person who writes is in P1.

6. From rule 8, the fan of folk is the Indonesian or the person drinking almond-milk, but not both. Since the Indonesian is already assigned, the person drinking almond-milk must be in P1, P3, or P4. However, this violates rule 17, so the person drinking almond-milk must be in P2. This means the fan of folk is the Indonesian.

7. From rule 10, the person who does chess is not the fan of funk. This means the person who does chess is drinking juice, sprite, or lemonade. However, this violates rule 17, so the person who does chess must be drinking almond-milk. This means the person drinking juice is in P1, P3, or P4.

8. From rule 11, the person drinking juice is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies. This means the person drinking juice is in P1 or P2. However, this violates rule 19, so the person drinking juice is in P4.

9. From rule 12, the person who writes and the fan of pop have the same parity positions. Since the person who writes is in P1, the fan of pop must be in P3.

10. From rule 13, the person drinking juice and the person watching thriller movies have different parity positions. Since the person drinking juice is in P4, the person watching thriller movies must be in P1 or P3. However, this violates rule 7, so the person watching thriller movies is in P1.

11. From rule 14, the person watching martial-arts movies is the person who does puzzles. Since the person watching family movies is between the Spanish and the person drinking lemonade (rule 7), the person watching martial-arts movies must be in P2. This means the person doing puzzles is in P3.

12. From rule 15, the fan of funk and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions. Since the fan of funk is the Indonesian (rule 6), the person watching epic movies must be in P2 or P4. However, this violates rule 18, so the person watching epic movies is in P4.

13. From rule 16, the person watching thriller movies is not the person who writes. This means the person watching thriller movies is drinking almond-milk, juice, or sprite. However, this violates rule 11, so the person watching thriller movies is drinking lemonade.

14. From rule 18, the fan of pop is not the person drinking juice. This means the fan of pop is drinking sprite or almond-milk. However, this violates rule 15, so the fan of pop is drinking sprite.

The final solution table is:

Lv10-5x4-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign variables to each category and person. For example, let B1, B2, B3, B4 represent the beverages, F1, F2, F3, F4 for food, H1, H2, H3, H4 for hobbies, J for job, S1, S2, S3, S4 for sports.

2. Let's use even and odd numbers to represent left and right positions respectively. For example, if a person is in the first position, we can represent them as even for left and odd for right.

3. Let's start with the positions of the hobbies. From rule 1, we know that the person reading is in an even position and is either to the left or right of the person eating lettuce. Let's say the person reading is in position H2 (even) and the person eating lettuce is in position H3 (odd). From rule 8, the gardener is to the left or right of the reader, so let's say the gardener is in position H1 (even). From rule 9, the magician is to the right of the engineer, so the engineer is in position H4 (odd). From rule 15, the magician is not to the left of the singer, so the singer is in position H3 (odd).

4. Now let's place the jobs. From rule 2, the engineer is to the left or right of the lawyer. Since the engineer is in position H4 (odd), the lawyer must be in position J2 (even). From rule 12, the journalist is to the left of the lawyer, so the journalist is in position J1 (even). From rule 19, the paramedic is in an odd position, so the paramedic is in position J3 (odd).

5. Let's place the sports. From rule 17, the parkour player is in an odd position, so the parkour player is in position S3 (odd). From rule 18, the person eating pomegranate is to the left or right of the person eating pineapple. Since the parkour player is in position S3 (odd), the pineapple eater must be in position S4 (even). From rule 6, the parkour player and the pineapple eater have the same parity positions, so the pineapple eater is in position S3 (odd). From rule 10, the lacrosse player is the paramedic, so the paramedic is in position S2 (even).

6. From rule 11, the person eating pineapple is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the pineapple eater is in position S3 (odd) and the lemonade drinker must be in an even position, the lemonade drinker is in position B2 (even). From rule 4, the almond-milk drinker is to the left of the hot-chocolate drinker. Since the lemonade drinker is in position B2 (even), the hot-chocolate drinker must be in position B3 (odd). From rule 16, the almond-milk drinker is the gardener or the gardener is the person eating pomegranate, but not both. Since the gardener is already placed, the almond-milk drinker must be the person eating pomegranate, so the pomegranate eater is in position F4 (even).

7. From rule 13, the magician is to the right of the lacrosse player (paramedic). Since the paramedic is in position S2 (even), the magician is in position H4 (odd). From rule 14, the gardener (almond-milk drinker) and the engineer have different parity positions. Since the gardener is in an even position (F4), the engineer must be in an odd position (H1, H3). Since the engineer is already placed (H4), the gardener must be in position H1 (odd).

8. From rule 16, the almond-milk drinker is the gardener or the gardener is the person eating pomegranate, but not both. Since the gardener is already placed (H1), the almond-milk drinker must be the person eating pomegranate, so the pomegranate eater is in position F1 (even).

9. From rule 7, the singer is to the right of the cricket player. Since the singer is already placed (H3), the cricket player must be in position S1 (even).

10. From rule 5, the lawyer is to the left or right of the lemonade drinker. Since the lemonade drinker is in position B2 (even), the lawyer can be either in position J1 (even) or J3 (odd). Since the journalist is already placed in position J1 (even), the lawyer must be in position J3 (odd).

11. Finally, from rule 3, the person eating cabbage is on the far left or far right. Since the gardener (almond-milk drinker) is in position H1 (odd) and the singer is in position H3 (odd), the cabbage eater must be in position F2 (even).

The final solution table is:

```

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv10-5x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. Let's assign hobbies (H), jobs (J), movie-genres (M), nationalities (N), and sports (S) to each person. We'll use different letters for each category.

3. From rule 16, the analyst (A) must be in an odd position, so A cannot be in the first or fourth position.

4. From rule 5, the polish (P) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is soccer (Soc). Since A cannot be in the first position, P cannot be in the second position either, so P must be in the third or fourth position.

5. From rule 12, the australian (Aus) is the person who's sport is soccer or the person who's sport is soccer is the person who's hobby is fishing (Fish), but not both. Since P cannot be in the second position, Aus must be in the second position. So, Aus = Soc or Soc = Fish, but not both.

6. From rule 11, the Aus is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies (Dis). Since Aus is in the second position, Dis must be in the first position. So, Dis = M1.

7. From rule 14, the Dis is the accountant (Acc). So, Acc = M1.

8. From rule 4, the Acc is on the left of the accountant. Since Acc is in the first position, the other accountant (Acc2) must be in the fourth position.

9. From rule 15, the American (Am) is not to the right of the American. Since Acc2 is in the fourth position, Am cannot be in the third position. So, Am must be in the first, second, or fifth position.

10. From rule 13, the accountant and the person who's hobby is skydiving (Sky) have the same parity positions. Since Acc is in the first position, Sky must be in the third position.

11. From rule 3, the person who's sport is cycling (Cyc) is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing (Draw). Since Sky is in the third position, Cyc cannot be in the fourth position. So, Cyc must be in the first, second, or fifth position.

12. From rule 10, the person who's sport is skateboarding (Skate) and the person who's hobby is fishing have different parity positions. Since Sky is in the third position, Skate cannot be in the third position. So, Skate must be in the first, second, or fifth position.

13. Since there are only 4 positions left, we can assign the remaining hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, and nationalities to the remaining positions. However, we still have some constraints:

   - From rule 8, the analyst is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket (Crick). Since Acc2 is in the fourth position, the analyst (Ana) must be in the third position.

   - From rule 9, the polish (P) is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since Skate is in the first position, P must be in the second, third, or fourth position. But we already know P is in the third position, so this rule is satisfied.

   - From rule 2, the person watching action movies is somewhere to the left of the indian (Ind). Since Acc is in the first position and Ind cannot be in the second position (because P is there), Ind must be in the fourth position.

   - From rule 6, the security-guard (Sec) is somewhere to the left of the accountant. Since Acc is in the first position and Acc2 is in the fourth position, Sec must be in the second or third position.

   - From rule 7, the indian (Ind) is not to the left of the accountant. Since Acc is in the first position and Acc2 is in the fourth position, Ind cannot be in the second position (because Sec is there). So, Ind must be in the third position.

14. Now we can assign the remaining categories:

   - Since Cyc is not in the fourth position, it must be in the first position. So, Cyc = H1, J2, M3, N5, S1.
   - Since Skate is not in the first, second, or fourth positions, it must be in the fifth position. So, Skate = H5, J3, M4, N1, S5.
   - Since Draw is not in the first, second, or fifth positions, it must be in the third position. So, Draw = H3, J1, M2, N4, S3.
   - Since Ana is in the third position, it must be J3.
   - Since Ind is in the third position, it must be N3.
   - Since Sec is not in the first or fourth positions, it must be J4 or J5. Since Ana is in J3, Sec must be J4.
   - Since Am is not in the second position, it must be N2.
   - Since the person watching comedy movies and the polish have different parity positions, the polish (P) must be watching comedy movies (M2).

15. Now we have the final solution:

Lv10-5x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people with unique jobs. Since the analyst is to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting (5), and the lawyer is not to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting (8), we can place the analyst in position 1 and the lawyer in position 4.

2. Since the lawyer is the person watching time-travel movies (16), we know that position 4 is time-travel.

3. The lawyer and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions (9), so the person drinking soy-milk must be in an even-numbered position. Since the person drinking soy-milk is the person who's hobby is collecting (15), we can place the person drinking soy-milk in position 2 (even).

4. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the person watching disaster movies (8), and the lawyer is watching time-travel movies, which is not disaster (16), so the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position 4. Also, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the person who's hobby is singing (11), and the singer is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies (23), so the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3.

5. The person drinking sprite is the fan salsa or the person drinking sprite is the person who's hobby is collecting, but not both (9). Since we already placed the person drinking soy-milk (who's hobby is collecting) in position 2, the person drinking sprite cannot be in position 2. So, the person drinking sprite must be the fan salsa, and the person who's hobby is salsa is in position 3.

6. The fan salsa is on the right of the police-officer (5). Since the police-officer is not in position 1 (because the analyst is there), the police-officer must be in position 1.

7. The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching drama movies (5). Since the lawyer is watching time-travel movies (16), and the person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (22), the person watching disaster movies cannot be in position 4 (because the lawyer is there). So, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 2.

8. The person watching drama movies is somewhere to the left of the fan folk (19). Since the person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (22), and the person watching time-travel movies is the lawyer (16), the person watching drama movies cannot be in position 4. So, the person watching drama movies must be in position 1.

10. The person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is singing (23). Since the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the person who's hobby is singing (11), and the person drinking iced-tea is in position 3, the person watching thriller movies cannot be in position 1 (because the person watching drama movies is there). So, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 2.

11. The person who's hobby is singing is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies (23), and the person watching thriller movies is in position 2, so the person who's hobby is singing must be in position 4.

12. The person who's hobby is traveling is not to the left of the fan classical (21), and the lawyer is not to the left of the fan classical (5), so the person who's hobby is traveling cannot be in position 1. Since the person watching drama movies is in position 1, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 3.

13. The fan classical is the person drinking mirinda or the person who's hobby is traveling is the fan classical, but not both (12). Since we already placed the person who's hobby is traveling in position 3, the fan classical must be the person drinking mirinda. So, the person drinking mirinda is in position 2.

14. The person drinking soy-milk and the police-officer have the same parity positions (9), so the police-officer must be in an odd-numbered position. Since the police-officer is in position 1, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 3.

15. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (22), and the lawyer is watching time-travel movies (16), so the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in position 4.

Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 4, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 5.

17. The person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling (17), and the person watching time-travel movies is in position 4, so the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 5.

18. The lawyer is not to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting (8), and the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 5, so the lawyer cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the lawyer is in position 4, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3, and the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 5.

19. The person who's hobby is singing is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies (23), and the person watching thriller movies is in position 2, so the person who's hobby is singing must be in position 4.

4. From rule 11, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is the Australian. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1, 3, or 4. But from rule 17, we know that the person eating apricot is not the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in position 1.

5. Now we have the following arrangement:

   |               |      1      |     2      |       3       |     4     |

But from rule 16, we know that the person driving the airplane is on the far right. So, the person driving the bike must be in position 3.

14. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking milk and the Egyptian have different parity positions. Since the person drinking milk is in position 1, the Egyptian must be in position 2.

15. From rule 8, we know that the person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the person eating mango. Since the person eating mango is in position 4, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But from rule 12, we know that the person watching mystery movies is in position 1. So, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 2 or 3.

1. We can start by placing the dancer (helicopter driver) in the last row since we know that from rule 10. Let's place the dancer in position 4.

2. Since the dancer is not eating peach (rule 1), we can place the peach eater in the first, second, or third position. Let's place the peach eater in position 1 for now.

3. From rule 2, the entrepreneur or the person eating orange is the one with the hobby of drawing. Since the dancer is not the entrepreneur (as the dancer is in the last position), the entrepreneur must be in one of the first three positions. Let's place the entrepreneur in position 2 (eating orange).

4. Now, the person with the hobby of drawing is the entrepreneur, so the person in position 2. According to rule 3, the person with the hobby of card-games is to the right of the person with the hobby of drawing. So, the card-games person is in position 3.

5. The hobby of card-games person is to the right of the person with the hobby of drawing, so the coach (who is not to the right of the card-games person, rule 7) must be in position 4, as the dancer is already in position 4.

6. The coach is in position 4, so the card-games person is in position 3. The hobby of card-games is in the third position.

7. The hobby of card-games is in position 3, so the hobby of drawing is in position 2. The entrepreneur is in position 2, so the hobby of drawing is drawing.

8. The entrepreneur is in position 2, eating orange. The hobby of drawing is in position 2, so the hobby of the person in position 1 is not drawing. The only remaining hobby for position 1 is skydiving (as card-games, chess, and crime movies are already assigned). So, the person in position 1 is skydiving and eating pumpkin.

9. The skydiving person is in position 1, eating pumpkin. The hobby of skydiving is in the first position, so the hobby of the person in position 2 is not skydiving. The only remaining hobby for position 2 is chess (as card-games, drawing, and crime movies are already assigned). So, the person in position 2 is playing chess.

10. The person in position 2 is playing chess, so the hobby of the person in position 3 is card-games.

11. The person in position 3 is playing card-games, so the hobby of the person in position 4 is not chess (as the hobby of the person in position 2 is chess). The only remaining hobby for position 4 is crime movies (as family, horror, and thriller movies are already assigned). So, the person in position 4 is watching crime movies.

12. The person in position 4 is watching crime movies, so the person in position 3 is not watching crime movies. The only remaining movie genre for position 3 is thriller. So, the person in position 3 is watching thriller movies.

13. The person in position 3 is watching thriller movies, so the person in position 2 is not watching thriller movies. The only remaining means of transport for position 2 is the tram (as bus, helicopter, and snowmobile are already assigned). So, the person in position 2 is driving the tram.

14. The person in position 2 is driving the tram, so the person in position 3 is not driving the tram. The only remaining means of transport for position 3 is the snowmobile. So, the person in position 3 is driving the snowmobile.

15. The person in position 3 is driving the snowmobile, so the person in position 4 is not driving the snowmobile. The only remaining means of transport for position 4 is the helicopter. So, the person in position 4 is driving the helicopter.

    | hot-chocolate| plum       | trance    | mango     | almond-milk| lemonade  |
    |               | musical    | snake    | rabbit   | fish        | spinach  |
    | Food          | broccoli   |           |          |             |          |

28. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. Since the snake is in the second row, we'll place the coffee in the third row.

    | hot-chocolate| plum       | trance    | mango     | almond-milk| lemonade  |
    | coffee       | musical    | snake     | rabbit   | fish        | spinach  |
    | Food          | broccoli   |           |          |             |          |
    | Movie-Genre   |          |          | western   |             | western   |
    | Music-Genre   | gospel      |            |          | reggae      |           |
    | Pet           | chinchilla  |            |          |             |           |

29. The person drinking almond-milk is not to the right of the fan gospel. Since the gospel music-genre is in the third row, the almond-milk can't be in the fourth column. We've already placed the almond-milk in the fourth column, so this condition is violated. However, since we have a contradiction, we can assume that the condition is not applicable or there is an error in the puzzle.

    | hot-chocolate| plum       | trance    | mango     | almond-milk| lemonade  |
    | coffee       | musical    | snake     | rabbit   | fish        | spinach  |
    | Food          | broccoli   |           |          |             |          |
    | Movie-Genre   |          |          | western   |             | western   |
    | Music-Genre   | gospel      |            |          | reggae      |           |
    | Pet           | chinchilla  |            |          |             |           |

Since we found a contradiction in the puzzle, it's impossible to solve it with the given conditions.

This is the final solution table, but it contains a contradiction."
Lv10-5x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 columns and 5 rows, so each person/item is in a unique position. Let's label the positions from 1 to 5 from left to right and top to bottom.

2. From rule 1, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1, 2, or 3. Since it can't be in position 5 (rule 16), it must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

3. From rule 10, the Canadian is in position 2, 3, or 4. Since it can't be in position 5 (rule 16), it must be in position 2 or 3. Let's assume it's in position 2 for now.

4. From rule 4, the Canadian and the owner of the frog have different parity positions. Since the Canadian is in an even position (2), the frog must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). But the frog can't be in position 5 (rule 16), so it must be in position 1.

5. From rule 7, the owner of the fish and the Italian have different parity positions. Since the frog is in an odd position (1), the Italian must be in an even position (2, 4).

6. From rule 15, the fan funk is to the right of the fish. So, the fish can't be in position 1 (it's occupied by the iced-tea), so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But it can't be in position 4 (rule 5), so it must be in position 3.

7. From rule 18, the owner of the fish is to the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since the fish is in position 3, the person drinking 7up must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But it can't be in position 1 (it's occupied by the iced-tea), so it must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume it's in position 4 for now.

8. From rule 12, the person drinking water is not to the left of the British. Since the person drinking 7up is not in position 1 (it's occupied by the iced-tea), the only remaining position for the British is position 1.

9. From rule 19, the Brazilian is to the left of the person drinking water. So, the person drinking water must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But it can't be in position 4 (it's occupied by the person drinking 7up), so it must be in position 2 or 3. Let's assume it's in position 3 for now.

10. From rule 13, the fan pop is not to the right of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian is in position 2, the fan pop can't be in position 3, 4, or 5. So, it must be in position 1.

11. From rule 8, the owner of the cat is not to the right of the fan pop. Since the fan pop is in position 1, the cat can't be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, it must be in position 5.

12. From rule 14, the person doing magic-tricks and the fan reggae have the same parity positions. Since the fan pop is in an even position (1), the person doing magic-tricks must be in an odd position (3).

13. From rule 9, the fan reggae is between the person doing puzzles and the Italian. Since the Italian is in an even position (2), the person doing puzzles must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). But it can't be in position 1 (it's occupied by the iced-tea), so it must be in position 3.

14. From rule 11, the fan reggae is in an odd position (it's the person drinking iced-tea). So, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1.

15. From rule 6, the person doing puzzles is to the right of the person doing magic-tricks. Since the person doing magic-tricks is in position 3, the person doing puzzles must be in position 4.

16. From rule 17, the owner of the frog and the fan reggae have the same parity positions. Since the fan reggae is in an odd position (1), the owner of the frog must also be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). But it can't be in position 5 (it's occupied by the cat), so it must be in position 1.

17. From rule 16, the Italian is in an even position (2).

18. From rule 20, the owner of the pony is to the right of the owner of the fish. Since the owner of the fish is in position 3, the owner of the pony must be in position 4 or 5. But it can't be in position 5 (it's occupied by the cat), so it must be in position 4.

19. From rule 16, the Canadian is in an even position (2).

20. From rule 22, the person doing rock-climbing is to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 4, the person doing rock-climbing must be in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:
