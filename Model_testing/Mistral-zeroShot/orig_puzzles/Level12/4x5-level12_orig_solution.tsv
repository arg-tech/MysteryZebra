Lv12-4x5-1	"To solve this puzzle, we will use the given constraints to eliminate possibilities and fill in the table step by step. Let's start by assigning the beverages, hobbies, music-genres, and pets to the positions.

1. Almond-milk and bird can only be in even positions (parity 0) or odd positions (parity 1) with the same parity. Let's assign almond-milk to position 1 (parity 1) and bird to position 3 (parity 1).

2. Dubstep and frog can't have the same parity. Since we already assigned bird and almond-milk, let's assign frog to position 5 (parity 0).

3. Milk must be to the left of fish (position 4). Let's assign milk to position 2 (parity 1).

4. Hip-hop must be to the left of filmmaking. Since we already assigned almond-milk, bird, and milk, let's assign hip-hop to position 0 (parity 1) and filmmaking to position 6 (parity 0).

5. Classical can't be the owner of the frog. Since we already assigned frog, let's assign classical to position 7 (parity 0).

6. Classical can't be to the right of hot-chocolate. Since we already assigned hot-chocolate to position 4, let's assign hot-chocolate to position 4 (parity 0).

7. The owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is board-games or the fan classical is the owner of the bird, but not both. Since we already assigned bird and classical, let's assign board-games to position 3 (parity 1).

8. The owner of the fish is the fan punk. We already assigned fish and punk, so let's assign punk to position 4 (parity 0).

9. The owner of the frog is on the left of the owner of the fish. Since we already assigned frog and fish, let's assign frog to position 5 (parity 0) and fish to position 3 (parity 1).

10. Dubstep is somewhere to the left of the owner of the horse. Since we already assigned dubstep and frog, let's assign horse to position 0 (parity 1).

11. The owner of the fish is not the person drinking almond-milk or the person drinking almond-milk is not the fan punk or both. Since we already assigned almond-milk and fish, let's assign almond-milk to position 1 (parity 1) and fish to position 3 (parity 1).

12. The person drinking almond-milk is not to the right of the owner of the frog. Since we already assigned almond-milk and frog, the positions are correct.

13. The fan hip-hop is not to the left of the fan classical. Since we already assigned hip-hop and classical, the positions are correct.

14. The person who's hobby is dancing is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we already assigned hobbies, the positions are correct.

15. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we already assigned filmmaking and dancing, the positions are correct.

16. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since we already assigned fish and lemonade, let's assign lemonade to position 5 (parity 0).

17. The person who's hobby is card-games and the fan dubstep have different parity positions. Since we already assigned card-games and dubstep, the positions are correct.

18. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since we already assigned milk and turtle, let's assign turtle to position 2 (parity 1).

19. The person drinking milk is between the fan hip-hop and the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we already assigned milk, hip-hop, and card-games, the positions are correct.

20. The person drinking milk is in the middle. Since we already assigned milk to position 2 (parity 1), this condition is already satisfied.

21. The person who's hobby is gardening is the fan soul or the person who's hobby is gardening is the owner of the fish or both. Since we already assigned gardening and fish, let's assign gardening to position 5 (parity 0) and soul to position 7 (parity 0).

22. The fan classical is the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we already assigned classical and hot-chocolate, the positions are correct.

23. The person who's hobby is board-games is not to the right of the fan classical. Since we already assigned board-games and classical, the positions are correct.

24. The owner of the frog is not to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we already assigned frog and card-games, the positions are correct.

25. The fan punk is not to the left of the fan dubstep. Since we already assigned punk and dubstep, the positions are correct.

Now, we have filled the table as follows:

|               |      1      |       2       |     3     |    4     |     5      |

This is the final solution table."
Lv12-4x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person in the table. Let's start by assigning numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the far left and 5 being the far right).

1. The argentine is not the fan of blues or the gardener, so they cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Since there are only 5 people, the argentine must be in position 3 or 5.

2. The dutch is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since rowing is not mentioned yet, we can't place the dutch yet.

3. The gardener is somewhere between the fan of blues and the person who's sport is swimming. Since the argentine cannot be the gardener, the gardener must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

4. The person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since volleyball is not mentioned yet, we can't place the swimmer yet.

5. The nigerian is between the fan of ambient and the fan of dubstep. Since the argentine cannot be the nigerian, the nigerian must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

6. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left or far right. Since the argentine and nigerian cannot be board-games, they must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

7. The mexican is not to the left of the french. Since the argentine, nigerian, and board-games cannot be the mexican, the mexican must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

8. The person who's sport is skiing is the mexican or the person who's sport is skiing is the person who's hobby is camping or both. Since the mexican cannot be in position 1 or 2, the skier must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

9. The argentine is not to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the argentine cannot be in position 5, the argentine must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

10. The person who's hobby is gardening is not the argentine or the argentine is not the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the argentine cannot be the gardener or the volleyball player, the gardener and volleyball player must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not in the same position as the argentine.

11. The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the fan of metal. Since the argentine, nigerian, and board-games cannot be camping, the camping person must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

12. The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep. Since the argentine, nigerian, gardener, and camping person cannot be basketball, the basketball player must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

13. The fan of metal is on the left or right of the dutch. Since the argentine, nigerian, and board-games cannot be the fan of metal, the fan of metal must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not in the same position as the dutch.

14. The nigerian is somewhere between the fan of techno and the fan of ambient. Since the nigerian cannot be in position 1, the nigerian must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

15. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the fan of ambient. Since the argentine, nigerian, and board-games cannot be woodworking, the woodworking person must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

16. The mexican is not to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the mexican cannot be in position 1 or 2, the skier must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

17. The person who's sport is swimming and the fan of dubstep have different parity positions. Since the swimmer and the fan of dubstep cannot be in the same position, the swimmer must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), and the fan of dubstep must be in an even position (2 or 4).

18. The argentine is the fan of dubstep or the argentine is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the argentine cannot be in position 5, the argentine must be in position 1 or 2, and the magic-tricks person must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

19. The fan of blues is between the dutch and the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the argentine, nigerian, and woodworking cannot be the fan of blues, the fan of blues must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not in the same position as the dutch and board-games.

20. The fan of techno is not to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the argentine, nigerian, gardener, camping, and woodworking cannot be the fan of techno, the fan of techno must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

21. The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the fan of metal. Since the skier cannot be in position 1 or 2, the skier must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

22. The person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the argentine, nigerian, gardener, and camping cannot be board-games, the board-games person must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

23. The fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the mexican. Since the fan of blues cannot be in position 1, the fan of blues must be in position 2.

Now we have the following positions for some people:
- Position 1: Argentine (dubstep or magic-tricks), woodworking, fan of blues
- Position 2: Gardener, fan of blues, nigerian
- Position 3: Skier (Mexican or camper), fan of metal, board-games
- Position 4: Fan of techno
- Position 5: Swimmer

We still have some unknowns, but we can deduce the following:
- The skier cannot be the Mexican because the skier is to the right of the fan of metal, and the Mexican is to the left of the fan of metal. So the skier must be the camper.
- The swimmer cannot be in position 1 or 3 because the swimmer and the fan of dubstep have different parity positions, and the argentine and the camper are in positions 1 and 3. So the swimmer must be in position 5.
- The nigerian cannot be in position 4 because the nigerian is between the fan of techno and the fan of ambient, and the fan of techno is in position 4. So the nigerian must be in position 2.
- The gardener cannot be in position 2 because the gardener is between the fan of blues and the person who's sport is swimming, and the nigerian is in position 2. So the gardener must be in position 3.
- The fan of ambient must be to the left of the nigerian because the nigerian is between the fan of techno and the fan of ambient. Since the nigerian is in position 2, the fan of ambient must be in position 1.
- The dutch cannot be in position 1 because the fan of blues is in position 1. Since the dutch is to the right of the person who's sport is rowing, and rowing is not mentioned yet, we can't place the dutch yet.
- The fan of metal cannot be in position 5 because the skier is in position 5. Since the fan of metal is on the left or right of the dutch, and the dutch is not in position 1, the fan of metal must be in position 4.
- The rowing person must be to the left of the dutch because the dutch is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the rowing person cannot be in position 1 or 5, the rowing person must be in position 2 or 4.
- The board-games person cannot be in position 2 because the gardener is in position 2. Since the board-games person is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball, and the swimmer is in position 5, the board-games person must be in position 1 or 3.
- The volleyball player cannot be in position 1 or 5 because the argentine is not the volleyball player, and the argentine is in position 1 or 5. Since the volleyball player is not to the left of the fan of dubstep, and the swimmer is in position 5, the volleyball player must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- The fan of ambient cannot be in position 5 because the skier is in position 5. Since the fan of ambient is to the left of the nigerian, and the nigerian is in position 2, the fan of ambient must be in position 1.
- The fan of techno cannot be in position 1 or 3 because the fan of techno is not to the right of the person who's sport is basketball, and the board-games person is in position 1 or 3. So the fan of techno must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- The fan of dubstep cannot be in position 1 or 3 because the argentine is not the fan of dubstep, and the argentine is in position 1 or 3. Since the fan of dubstep is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming, and the swimmer is in position 5, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- The dutch cannot be in position 4 because the fan of metal is in position 4. Since the dutch is to the right of the person who's sport is rowing, and rowing is not in position 1 or 5, the dutch must be in position 2 or 3.
- The rowing person cannot be in position 4 because the fan of metal is in position 4. Since the rowing person is to the left of the dutch, and the dutch is not in position 1, the rowing person must be in position 2.
- The board-games person cannot be in position 3 because the gardener is in position 3. Since the board-games person is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball, and the rowing person is in position 2, the board-games person must be in position 1.
- The volleyball player cannot be in position 4 because the fan of techno is in position 4. Since the volleyball player is not to the left of the fan of dubstep, and the fan of dubstep is not in position 1 or 5, the volleyball player must be in position 2.
- The fan of techno cannot be in position 2 because the volleyball player is in position 2. Since the fan of techno is not to the right of the person who's sport is basketball, and the rowing person is in position 2, the fan of techno must be in position 5.
- The fan of dubstep cannot be in position 2 because the volleyball player is in position 2. Since the fan of dubstep is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming, and the swimmer is in position 5, the fan of dubstep must be in position 4.
- The dutch cannot be in position 3 because the rowing person is in position 3. Since the dutch is to the right of the person who's sport is rowing, and the rowing person is in position 2, the dutch must be in position 1.

Now we have the final solution table:

Lv12-4x5-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign a number to each person (1 to 5) and list the unique hobbies, jobs, sports, and transports in separate lists.

   Hobbies: [camping, chess, collecting, photography, reading]
   Jobs: [electrician, entrepreneur, lawyer, pilot, videographer]
   Sports: [badminton, climbing, ice-hockey, rowing, water-polo]
   Transports: [boat, car, jet-ski, snowmobile, taxi]

2. Now, let's use the given clues to fill in the table step by step. We'll use the numbers 1 to 5 to represent the people, and we'll use '?' for unknown positions.

   |             |     1      |     2     |      3       |      4      |      5       |

   | Transport   |            |           |              |             |              |

3. Let's start with the positions of the electrician and the rowing sport. Since the electrician is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing, we can place the electrician and rowing in positions 1 and 3, 2 and 4, or 2 and 5. Let's place the electrician in position 2 and rowing in position 3 for now.

   |             |     1      |     2     |      3       |      4      |      5       |

4. The person who's hobby is reading is not to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we placed the electrician (who has a different hobby) to the right of the person who's hobby is chess, the person who's hobby is reading must be in position 1.

   |             |     1     |     2     |      3       |      4      |      5       |

5. The person driving the car is the person who's sport is badminton or the person driving the car is the person who's hobby is reading, but not both. Since we already placed the person who's hobby is reading in position 1, the person who's sport is badminton must be in position 2 (driving the car).

   |             |     1     |     2     |      3       |      4      |      5       |

6. The entrepreneur is the person who's hobby is chess or the person who's hobby is chess is the person who's sport is badminton or both. Since we already placed the person who's sport is badminton in position 2, the entrepreneur must be in position 3 (with the hobby of chess).

   |             |     1     |     2     |      3       |      4      |      5       |

   | Job         |            |           | entrepreneur|             |              |

7. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the entrepreneur (with the hobby of chess) is in position 3, the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 1.

   |             |     1     |     2     |      3       |      4      |      5       |

8. The person who's sport is water-polo is the person driving the jet-ski or the person driving the jet-ski is the person who's hobby is camping, but not both. Since we already placed the person driving the jet-ski in position 1, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 1 (driving the jet-ski).

   |             |     1     |     2     |      3       |      4      |      5       |

9. The person who's hobby is photography is not the person driving the snowmobile. Since we haven't placed the person who's hobby is photography yet, the person driving the snowmobile can't be the person who's hobby is photography. Let's place the person who's hobby is photography in position 5 for now.

   |             |     1     |     2     |      3       |      4      |      5       |
   | Hobby       | reading  | badminton| chess       | water-polo  | photography  |
   | Job         | jet-ski  |           | entrepreneur|             |             |
   | Sport       | water-polo|           |             |             |              |

Lv12-4x5-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the variables for each category and person:

1. Beverage: A (almond-milk), F (fanta), L (lemonade), T (tea), W (water)
2. Food: L (lime), O (onion), P (pear), R (raspberry), S (peas)
3. Movie-Genre: C (comedy), R (romance), T (thriller), E (epic), Cm (crime)
4. Sport: B (basketball), H (handball), Rg (rugby), Sb (snowboarding), V (volleyball)

Now let's analyze the clues and make deductions:

1. F is on the left or right of Rg (clue 3)
2. O is on the left of A (clue 2)
3. C is not to the right of B (clue 3)
4. F is on the right of L (clue 4)

22. W is not to the right of R (clue 23)
23. R is on the right of T (clue 24)
24. The person watching T is between R and E (clue 25)
25. R is not the person eating L (clue 28)
26. A is on the left or right of W (clue 29)
27. B is not playing V (clue 30)
28. P is on the left of S (clue 27)
29. S is not the person eating P (clue 31)

Now let's use the information from the clues to fill in the table:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |      4       |   5   |
| Beverage      | A       | F           | L          | T          | W     |
| Food          | L       | O           | P          | S          | R     |

| Sport         | B       | H           | Rg         | Sb         | V     |

Now we have the initial table filled with the given information. To find the final solution, we need to use the remaining clues to place the items in the correct order.

Let's start with the sports:
- Since B is on the left of F (clue 17), we can place B in position 1 and F in position 3.
- Since B is somewhere to the left of Rg (clue 5), we can place Rg in position 5.
- Since O is the person playing H (clue 20), we can place H in position 2.
- Since V is the person playing A or V is the person watching R, but not both (clue 21), we can place V in position 4.
- Since Sb is not the person playing V (clue 30), we can place Sb in position 3.

Now let's work on the beverages:
- Since A is somewhere between B and W (clue 11), we can place A in position 2 or 4. Since A is not to the left of W (clue 16), we can place A in position 4.
- Since F is on the left or right of Rg (clue 3), we know that F cannot be in position 1 or 5. Since F is on the right of L (clue 4), we can place F in position 3.
- Since W is not the person eating R (clue 14), we know that W cannot be in position 5. Since W is not to the right of R (clue 23), we can place W in position 2.

Now let's work on the foods:
- Since O is on the left of A (clue 2), we can place O in position 1.
- Since S is not the person eating P (clue 31), we can place S in position 5.
- Since P is on the left of S (clue 27), we can place P in position 4.
- Since R is not the person eating L (clue 28), we can place R in position 3.

Now let's work on the movie genres:
- Since C is not to the right of B (clue 3), we know that C cannot be in position 5. Since R is on the right of T (clue 24), we can place T in position 5.
- Since T is not the person watching T (clue 13), we know that T cannot be in position 1 or 5. Since R is on the right of T (clue 24), we can place R in position 4.
- Since Cm is somewhere to the left of F (clue 22), we can place Cm in position 1.
- Since C is not the person watching Cm or the person eating L is not the person watching Cm or both (clue 15), we know that C cannot be in position 5. Since C is not the person eating L (clue 28), we can place C in position 2.
- Since R is on the right of T (clue 24), we know that T cannot be in position 1 or 2. Since T is not the person watching T (clue 13), we can place T in position 3.

Now we have the final solution table:

#############

This is the final solution table for the given logic puzzle."
Lv12-4x5-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the leftmost position and 5 being the rightmost position).

2. From rule 25, we know that the person eating peach is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Since the person driving the car can't be in position 1 (rule 20), the person eating peach can't be in position 5 either (because the person eating pineapple is to the right of the person eating carrot, and pineapple can't be in position 5). So, the person eating peach can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. From rule 10, we know that the person eating nectarine is to the left of the person eating peach. So, the person eating nectarine can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

4. From rule 28, we know that the person watching drama movies is not the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the person watching drama movies can't be in position 1 (rule 21), the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 either. So, the person who's sport is volleyball can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

5. From rule 29, we know that the person driving the train and the person who's sport is baseball have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the train can't be in position 1 (rule 16), the person who's sport is baseball can't be in position 5 either. So, both the person driving the train and the person who's sport is baseball can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

6. From rule 24, we know that the person eating carrot is not the person watching drama movies and not the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the person watching drama movies can't be in position 1 (rule 21), the person who's sport is skateboarding can't be in position 5 either. So, the person eating carrot can be in positions 2, 3, or 4, and the person who's sport is skateboarding can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4 because of rule 24).

7. From rule 30, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. So, the person who's sport is snowboarding can be in positions 4 or 5.

8. From rule 3, we know that the person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching drama movies can't be in position 1 (rule 21), the person watching sports movies can't be in position 5 either. So, the person watching sports movies can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

9. From rule 14, we know that the person watching sports movies is the person driving the bus or the person watching sports movies is the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding can't be in position 5 (because the person who's sport is skateboarding is to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding), the person watching sports movies must be the person driving the bus. So, the person driving the bus is in position 2, 3, or 4, and the person watching sports movies is in the same position.

10. From rule 17, we know that the person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 4 or 5, the person watching adventure movies can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

11. From rule 1, we know that the person driving the car is not the person watching animation movies. Since the person driving the car can't be in position 1 (rule 20), the person watching animation movies can't be in position 5 either. So, the person watching animation movies can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

12. From rule 5, we know that the person watching animation movies is the person driving the roller or the person who's sport is ice-hockey or both. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey can't be in position 5 (because the person who's sport is skateboarding is to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey), the person watching animation movies must be the person driving the roller or the person who's sport is ice-hockey.

13. From rule 13, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is not the person driving the quad-bike or the person who's sport is skateboarding is not the person eating eggplant. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding, the person driving the quad-bike can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the person driving the quad-bike is in position 3, 4, or 5, and the person who's sport is skateboarding is in a position to the left of position 3.

14. From rule 15, we know that the person eating peach is not the person driving the train or the person who's sport is snowboarding is not the person eating peach. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 4 or 5, the person eating peach can't be in position 4 or 5 either. So, the person eating peach can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

15. From rule 18, we know that the person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 4 or 5, the person watching adventure movies can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

16. From rule 19, we know that the person eating pineapple is not the person driving the bus or the person watching time-travel movies is not the person eating pineapple. Since the person driving the bus is in position 2, 3, or 4, the person watching time-travel movies can't be in position 2, 3, or 4 either. So, the person watching time-travel movies can be in position 1 or 5.

17. From rule 7, we know that the person watching animation movies and the person who's sport is volleyball have the same parity positions. Since the person watching animation movies can't be in position 1 (because the person driving the roller or the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 1), the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 either. So, both the person watching animation movies and the person who's sport is volleyball can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

18. From rule 22, we know that the person eating eggplant and the person who's sport is snowboarding have the same parity positions. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 4 or 5, the person eating eggplant can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the person eating eggplant can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

19. From rule 23, we know that the person driving the train is on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person watching time-travel movies can't be in position 2, 3, or 4 (because the person driving the bus is in position 2, the person watching adventure movies is to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding, and the person watching animation movies and the person who's sport is volleyball have the same parity positions), the person driving the train can be in position 1 or 5.

20. From rule 26, we know that the person watching adventure movies is not the person driving the train. Since the person driving the train can't be in position 1 (because the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the person driving the car), the person watching adventure movies can't be in position 5 either. So, the person watching adventure movies can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

21. From rule 27, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person who's sport is baseball can't be in position 1 (because the person driving the train is to the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies), the person watching time-travel movies can't be in position 5 either. So, the person watching time-travel movies can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |     4      |      5       |
| Food          | carrot       | eggplant  | nectarine  | peach      | pineapple    |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure    | drama     | animation   | sports     | time-travel   |
| Sport         | skateboarding | snowboarding| ice-hockey  | baseball   | volleyball    |
| Transport     | quad-bike    | bus       | roller      | train      | car          |

This is the final solution table, where '#############' is not needed because the table itself represents the solution."
Lv12-4x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 5 people and the parity of the positions of the Australian and the owner of the rat are different, we can assign the Australian to an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and the rat owner to an even position (2, 4).

2. The electrician cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 8 and rule 12), so the electrician can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. The freelancer cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 8) and cannot be to the left of the electrician (because of rule 2), so the freelancer can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

4. The engineer cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 13) and cannot be to the left of the freelancer (because the freelancer cannot be in position 1), so the engineer can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

5. The police-officer cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 11) and cannot be the owner of the cat (because of rule 16), so the police-officer can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

6. The lawyer cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 17) and cannot be to the left of the engineer (because the engineer cannot be in position 1), so the lawyer can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

7. The Italian cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 14) and cannot be to the left of the engineer (because the engineer cannot be in position 1), so the Italian can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

8. The Chinese cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 11) and cannot be to the right of the owner of the rat (because the rat owner is in an even position), so the Chinese can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

9. The Russian cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 11, 12, and 16) and cannot be the owner of the hedgehog (because of rule 19), so the Russian can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

10. The owner of the cat must be between the Italian and the engineer (because of rule 14), so the owner of the cat can only be in position 3.

11. The owner of the dog cannot be to the left of the engineer (because of rule 13), so the owner of the dog can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

12. The owner of the hedgehog must be to the right of the police-officer (because of rule 19), so the owner of the hedgehog can only be in position 5.

13. The person eating cucumber must be on the left of the owner of the rat (because of rule 4) and on the left of the engineer (because of rule 15), so the person eating cucumber can only be in position 1 or 2.

14. The person eating grapefruit cannot be to the right of the electrician (because of rule 18), so the person eating grapefruit can only be in position 1, 2, or 3.

15. The person eating lime cannot be to the right of the electrician (because of rule 7) and must have the same parity as the freelancer (because of rule 9), so the person eating lime can only be in position 2, 4, or 5.

16. The person eating watermelon must be on the far left (because of rule 20), so the person eating watermelon is in position 1.

Now we have the following information:
- Position 1: Australian, Watermelon
- Position 2: Freelancer (or electrician or lime), Lime
- Position 3: Italian, Cat
- Position 4: Engineer (or electrician or lime), Grapefruit
- Position 5: Police-officer, Hedgehog

We still have some ambiguity because we don't know the exact positions of the electrician, the person eating lime, and the owner of the dog. However, we can use the parity rules to solve this:
- The parity of the positions of the electrician and the Australian are the same (rule 12), so the electrician cannot be in position 2 (since the Australian is in position 1). Therefore, the electrician can only be in position 4.
- The parity of the positions of the person eating lime and the freelancer are the same (rule 9), so the person eating lime cannot be in position 2 (since the freelancer is in position 2). Therefore, the person eating lime can only be in position 5.
- The parity of the positions of the owner of the dog and the lawyer are the same (rule 17), so the owner of the dog cannot be in position 2 (since the lawyer is not in position 1). Therefore, the owner of the dog can only be in position 4.

Now we have the final solution:

Lv12-4x5-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several steps.

Step 1:
From rule 1, we know that the nurse is not eating tomato. So, let's place the tomato eater in the 4th column (since the nurse can't be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column).

Step 2:
From rule 2, the gardener is eating apricot. Since the nurse can't be in the 4th column, the gardener must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column. Let's place the gardener in the 1st column (since the tomato eater is in the 4th column).

Step 3:
From rule 3, the soy-milk drinker is to the left of the sudoku hobbyist. Since the gardener is in the 1st column, the sudoku hobbyist must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Let's place the sudoku hobbyist in the 4th column (since the tomato eater is in the 4th column, and we want to minimize the number of column swaps).

Step 4:
From rule 4, the journalist is the person eating apricot or the journalist is the person who's hobby is collecting or both. Since the gardener is eating apricot, the journalist must be the person who's hobby is collecting or both. Let's place the journalist in the 2nd column (since the gardener is in the 1st column and the sudoku hobbyist is in the 4th column).

Step 5:
From rule 5, the person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the right of the designer. Since the journalist is in the 2nd column and the gardener is in the 1st column, the designer must be in the 3rd column.

Step 6:
From rule 6, the person drinking water is the person who's hobby is sudoku or the nurse is the person drinking water, but not both. Since the sudoku hobbyist is in the 4th column, the water drinker can't be in the 4th column. So, the water drinker must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column. Let's place the water drinker in the 1st column (since the gardener is in the 1st column, and we want to minimize the number of column swaps).

Step 7:
From rule 7, the juice drinker is on the right of the iced-tea drinker. Since the water drinker is in the 1st column, the iced-tea drinker must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Let's place the iced-tea drinker in the 2nd column (since the gardener is in the 1st column, the sudoku hobbyist is in the 4th column, and the water drinker is in the 1st column).

Step 8:
From rule 8, the nurse is on the left or right of the writer. Since the water drinker is in the 1st column, the nurse can't be in the 1st column. So, the nurse must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Let's place the nurse in the 3rd column (since the gardener is in the 1st column, the sudoku hobbyist is in the 4th column, the water drinker is in the 1st column, and the iced-tea drinker is in the 2nd column).

Step 9:
From rule 9, the person drinking water is the manager. Since the water drinker is in the 1st column, the manager is also in the 1st column.

Step 10:
From rule 10, the person eating apricot is not to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the journalist is in the 2nd column and the designer is in the 3rd column, the apricot eater can't be in the 4th column. So, the apricot eater must be in the 1st or 2nd column. Since the gardener is in the 1st column, the apricot eater must be in the 2nd column.

Step 11:
From rule 11, the person eating mango is not to the left of the person eating cabbage. Since the tomato eater is in the 4th column, the cabbage eater must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column. Let's place the cabbage eater in the 1st column (since the gardener is in the 1st column, the journalist is in the 2nd column, the water drinker is in the 1st column, the manager is in the 1st column, and the apricot eater is in the 2nd column).

Step 12:
From rule 12, the journalist is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the journalist is in the 2nd column and the gardener is in the 1st column, this rule is already satisfied.

Step 13:
From rule 13, the writer is not the person eating apricot or the person who's hobby is collecting is not the writer or both. Since the journalist is the person who's hobby is collecting, the writer can't be the journalist. So, the writer must be in the 5th column.

Step 14:
From rule 14, the writer is not to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the journalist is in the 2nd column and the writer is in the 5th column, this rule is already satisfied.

Step 15:
From rule 15, the person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since the water drinker is in the 1st column, the mirinda drinker must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Let's place the mirinda drinker in the 3rd column (since the gardener is in the 1st column, the journalist is in the 2nd column, the water drinker is in the 1st column, the manager is in the 1st column, the apricot eater is in the 2nd column, the cabbage eater is in the 1st column, and the writer is in the 5th column).

Step 16:
From rule 16, the person who's hobby is puzzles is not to the right of the person eating tomato. Since the tomato eater is in the 4th column, the puzzles hobbyist can't be in the 5th column. So, the puzzles hobbyist must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column. Let's place the puzzles hobbyist in the 1st column (since the gardener is in the 1st column, the journalist is in the 2nd column, the water drinker is in the 1st column, the manager is in the 1st column, the apricot eater is in the 2nd column, the cabbage eater is in the 1st column, the writer is in the 5th column, and the mirinda drinker is in the 3rd column).

Step 17:
From rule 17, the nurse is the person eating apricot or the person eating apricot is the person drinking soy-milk or both. Since the journalist is the person eating apricot, the nurse can't be the person eating apricot. So, the nurse must be the person drinking soy-milk. Since the soy-milk drinker is in the 2nd column, the nurse must be in the 4th column.

Step 18:
From rule 18, the soy-milk drinker is not the designer. Since the soy-milk drinker is in the 2nd column and the designer is in the 3rd column, this rule is already satisfied.

Step 19:
From rule 19, the water drinker is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the water drinker is in the 1st column and the soy-milk drinker is in the 2nd column, this rule is already satisfied.

Step 20:
From rule 20, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the puzzles hobbyist is in the 1st column and the collector (journalist) is in the 2nd column, this rule is already satisfied.

Step 21:
From rule 21, the person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the mirinda drinker is in the 3rd column and the iced-tea drinker is in the 2nd column, this rule is already satisfied.

Step 22:
From rule 22, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the puzzles hobbyist is in the 1st column, the rock-climbing hobbyist must be in the 5th column.

Step 23:
From rule 23, the person who's hobby is collecting is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the journalist is in the 2nd column and the gardener is in the 1st column, this rule is already satisfied.

Step 24:
From rule 24, the journalist is not the person who's hobby is sudoku or the person who's hobby is sudoku is not the person drinking soy-milk or both. Since the journalist is not the sudoku hobbyist (since the journalist is the collector), and the sudoku hobbyist is in the 4th column and the soy-milk drinker is in the 2nd column, this rule is already satisfied.

Step 25:
From rule 25, the writer is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the journalist is the person who's hobby is collecting and the writer is in the 5th column, this rule is already satisfied.

Step 26:
From rule 26, the person eating mango is on the right of the manager. Since the manager is in the 1st column and the mango eater is in the 5th column, this rule is already satisfied.

Now, let's put all the information together:

Lv12-4x5-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person in the table based on the given conditions. Let's start by assigning numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the far left and 5 being the far right).

1. The person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the right of the Canadian. This means the woodworking person must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
2. The person drinking soy-milk is the American. So the American is in position 1, 2, or 3, and the soy-milk is in the same position.
3. The fan disco is the person drinking milk or the fan disco is the Colombian or both. Since the American is already drinking soy-milk, the only option left for milk is position 5. This means the Colombian must be in position 4 or 5.
4. The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the fan metal. Since the milk is in position 5, the fan metal must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
5. The person drinking milk is not the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the milk is in position 5, the collecting person cannot be in position 5.
6. The person drinking milk is the person who's hobby is board-games. So the board-games person is in position 5.
7. The person drinking milk is not the person who's hobby is writing. Since the milk is in position 5, the writing person cannot be in position 5.
8. The fan folk is somewhere to the left of the Chinese. Since the Colombian is in position 4 or 5, the Chinese must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
9. The person drinking milk is on the right of the Canadian. Since the milk is in position 5, the Canadian must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
10. The chinese and the person who's hobby is woodworking have different parity positions. Since the Chinese is in position 1, 2, or 3, the woodworking person must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (an even position).
11. The fan classical is the person drinking fanta or the Chinese is the fan classical or both. Since the American and Colombian are already assigned, the only options left for fanta are positions 1, 2, or 3.
12. The colombian is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the Colombian is in position 4 or 5, the soy-milk person must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
13. The person who's hobby is writing and the fan salsa have different parity positions. Since the writing person is in an odd position (not in position 5), the fan salsa must be in an even position (not in position 1, 3, or 5).
14. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the fan disco. Since the milk is in position 5, the fan disco must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

18. The person drinking iced-tea is not the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the board-games person is in position 5, the iced-tea person cannot be in position 5.
19. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Since the writing person is in an odd position, the juice person must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
20. The person drinking juice is not the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the juice person is in position 1, 2, or 3, the drawing person must be in position 4 or 5.
21. The person who's hobby is collecting is the fan salsa. Since the collecting person is in an even position, the fan salsa must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
22. The person who's hobby is drawing is the fan classical. Since the drawing person is in position 4 or 5, the fan classical must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Lv12-4x5-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign a number to each category (Beverage, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre) and each person (1 to 5). We'll use the same number for each category for a specific person.

2. Let's start with the jobs. From rule 8, the security-guard is either to the left or right of the designer. Since there are 5 positions, the designer must be in position 3 (leaving the other 4 for the security-guard). The bartender is to the left of the person who's hobby is camping (rule 1), so the bartender must be in position 1 or 2. The writer is not to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (rule 21), so the writer must be in position 4 or 5. The librarian is not specified yet, so she can be in any position.

3. The security-guard is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (rule 28), so the gardener is in position 1, 2, or 4. If the gardener is in position 1, the security-guard must be in position 5, and the writer must be in position 2 or 3. If the gardener is in position 2, the security-guard must be in position 4, and the writer must be in position 5. If the gardener is in position 4, the security-guard must be in position 1, and the writer must be in position 3.

4. The writer is the person watching fantasy movies or the writer is the person who's hobby is gardening (rule 23). If the writer is the gardener, we've already placed them in position 1, 2, or 4. If the writer is watching fantasy movies, they must be in position 3 (rule 5), and the gardener must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

5. The person drinking almond-milk and the person watching action movies have the same parity positions (rule 20). Since almond-milk is an odd numbered beverage (1), the action movie watcher must also be in an odd position. The action movie watcher is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing (rule 27), so the action movie watcher can't be in position 1 or 5. Therefore, the action movie watcher is in position 3, and the almond-milk drinker is in position 2.

6. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies (rule 3), so the cola drinker is in position 4 or 5. The cola drinker is not to the right of the writer (rule 11), so the cola drinker is in position 4.

7. The person watching epic movies is the person watching epic movies (rule 9), so we know their position. Since the epic movie watcher is not to the left of the person watching satire movies (rule 26), the epic movie watcher is in position 1, 3, or 5. However, the epic movie watcher is on the left or right of the person drinking cola (rule 10), so the epic movie watcher can't be in position 5. Therefore, the epic movie watcher is in position 1 or 3.

8. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the writer (rule 11), so the iced-tea drinker is in position 1, 2, or 4. The iced-tea drinker is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies (rule 13), so the iced-tea drinker can't be in position 1. Therefore, the iced-tea drinker is in position 2 or 4.

9. The person watching drama movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is camping (rule 12), so the drama movie watcher is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. The person drinking juice is not the person watching epic movies or the person watching epic movies is not the security-guard (rule 22), so the juice drinker can't be in position 1 or 5. Therefore, the juice drinker is in position 2, 3, or 4.

10. The person watching fantasy movies is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk (rule 18), so the fantasy movie watcher is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. The person watching fantasy movies is the writer or the writer is the person who's hobby is gardening (rule 23), so the fantasy movie watcher must be the writer if the gardener is not the writer.

11. The person watching action movies is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk (rule 18), so the action movie watcher is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, the action movie watcher is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing (rule 27), so the action movie watcher can't be in position 4. Therefore, the action movie watcher is in position 2, 3, or 5.

12. The person drinking juice is not in position 1 (since the gardener is in position 1), so the juice drinker is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. The person watching drama movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is camping (rule 12), so the drama movie watcher is in position 3, 4, or 5. However, the drama movie watcher is not the person watching epic movies (rule 9), so the drama movie watcher is in position 4 or 5.

13. The person watching fantasy movies is the writer (since the gardener is not the writer), so the fantasy movie watcher is in position 3. The person drinking iced-tea is in position 2 or 4, but not 1 (since the gardener is in position 1). Since the iced-tea drinker is not to the left of the writer (rule 11), the iced-tea drinker must be in position 4.

14. The person watching action movies is in position 2, 3, or 5, but not 4 (since the cola drinker is in position 4). The action movie watcher is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing (rule 27), so the action movie watcher can't be in position 5. Therefore, the action movie watcher is in position 2 or 3.

15. The person watching epic movies is in position 1 or 3. The person watching epic movies is not to the left of the person watching satire movies (rule 26), so the epic movie watcher is in position 3.

16. The person watching drama movies is in position 4. The person watching action movies is in position 2.

17. The person drinking cola is in position 4. The person drinking iced-tea is in position 4. The person drinking juice is in position 2. The person drinking almond-milk is in position 2.

18. The person who's hobby is camping is in position 1. The person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the person drinking cola (rule 29), so the card-games person is in position 1, 2, or 3. However, the card-games person is not to the right of the person drinking cola (rule 29), so the card-games person is in position 1. The person who's hobby is gardening is not to the right of the writer (rule 21), so the gardening person is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, the gardening person is not to the right of the writer (rule 21), so the gardening person is in position 2. The person who's hobby is video-games is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing (rule 30), so the video-games person is in position 3, 4, or 5. However, the video-games person is not to the right of the person drinking cola (rule 29), so the video-games person is in position 3. The librarian is in position 5.

19. The security-guard is in position 5. The person watching satire movies is in position 5 (since the security-guard is to the right of the person watching satire movies (rule 25)).

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Job           | Movie-Genre   |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| almond-milk  | writing      | bartender     | action       |
| cola         | card-games   |              |              |
| iced-tea     | gardening    |              | fantasy      |
| juice        | camping      |              | drama        |
| tea          | video-games  | security-guard| satire       |

The librarian is not specified in the table because their job is not associated with a specific position."
Lv12-4x5-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and I'll try to solve it step by step. Let's denote the people with numbers from 1 to 5, and let's assign each person a nationality, hobby, movie-genre, and music-genre.

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of disco is somewhere to the right of the Egyptian (#5).
2. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is singing is not the person watching epic movies or the Argentine is not the person who's hobby is singing. Let's assume that the hobby of person 1 is singing. Then, person 1 cannot watch epic movies, and the Argentine cannot have singing as a hobby.

8. From rule 8, the person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching documentary movies (#1 or #2).
9. From rule 9, the person watching adventure movies is the Argentine or the person watching adventure movies is the fan techno or both. Since we know that the Argentine is watching adventure movies, the fan techno cannot be in position 1.
10. From rule 10, the person watching musical movies is not to the left of the fan punk (#4 or #5).
11. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is fishing is not the person watching documentary movies or the person who's hobby is fishing is not the American. Since we know that the American is not the baker (rule 19), the American cannot be in position 3.
12. From rule 12, the American is in the middle (#3).
13. From rule 13, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the fan disco (#1, #2, #4, or #5). Since we know that the American is not the fisherman (rule 11), the fisherman cannot be in position 3.
14. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since we know that the singer is in position 1, the fisherman must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

25. From rule 25, the person watching epic movies is not to the right of the person watching epic movies (#3).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |      1       |    2     |    3     |     4     |      5      |
