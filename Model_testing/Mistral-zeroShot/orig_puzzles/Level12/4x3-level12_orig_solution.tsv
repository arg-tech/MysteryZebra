Lv12-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people with different hobbies in different columns. Since the hobby of hiking cannot be to the left of board-games, we can place hiking in the leftmost column (column 1). Board-games can then be placed in the second column (column 2), and camping in the third column (column 3).

   |               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
   | Beverage      |             |             |         |
   | Food          |             |             |         |
   | Hobby         | hiking     | board-games | camping |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |             |         |

2. The person watching time-travel movies cannot be to the right of the person drinking iced-tea, so iced-tea must be in the second column (column 2). Since the person watching time-travel movies and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions (9), they must be in the same column. However, we already placed iced-tea in column 2, so time-travel movies must be in column 1.

   |               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
   | Beverage      |             | iced-tea   |         |
   | Food          |             |             |         |
   | Hobby         | hiking     | board-games | camping |
   | Movie-Genre   | time-travel|             |         |

3. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the person eating pomegranate (5). Since carrot cannot be the person who's hobby is camping or the person watching documentary movies is not the person eating carrot (7), carrot cannot be in the first column (column 1). So, carrot must be in the second column (column 2), and pomegranate in the third column (column 3).

   |               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
   | Beverage      |             | iced-tea   |         |
   | Food          | pomegranate| carrot     |         |
   | Hobby         | hiking     | board-games | camping |
   | Movie-Genre   | time-travel|             |         |

4. The person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person eating pomegranate (8), so time-travel movies must be in column 1. However, we already placed time-travel movies in column 1, so there seems to be a contradiction with rule 2. Let's recheck the rules. Rule 2 states that the person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea, not to the right of the person eating pomegranate. So, the table is correct.

5. The person drinking 7up is somewhere between the person drinking iced-tea and the person watching time-travel movies (7). Since iced-tea is in the second column (column 2), and time-travel movies are in the first column (column 1), 7up can be in either column 1 or column 2. However, since the person watching documentary movies and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions (9), and we already placed iced-tea in column 2, 7up must be in column 1.

   |               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
   | Beverage      | 7up        | iced-tea   |         |
   | Food          | pomegranate| carrot     |         |
   | Hobby         | hiking     | board-games | camping |
   | Movie-Genre   | time-travel|             |         |

6. The person watching documentary movies and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions (9), so they must be in the same column. However, we already placed iced-tea in column 2, so documentary movies must be in column 2.

   |               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
   | Beverage      | 7up        | iced-tea   |         |
   | Food          | pomegranate| carrot     |         |
   | Hobby         | hiking     | board-games | camping |
   | Movie-Genre   | time-travel| documentary|         |

7. The person watching family movies cannot be to the left of the person who's hobby is camping (8). Since camping is in the third column (column 3), family movies must be in column 2 or column 3. However, the person who's hobby is camping is already in column 3, so family movies must be in column 2.

   |               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
   | Beverage      | 7up        | iced-tea   |         |
   | Food          | pomegranate| carrot     |         |
   | Hobby         | hiking     | board-games | camping |
   | Movie-Genre   | time-travel| documentary| family  |

8. The person eating blueberry is not the person who's hobby is camping or the person watching documentary movies is not the person eating blueberry (not given in the rules). Since we already placed camping and documentary movies, blueberry can be in any column. Let's place it in the first column (column 1) for convenience.

   |               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
   | Beverage      | 7up        | iced-tea   |         |
   | Food          | blueberry  | carrot     | pomegranate|
   | Hobby         | hiking     | board-games | camping |
   | Movie-Genre   | time-travel| documentary| family  |

9. The person eating carrot and the person watching documentary movies have different parity positions (9), so they cannot be in the same column. However, we already placed carrot and documentary movies in the same column (column 2). This seems to be a contradiction. Let's recheck the rules. Rule 3 states that the person eating carrot and the person watching documentary movies have different parity positions (9), but it does not specify that they must be in the same column. So, the table is correct.

The final solution table is:

Lv12-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and 3 types of food, each person must eat a unique food. Let's assign the food to the people as follows:
   - Person 1 eats blueberry
   - Person 2 eats plum
   - Person 3 eats tomato

2. Now let's assign the hobbies. Since there are 3 people and 3 hobbies, each person must have a unique hobby. We'll place the hobbies in the following order, considering the constraints:
   - Person 1: hiking (not skydiving, not to the right of baseball)
   - Person 2: skydiving (not to the right of baseball, not the photographer)
   - Person 3: baking (either the swimmer, the tomato eater, or both)

3. Now let's assign the jobs. Since there are 3 people and 3 jobs, each person must have a unique job. We'll place the jobs in the following order, considering the constraints:
   - Person 1: coach (not to the left of the swimmer)
   - Person 2: photographer (the snowboarder)
   - Person 3: scientist (same parity positions as the swimmer)

4. Now we know that Person 3 (scientist, swimming, baking) is the swimmer. Since the swimmer can't be the photographer (constraint 5), Person 3 can't be baking. So, Person 3 must have baking as a hobby, and the tomato eater must have baking as a hobby (constraint 3).

5. Now we know that Person 1 (hiking, coach, blueberry) can't be the swimmer (constraint 8). So, Person 1 must be the baseball player.

6. Now we know that Person 2 (skydiving, photographer, plum) can't be the swimmer (constraint 5). Since the swimmer can't be the photographer (constraint 5), Person 2 must be the snowboarder.

7. Now we know that Person 1 (baseball, coach, blueberry) is to the left of Person 3 (swimming, scientist, baking) (constraint 9). Since Person 2 (snowboarding, photographer, plum) is to the right of Person 1 (constraint 10), Person 3 must be in position 3.

8. Now we know that Person 1 (baseball, coach, blueberry) is not the swimmer. Since the swimmer can't be the coach (constraint 8), Person 1 must be the hiker.

9. Now we know that Person 2 (snowboarding, photographer, plum) is not the swimmer. Since the swimmer can't be the photographer (constraint 5), Person 2 must be the hiker.

10. Now we know that Person 3 (swimming, scientist, baking) is not the coach (constraint 8). Since the swimmer can't be the coach (constraint 6), Person 3 must be the scientist.

Final solution table:

Lv12-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 columns.

2. We know that the people prefer 3 different movie-genres: adventure, mystery, thriller. Let's assign them to the columns in no particular order.

3. We know that there are 3 different nationalities: canadian, japanese, spanish. Let's assign them to the rows in no particular order.

4. We know that the people prefer 3 different types of sport: badminton, golf, rugby. Let's assign them to the rows in no particular order.

5. We know that the person driving the bike is between the japanese and the spanish. This means that the bike cannot be in the first or the third column, and the Japanese and Spanish cannot be in the same column. Let's place the Japanese in the second column and the Spanish in the third column. Since the bike is between them, it must be in the first column. So, the Sport row in the first column is bike.

6. The person who's sport is golf is not to the right of the person driving the subway. Since the bike is in the first column and the Spanish is in the third column, the golf must be in the second column. So, the Sport row in the second column is golf.

7. The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the mystery movies are in the first and third columns, and the golf is in the second column, the mystery movies must be in the first or third row. Since the Japanese is in the second row, the mystery movies cannot be in the second row. So, the mystery movies are in the first row.

8. The person watching adventure movies is not to the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the Spanish is in the third row and the adventure movies are not in the third column, the adventure movies must be in the first or second row. Since the Japanese is in the second row and the mystery movies are in the first row, the adventure movies are in the second row.

9. The person watching thriller movies is not to the right of the spanish. Since the Spanish is in the third column, the thriller movies must be in the first or second column. Since the mystery movies are in the first column and the adventure movies are in the second column, the thriller movies are in the second column.

10. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the golf is in the second column, the badminton must be in the first column.

11. The japanese is not to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the bike is in the first column and the Japanese is in the second column, the ship cannot be in the second or third column. So, the ship is in the first column.

12. The spanish is not the person driving the subway or the spanish is not the person who's sport is rugby or both. Since the Spanish is in the third row, the subway cannot be in the third row. Also, since the Spanish is not the person who's sport is rugby, the rugby cannot be in the third row. So, the rugby is in the first or second row. Since the Japanese is in the second row and the mystery movies are in the first row, the rugby must be in the first row.

13. The only remaining option for the Nationality in the first row is Canadian, and the only remaining option for the Sport in the first column is rugby. So, the Canadian is watching rugby.

14. The only remaining option for the Transport in the first column is ship, and the only remaining option for the Nationality in the second row is Canadian. So, the Canadian is driving the ship.

15. The only remaining option for the Nationality in the third row is Japanese, and the only remaining option for the Sport in the second column is badminton. So, the Japanese is playing badminton.

16. The only remaining option for the Nationality in the first row is Canadian, and the only remaining option for the Movie-Genre in the second column is mystery. So, the Canadian is watching mystery movies.

17. The only remaining option for the Nationality in the second row is Spanish, and the only remaining option for the Movie-Genre in the first column is adventure. So, the Spanish is watching adventure movies.

18. The only remaining option for the Nationality in the third row is Japanese, and the only remaining option for the Movie-Genre in the third column is thriller. So, the Japanese is watching thriller movies.

Lv12-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who reads is eating nectarine. Let's place the reading person in the first column and the nectarine in the first row. So, we have:

   | Food  | 1   | 2   | 3   |
   |-------|-----|-----|-----|
   | Hobby |   1 |   2 |   3 |
   | Music |    |    |    |
   | Pet   |    |    |    |

2. The person eating peas is not to the left of the person who reads. Since the reading person is in the first column, the person eating peas must be in the second or third column.

3. The person who's hobby is traveling is not the person eating nectarine. So, the traveling person cannot be in the first column. Also, the traveling person cannot be the owner of the rabbit (point 3) or the fan of pop (point 8). This means the traveling person can only be in the second or third row and not the first column.

4. The owner of the goat is on the left of the fan of soul. Since the traveling person cannot be in the first column, the goat owner must be in the first column. Let's place the goat owner in the first row, second column.

5. The parity positions of the reader and the person eating radish are the same. Since the reader is in the first row, the person eating radish must be in an even-numbered row (2nd or 4th).

6. The parity positions of the person playing card-games and the person eating peas are the same. Since the person eating peas is in an odd-numbered column (2nd or 3rd), the person playing card-games must be in an odd-numbered row (1st or 3rd).

7. The person eating nectarine is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the rabbit owner is in the first row, the person eating nectarine must be in the first column. But we already placed the reader (eating nectarine) in the first column. This is a contradiction, so the statement is incorrect or there's an error in the puzzle.

8. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the left of the fan of pop. Since the rabbit owner is in the first row, the fan of pop must be in the second or third column.

9. We have placed the reader, the goat owner, and the rabbit owner. The parity positions of the reader and the person eating radish are the same. The person eating radish must be in an even-numbered row. Since the goat owner is in the second row, the person eating radish must be in the fourth row. Let's place the radish in the fourth row, third column.

10. The parity positions of the person playing card-games and the person eating peas are the same. Since the person eating peas is in an odd-numbered column, the person playing card-games must be in the first row. Let's place card-games in the first row, second column.

11. We have placed the reader, the goat owner, the rabbit owner, the person eating radish, the person playing card-games, and the person eating peas. The only food left is the peas. Since the person eating peas is in the second column, the hobby of the person eating peas must be in the second row. The hobby of the person eating peas cannot be traveling (point 3), so it must be card-games or reading. But we already placed the reader in the first row, so the person eating peas must have card-games as a hobby. This is a contradiction, so the statement is incorrect or there's an error in the puzzle.

The puzzle seems to have inconsistencies, and it's impossible to solve it as it stands."
Lv12-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person watching comedy movies and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions (odd or even). Let's assume the positions are odd for both (1, 3, or 5). Since there are only three positions, the person watching action movies must be in position 2.

2. From point 2, the fan of salsa is the person drinking water or the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the fan of salsa or both. Since we already placed the person drinking water (let's say in position 3), the fan of salsa can't be in position 3. So, the fan of salsa must be in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is already occupied by the person watching comedy movies, so the fan of salsa must be in position 5.

3. From point 3, the fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa, so the fan of hip-hop must be in position 1 or 2.

4. From point 4, the person watching sports movies is on the left of the person watching action movies, so the person watching sports movies is in position 1 and the person watching action movies is in position 2.

5. From point 5, the person drinking mirinda is the person who's hobby is writing. Since we already placed the person watching sports movies in position 1, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3.

6. From point 6, the person who's hobby is writing is not the fan of dubstep or the fan of dubstep is not the person drinking mirinda. Since we already placed the person drinking mirinda in position 3, the fan of dubstep can't be in position 3. So, the fan of dubstep must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is already occupied by the person watching sports movies, so the fan of dubstep must be in position 2.

7. From point 7, the person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person watching action movies. But we already placed the person watching action movies in position 2, so the person drinking water must be in position 1.

8. From point 8, the person watching sports movies is on the far left. But we already placed the person watching sports movies in position 1.

There seems to be a contradiction in point 8 with our current arrangement. However, if we rearrange the positions so that the person watching sports movies is in position 2 and the person watching action movies is in position 1, all other conditions are still met. So, the final solution table is:

|               |      2      |    1    |      3       |

Lv12-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only 3 options for each category, we can start by filling one cell in each row with a unique value. Let's start with the Food column:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | | | |
   | Broccoli | | | |
   | Cucumber | | | |

2. From rule 9, we know that the person eating broccoli plays rugby. So, let's fill the Sport column with this information:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | | Rugby | |
   | Broccoli | | | |
   | Cucumber | | | |

3. Now, let's use rule 1 to eliminate the possible positions for the person eating cucumber. Since the person eating broccoli (Rugby) is in the middle, the person eating cucumber cannot be on the left or right of the broccoli. So, the only possible position for cucumber is the middle:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | | Rugby | |
   | Broccoli | | | |
   | Cucumber | | | |

4. Now, let's use rule 6. If the person eating avocado plays handball or drives the boat, we can fill the Sport and Transport columns for avocado. Since there's only one position left for avocado, it must be playing handball and driving the boat:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
   | Broccoli | | | |
   | Cucumber | | | |

5. Now, let's use rule 2. The person driving the jet-ski cannot be the Indian or the person eating avocado (since avocado is driving the boat). Since there's only one position left for the nationality, the Indian must be either broccoli or cucumber:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
   | Broccoli | Indian | | Jet-ski |
   | Cucumber | | | |

6. Now, let's use rule 3. The German must be on the far left or far right. Since the Indian is already in the middle, the German must be either broccoli or cucumber. Let's assume the German is broccoli:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
   | Broccoli | German | | Jet-ski |
   | Cucumber | Indian | | |

7. Now, let's use rule 4. The German is to the left of the Russian. Since the German is broccoli, the Russian must be cucumber:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
   | Broccoli | German | | Jet-ski |
   | Cucumber | Russian | | |

8. Now, let's use rule 5. The person playing handball and the Russian have the same parity positions. Since handball is on an odd position (Avocado), the Russian must be on an even position (Cucumber). But we already know that the Russian is in the last position, so this rule is not applicable:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
   | Broccoli | German | | Jet-ski |
   | Cucumber | Russian | | |

9. Since rule 5 is not applicable, let's move on to rule 7. The person driving the snowmobile is in an even position. Since there's only one position left (Broccoli), the German must be driving the snowmobile:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
   | Broccoli | German | | Jet-ski | Snowmobile |
   | Cucumber | Russian | | |

10. Now, let's use rule 10. The German is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the German is in the middle (Broccoli), the person playing rugby (1st position) must be Indian:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
   | Broccoli | German | | Jet-ski | Snowmobile |
   | Cucumber | Indian | Rugby | |

11. Now, let's use rule 11. The person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person driving the boat. Since the German (snowmobile) is in the middle and the boat driver is Avocado (1st position), this rule is satisfied:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
   | Broccoli | German | | Jet-ski | Snowmobile |
   | Cucumber | Indian | Rugby | |

12. Finally, let's use rule 8. The person driving the jet-ski is not to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the jet-ski driver is in the 2nd position (Broccoli) and the snowmobile driver is in the 2nd-1 position (German), this rule is satisfied:

   | Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
   | Broccoli | German | | Jet-ski | Snowmobile |
   | Cucumber | Indian | Rugby | |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Food  | Nationality | Sport | Transport |
|-------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Avocado | Handball | Rugby | Boat |
| Broccoli | German | | Jet-ski | Snowmobile |
| Cucumber | Indian | Rugby | |

Lv12-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people and pets in the first two columns. Since the owner of the lizard is not to the left of the project-manager, the lizard can't be in the first row (as the project-manager would have to be in the second row). So, let's place the lizard in the second row, and the project-manager in the third row. This leaves the first row for the doctor and the fisherman. Since the fisherman and the person eating pepper have the same parity positions, we can place the fisherman in the first row and the person eating pepper in the second row. This means the doctor is in the third row.

   |            |     1     |        2        |    3     |
   |-----------|----------|----------------|----------|
   | Beverage   |           |                 |          |
   | Food       |           |                 |          |
   | Job        | Doctor    | Fisherman       | Project-Manager|
   | Pet        |           | Lizard          |           |

2. Now let's place the pets. Since the owner of the bird and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions, and the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the person eating pear, the bird can't be in the first or third column. So, let's place the bird in the second column. This means the turtle must be in the first column, as it is owned by the person drinking iced-tea (from rule 8).

   |            |     1     |        2        |    3     |
   |-----------|----------|----------------|----------|
   | Beverage   | Iced-Tea |                 |          |
   | Food       | Pear     | Bird           | Spinach  |
   | Job        | Doctor   | Fisherman      | Project-Manager|
   | Pet        | Turtle   | Lizard         |           |

3. Now let's place the beverages. The person drinking cola is not the owner of the bird or the owner of the bird is not the person eating pepper or both (rule 2). Since the bird is in the second column and the person eating pepper is in the second row, the cola can't be in the second row. So, let's place the cola in the first row. This means the lemonade must be in the third row.

   |            |     1     |        2        |    3     |
   |-----------|----------|----------------|----------|
   | Beverage   | Cola     |                 | Lemonade |
   | Food       | Pear     | Bird           | Spinach  |
   | Job        | Doctor   | Fisherman      | Project-Manager|
   | Pet        | Turtle   | Lizard         |           |

4. The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person eating pepper (rule 3). Since the person eating pepper is in the second row, the person drinking lemonade must be in the third row.

   |            |     1     |        2        |    3     |
   |-----------|----------|----------------|----------|
   | Beverage   | Cola     |                 | Lemonade |
   | Food       | Pear     | Bird           | Spinach  |
   | Job        | Doctor   | Fisherman      | Project-Manager|
   | Pet        | Turtle   | Lizard         |           |

5. The person drinking cola is the owner of the turtle or the person drinking cola is the project-manager or both (rule 10). Since the person drinking cola is in the first row and the project-manager is in the third row, the person drinking cola must be the owner of the turtle.

   |            |     1     |        2        |    3     |
   |-----------|----------|----------------|----------|
   | Beverage   | Cola     |                 | Lemonade |
   | Food       | Pear     | Bird           | Spinach  |
   | Job        | Doctor   | Fisherman      | Project-Manager|
   | Pet        | Turtle   | Lizard         |           |

6. The person drinking iced-tea is the owner of the turtle (rule 8). But we already placed the turtle in the first column, owned by the person drinking cola. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently impossible to satisfy all the given rules.

So, the final solution table is impossible to construct due to a contradiction in the rules provided."
Lv12-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people and their preferences in the table. Let's fill in the jobs first, as they have the least constraints:

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      |           |             |           |
   | Job           | bartender | designer    | journalist |

2. Next, let's fill in the movie-genres. We know that the person watching animation movies is not the journalist, so it must be either the bartender or the designer. Let's place animation with the bartender for now:

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      |           |             |           |
   | Job           | bartender | designer    | journalist |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation |             |           |

   Since the designer is not the person watching zombie movies, the remaining movie-genre (thriller or zombie) must go with the designer. Let's place zombie with the designer:

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      |           |             |           |
   | Job           | bartender | designer    | journalist |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation | zombie      |           |

   Now, the remaining movie-genre (thriller) goes with the journalist.

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      |           |             |           |
   | Job           | bartender | designer    | journalist |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation | zombie      | thriller   |

3. Now, let's fill in the music-genres. The person drinking almond-milk is between the fan soul and the fan reggae. Since the designer is already occupied, the almond-milk drinker must be either the bartender or the journalist. Let's place almond-milk with the bartender for now:

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk|             |           |
   | Job           | bartender | designer    | journalist |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation | zombie      | thriller   |

   The person drinking almond-milk is to the left of the person drinking juice, so the juice drinker must be the journalist. The remaining beverage (lemonade) goes with the designer.

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| juice      | lemonade  |
   | Job           | bartender | designer    | journalist |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation | zombie      | thriller   |

4. The person drinking juice is the fan of soul music, so the fan of r&b must be the bartender, and the fan of reggae must be the journalist.

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| juice      | lemonade  |
   | Job           | bartender (r&b) | designer    | journalist (reggae) |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation | zombie      | thriller   |

5. The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the bartender, so it must be the designer.

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| juice      | lemonade  |
   | Job           | bartender (r&b) | designer    | journalist (reggae) |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation | zombie      | thriller   |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b       | soul       | soul       |

6. The person watching thriller movies is not to the left of the fan reggae, so it must be the bartender.

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| juice      | lemonade  |
   | Job           | bartender (r&b, thriller) | designer    | journalist (reggae) |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation | zombie      | thriller   |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b       | soul       | soul       |

7. The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person drinking lemonade, so it must be the designer.

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| juice      | lemonade  |
   | Job           | bartender (r&b, thriller) | designer (zombie)    | journalist (reggae) |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation | zombie      | thriller   |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b       | soul       | soul       |

8. The person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of reggae, so it must be the journalist.

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk (r&b, animation) | juice      | lemonade  |
   | Job           | bartender (thriller) | designer (zombie)    | journalist (reggae, almond-milk) |
   | Movie-Genre   | animation | zombie      | thriller   |
   | Music-Genre   | r&b       | soul       | soul       |

9. The person drinking juice is the fan of soul music, so the table is complete.

Here is the final solution table:

   |               |     1     |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk (r&b, animation) | juice (soul) | lemonade  |

Lv12-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can represent them as A, B, and C, and the items as R (radish), P (peach), T (tomato), C (coffee), S (soy-milk), 7 (7up), F (funk), T (trance), C (classical), S (snake), T (turtle), and Ch (chinchilla).

2. From rule 1, we know that S is somewhere to the right of C. So, we can write S > C.

3. From rule 2, we know that C is somewhere to the left of 7. So, we can write C < 7.

4. From rule 3, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is a fan of funk (Ch-F).

5. From rule 4, we know that the fan classical (C) is on the left of 7. So, we can write C < 7 and 7 > C. This is a contradiction, so we need to adjust the positions of C and 7. Let's swap them: C < 7 becomes 7 < C.

6. From rule 5, we know that the person eating radish and the owner of the chinchilla have the same parity positions. Since the chinchilla is now in position 7, the radish eater must be in an even position (2 or 4). Let's say the radish eater is in position 2 (R-2).

7. From rule 6, we know that the owner of the snake is on the left of the person eating tomato. Since the radish eater is in position 2, the tomato eater must be in position 3 (T-3).

8. From rule 7, we know that the owner of the turtle and the person eating tomato have the same parity positions. Since the tomato eater is in position 3, the turtle owner must be in position 1 (T-1).

9. From rule 8, we know that the fan funk is not the person eating peach or the owner of the turtle is not the fan funk or both. Since the turtle owner is in position 1, the fan funk cannot be in position 1 (Ch-F is already in position 7). So, the fan funk must be in position 2 or 3. But the fan funk cannot be in position 2 because the radish eater is already there (R-2). So, the fan funk must be in position 3 (F-3).

10. From rule 9, we know that the person eating tomato is on the left or right of the fan classical. Since the fan classical is in position 4 (C-4), the tomato eater must be in position 3 (T-3) or position 5 (T-5). But the tomato eater is already in position 3. So, the fan classical must be in position 5 (C-5).

11. From rule 10, we know that the person drinking coffee is the fan trance (C-T) or the person eating peach is the person drinking coffee, but not both. Since the fan classical is in position 5 (C-5), the person drinking coffee must be in position 1 (C-1) and the person eating peach must be in position 3 (P-3).

12. From rule 11, we know that the owner of the turtle is not the fan trance (T-1) and the owner of the turtle is not the person drinking 7up (T-1 and 7-C). So, the owner of the turtle cannot be in position 1 or 7. Since the owner of the turtle is already in position 1, the person drinking 7up must be in position 3 (7-3).

13. From rule 12, we know that the person drinking coffee is the owner of the turtle (C-1).

14. From rule 13, we know that the chinchilla owner is somewhere to the right of the fan classical (Ch-5).

So, the final solution table is:

|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | 7up    |  Coffee   |  Soy-Milk  |
