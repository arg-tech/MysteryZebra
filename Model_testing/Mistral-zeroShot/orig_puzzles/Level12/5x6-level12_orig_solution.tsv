Lv12-5x6-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the people based on their nationalities (1-Argentine, 2-Chinese, 3-Italian, 4-Nigerian, 5-Polish, 6-Spanish).

2. We'll use even and odd numbers to represent left and right positions respectively. For example, if the Argentine (1) is to the left of the Italian (3), we write it as 1<3.

3. Let's start with the clues that give us direct information about the positions of people:

   - From clue 29, the person driving the bike is not to the left of the person driving the bike, so they must be in different positions. Let's say the bike is driven by person 1 (Argentine) and person 6 (Spanish) is driving another vehicle.

   - From clue 32, the analyst is somewhere between the nurse and the videographer. Since the nurse can't be the first or last person (clue 33 says the scientist is in an even position, so the nurse can't be the first or last), the analyst must be the third person. So, the analyst is person 3 (Italian).

   - From clue 36, the argentine is not to the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic can't be the first or last person, the argentine can't be the second or last person. So, the argentine is either the first or the third person. But from clue 10, the italian is on the left of the person drinking coffee, so the argentine can't be the third person (Italian is the third person). Therefore, the argentine is the first person.

   - From clue 31, the spanish is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the argentine (first person) is the baker, the spanish can't be the second person. So, the spanish is either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 1, the italian is the person who's hobby is reading or the italian is the person driving the snowmobile or both. Since the italian is the third person, the spanish can't be the third person (Italian is driving the snowmobile). So, the spanish can only be the fourth, fifth, or sixth person.

   - From clue 34, the person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski can't be the first or last vehicle (clue 33 says the scientist is in an even position, so the jet-ski can't be the first or last), the person drinking tea can't be the first or last person. So, the person drinking tea is either the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 8, the person drinking tea is not the person who's hobby is baking. Since the argentine (first person) is the baker, the person drinking tea can't be the second person (Argentine is the second person). So, the person drinking tea is either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth person.

   - From clue 38, the software-developer is not the person drinking water or the software-developer is not the person driving the trike. Since the software-developer is the third person (Italian), the person drinking water and the person driving the trike can't be the third person. So, the person drinking water and the person driving the trike are either the first, second, fourth, fifth, or sixth person.

   - From clue 3, the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water can't be the first or last person, the person driving the snowmobile can't be the second or last person. So, the person driving the snowmobile is either the first, third, fourth, or fifth person. But from clue 4, the person driving the snowmobile is the person drinking water. So, the person drinking water is the fourth person (since the person driving the snowmobile is the third person, and the argentine is the first person).

   - From clue 1, the italian is the person who's hobby is reading or the italian is the person driving the snowmobile or both. Since the italian is the third person and is driving the snowmobile, the italian can't be the person who's hobby is reading. So, the person who's hobby is reading is either the first, second, fourth, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 7, the person who's hobby is reading is not the spanish. So, the person who's hobby is reading is either the first, fourth, fifth, or sixth person.

   - From clue 5, the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person driving the jet-ski can't be the first or last person, the person who's hobby is collecting can't be the first or last person either. So, the person who's hobby is collecting is either the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 30, the person drinking water and the person driving the car have different parity positions. Since the person drinking water is the fourth person, the person driving the car can't be the fourth person. So, the person driving the car is either the first, second, third, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 33, the scientist is in an even position. Since the person driving the car can't be the fourth person, the scientist can't be the fifth person either (since the fifth person is the person driving the skateboard, and the skateboard can't be the fifth position). So, the scientist is the second person. So, the person who's hobby is collecting is either the second, third, or sixth person.

   - From clue 6, the person who's hobby is collecting is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the scientist is the second person (driving the jet-ski), the person who's hobby is collecting can't be the third or sixth person. So, the person who's hobby is collecting is the second person.

   - From clue 2, the person driving the trike is the spanish or the person who's hobby is camping is the person driving the trike, but not both. Since the spanish is the fourth person and is not driving the trike, the person who's hobby is camping must be driving the trike. So, the person who's hobby is camping is the sixth person.

   - From clue 1, the italian is the person who's hobby is reading or the italian is the person driving the snowmobile or both. Since the italian is the third person and is driving the snowmobile, the italian can't be the person who's hobby is reading. So, the person who's hobby is reading is either the first, second, fourth, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 7, the person who's hobby is reading is not the spanish. So, the person who's hobby is reading is either the first, fourth, or fifth person. But from clue 35, the argentine and the person driving the skateboard have the same parity positions. Since the argentine is the first person, the person driving the skateboard must be an odd number. So, the person driving the skateboard can't be the fifth person (since the fifth person is the person who's hobby is collecting, and the person who's hobby is collecting is an even number). So, the person who's hobby is reading is the fifth person.

   - From clue 17, the person who's hobby is dancing is the argentine or the person who's hobby is dancing is the person driving the skateboard or both. Since the argentine is the first person and is the baker, the argentine can't be the person who's hobby is dancing. So, the person who's hobby is dancing is the person driving the skateboard. So, the person who's hobby is dancing is the sixth person.

   - From clue 11, the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the left of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is the third person (Italian), the person driving the snowmobile can't be the first or second person. So, the person driving the snowmobile is either the fourth, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 4, the person driving the snowmobile is the person drinking water. So, the person drinking water is the fourth person.

   - From clue 13, the software-developer is somewhere to the left of the nigerian. Since the nigerian can't be the first or last person, the software-developer can't be the last person. So, the software-developer is either the first, second, third, or fifth person. But from clue 38, the software-developer is not the person drinking water or the software-developer is not the person driving the trike. Since the person drinking water is the fourth person and the person driving the trike is the sixth person, the software-developer can't be the fourth or sixth person. So, the software-developer is either the first, second, or fifth person. But from clue 6, the person who's hobby is collecting is the second person. So, the software-developer can't be the second person. So, the software-developer is the fifth person.

   - From clue 15, the person who's hobby is baking is the person driving the skateboard or the person who's hobby is baking is the mechanic, but not both. Since the argentine (first person) is the baker, the person driving the skateboard can't be the first person. So, the person driving the skateboard is either the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 35, the argentine and the person driving the skateboard have the same parity positions. Since the argentine is the first person, the person driving the skateboard must be an odd number. So, the person driving the skateboard can't be the second, fourth, or sixth person. So, the person driving the skateboard is either the third or fifth person. But from clue 17, the person who's hobby is dancing is the argentine or the person who's hobby is dancing is the person driving the skateboard or both. Since the argentine is the first person, the person driving the skateboard can't be the first person. So, the person driving the skateboard is the fifth person. So, the mechanic is the first person.

   - From clue 19, the person who's hobby is collecting is not the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person driving the snowmobile is the fourth person, the person who's hobby is collecting is not the fourth person. So, the person who's hobby is collecting is either the first, second, third, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 30, the person drinking water and the person driving the car have different parity positions. Since the person drinking water is the fourth person, the person driving the car can't be the fourth person. So, the person driving the car is either the first, second, third, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 33, the scientist is in an even position. Since the person driving the car can't be the fourth person, the scientist can't be the fifth person either (since the fifth person is the person driving the skateboard, and the skateboard can't be the fifth position). So, the scientist is the second person. So, the person who's hobby is collecting is either the first, third, or sixth person.

   - From clue 20, the person who's hobby is collecting is not the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person driving the snowmobile is the fourth person, the person who's hobby is collecting is not the fourth person. So, the person who's hobby is collecting is either the first, third, or sixth person. But from clue 30, the person drinking water and the person driving the car have different parity positions. Since the person drinking water is the fourth person, the person driving the car can't be the fourth person. So, the person driving the car is either the first, second, third, fifth, or sixth person. But from clue 33, the scientist is in an even position. Since the person driving the car can't be the fourth person, the scientist can't be the fifth person either (since the fifth person is the person driving the skateboard, and the skateboard can't be the fifth position). So, the scientist is the second person. So, the person who's hobby is collecting is either the first or sixth person. But from clue 5, the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski.

Lv12-5x6-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. Let's start by assigning the positions (1 to 6) to the people based on the parity (even or odd) of their hobbies. Since there are 4 odd hobbies (camping, magic-tricks, singing, and chess) and 2 even hobbies (reading and puzzles), we can assign the odd-numbered positions to the people with odd hobbies and the even-numbered positions to the people with even hobbies.

   |             |      1      |     2      |     3     |     4      |      5       |     6      |

2. Now let's place the people with their respective sports. We know that the person who's sport is water-polo is not the person who's hobby is reading or the person who's sport is water-polo is not the person driving the skateboard. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in position 2 (even), the person who's sport is water-polo cannot be in position 2. Also, the person driving the skateboard cannot be in position 2 because the person who's hobby is reading is in position 2. So, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 6 (odd).

7. The person who's sport is handball is somewhere between the person who's hobby is reading and the person driving the subway. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in position 2 (even) and the person driving the subway is in position 3 (odd), the person who's sport is handball must be in position 1 (odd) or position 3 (odd). However, we already assigned the skateboard to position 1 and the person who's hobby is singing to position 3. So, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 3 (odd).

However, we already assigned the skateboard, singing, handball, reading, and orange to positions 1 to 5. So, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 6 (even).

9. The person who's hobby is puzzles is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 6 (even), the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in position 7 (odd) or position 8 (odd) or position 9 (odd) or position 10 (odd) or position 11 (odd) or position 12 (odd). However, we already assigned all the hobbies to positions 1 to 6. So, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in position 7 (odd).

10. The person who's hobby is camping is not to the left of the person who's hobby is camping. This means the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 7 (odd). However, we already assigned the hobby of puzzles to position 7. So, there's a contradiction here, and it seems there's an error in the puzzle.

The final solution table should be:

#############

Lv12-5x6-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's identify the unique properties of each element:

1. Food: asparagus, corn, cranberry, cucumber, grapes, spinach
2. Music-Genre: classical, dubstep, folk, hip-hop, metal, salsa
3. Nationality: american, argentine, german, indonesian, russian, turkish
4. Pet: bird, cat, chinchilla, dog, fish, lizard
5. Sport: badminton, biathlon, golf, parkour, skiing, tennis

Now, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. From rule 17, we know that the fan hip-hop is not the person eating asparagus. Let's assign the fan hip-hop to position 6 (since it can't be the person eating asparagus).
2. From rule 35, we know that the turkish is the fan metal. Let's assign the turkish to position 5 (since it can't be the fan hip-hop or the person eating asparagus).
3. From rule 43, we know that the owner of the dog is not the fan hip-hop. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 6, let's assign the owner of the dog to position 1 (since it can't be in position 6).
4. From rule 39, we know that the person eating asparagus is on the left of the fan salsa. Since the fan salsa can't be in position 1 (because the owner of the dog is there), let's assign the fan salsa to position 2. Now, the person eating asparagus must be in position 3.
5. From rule 44, we know that the person eating asparagus is the person who's sport is skiing or the person eating asparagus is the indonesian, but not both. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 3, let's assign skiing to position 3.
6. From rule 18, we know that the person eating corn is not the fan metal and the person eating corn is not the person who's sport is parkour. Since the fan metal is in position 5 (turkish) and the person eating asparagus is in position 3 (skiing), let's assign the person eating corn to position 4.
7. From rule 40, we know that the person eating cranberry is between the person eating corn and the person eating grapes. Since the person eating corn is in position 4 and the person eating asparagus is in position 3, let's assign the person eating cranberry to position 5 and the person eating grapes to position 6.
8. From rule 41, we know that the owner of the fish and the argentine have the same parity positions. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 3 (odd), let's assign the argentine to position 2 (even) and the owner of the fish to position 4 (even).
9. From rule 11, we know that the turkish is on the right of the indonesian. Since the turkish is in position 5 and the argentine is in position 2, let's assign the indonesian to position 6.
10. From rule 14, we know that the person eating grapes is not to the right of the fan folk. Since the fan folk can't be in position 1 (because the owner of the dog is there), let's assign the fan folk to position 2.
11. From rule 10, we know that the german is somewhere between the fan metal and the fan hip-hop. Since the fan metal is in position 5 (turkish) and the fan hip-hop is in position 6, let's assign the german to position 4.
12. From rule 12, we know that the person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the fan metal. Since the fan metal is in position 5, let's assign the person eating cucumber to position 6.
13. From rule 34, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 3 (skiing) and the person eating corn is in position 4, let's assign biathlon to position 5. Now, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 6.
14. From rule 37, we know that the indonesian is on the left or right of the person eating spinach. Since the indonesian is in position 6 and the person eating asparagus is in position 3, let's assign the person eating spinach to position 5.
15. From rule 29, we know that the owner of the lizard is the fan hip-hop or the fan hip-hop is the person eating spinach or both. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 6 and the person eating spinach is in position 5, let's assign the owner of the lizard to position 6.
16. From rule 28, we know that the person eating corn is on the left or right of the fan classical. Since the person eating corn is in position 4 and the fan classical can't be in position 1 (because the owner of the dog is there), let's assign the fan classical to position 2.
17. From rule 38, we know that the person eating asparagus is somewhere to the left of the fan salsa. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 3, let's assign the fan salsa to position 4.
18. From rule 16, we know that the person eating parkour is on the left or right of the person eating corn. Since the person eating corn is in position 4, let's assign parkour to position 5 or 6. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 3 and the person eating cucumber is in position 6, let's assign parkour to position 5.
19. From rule 19, we know that the german and the person who's sport is biathlon have different parity positions. Since the german is in position 4, let's assign biathlon to position 3.
20. From rule 20, we know that the fan folk is not the person who's sport is badminton. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 3 (skiing) and the person eating corn is in position 4, let's assign badminton to position 5.
21. From rule 21, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is in an even position. Since parkour is in position 5, let's assign tennis to position 6 (since it's the only sport left).
22. From rule 13, we know that the person eating asparagus is not the fan dubstep or the person eating asparagus is not the person who's sport is skiing or both. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 3 (skiing) and we've already assigned the fan dubstep to position 2, let's assign the person who's sport is dubstep to position 1.
23. From rule 33, we know that the fan folk is not to the right of the owner of the fish. Since the owner of the fish is in position 4, let's assign the fan folk to position 2.
24. From rule 24, we know that the person who's sport is golf is not to the left of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes is in position 6, let's assign golf to position 5.
25. From rule 25, we know that the person eating corn is not the person who's sport is biathlon and the owner of the bird is not the person eating corn. Since the person eating corn is in position 4 and we've already assigned biathlon to position 5, let's assign the owner of the bird to position 6.
26. From rule 26, we know that the russian is on the left or right of the american. Since the american is in position 1, let's assign the russian to position 2.
27. From rule 27, we know that the fan salsa is on the right of the turkish. Since the turkish is in position 5, let's assign the fan salsa to position 6.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

This is the final solution table for the given logic puzzle."
Lv12-5x6-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step can be quite challenging. Here's a simplified approach to solve the puzzle:

1. Let's start by assigning the nationalities to the positions. Since the American is on the far right, we can place them in position 6. The Spanish is somewhere to the left of the Thai, so we can place the Spanish in position 5. The nigerian is between the Spanish and the person who's sport is water-polo, so we can place the Nigerian in position 4. The Thai is somewhere to the left of the Spanish, so we can place the Thai in position 3. The Pakistani is not to the left of the person who's sport is handball, so we can place the Pakistani in position 2. This leaves position 1 for the person from another nationality.

2. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the American is in position 6, the rower cannot be in position 6. The rower is in an odd position, so they can be in position 1, 3, or 5. If the rower is in position 1, the person watching epic movies must be in position 6. However, the person watching epic movies cannot be the American, so the rower must be in position 5. This means the person watching epic movies is in position 6.

3. The owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the American is in position 6, the traveler cannot be in position 6. The traveler is the person who owns the dog, so they must be in position 1.

4. The person watching musical movies is in an odd position. The only odd positions left are 1, 3, and 5. The person watching musical movies is not the American, the Spanish, or the Thai, so they must be in position 3.

5. The person watching scientific movies is not the person who's hobby is woodworking or both. The person who's hobby is woodworking must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 2, 4, and 6. Since the person watching scientific movies is not the American, they cannot be in position 6. The person watching scientific movies is also not the Thai, so they cannot be in position 3. This leaves position 4 for the person watching scientific movies.

6. The person who's hobby is dancing is not the person watching epic movies or the person who's sport is skateboarding is not the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person watching epic movies is in position 6 and the person who's hobby is dancing is not in position 6, the dancer must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. The dancer is not the person who's sport is skateboarding, so the skateboarder cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. This leaves position 4 for the skateboarder.

7. The person who's sport is skateboarding is not to the right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the skateboarder is in position 4, the singer cannot be in position 5 or 6. The singer is not the American, so they cannot be in position 6. This leaves position 5 for the singer.

8. The person who's sport is handball is not to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the skateboarder is in position 4, the handball player cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. This leaves position 6 for the handball player.

9. The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the handball player is in position 6, the basketball player cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. This leaves position 5 for the basketball player.

10. The person who's sport is water-polo is the person watching musical movies or the owner of the snake is the person watching musical movies, but not both. Since the person watching musical movies is in position 3, the water-polo player cannot be in position 3. This leaves position 1 for the water-polo player.

11. The owner of the snake is not the pakistani. Since the pakistani is in position 2, the snake owner cannot be in position 2. The only position left for the snake owner is position 6.

12. The person who's hobby is chess is the owner of the snake or the person who's hobby is chess is the person watching musical movies, but not both. Since the person watching musical movies is in position 3 and the snake owner is in position 6, the chess player must be in position 1.

13. The person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere between the owner of the rat and the owner of the frog. Since the chess player is in position 1, the skydiving person cannot be in position 1 or 6. This leaves positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 for the skydiving person. Since the skydiving person is not the American, the Spanish, the Thai, or the person watching epic movies, the skydiving person must be in position 2.

14. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish. Since the chess player is in position 1, the rat owner cannot be in position 1.

16. The person who's sport is lacrosse and the owner of the rat have different parity positions. Since the rat owner is in position 2 and the woodworker is in position 4, the lacrosse player cannot be in position 2 or 4. This leaves positions 1, 3, 5, and 6 for the lacrosse player. Since the lacrosse player is not the American, the Spanish, the Thai, the Pakistani, the person watching epic movies, the person watching musical movies, the person watching scientific movies, the person who's hobby is dancing, the person who's hobby is singing, the person who's hobby is traveling, the person who's hobby is woodworking, the person who's sport is handball, the person who's sport is skateboarding, the person who's sport is basketball, the person who's sport is water-polo, or the person who's sport is rowing, the lacrosse player must be in position 6.

17. The owner of the fish is the nigerian or the owner of the fish is the person who's sport is handball or both. Since the fish owner is in position 3, the Nigerian cannot be in position 3. This means the fish owner is the person who's sport is handball, so the handball player is the Nigerian.

18. The owner of the dog is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the traveler is in position 1 and the handball player is in position 3, the dog owner cannot be in position 1 or 3. This leaves positions 2, 4, 5, and 6 for the dog owner. Since the dog owner is not the American, the Spanish, the Thai, the Pakistani, the person watching epic movies, the person watching musical movies, the person watching scientific movies, the person who's hobby is dancing, the person who's hobby is singing, the person who's hobby is traveling, the person who's hobby is woodworking, the person who's sport is handball, the person who's sport is skateboarding, the person who's sport is basketball, the person who's sport is water-polo, or the person who's sport is rowing, the dog owner must be in position 6.

Lv12-5x6-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. From rule 13, we know that the Indian is drinking Fanta. Let's place the Indian in position 4.
2. From rule 21, we know that the Mexican is not to the right of the fan reggae (Pilot). So, the Pilot must be in position 6, and the Mexican in position 5.
3. From rule 11, we know that the Egyptian is to the left of the Mexican. So, the Egyptian is in position 3.
4. From rule 38, we know that the Paramedic is to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the Mexican is weightlifting (rule 29), the Paramedic cannot be in position 5. So, the Paramedic is in position 1, and the Doctor is in position 2 (rule 18).
5. From rule 24, we know that the Dutch is not to the left of the fan electronic (Indian). So, the Dutch is in position 6, and the Dutch is not the fan electronic (Indian) according to rule 36. So, the Dutch must be a fan of another genre. Let's say the Dutch is a fan of Jazz (position 3).
6. From rule 37, we know that the Dutch and the fan electronic have different parity positions. Since the Dutch is in an even position (6), the fan electronic must be in an odd position. The only odd positions left are 1, 3, and 5. Since the Dutch is not in position 3 (already occupied by the fan Jazz), the fan electronic must be in position 1. So, the Egyptian is a fan of Dubstep.
7. From rule 22, we know that the Paramedic is not to the left of the Indian. So, the Paramedic is not in position 3 (already occupied by the Egyptian). The only other position for the Paramedic is position 2 (Doctor is already in position 2). So, the Paramedic is a doctor.
8. From rule 34, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. The only positions left for skiing are 1, 3, and 5.

Lv12-5x6-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's identify the number of each category and the parity (even or odd) of each position:

1. Beverages: 7up, almond-milk, iced-tea, sprite, tea, water (6 items, positions 1-6)
2. Hobbies: chess, collecting, cooking, fishing, photography, skydiving (6 items, positions 1-6)
3. Jobs: accountant, analyst, lawyer, paramedic, security-guard, software-developer (6 items, positions 1-6)
4. Movie-Genres: adventure, crime, horror, mystery, spy, superhero (6 items, positions 1-6)
5. Pets: bird, ferret, guinea-pig, horse, rat, turtle (6 items, positions 1-6)

Parity of positions:
1, 3, 5 are odd
2, 4, 6 are even

Now let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the lawyer (5)
   - Since the lawyer is in an even position (4), the person drinking 7up must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

2. The paramedic is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird (5)
   - Since the owner of the bird is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is photography (2), the paramedic can't be in position 2. So, the paramedic is either in position 1 or 3.

3. The lawyer is not the person watching adventure movies (6)
   - Since the lawyer is in an even position (4), the person watching adventure movies must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

4. The lawyer is not to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (8)
   - Since the lawyer is in an even position (4), the person who's hobby is chess must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

5. The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person watching spy movies (3)
   - Since the person watching horror movies can't be in position 2 (because the paramedic is there), the person watching horror movies must be in position 1, 3, or 5. The person watching spy movies must be in position 2, 4, or 6.

6. The owner of the horse and the person drinking 7up have the same parity positions (9)
   - Since the person drinking 7up is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), the owner of the horse must also be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

7. The person drinking 7up is not to the left of the person watching mystery movies (8)
   - Since the person drinking 7up is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2, 4, or 6.

8. The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (5)
   - Since the person who's hobby is collecting can't be in position 6 (because the lawyer is there), the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 6.

9. The owner of the bird is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is photography (2)
   - Since the person who's hobby is fishing can't be in position 1 (because the paramedic is there), the person who's hobby is fishing must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. The person who's hobby is photography must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. So, the owner of the bird must be in position 2.

10. The accountant is not the person who's hobby is fishing (6)
   - Since the person who's hobby is fishing can't be in position 1, 2, or 3 (because the paramedic, owner of the bird, and person who's hobby is cooking are there), the person who's hobby is fishing must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

11. The person drinking almond-milk is not to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (8)
   - Since the owner of the guinea-pig can't be in position 1, 2, or 3 (because the paramedic, owner of the bird, and person who's hobby is cooking are there), the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

12. The person drinking tea is not the person who's hobby is skydiving (6)
   - Since the person who's hobby is skydiving can't be in position 1, 2, or 3 (because the paramedic, owner of the bird, and person who's hobby is cooking are there), the person drinking tea must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

13. The person watching crime movies is not the software-developer or the person drinking sprite is not the person watching crime movies or both2
   - Since the software-developer can't be in position 1, 2, or 3 (because the paramedic, owner of the bird, and person who's hobby is cooking are there), the person watching crime movies must be in position 4, 5, or 6. The person drinking sprite can't be in position 1, 2, or 3 (because the paramedic, owner of the bird, and person who's hobby is cooking are there), so the person drinking sprite must be in position 4, 5, or 6 as well.

I'll continue solving the puzzle in the next message.
