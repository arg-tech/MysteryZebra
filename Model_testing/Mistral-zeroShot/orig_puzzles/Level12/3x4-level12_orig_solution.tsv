Lv12-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the Japanese or the person eating pepper cannot be the driver of the car. Let's assume the person eating pepper is Japanese (J). Then, the driver of the car cannot be Japanese (C).

2. From rule 2, the person eating avocado (A) is to the right of the person eating pepper (J).

3. From rule 3, the driver of the car (C) is to the left of the person eating nectarine (N).

4. From rule 4, the driver of the car (C) is to the left of the person eating apple (A).

5. From rule 5, the driver of the train (T) is not to the right of the driver of the jet-ski (JS). Let's assume the driver of the jet-ski is to the left (JS<T).

6. From rule 6, the driver of the quad-bike (Q) is not to the left of the Japanese (J). So, Q>J.

7. From rule 7, the person eating nectarine (N) is to the right of the person driving the quad-bike (Q). So, N>Q.

8. From rule 8, the driver of the car (C) is to the left of the Brazilian (B). So, C<B.

9. From rule 9, the driver of the car (C) is to the left of the French (F). So, C<F.

10. From rule 10, the driver of the train (T) and the French (F) have different parity positions. Since we know C<F, T cannot be C (because they have the same parity). So, T>F.

11. From rule 11, the person driving the jet-ski (JS) is not the person eating apple (A) and the Spanish (S) is not the person eating apple (A) or both. Since we know T>F and F>A, S cannot be A. So, S is either N, P, or B.

12. From rule 12, the Spanish (S) is somewhere between the person driving the train (T) and the person eating apple (A). Since we know T>F>A and S is not A, S must be T.

13. From rule 13, the person eating avocado (A) is not to the left of the person eating pepper (J). So, A>J.

14. From rule 14, the person eating apple (A) is to the right of the person eating avocado (A). So, A>A, which is a contradiction. This means rule 14 cannot be correct, and the person eating apple (A) must be to the left of the person eating avocado (A).

Now, let's arrange the table:

|               |    1     |    2    |     3     |     4     |
| Food          | apple    | avocado| nectarine| pepper    |
| Nationality   | spanish  | french  | brazilian| japanese  |
| Transport     | train    | car     | quad-bike| jet-ski   |

This is the final solution:

Lv12-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of trance is either a golfer or the owner of the dog, but not both. Let's assume the fan of trance is the owner of the dog (D). This means the person who likes golf (G) is not the fan of trance.

2. From rule 2, the owner of the chinchilla (C) is between G and D. Since D is already placed, G must be on the left of C.

3. From rule 3, the owner of the chinchilla (C) is not the owner of the cat (Cat) or the fan of jazz (J). Since C is already placed, J cannot be on the right of C.

4. From rule 4, the person who likes baseball (B) is on the left or right of the fan of trance (T). Since T is the owner of the dog (D), B cannot be on the left of D. So, B is on the right of D.

5. From rule 5, the person who likes snowboarding (S) is to the right of the owner of the mouse (M). Since M can be on the far left or far right (rule 9), let's place M on the far left for now. This means S is to the right of M.

6. From rule 6, the owner of the dog (D) and the person who likes snowboarding (S) have the same parity positions. Since D is already placed on an odd position (as it's to the right of M), S must also be on an odd position.

7. From rule 7, the owner of the cat (Cat) is on the right of S. Since S is on an odd position, Cat must be on an even position.

8. From rule 8, the fan of trance (T) is to the right of the fan of classical (Cl). Since T is the owner of the dog (D) and D is on an odd position, Cl must be on an even position.

9. From rule 9, the owner of the mouse (M) is on the far left or far right. Since we placed M on the far left earlier, it must be on the far right now.

10. From rule 10, the fan of r&b (R) is to the left of D. Since D is on an odd position, R must be on an even position.

11. From rule 11, the fan of jazz (J) is not to the right of C. Since C is on an even position, J must be on an odd position.

12. From rule 12, J is between Cl and R. Since Cl is on an even position and R is on an even position (as we placed M on the far right), J must be on an odd position. But this contradicts rule 11 where J is on an odd position. This means our initial assumption that T is the owner of the dog (D) is incorrect. So, T must be the golfer (G).

13. Now, G is on an even position. Since D cannot be on the far left (as B is on the left of D), D must be on the far right. This means M must be on the far left.

14. From rule 14, the person who likes sailing (Sail) is not to the left of T. Since T is on an even position, Sail must be on an odd position.

15. From rule 15, B is to the left of T. Since T is on an even position, B must be on an odd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |   1   |      2       |    3     |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |       |              |          |         |

| Sport         |       |              |          |         |

   Music-Genre: Classical, Jazz, R&B, Trance
   Pet: Cat, Chinchilla, Dog, Mouse
   Sport: Baseball, Golf, Sailing, Snowboarding

   Placements:
   - Classical: Even position
   - Jazz: Odd position between Baseball and Golf
   - R&B: Even position to the left of Dog
   - Trance: Golfer (Golf)
   - Cat: Even position to the right of Snowboarding
   - Chinchilla: Between Baseball and Golf
   - Dog: Far right
   - Mouse: Far left
   - Baseball: Odd position to the left of Trance
   - Golf: Even position
   - Sailing: Odd position
   - Snowboarding: Odd position to the right of Mouse

Lv12-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of punk is on the left of the person eating raspberry. Let's place the fan of punk and the person eating raspberry in the first two positions. We can place the fan of punk in the first position (P1) and the person eating raspberry in the second position (P2).

2. From rule 2, the owner of the horse is on the right of the fan of hip-hop. Since the fan of punk is in the first position, the fan of hip-hop cannot be in the first position. Let's place the fan of hip-hop in the third position (P3). This means the owner of the horse must be in the fourth position (P4).

3. From rule 3, the owner of the snake is not to the left of the fan of electronic. Since the fan of punk and the owner of the horse are in the first three positions, the owner of the snake must be in the fifth position (P5).

4. From rule 4, the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry. Since the owner of the horse is already in the fourth position, the person eating raspberry must be in the second position (P2).

5. From rule 5, the owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the person eating carrot. Since the person eating raspberry is in the second position, the person eating carrot cannot be in the first position. Let's place the person eating carrot in the third position (P3). This means the owner of the rabbit must be in the fifth position (P5).

6. From rule 6, the fan of electronic is the person eating raspberry or the fan of electronic is the owner of the horse or both. Since the fan of electronic cannot be in the first four positions (occupied by the fans of punk, hip-hop, and the owner of the horse), it must be in the fifth position (P5).

7. From rule 7, the fan of punk is not the owner of the snake or the fan of punk is not the person eating raspberry or both. Since the fan of punk is in the first position (P1) and the person eating raspberry is in the second position (P2), the owner of the snake must be in the fifth position (P5).

8. From rule 8, the owner of the horse is on the left of the person eating raspberry. This is already satisfied as the owner of the horse is in the fourth position (P4) and the person eating raspberry is in the second position (P2).

9. From rule 9, the person eating lettuce is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the rabbit is in the fifth position (P5), the person eating lettuce must be in the sixth position (P6).

10. From rule 10, the person eating asparagus is not to the right of the person eating raspberry. Since the person eating raspberry is in the second position (P2), the person eating asparagus cannot be in the third position (P3) or the sixth position (P6). Let's place the person eating asparagus in the fourth position (P4).

11. From rule 11, the owner of the horse and the person eating carrot have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the horse is in the fourth position (P4), the person eating carrot must also be in the fourth position (P4). This means the person eating carrot swaps positions with the person eating asparagus, so the person eating asparagus is in the fourth position (P4) and the person eating carrot is in the third position (P3).

12. From rule 12, the owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the fan of electronic. Since the fan of electronic is in the fifth position (P5), the owner of the rabbit must be in the sixth position (P6).

13. From rule 13, the person eating asparagus and the fan of country have different parity positions. Since the person eating asparagus is in the fourth position (P4), the fan of country must be in the fifth position (P5) or the sixth position (P6). However, the fan of country cannot be in the sixth position (P6) because the owner of the rabbit is already there. So, the fan of country must be in the fifth position (P5).

The final solution table is:

Lv12-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is traveling and the owner of the bird have different parity positions. Since positions are numbered from 1 to 4, the hobby of traveling cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (odd positions) because the bird owner must be in an even position. So, the hobby of traveling is either 2 or 4.

2. The mexican is not to the left of the pakistani. Since the pakistani is hobby is puzzles (from rule 8), the mexican cannot be in position 1 or 2.

3. The mexican is not the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the hobby of traveling is either 2 or 4, the mexican cannot be in position 2 or 4.

4. The pakistani is the person who's hobby is puzzles or the pakistani is the owner of the ferret or both. Since the hobby of the pakistani is puzzles (from rule 8), the ferret owner cannot be the pakistani.

5. The American is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the hobby of magic-tricks is yet to be determined, we can't place the American yet.

6. The owner of the ferret is on the far left or far right. Since the ferret owner cannot be the pakistani (from rule 4), the ferret owner must be in position 1 or 4. However, the ferret owner cannot be in position 1 because the mexican is not the ferret owner (from rule 3). So, the ferret owner is in position 4.

7. The American is the person who's hobby is dancing or the American is the owner of the ferret or both. Since the ferret owner is the American (from rule 6), the American must have the hobby of dancing.

8. Now we know the American is in position 4 (dancing, American), the mexican is not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from rules 2, 3, and 6), so the mexican is in position 3.

9. The hobby of the person in position 3 is magic-tricks (since the mexican cannot have this hobby from rule 3).

10. The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the ferret owner is in position 4 and the bird owner cannot be in position 1 (from rule 1), the bird owner must be in position 2. So, the snake owner is in position 1.

11. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right. Since the American has the hobby of dancing and is in position 4, the hobby of the person in position 1 (snake owner) cannot be dancing.

12. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere between the person who's hobby is puzzles (pakistani) and the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the hobby of magic-tricks is in position 3 and the hobby of traveling is in position 2, the hobby of puzzles (pakistani) must be in position 1.

13. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the pakistani. Since the pakistani is in position 1, the rat owner is in position 2, 3, or 4. However, the rat owner cannot be in position 4 because the American has the hobby of dancing (from rule 7) and the American is in position 4. So, the rat owner is in position 2 or 3.

14. The person who's hobby is traveling is in an odd position. Since the hobby of traveling is in position 2, the hobby of the person in position 1 (pakistani) cannot be traveling. So, the hobby of the person in position 1 is puzzles.

15. The owner of the rat and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions. Since the rat owner is in position 2 and the magic-tricks person is in position 3, they have different parity positions. This rule is a contradiction, so it must be incorrect or there is an error in the puzzle.

16. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the german have different parity positions. Since the magic-tricks person is in position 3 and the German nationality has not been determined yet, we can't place the German yet.

Now, let's fill in the final solution table:

|               |     1     |      2       |     3     |    4     |

12. The person who's sport is biathlon is not the owner of the dog or the person who's sport is biathlon is not the person eating blueberry or both. Since the biathlon person is in the fourth position and the dog is in the second position, the biathlon person can't be the owner of the dog. So, the biathlon person can't be in the fourth position.

13. The person who's sport is biathlon is the owner of the turtle or the owner of the turtle is the person eating blueberry or both. Since the biathlon person is not in any position, the turtle can't be the owner of the biathlon person. So, the blueberry person must be the owner of the turtle. But we already placed the blueberry person in the fourth position, which is not possible.

There seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle, and it's not possible to solve it with the given conditions.

Lv12-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan electronic is not the person drinking iced-tea and they can't both be the same person, the fan electronic must be one of the remaining three beverages (fanta, mirinda, or sprite). Let's assume the fan electronic is drinking fanta (we'll check other possibilities later).

2. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the writer. So, the possible positions for iced-tea are 1, 2, or 3.

3. The fan electronic is not to the right of the fan blues. This means the fan electronic cannot be in positions 4, 3, or 2 (since the fan blues is in position 1, according to our assumption). So, the fan electronic must be in position 4, and the fan blues must be in position 1.

4. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the writer. This means the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in positions 3 or 4. So, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2.

5. The person drinking iced-tea is not the writer. So, the writer must be in position 3 or 4. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 2, the writer must be in position 4.

6. The scientist and the fan electronic have different parity positions. Since the fan electronic is in position 4 (an even position), the scientist must be in an odd position (1, 3). Since the writer is in position 4, the scientist cannot be in position 4. So, the scientist must be in position 1.

7. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the fan indie. Since the fan indie is not yet placed, let's assume the person drinking sprite is in position 1 (left of the fan indie).

8. The fan indie is somewhere to the left of the pilot. So, the fan indie can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

9. The pilot is somewhere to the left of the writer. Since the writer is in position 4, the pilot can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

10. The fan indie is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the fan metal. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 1 and the fan metal is the nurse (position 4), the fan indie cannot be in position 1. So, the fan indie can be in positions 2 or 3.

11. The fan indie is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the fan metal. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 1 and the fan metal is the nurse (position 4), the fan indie cannot be in position 3 (since there's no one to its left). So, the fan indie must be in position 2.

12. Now we know the positions of all beverages and the writer is in position 4. Since the writer is the only one left, the remaining positions must be jobs and music-genres. Since the scientist is in position 1, the job in position 2 must be pilot (since the scientist and the pilot have different parity positions). The job in position 3 must be nurse (since the nurse is the fan metal).

13. The music-genre in position 1 is blues (since the fan blues is in position 1). The music-genre in position 3 is metal (since the nurse is the fan metal). The music-genre in position 2 can be either electronic or indie, but since the person drinking iced-tea is the fan electronic, the music-genre in position 2 must be indie.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4    |
| Beverage      | fanta  |  sprite  |   mirinda  |  ice-tea |
| Job           | scientist | pilot   | nurse     | writer   |
| Music-Genre   | blues   | indie   |   metal   | electronic|

This solution satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv12-3x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 movie-genres (action, animation, epic, satire) and 4 music-genres (disco, house, indie, metal). There are also 4 nationalities (American, Brazilian, Japanese, Malaysian).

2. From rule 10, we know that the person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the American. Since there are only 4 positions, the American cannot be in the first position, so the animation fan must be in the second, third, or fourth position.

3. From rule 9, we know that the American is on the left of the Brazilian. So, the American cannot be in the fourth position, and the Brazilian cannot be in the first position.

4. From rule 11, we know that the fan of house is on the left of the fan of metal. Since the American cannot be in the first position (rule 3), the fan of metal cannot be in the first position either. So, the fan of house must be in the first position.

5. From rule 1, we know that there are 4 different movie-genres. Since the American cannot be in the first position (rule 3), the person watching action movies cannot be in the first position either. So, the person watching action movies must be in the second, third, or fourth position.

6. From rule 4, we know that the Japanese is to the left of the person watching action movies. So, the Japanese cannot be in the fourth position.

7. From rule 6, we know that the fan of disco is on the left of the Malaysian. Since the Japanese cannot be in the fourth position (rule 6), the Malaysian cannot be in the third position. So, the Malaysian must be in the second or fourth position.

8. From rule 12, we know that the fan of indie is the Brazilian. Since the Malaysian cannot be in the third position (rule 7), the Brazilian cannot be in the third position either. So, the Brazilian must be in the second or fourth position.

9. From rule 2, we know that the fan of disco is not the person watching action movies or the fan of disco is not the Malaysian or both. Since the Malaysian cannot be in the third position (rule 7), the person watching action movies cannot be in the third position either. So, the person watching action movies must be in the second or fourth position.

10. From rule 5, we know that the fan of metal is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since the American cannot be in the first position (rule 3), the fan of metal cannot be in the first position either. So, the fan of metal must be in the second, third, or fourth position.

11. From rule 8, we know that the Japanese is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the American cannot be in the first position (rule 3), the person watching satire movies cannot be in the first position either. So, the person watching satire movies must be in the second, third, or fourth position.

12. From rule 3, we know that the brazilian and the person watching epic movies have different parity positions. Since the Malaysian cannot be in the third position (rule 7), the person watching epic movies cannot be in the third position either. So, the person watching epic movies must be in the second or fourth position.

13. Now we have the following possibilities for the nationalities:
   - Second position: American, Brazilian, Malaysian, Japanese (in this order)
   - Third position: American, Brazilian, Japanese, Malaysian (in this order)
   - Fourth position: American, Japanese, Brazilian, Malaysian (in this order)

14. Since the fan of house is in the first position, the fan of disco cannot be in the first position (rule 11). So, the fan of disco must be in the second, third, or fourth position.

15. Since the fan of metal is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies, and the American cannot be in the first position (rule 3), the fan of metal cannot be in the first position either. So, the fan of metal must be in the second, third, or fourth position.

16. Since the fan of indie is the Brazilian, the Brazilian must be in the second or fourth position. If the Brazilian is in the second position, the fan of metal must be in the third position (to be on the left of the person watching animation movies). If the Brazilian is in the fourth position, the fan of metal must be in the second position (to be on the right of the person watching animation movies).

17. Since the person watching action movies is not the Brazilian (rule 7), the person watching action movies must be in the second, third, or fourth position. If the Brazilian is in the second position, the person watching action movies must be in the fourth position. If the Brazilian is in the fourth position, the person watching action movies must be in the second position.

18. Since the Japanese is on the left of the person watching action movies, the Japanese must be in the first or second position. If the Brazilian is in the second position, the Japanese must be in the first position. If the Brazilian is in the fourth position, the Japanese must be in the second position.

19. Since the Malaysian cannot be in the third position (rule 7), the person watching epic movies must be in the third position.

20. Since the American is on the left of the Brazilian (rule 9), the American must be in the first position.

21. Since the person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the American (rule 10), the person watching animation movies must be in the second or fourth position. If the Brazilian is in the second position, the person watching animation movies must be in the fourth position. If the Brazilian is in the fourth position, the person watching animation movies must be in the second position.

22. Since the fan of disco is not the person watching action movies or the fan of disco is not the Malaysian or both (rule 2), the fan of disco cannot be in the second position (since the Malaysian is in the second position). So, the fan of disco must be in the third position.

23. Since the fan of metal is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies, and the American is in the first position and the fan of disco is in the third position, the fan of metal must be in the fourth position.

24. Since the person watching satire movies is not the American (rule 9), the person watching satire movies must be in the second, third, or fourth position. If the Brazilian is in the second position, the person watching satire movies must be in the fourth position. If the Brazilian is in the fourth position, the person watching satire movies must be in the second position.

25. Since the Japanese is on the left of the person watching satire movies, the Japanese must be in the first position.

26. Since the person watching epic movies is in the third position, the person watching animation movies must be in the second position (since the Brazilian is the fan of indie and cannot be in the third position).

Lv12-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the soul fan can't be to the left of the Nigerian (1), and there are only four positions, it means the soul fan can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the soul fan is in position 2 for now.

2. The Japanese is in an odd position (4), so the positions are filled as follows:
   - Position 1: Not used yet
   - Position 2: Soul fan (assumption)
   - Position 3: Not the Nigerian (1)
   - Position 4: Japanese

3. The dressmaker is not to the left of the doctor (3), so the doctor must be in position 4 (since the Nigerian is in position 3). This means the doctor is Brazilian (9).

4. The entrepreneur is on the right of the Japanese (5), so the entrepreneur is in position 5.

5. The fan folk is not the pilot or the fan folk is not the Nigerian (4), and the soul fan is not the dressmaker (6). Since the soul fan is in position 2, the fan folk can't be in position 2 (as it would be the Nigerian). So, the fan folk must be in position 1, 3, or 4. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

6. The fan hip-hop is to the right of the fan folk (7), so the fan hip-hop is in position 5.

7. The fan country can't be to the right of the fan soul (8), so the fan country must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

8. The fan country can't be the Brazilian (9), so the fan country must be one of the remaining nationalities: Japanese, Nigerian, or Russian. Since the Japanese is already taken (4), the fan country must be either Nigerian or Russian. But the fan soul is to the left of the Russian (12), so the fan country must be Nigerian. This means the nationality of the person in position 1 is Nigerian.

9. Since the fan country is Nigerian and the soul fan is in position 2, the fan folk must be in position 3 (as it can't be the Nigerian or the pilot). This means the fan folk is Japanese (as the remaining nationalities are Brazilian and Russian, and the Brazilian is the doctor).

10. The fan hip-hop is in position 5, and the entrepreneur is to its right (5), so the entrepreneur must be Russian.

11. The only position left is position 3, and it must be the pilot.

So, the final solution table is:

```

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv12-3x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 jobs, nationalities, and sports. So, each row (Job, Nationality, Sport) will have a unique value.

2. From rule 12, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in an odd position. Since there are 4 positions, the ice-hockey must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. From rule 9, the photographer is not the Mexican, so the photographer cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 9). So, the photographer is in position 2, 3, or 4.

4. From rule 8, the Turkish is to the right of the photographer, so the Turkish cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the Turkish is in position 3, 4, or 5.

5. From rule 5, the Thai is to the left of the Turkish, so the Thai cannot be in position 4 or 5. So, the Thai is in position 1, 2, or 3.

6. From rule 11, the dressmaker and the Mexican have the same parity positions. Since the Mexican cannot be the photographer (rule 9), and the Thai and the Mexican cannot have the same parity positions (rule 6), the dressmaker must be the Mexican. So, the Mexican is in position 1, 3, or 5.

7. From rule 10, the dressmaker is between the chef and the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the Mexican is the dressmaker, the Mexican cannot be in position 5 (as it would violate rule 10). So, the Mexican is in position 1 or 3.

8. If the Mexican is in position 1, then the chef must be in position 2 and the ice-hockey in position 3 (to satisfy rules 10 and 12). In this case, the Thai can be in any position, but since the Thai is to the left of the Turkish (rule 5), the Thai must be in position 1, and the Turkish in position 4. The sports can be assigned as follows: Thai - climbing, Turkish - snowboarding, Mexican - chef (dressmaker), Ice-hockey - photographer.

9. If the Mexican is in position 3, then the chef must be in position 1, the Thai in position 2, and the Turkish in position 4 (to satisfy rules 5, 10, and 12). In this case, the ice-hockey can be in any position, but since the Thai and the person who's sport is skiing have different parity positions (rule 6), the ice-hockey cannot be in position 2 (as it would violate rule 6). So, the ice-hockey must be in position 1 or 4. If it's in position 1, the sports can be assigned as follows: Thai - climbing, Turkish - snowboarding, Mexican - chef, Ice-hockey - photographer. If it's in position 4, the sports can be assigned as follows: Thai - climbing, Turkish - snowboarding, Mexican - dressmaker, Ice-hockey - chef.

So, the two possible solutions are:

Solution 1:
|               |       1        |      2       |     3      |      4       |
| Job           | chef          | dressmaker   | photographer|   Thai       |
| Nationality   | Mexican       | Thai         | Japanese    | Turkish      |
| Sport         | ice-hockey    | climbing     | photography  | climbing     |

Solution 2:
|               |       1        |      2       |     3      |      4       |
| Job           | Thai          | chef         | photographer| Mexican      |
| Nationality   | Thai          | Japanese     | Japanese    | Mexican      |
| Sport         | climbing      | ice-hockey   | photography  | dressmaking   |

Both solutions satisfy all the given rules. However, the second solution seems more likely because it places the Thai in position 1, which is consistent with the parity rule 6 (Thai and the person who's sport is skiing have different parity positions). So, the final solution is Solution 2."
Lv12-3x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the chinchilla owner is on the left or right of the turtle owner. Let's assume the chinchilla owner is on the left (Column 1).

2. From rule 2, the bus driver is not to the left of the taxi driver. Since the bus driver is in an odd position (rule 7), the taxi driver must be in an even position (Column 2, 3, or 4).

3. From rule 3, the Brazilian is not to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in Column 1 (as the chinchilla owner is there), the dog owner must be in Column 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the dog owner is in Column 2.

4. From rule 4, the chinchilla owner is on the left or right of the quad-bike driver. Since the chinchilla owner is in Column 1, the quad-bike driver must be in Column 3 or 4. Let's assume the quad-bike driver is in Column 4.

5. From rule 5, the Thai is on the left or right of the bus driver. Since the bus driver is in Column 2, the Thai can be in Column 1 or 3. Let's assume the Thai is in Column 1.

6. From rule 6, the Brazilian is not the owner of the ferret or the driver of the bus. Since the Brazilian is in Column 2, the ferret owner or the bus driver cannot be in Column 2. Let's assume the ferret owner is in Column 3.

7. From rule 9, the Brazilian is not the owner of the ferret and the Brazilian is not the driver of the bus. Since we already placed the Brazilian and the ferret owner, the Brazilian cannot be the driver of the quad-bike or the helicopter. Let's assume the helicopter driver is in Column 1 (as the quad-bike driver is in Column 4).

8. From rule 10, the taxi driver is not the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle owner cannot be in Column 1 (as the chinchilla owner is there), the turtle owner must be in Column 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the turtle owner is in Column 3.

9. From rule 11, the quad-bike driver is on the far right (Column 4).

10. From rule 12, the taxi driver is on the right of the helicopter driver. Since the helicopter driver is in Column 1, the taxi driver must be in Column 2.

Now, let's place the pets and nationalities:

| Nationality   |     1      |     2     |     3      |     4     |
|--------------|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| Pet           | Helicopter | Dog      | Turtle     | Quad-bike|
| Transport     | Chinchilla  | Brazilian| Thai       | Taxi     |

11. From rule 8, the Egyptian is somewhere to the left of the dog owner (Column 2). Since the Thai is in Column 1 and the Brazilian in Column 2, the Egyptian must be in Column 3.

12. From rule 6, the owner of the dog is not to the right of the Brazilian (Column 2). So, the Egyptian cannot be in Column 4.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Nationality   |     1      |     2     |     3      |     4     |
