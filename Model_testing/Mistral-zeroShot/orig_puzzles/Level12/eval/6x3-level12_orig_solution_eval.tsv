Lv12-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the nationalities. Since the Dutch is not the person driving the trike (5), they can't be in the first or third row. So, the Dutch is in the second row. Let's place them in column 2 (Dutch is not the person drinking sprite or the fan of indie, so they can't be in column 1 or 3).

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |
   | Beverage      |         |           |        |

   | Transport     |         |           |        |

2. The fan of reggae is between the person drinking juice and the writer (2). Since the Dutch is in the second row and column 2, the fan of reggae can't be in column 2. The fan of reggae also can't be in column 1 because the Dutch is in column 2. So, the fan of reggae is in column 3.

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |
   | Beverage      |         |           | fanta  |

   | Transport     |         |           |        |

3. The person who's hobby is chess is not the fan of salsa (3). Since the fan of reggae is in column 3, the hobby of chess can't be in column 3. So, the hobby of chess is in column 1 or 2. Let's place it in column 1 for now.

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |

   | Transport     |         |           |        |

4. The person driving the ship and the writer have the same parity positions (9). Since the Dutch is in the second row, the writer can't be in the first or third row. So, the writer is in the second row. The writer can't be in column 1 because the hobby of chess is there, and they can't be in column 3 because the fan of reggae is there. So, the writer is in column 2.

Lv12-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the left of the person drinking mirinda, we can place them in the first two positions. Let's place lemonade in position 1 and mirinda in position 2.

2. Now we know that the person driving the van and the fan of dubstep have the same parity positions. Since there are 3 odd and 3 even positions, one of them must be in an odd position and the other in an even position. Since the person drinking mirinda is in an even position (rule 11), the fan of dubstep must be in an odd position. So, we can place the fan of dubstep in position 3.

3. The person who's hobby is filmmaking and the Canadian have different parity positions. Since we have already placed the Canadian (mirinda drinker) in an even position, the filmmaker must be in an odd position. Since the fan of dubstep is in an odd position, the filmmaker can't be in position 3. So, the filmmaker must be in position 1.

4. The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the right of the Canadian (rule 15). Since the Canadian is in position 2, the reader must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

5. The french and the person who's hobby is reading have the same parity positions (rule 5). Since the Canadian (hobby: reading) is in an even position, the French must be in an even position as well. So, the French can't be in position 1, 3, or 5.

6. The french and the person driving the ship have the same parity positions (rule 6). Since the French can't be in position 1, 3, or 5, the driver of the ship must be in one of these positions. Let's place the French in position 4 and the driver of the ship in position 1.

7. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing (rule 7). Since the filmmaker is in position 1 and the reader is in position 3, the singer must be in position 2 or 4. Since the French is in position 4, the singer can't be in position 4. So, the singer must be in position 2.

8. The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is handball (rule 8). Since the fan of dubstep is in position 3 and there are no empty positions to the right, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 5 or 6.

9. The person who's sport is parkour and the fan of folk have different parity positions (rule 9). Since the fan of dubstep is in an odd position (position 3), the person who's sport is parkour must be in an even position. Since the French is in position 4, the person who's sport is parkour can't be in position 4. So, the person who's sport is parkour must be in position 2.

10. The person who's sport is soccer is not the person who's hobby is reading or the person who's sport is soccer is not the fan of dubstep or both (rule 4). Since the reader is in position 3 and the fan of dubstep is in position 3, the person who's sport is soccer can't be in position 3. So, the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Since the person who's sport is parkour is in position 2, the person who's sport is soccer can't be in position 2. So, the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 1, 4, 5, or 6.

11. The russian is the person driving the van or the russian is the person drinking mirinda or both (rule 14). Since the driver of the van is in position 1 and the person drinking mirinda is in position 2, the Russian must be in position 2 or 5 or 6. Since the person who's sport is soccer can't be in position 2, the Russian can't be in position 2. So, the Russian must be in position 5 or 6. Since the person who's sport is parkour is in position 2, the Russian can't be in position 6. So, the Russian must be in position 5.

12. The person who's hobby is singing is in position 2 (we found this in the previous steps).

13. The person who's sport is parkour is in position 2 (we found this in the previous steps).

14. The fan of folk must be in an even position since the fan of dubstep is in an odd position and they have different parity positions. Since the French is in position 4 and the Russian is in position 5, the fan of folk must be in position 6.

15. The person who's sport is soccer can't be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (we found this in the previous steps). So, the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 6.

Now we have the final solution table:

Lv12-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and each person has 6 categories (hobby, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, sport, transport). Since there are 3 options for each category, we can represent each person as a 6-digit number where each digit represents the category in the order given. For example, if a person's hobby is hiking, movie-genre is drama, music-genre is gospel, nationality is dutch, sport is climbing, and transport is bike, we would represent them as 123451.

2. From the given clues, we can start to eliminate some possibilities. For example, from clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is cricket is not in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the numbers for the people with cricket as a sport will have a 4, 5, or 6 in the 5th position.

3. Let's assign the nationalities. From clue 3, the Egyptian is to the left of the Dutch, so their numbers will have a smaller 3rd digit. Let's say the Egyptian is 1XXXA and the Dutch is 2XXXB (A and B are the remaining nationalities).

4. From clue 5, the Indian is the fan of rock music, so the Indian's number will have a 5 in the 4th position. Since the Indian is not the person with cricket as a sport (from clue 5), the Indian's number will not have a 4, 5, or 6 in the 5th position. So, the Indian's number is 3XXXI.

5. From clue 13, the Egyptian watches romance movies, so the Egyptian's number will have a 2 in the 2nd position.

6. From clue 11, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the Indian or the person watching drama movies. Since the Indian's number is already assigned, the number for the person watching drama movies must have a 2 in the 2nd position. So, the person watching drama movies is 2XXXD (D is the remaining nationality).

7. From clue 14, the person who's hobby is hiking is not to the right of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching drama movies is in position 2, the person who's hobby is hiking is not in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

8. From clue 10, the person who's hobby is reading is on the far right. Since the person watching drama movies is in position 2, the person who's hobby is reading is in position 6.

9. From clue 12, the person who's hobby is reading and the person driving the taxi have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in position 6, the person driving the taxi is in an odd-numbered position (1, 3, or 5).

10. From clue 7, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in position 6 and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not in position 1 (from clue 1), the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 5.

11. From clue 15, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person driving the ship. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 5, the person driving the ship is in position 1, 2, or 4.

12. From clue 16, the person who's hobby is hiking is not the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching drama movies is in position 2, the person who's hobby is hiking is not in position 2. Also, the person who's hobby is hiking is not the person with cricket as a sport (from clue 16). So, the person who's hobby is hiking is in position 3, 4, or 6.

13. From clue 9, the fan of gospel is not to the right of the Dutch. Since the Dutch is in position 2 and the person who's hobby is hiking is not in position 2, the fan of gospel is not in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the fan of gospel is in position 1.

14. From clue 8, the fan of gospel is on the right of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of gospel is in position 1, the fan of salsa is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

15. From clue 6, the fan of rock is not the person watching thriller movies. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is not the person watching drama movies and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the person driving the ship, the fan of rock is not in position 2, 5, or 6. So, the fan of rock is in position 3, 4, or 5.

16. From clue 17, the fan of rock is not to the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is not the person watching drama movies and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the person driving the ship, the person watching thriller movies is not in position 3, 4, or 5. So, the person watching thriller movies is in position 1, 2, or 6.

17. From clue 11, the person who's sport is climbing is not the Indian or the person watching drama movies. Since the Indian is in position 3 and the person watching drama movies is in position 2, the person who's sport is climbing is not in position 2 or 3. Also, the person who's sport is climbing is not the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (from clue 10). So, the person who's sport is climbing is in position 4, 5, or 6.

18. From clue 14, the person who's hobby is hiking is not to the right of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching drama movies is in position 2, the person who's hobby is hiking is not in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Also, the person who's hobby is hiking is not the person who's sport is climbing (from clue 16). So, the person who's hobby is hiking is in position 1.

19. From clue 4, the person who's sport is cricket is not the fan of salsa or the person who's sport is cricket is not the person watching drama movies or both. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is not the person watching drama movies and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the person driving the ship, the person who's sport is cricket is not in position 1, 2, 5, or 6. So, the person who's sport is cricket is in position 3 or 4.

20. From clue 11, the person who's sport is climbing is not the Indian. Since the Indian is in position 3, the person who's sport is climbing is not in position 3. So, the person who's sport is climbing is in position 4.

21. From clue 16, the person who's hobby is hiking is not the person watching drama movies. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is in position 1, the person watching drama movies is in position 2.

22. From clue 1, the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person driving the taxi. Since the person who's sport is climbing is in position 4 and the person driving the taxi is in an odd-numbered position (from clue 9), the person who's sport is cricket is in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is in position 1 and the person watching drama movies is in position 2, the person who's sport is cricket is in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the nationalities in the Nationality column. Since the Egyptian is the fan of r&b, let's place the Egyptian in the second row (Nationality[2]). The other two nationalities can be filled in the remaining rows (Nationality[1] = Dutch, Nationality[3] = Italian).

2. Since the fan of reggae is not to the left of the fan of r&b, the fan of reggae cannot be in the first two rows (Reggae cannot be in Nationality[1] or Nationality[2]). So, the fan of reggae must be in the third row (Reggae[3]).

3. Now we know that the Italian is not the fan of r&b, so the Italian cannot be in the second row (Italian cannot be in Nationality[2]). The Italian can be in either the first or the third row (Italian[1] or Italian[3]).

4. The entrepreneur is on the left of the videographer, so the entrepreneur cannot be in the third row (Entrepreneur cannot be in Nationality[3]). The entrepreneur can be in either the first or the second row (Entrepreneur[1] or Entrepreneur[2]).

5. The accountant is on the right of the Dutch, so the accountant cannot be in the first row (Accountant cannot be in Nationality[1]). The accountant can be in either the second or the third row (Accountant[2] or Accountant[3]).

6. The person driving the taxi is the person eating watermelon, so the watermelon eater must be in the third row (Watermelon[3]).

7. The entrepreneur is the fan of r&b or the person driving the bus is the entrepreneur or both. Since we already know the watermelon eater is the taxi driver, the entrepreneur cannot be the taxi driver (Entrepreneur cannot be in Transport[3]). So, the entrepreneur must be in the first row (Entrepreneur[1]) and the bus driver must be in the second row (Bus[2]).

8. The fan of r&b is not the Dutch, so the Dutch cannot be in the second row (Dutch cannot be in Nationality[2]). The Dutch can be in either the first or the third row (Dutch[1] or Dutch[3]).

9. The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the fan of reggae. Since we know the fan of reggae is in the third row, the hobby of traveling cannot be in the third row (Traveling cannot be in Hobby[3]). So, the hobby of traveling can be in either the first or the second row (Traveling[1] or Traveling[2]).

10. The person who's hobby is collecting and the fan of reggae have different parity positions. Since we know the fan of reggae is in the third row and the hobby of traveling cannot be in the third row, the hobby of collecting cannot be in the third row either (Collecting cannot be in Hobby[3]). So, the hobby of collecting can be in either the first or the second row (Collecting[1] or Collecting[2]).

11. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the left of the person eating watermelon. Since we know the watermelon eater is in the third row, the hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in the third row either (Magic-tricks cannot be in Hobby[3]). So, the hobby of magic-tricks can be in either the first or the second row (Magic-tricks[1] or Magic-tricks[2]).

12. The entrepreneur is not to the left of the videographer. Since we know the entrepreneur is in the first row and the videographer is in the second row, this condition is satisfied.

13. The dutch is not to the right of the accountant. Since we know the Dutch is in the first row and the accountant is in the second or third row, this condition is satisfied.

Now we have all the information to fill the table:

|               |      1       |      2       |     3      |

However, we don't have enough information to determine the food for the first two people. Let's fill them with Cabbage and Watermelon respectively for now:

Lv12-6x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 options for each category, we can represent each category with numbers from 1 to 3. Let's assign the numbers to the categories as follows:

   - Beverage: 1 (lemonade), 2 (milk), 3 (water)
   - Food: 1 (cherry), 2 (radish), 3 (watermelon)
   - Job: 1 (accountant), 2 (journalist), 3 (paramedic)
   - Movie-Genre: 1 (adventure), 2 (comedy), 3 (family)
   - Music-Genre: 1 (country), 2 (disco), 3 (funk)
   - Transport: 1 (bike), 2 (jet-ski), 3 (quad-bike)

2. From rule 11, we know that the person eating watermelon is in the middle, so Watermelon = 2.

3. From rule 15, we know that the fan disco is in the middle, so Disco = 2. This means that Country and Funk must be in positions 1 and 3. Let's assume Country = 1 and Funk = 3.

4. From rule 10, we know that the person drinking milk is not the person driving the quad-bike or the accountant is not the person drinking milk or both. Since the accountant can't be the person drinking milk, Milk = 2 (leaving positions 1 and 3 for Lemonade and Water).

5. From rule 14, we know that the person eating watermelon is not to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since Watermelon = 2 and Quad-bike = 3, the person driving the quad-bike can't be in position 4, 5, or 6. So, Quad-bike = 1. This means that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike, so Jet-ski = 2 or 4.

6. From rule 13, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the fan country. Since Quad-bike = 1 and Country = 1, the fan country can't be in position 2. So, Country = 3 and Fan Country = 3.

7. From rule 12, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since Jet-ski = 2, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1, and the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 3.

8. From rule 4, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person watching family movies. Since Quad-bike = 1 and Family = 3, the person watching family movies must be in position 2.

9. From rule 5, we know that the person watching family movies is somewhere between the paramedic and the person watching adventure movies. Since Family = 2, the paramedic must be in position 1 and the person watching adventure movies must be in position 3.

10. From rule 8, we know that the person eating cherry is somewhere to the left of the person eating watermelon. Since Cherry and Watermelon are in positions 1 and 2, Cherry = 1.

11. From rule 3, we know that the person watching adventure movies is the person eating cherry. So, Adventure = 1.

12. From rule 2, we know that the person drinking lemonade and the person eating cherry have the same parity positions##9. Since Lemonade and Cherry are in positions 1 and 2, Lemonade = 2.

13. From rule 6, we know that the person drinking milk is not to the right of the person watching family movies. Since Milk = 2 and Family = 3, the person drinking milk can't be in position 3 or 4. So, Milk = 1.

14. From rule 7, we know that the person eating radish is not to the right of the fan funk. Since Radish and Funk are in positions 1 and 3, Radish = 1.

15. From rule 1, we know that there are 3 different favourite beverages: lemonade, milk, water. Since we have already assigned Lemonade = 2 and Milk = 1, Water = 3.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-6x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the hobbies in the first row since we know the taxi driver's hobby is photography. Let's place photography in the first column (column 1).

2. Since the owner of the lizard is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla, we can place the lizard owner in the second column (column 2) and the chinchilla owner in the third column (column 3). Let's place the lizard owner in the second column and the chinchilla owner in the third column.

3. The person driving the skateboard is to the left of the person who's sport is sailing. Since we don't know the sport yet, we can't place the skateboard driver yet. But we know that the person who's sport is sailing must be in the third column (column 3) because the skateboard driver is to the left of them.

4. The person who's hobby is photography is not the person eating peach or the person eating peach is not the fan of gospel. Since we don't know the food yet, we can't place the photography person or the peach eater yet. But we know that the peach eater can't be in the first column (column 1) because the photography person is there.

6. The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we don't know the sport yet, we can't place the water-polo player yet. But we know that the water-polo player must be in the first or second column because they are to the left of the chess player.

10. The person eating peach is somewhere between the owner of the bird and the person eating orange. Since the bird owner is in the first column and the person eating orange is in the second column, the person eating peach must be in the second column.

    |               |     1      |     2      |      3      |

    | Transport     | Taxi     | Skateboard|            |

12. The fan of country is on the left or right of the person eating peach. Since the person eating peach is in the second column, the fan of country can be in either the first or second column.

    |               |     1      |     2      |      3      |

    | Transport     | Taxi     | Skateboard|            |

13. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person eating peach. Since the person eating peach is in the second column and the photography person is in the third column, this condition is already satisfied.

    |               |     1      |     2      |      3      |

    | Transport     | Taxi     | Skateboard|            |

14. The owner of the lizard is not the person eating lettuce. Since the person eating lettuce is not determined yet, we can't check this condition. But it doesn't affect the placement of other elements.

    |               |     1      |     2      |      3      |
    | Food          | Lettuce   | Orange    | Peach      |

    | Transport     | Taxi     | Skateboard|            |

Now, we have filled all the rows except for the food, music-genre, and the person eating lettuce. Since we have placed all the elements according to the given conditions, the final solution table should look like this:

#############

The person eating lettuce can be placed in any of the columns (1, 2, or 3), but since we don't have any conditions that depend on the food, we can't determine the exact position of the person eating lettuce."	{'hobby': ['chess', 'country', 'photography'], 'music-genre': ['', 'metal', 'gospel'], 'pet': ['bird', 'lizard', 'chinchilla'], 'sport': ['water-polo', 'sailing', ''], 'transport': ['taxi', 'skateboard', '']}	False	0	False
Lv12-6x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 categories, so each person must belong to one category in each row.

2. From rule 1, we know that there are 3 different beverages, so each person can drink only one of them. Similarly, for food, movie-genre, nationality, pet, and sport.

3. From rule 2, the Canadian cannot be in the first position (as the person eating lemon is to their left). So, the Canadian cannot be in the first row.

4. From rule 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in the third position (as they are not to the left of the person eating pomegranate). So, the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in the third row.

5. From rule 4, the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is not in the third row, the ferret owner cannot be in the third column.

6. From rule 5, the person doing parkour is in an odd position. So, parkour cannot be in the first, third, or fifth row (as there are only 3 odd numbers between 1 and 5).

7. From rule 6, the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the Russian. Since the Canadian cannot be in the first row, the Russian cannot be in the first column. So, the person watching horror movies cannot be in the second row (as the Canadian is not there).

8. From rule 7, the person eating pomegranate and the person watching comedy movies have the same parity positions. Since the person watching horror movies cannot be in the second row, the person eating pomegranate cannot be in the fourth row (as there are only 2 even numbers between 1 and 5).

9. From rule 9, the person doing cycling is somewhere between the person eating pomegranate and the person doing biathlon. Since the person doing parkour cannot be in the first, third, or fifth row, the person doing biathlon cannot be in the fifth row. So, the person doing cycling must be in the second row, and the person doing biathlon must be in the fourth row.

10. From rule 10, the person watching comedy movies is not the person doing cycling, and the person doing cycling is not the person drinking milk or the person watching horror movies. Since the person doing cycling is in the second row, the person watching comedy movies cannot be in the second row. So, the person watching comedy movies must be in the fifth row.

11. From rule 11, the person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person doing parkour. Since the person doing parkour is in the first row, the person watching musical movies cannot be in the second or third column.

12. From rule 12, the person watching musical movies is not to the right of themselves, which is impossible. So, the person watching musical movies must be in the fourth row.

13. From rule 13, the person doing biathlon is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the person doing cycling is in the second row and the person doing biathlon is in the fourth row, the person doing biathlon must be in the fifth column. So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the fourth column.

14. From rule 14, the person drinking milk is the owner of the horse or the person drinking milk is the Brazilian or both. Since the person doing biathlon is in the fifth column, the person drinking milk cannot be in the fifth row (as the person doing biathlon is in the fifth column). So, the person drinking milk must be in the first row, and the Brazilian must be in the third column.

15. From rule 15, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the middle. Since the person drinking milk is in the first row and the person doing biathlon is in the fifth column, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the third row.

16. From rule 16, the person drinking fanta is not the person eating lemon or the person watching horror movies is not the person drinking fanta. Since the person eating lemon is in the second column and the person watching horror movies is in the second row, the person drinking fanta must be in the third row.

Lv12-6x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people (3 for each category), so we can represent the positions with numbers from 1 to 6 horizontally. Let's arrange the nationalities first:
   - Colombian (C) can't be to the right of the person watching satire movies, so C can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Let's place C in position 1 for now.
   - Turkish (T) can't be to the right of Colombian, so T can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's place T in position 2 for now.
   - Canadian (K) is left or right of the person eating papaya, so K can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

2. Let's arrange the beverages:
   - Fanta (F) can't be to the left of the person driving the bike, so F can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's place F in position 4 for now.
   - Coffee (Coff) can't be the owner of the fish, so Coff can't be in positions 1, 2, or 6. Let's place Coff in position 5 for now.
   - 7up (7U) and Train (Tr) have different parity positions, so they can't be in the same even or odd positions. Since F and Coff are in positions 4 and 5, 7U and Tr can't be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's place 7U in position 3 for now.

3. Let's arrange the food:
   - Lettuce (L) can't be to the right of the person driving the bike, so L can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Let's place L in position 2 for now.
   - Papaya (P) can be in positions 3, 4, or 5, but not to the right of the Colombian, so P can't be in position 5. Let's place P in position 4 for now.
   - Raspberry (R) is between L and Mystery, so R can't be in position 1 or 6. Let's place R in position 5 for now.

4. Let's arrange the movie-genres:
   - Family (Fam) can't be to the left of the owner of the fish, so Fam can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's place Fam in position 6 for now.
   - Mystery (M) can't be to the right of R, so M can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Let's place M in position 2 for now.
   - Satire (S) can't be to the right of the person watching satire movies, so S can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Since S can't be in position 2 (because M is there), S can only be in position 1 or 4. Let's place S in position 1 for now.

5. Let's arrange the pets:
   - Fish (Fish) can't be to the right of the person watching satire movies, so Fish can't be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6. Let's place Fish in position 5 for now.
   - Hedgehog (H) is to the left of the person driving the train, so H can't be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Let's place H in position 6 for now.
   - Snake (Sn) can't be the person driving the train, so Sn can't be in position 6. Let's place Sn in position 1 for now.

6. Let's arrange the transport:
   - Bike (B) can't be to the left of the person drinking fanta, so B can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since S is in position 1, B can't be in position 2. Let's place B in position 4 for now.
   - Boat (Bo) can't be the Colombian or the owner of the fish, so Bo can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Let's place Bo in position 3 for now.
   - Train (Tr) is to the left of the owner of the hedgehog, so Tr can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Since H is in position 6, Tr can't be in position 5. Let's place Tr in position 3 for now.

Now, let's check the constraints again:

1. The Colombian is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. This is true because C is in position 1, and S is in position 1 or 4.
2. The person eating lettuce is not to the right of the person driving the bike. This is true because L is in position 2, and B is in position 4.
3. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. This is true because B is in position 4, and F is in position 4.
4. The person eating raspberry is somewhere between the person eating lettuce and the person watching mystery movies. This is true because R is in position 5, L is in position 2, and M is in position 2.
5. The owner of the fish is not to the right of the person watching satire movies. This is true because Fish is in position 5, and S is in position 1.
6. The person driving the bike is the person watching family movies or the person eating lettuce is the person driving the bike, but not both. This is true because B is in position 4, and Fam is in position 6, and L is in position 2.
7. The person drinking 7up and the person driving the train have different parity positions. This is true because 7U is in position 3, and Tr is in position 3.
8. The owner of the snake is not the person driving the train. This is true because Sn is in position 1, and Tr is in position 3.
9. The person watching family movies is not to the left of the owner of the fish. This is true because Fam is in position 6, and Fish is in position 5.
10. The person eating raspberry is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies. This is true because R is in position 5, and M is in position 2.
11. The turkish is not to the right of the colombian. This is true because T is in position 2, and C is in position 1.
12. The owner of the fish is not the person drinking coffee. This is true because Fish is in position 5, and Coff is in position 5.
13. The person driving the train is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog. This is true because Tr is in position 3, and H is in position 6.
14. The colombian is on the left or right of the person eating papaya. This is true because C is in position 1, and P is in position 4.
15. The colombian is not the person driving the boat or the colombian is not the owner of the fish or both. This is true because C is in position 1, Bo is in position 3, and Fish is in position 5.
16. The person watching family movies is on the right of the person drinking fanta. This is true because Fam is in position 6, and F is in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-6x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport, Transport) and 12 people. Each person has one preference for each category.

2. Since there are 3 different options for each category, we can assign the first option to the first 3 people, the second option to the next 3 people, and the third option to the last 3 people.

3. Now let's solve the position constraints:

   - The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. So, the quad-bike driver is the first, third, or fifth person. The chinchilla owner is the fourth, sixth, or eighth person.

   - The owner of the chinchilla is not the fan of classical music or the owner of the chinchilla is not the person driving the car or both. The first, third, and fifth people can't be classical music fans. The fourth person can't drive a car. So, the chinchilla owner is the sixth person, and the quad-bike driver is the first person.

   - The person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car. The car driver is the fourth person, so the musical movie watcher is the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth person. The sixth person is the chinchilla owner, so the musical movie watcher is the seventh or eighth person.

   - The owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. The chinchilla owner is the sixth person, so the bird owner is the seventh or eighth person.

   - The person driving the car is the fan of r&b or the person driving the car is the person drinking tea, but not both. The fourth person drives the car, so the fourth person can't drink tea. The fourth person can't be a fan of r&b because the sixth person (chinchilla owner) can't be a fan of r&b. So, the fourth person drinks water.

   - The person drinking tea is on the far left or far right. The first and eighth positions are taken, so the person drinking tea is the third person.

   - The person watching documentary movies is the person driving the car or the person watching documentary movies is the person who's sport is golf or both. The fourth person drives the car and watches documentaries, or the seventh person watches documentaries and plays golf.

   - The person driving the quad-bike is not the fan of classical music. The first person drives the quad-bike, so the first person can't be a fan of classical music.

   - The owner of the goldfish is not the fan of r&b. The seventh or eighth person owns the goldfish, so neither can be a fan of r&b.

   - The person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the person driving the car. The fourth person drives the car, and the eighth person plays tennis, so the eighth person can't be to the left of the fourth person.

   - The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is tennis. The fourth person drives the car, the fifth person watches musical movies, the sixth person owns the chinchilla, the seventh person owns the bird, and the eighth person plays tennis. So, the third person drinks water.

   - The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the fan of pop. The sixth person owns the chinchilla, and the seventh or eighth person is the fan of pop. So, the sixth person is on the left of the fan of pop, and the fan of pop is the seventh person.

   - The fan of pop and the owner of the goldfish have the same parity positions. The seventh person is the fan of pop, and the seventh or eighth person owns the goldfish. So, the eighth person owns the goldfish.

   - The person drinking iced-tea is between the fan of pop and the person who's sport is tennis. The third person drinks iced-tea, the sixth person owns the chinchilla, the seventh person is the fan of pop, and the eighth person plays tennis. So, the fifth person drinks iced-tea.

The person driving the quad-bike is the first person, the owner of the chinchilla is the sixth person, the person watching musical movies is the seventh person, the owner of the bird is the seventh person, the person driving the car is the fourth person (who also watches documentaries and plays golf), the person drinking tea is the third person, the person drinking water is the third person, the fan of classical music is the second person, the fan of pop is the seventh person, the owner of the goldfish is the eighth person, and the person playing tennis is the eighth person."	{'beverage': ['iced-tea', 'water', 'tea', '', '', '', '', ''], 'movie-genre': ['', '', '', 'documentary', 'musical', '', '', ''], 'music-genre': ['', '', '', '', '', 'classical', 'pop', 'r&b'], 'pet': ['', '', '', 'chinchilla', 'bird', '', 'goldfish', ''], 'sport': ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'tennis'], 'transport': ['quad-bike', '', '', 'car', '', '', '', 'airplane']}	True	2	False
Lv12-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person watching crime movies is not in the first position (roller) or the third position (hiking). Let's assume the crime movie fan is in the second position.

2. From rule 2, the person driving the snowmobile is in an odd position. Since the first and third positions are occupied, the snowmobile driver must be in the second position.

3. From rule 3, the owner of the goldfish is not to the left of the person driving the roller. Since the roller driver is in the second position, the goldfish owner cannot be in the first position.

4. From rule 4, the fan of r&b is somewhere to the right of the fan of electronic. Since the electronic fan is in the second position (as the snowmobile driver), the r&b fan must be in the third position or the sixth position.

5. From rule 5, the person doing skydiving is not to the right of the r&b fan. So, the skydiving person cannot be in the fourth position or the sixth position.

6. From rule 6, the person drinking cola is not the person watching epic movies. Since the epic movie fan cannot be in the second position (as the snowmobile driver), the cola drinker cannot be in the first position (as the crime movie fan) or the third position.

7. From rule 7, the person driving the roller is in an odd position. We already know it's the second position.

8. From rule 8, the person drinking juice is not the fan of electronic. Since the electronic fan is in the second position, the juice drinker cannot be in the second position.

9. From rule 9, the fan of electronic is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish owner cannot be in the first position, the electronic fan must be in the first or third position. But the first position is already occupied by the crime movie fan, so the electronic fan must be in the third position.

10. From rule 10, the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice. Since the snowmobile driver is in the second position, the juice drinker must be in the first position.

11. From rule 11, the fan of salsa and the person watching zombie movies have the same parity positions. Since the zombie movie fan cannot be in the second position (as the snowmobile driver), the salsa fan and the zombie movie fan must be in the first and third positions or the third and first positions. But the first position is already occupied by the juice drinker, so the salsa fan and the zombie movie fan must be in the third and first positions.

12. From rule 12, the owner of the horse is not to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the hobby of baking cannot be in the first position (as the juice drinker), the horse owner cannot be in the second position (as the snowmobile driver). So, the horse owner must be in the third position.

13. From rule 13, the fan of electronic is the person drinking lemonade or the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the van, but not both. Since the electronic fan is in the third position, the lemonade drinker cannot be in the third position. So, the lemonade drinker must be the van driver.

14. From rule 14, the person watching epic movies is the owner of the horse or the fan of r&b is the person watching epic movies, but not both. Since the horse owner is in the third position, the epic movie fan cannot be in the third position. So, the r&b fan must be watching epic movies.

15. From rule 15, the person watching crime movies is the person drinking lemonade or the person watching crime movies is the person driving the roller or both. Since we already know the lemonade drinker is the van driver, the crime movie fan must be the roller driver (as the second position).

16. From rule 16, the owner of the cat is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the hobby of hiking cannot be in the first position (as the juice drinker), the cat owner must be in the first position.
