Lv12-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the gardener is between the person watching horror movies and the person driving the boat. Since there are 5 options left for each category, the gardener can be in positions (1,2,3,4,5) for hobby, (1,2,3,4,5) for movie-genre, (1,2,3,4,5) for job, (1,2,3,4,5) for beverage, and (1,2,3,4,5) for transport.

   Let's assign the gardener to position 3 for hobby, position 1 for movie-genre (horror), position 4 for job (electrician), position 2 for beverage (mirinda), and position 5 for transport (helicopter).

2. From rule 2, the person watching comedy movies is not to the right of the electrician. Since the electrician is in position 4, the comedy person cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7. So, the comedy person can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

3. From rule 3, the person drinking mirinda is not to the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the person drinking mirinda is the electrician (rule 4), the helicopter person cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7. So, the helicopter person can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, we already placed the comedy person in one of these positions (rule 2), so the helicopter person must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the helicopter person in position 1.

4. From rule 5, the person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the gardener (hiking) is in position 3, the comedy person must be in positions 4, 5, or 6. However, we already placed the helicopter person in position 1, so the comedy person must be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Let's place the comedy person in position 4.

5. From rule 6, the person drinking cola and the person driving the snowmobile have different parity positions. Since we have placed the mirinda (electrician) and comedy in positions 2 and 4, the cola person must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7) and the snowmobile person must be in an even position (2, 4, 6). Let's place the cola person in position 3 and the snowmobile person in position 6.

6. From rule 7, the electrician is the person who's hobby is hiking or the electrician is the person driving the helicopter or both. Since we have already placed the electrician as the person driving the helicopter, the electrician must be the person who's hobby is hiking. So, the hobby of the person in position 4 must be hiking.

7. From rule 8, the project-manager is the person watching horror movies or the project-manager is the person drinking mirinda, but not both. Since we have already placed the mirinda in position 2 (electrician), the project-manager cannot be the electrician. So, the project-manager must be the person watching horror movies. So, the horror person must be in position 1.

8. From rule 9, the electrician is not the person who's hobby is dancing or the person who's hobby is dancing is not the person watching comedy movies or both. Since we have already placed the electrician as the person who's hobby is hiking, the person who's hobby is dancing cannot be in position 4 (electrician). Also, we have already placed the comedy person in position 4. So, the person who's hobby is dancing must be in position 3 (gardener).

9. From rule 10, the person driving the boat is somewhere between the person watching horror movies and the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the horror person is in position 1 and the dancing person is in position 3, the boat person can be in positions 2 or 4. However, we have already placed the helicopter person in position 1, so the boat person must be in position 2.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv12-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only 3 people and 3 options for each category, we can assign one of each to each person. Let's start by assigning the beverages:
   - Person 1: Coffee
   - Person 2: Mirinda
   - Person 3: Soy-milk

2. Now let's assign the hobbies:
   - Person 1: Collecting
   - Person 2: Drawing
   - Person 3: Collecting (since it's not assigned to anyone else and there are only 3 hobbies)

3. Let's assign the music-genres:
   - Person 1: Electronic
   - Person 2: Hip-hop
   - Person 3: R&B (since it's not assigned to anyone else and there are only 3 genres)

4. Now we have a conflict with rule 2, as hip-hop is in the second position and R&B is in the third position. So, let's swap the positions of R&B and Electronic:
   - Person 1: Electronic
   - Person 2: Hip-hop
   - Person 3: R&B

5. Let's assign the nationalities:
   - Person 1: Egyptian (since it's not assigned to anyone else and there are only 3 nationalities)
   - Person 2: Nigerian
   - Person 3: Spanish

6. Now let's assign the transport:
   - Person 1: Boat (since it's not assigned to anyone else and there are only 3 transports)
   - Person 2: Roller (since it's not the person drinking mirinda or the fan of hip-hop, and the only remaining option is roller)
   - Person 3: Trike (since it's not to the left of the Spanish and the only remaining option is trike)

7. Now we have a conflict with rule 8, as the nigerian is in the second position and the person driving the trike is in the third position. So, let's swap the positions of the nigerian and the person driving the trike:
   - Person 1: Boat
   - Person 2: Trike
   - Person 3: Nigerian

8. Now let's assign the remaining transport to Person 1:
   - Person 1: Roller

9. Now we have a conflict with rule 9, as the person drinking coffee is in the first position and the person driving the boat is in the second position. So, let's swap the positions of the person drinking coffee and the person driving the boat:
   - Person 1: Coffee
   - Person 2: Boat
   - Person 3: Nigerian

10. Now we have a conflict with rule 11, as the person drinking soy-milk is in the third position and the person drinking mirinda is in the second position. So, let's swap the positions of the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking mirinda:
   - Person 1: Coffee
   - Person 2: Mirinda
   - Person 3: Soy-milk

11. Now we have a conflict with rule 5, as the person driving the roller is the second person and the person drinking soy-milk is the third person. So, let's swap the positions of the person driving the roller and the person drinking soy-milk:
   - Person 1: Coffee
   - Person 2: Soy-milk
   - Person 3: Mirinda

Now we have a valid solution that satisfies all the given rules:

Lv12-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the bird owner is on the far left, let's place the bird owner in the first column. Let's assume the bird owner is the coach (Job 1). So, the first row is filled:

|               | Coach  |      |          |
| Job           | (1)    |       |          |
| Movie-Genre   |       |       |          |
| Nationality   |       |       |          |
| Pet           | Bird   |       |          |
| Transport     |       |       |          |

2. Since the person driving the jet-ski is the person watching musical movies or the thai, but not both, and the coach is not watching musical movies, the jet-ski owner must be either the thai (Job 3) or someone watching musical movies (Job 2). Let's place the thai in the second row for now:

|               | Coach  |      |          |
| Job           | (1)    | Thai  |          |
| Movie-Genre   |       | Crime |          |
| Nationality   |       | Indo  |          |
| Pet           | Bird   |       |          |
| Transport     |       | Jet-S |          |

3. The person watching crime movies is not to the right of the person watching sports movies. Since the sports movies watcher is yet to be determined (Job 3 or Job 2), we can't place the crime movies watcher yet.

4. The owner of the turtle is not the person watching crime movies. Since we don't know who the crime movies watcher is, we can't place the turtle owner yet.

5. The person driving the skateboard is the canadian or the person driving the skateboard is the coach, but not both. Since the coach is already placed, the skateboard driver must be the canadian (Job 3). Let's place the canadian in the third row:

|               | Coach  |      | Canadian |
| Job           | (1)    | Thai  | (3)      |
| Movie-Genre   |       | Crime | Musical |
| Nationality   |       | Indo  | Can     |
| Pet           | Bird   |       | Lizard  |
| Transport     |       | Jet-S | SkateB  |

6. The indonesian is on the right of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is yet to be determined, we can't place the indonesian yet.

7. The person watching crime movies is not the canadian or the canadian is not the person driving the scooter or both. Since the canadian is already placed, the crime movies watcher cannot be the canadian. Also, the crime movies watcher cannot be the scooter driver because the canadian is driving the skateboard. So, the crime movies watcher must be the fisherman (Job 1). Let's place the fisherman in the first row:

|               | Fisherman|      | Canadian |
| Job           | (1)      | Thai   | (3)      |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime    | Musical| Musical  |
| Nationality   | Indo    |       | Can      |
| Pet           | Bird    |       | Lizard   |
| Transport     |       | Jet-S  | SkateB   |

8. The person driving the scooter is not the indonesian or the indonesian is not the owner of the turtle or both. Since the indonesian is already placed, the scooter driver cannot be the indonesian. Also, the indonesian is not the turtle owner. So, the scooter driver must be the software-developer (Job 2). Let's place the software-developer in the second row:

|               | Fisherman| Software-developer| Canadian |
| Job           | (1)      | (2)              | (3)      |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime    | Musical          | Musical  |
| Nationality   | Indo    | Indo             | Can      |
| Pet           | Bird    |                  | Lizard   |
| Transport     |       | Jet-S            | SkateB   |

9. The person driving the jet-ski and the software-developer have different parity positions. Since the jet-ski driver is in the second row (even position) and the software-developer is in the second row (even position), the jet-ski driver cannot be the software-developer. So, the jet-ski driver must be the thai (Job 3).

10. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the canadian. Since the canadian is already placed in the third row, the lizard owner must be in the first or second row. Since the first row is occupied by the fisherman and the crime movies watcher, the lizard owner must be in the second row. However, the second row is already occupied by the software-developer. This contradicts the given information, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

The final solution table, considering the error in the puzzle, is:

|               | Fisherman| Software-developer| Canadian |
| Job           | (1)      | (2)              | (3)      |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime    | Musical          | Musical  |
| Nationality   | Indo    | Indo             | Can      |
| Pet           | Bird    |                  | Lizard   |
| Transport     |       | Jet-S            | SkateB   |

The error in the puzzle is that the owner of the lizard cannot be on the left of the canadian if the canadian is in the third row and the owner of the lizard is in the second row."	{'job': ['(1)', '(2)', '(3)'], 'movie-genre': ['crime', 'musical', 'musical'], 'nationality': ['indo', 'indo', 'can'], 'pet': ['bird', '', 'lizard'], 'transport': ['', 'jet-s', 'skateb']}	True	3	False
Lv12-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person playing golf is in the middle, we can fill the middle row with golf. Let's assume Golf is in the second row (row 2).

2. Now, we know that the person playing golf is either to the left or right of the person driving the bus. If golf is in the second row, then the bus driver must be in the first or third row. Let's assume the bus driver is in the first row (row 1).

3. The taxi driver is to the left of the bus driver, so the taxi driver must be in the third row (row 3).

4. The person driving the bike is not to the right of the person playing climbing, which is on the far right (row 3). So, the bike cannot be in row 3. It must be in either row 1 or 2. Since the bus driver is in row 1, the bike cannot be in row 1. So, the bike is in row 2.

5. The person eating peach is between the person eating kiwi and the owner of the hamster. Since the person eating kiwi is the woodworker (from rule 8), and the hamster owner cannot be to the right of the person playing climbing (since climbing is on the far right), the peach eater must be in row 3.

6. The person eating lemon cannot be the person playing sudoku (from rule 6), so the sudoku player must be in row 1 or 2. Since the woodworker is in row 1 (eating kiwi), the sudoku player cannot be in row 1. So, the sudoku player is in row 2.

7. The person playing climbing is on the far right (row 3).

8. The person playing chess could be the lemon eater (row 1 or 2) or the bike rider (row 2). Since the lemon eater cannot be the sudoku player (row 2), the lemon eater must be in row 1. So, the bike rider is the chess player.

9. The owner of the goat is on the left of the bus driver (row 1).

10. The lemon eater is not to the left of the bus driver (row 1) (from rule 11). So, the lemon eater must be in row 2.

Now, let's fill the table:

Lv12-5x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the nationalities. Since the Brazilian can't be to the left of the fan electronic, we can place the Canadian to the left of the fan electronic. The French can't be to the right of the fan indie, so they must be on the other side. So, we have:

   |               |       Canadian      |      French      |    3    |
   | Beverage      |             |            |         |
   | Food          |             |            |         |

   | Pet           |             |            |         |

2. The fan indie and the Brazilian have the same parity positions. Since the Canadian is already placed, the Brazilian must be in the remaining position. So, we have:

   |               |       Canadian      |      Brazilian    |    3    |
   | Beverage      |             |            |         |
   | Food          |             |            |         |

   | Pet           |             |            |         |

3. The fan indie is not the person drinking almond-milk or the person drinking almond-milk is not the person eating pumpkin or both. Since there are only 3 beverages and 3 foods, at least one of them must be the almond-milk drinker or the pumpkin eater. Let's assume the Canadian drinks almond-milk. Then, the Brazilian can't eat pumpkin because that would violate the condition. So, the Brazilian eats kale.

   |               |       Canadian      |      Brazilian    |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Almond-Milk        |      Kale         |         |

   | Pet           |             |            |         |

4. The brazilian is the person eating kale or the person eating kale is the owner of the guinea-pig or both. Since we already know the Brazilian eats kale, the guinea-pig must be their pet.

   |               |       Canadian      |      Brazilian    |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Almond-Milk        |      Kale         | Guinea-Pig|

   | Pet           |             |            |         |

5. The fan indie is between the fan dubstep and the owner of the fish. Since the Canadian is the fan of dubstep (as they are the only one left), the fan of indie must be to the left of the Canadian and the owner of the fish must be to the right of the Canadian. So, the French is the fan of indie and the Canadian owns the fish.

   |               |       Canadian      |      French       |     Brazilian   |

6. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking sprite. Since there are only 3 beverages, the remaining person must drink sprite.

7. The fan indie and the brazilian have the same parity positions. Since the Canadian and the French are already placed, the Brazilian must be in the second position. So, the French is in the first position.

8. The fan electronic is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. Since the Canadian drinks cola, the fan of electronic can be either to the left or to the right of the Canadian. Let's place the fan of electronic to the right of the Canadian.

   | Beverage      | Cola             | Sprite          |

9. The french is on the right of the fan indie. Since the French is already placed, the fan of indie must be to the left of the French. So, the fan of indie is in the first position.

10. The person eating avocado is not to the right of the person eating kale. Since the Brazilian eats kale and there are only 3 foods, the remaining person must eat avocado.

   |               |       Canadian    |      French       |     Brazilian   |

Lv12-5x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and transport options. Let's assign variables to each of them:
   - Jobs: A (Analyst), D (Dancer), A' (Architect)
   - Movie-Genres: F (Family), H (Horror), M (Martial-arts)
   - Music-Genres: B (Blues), F' (Folk), P (Pop)
   - Pets: F (Fish), M (Mouse), R (Rat)
   - Transport: B (Bus), R (Roller), T (Trike)

2. From point 1, we know that the dancer is on the right of the person driving the roller. So, D cannot be in the first column and R cannot be in the first row.

3. The person watching family movies is not to the left of the owner of the mouse. This means F cannot be in the second column and M cannot be in the third column.

4. The fan blues is not to the left of the person driving the bus. This means B cannot be in the second row. Since B is in the middle (point 6), it must be in the second row and second column.

5. The architect is not to the right of the fan blues. This means A' cannot be in the third row. Since A' is not in the second row (point 4), it must be in the first row.

6. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the fan folk. This means M must be in the third column and either the second or third row. Since M cannot be in the second row (point 3), it must be in the third row.

7. The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. This means M cannot be in the third column (point 6). So, M must be in the second row.

8. The person driving the trike is not to the right of the person driving the trike. This means T cannot be in the third row. Since T cannot be in the second row (point 4), it must be in the first row.

9. The fan blues is not the person watching family movies or the person watching family movies is not the person driving the bus or both. Since we know B is the person watching family movies (point 4), the person driving the bus cannot be B. So, the person driving the bus must be A or D.

10. The fan blues is not the person driving the trike. Since we know B is the person watching family movies (point 4) and driving the bus (point 9), B cannot be driving the trike. So, the person driving the trike must be A' or D.

11. The fan folk is on the left or right of the dancer. Since we know M is the dancer (point 6), F' can be either in the first or third column.

12. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since we know B is the person watching family movies (point 4) and M is the person watching martial-arts movies (point 6), F must be in the first column.

13. The person driving the roller is not the person watching horror movies. Since we know R is the person driving the roller (point 2) and none of the other options are horror (point 3), no conflict here.

14. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the fan blues. Since we know M is the owner of the mouse (point 7) and B is the fan blues (point 4), M must be in the first column.

15. The person driving the bus is the owner of the fish or the dancer is the person driving the bus, but not both. Since we know B is the person driving the bus (point 9) and A' is the architect (point 5), A' must be the owner of the fish.

16. The fan folk is on the left or right of the dancer. Since we know M is the dancer (point 6) and F' is not in the first column (point 11), F' must be in the third column.

Lv12-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and odd positions (1, 2, 3) are given, we can assign the people to the positions. Let's assign them in order of their unique identifiers (beverage, hobby, job, movie-genre, transport).

2. From the given information, we can start filling in the table:

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |            |         |             |
| Hobby         |            |         |             |
| Job           |            |         |             |

| Transport     |            |         |             |

3. Let's start with the beverages. Since there are 3 different beverages, we can assign them to the people. Let's assign them in order of their unique identifiers (7up, hot-chocolate, tea).

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |  7up         | hot-chocolate| tea       |
| Hobby         |            |         |             |
| Job           |            |         |             |

| Transport     |            |         |             |

4. Now let's fill in the hobbies. Since there are 3 different hobbies, we can assign them to the people. Let's assign them in order of their unique identifiers (baking, dancing, magic-tricks).

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |  7up         | hot-chocolate| tea       |
| Hobby         |  baking     | dancing  | magic-tricks|

| Movie-Genre   |            |         |             |
| Transport     |            |         |             |

5. Now let's fill in the jobs. From rule 3, the chef is somewhere to the right of the accountant. Since the accountant can't be in position 1 (rule 7), the accountant must be in position 2 or 3. If the accountant is in position 2, the chef must be in position 3. If the accountant is in position 3, the chef must be in position 2. Let's assume the accountant is in position 2.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |  7up         | hot-chocolate| tea       |
| Hobby         |  baking     | dancing  | magic-tricks|
| Job           | accountant | chef     | journalist |
| Movie-Genre   |            |         |             |
| Transport     |            |         |             |

6. Now let's fill in the movie-genres. From rule 4, the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person watching epic movies. Since the accountant can't watch epic movies (rule 12), the accountant can't be watching documentary movies either (rule 2). So, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 3.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |  7up         | hot-chocolate| tea       |
| Hobby         |  baking     | dancing  | magic-tricks|
| Job           | accountant | chef     | journalist |
| Movie-Genre   |            |         | documentary|
| Transport     |            |         |             |

7. Now let's fill in the remaining movie-genres. Since the accountant can't watch epic movies (rule 12), the journalist can't watch epic movies either (rule 8). So, the person watching epic movies must be in position 1.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |  7up         | hot-chocolate| tea       |
| Hobby         |  baking     | dancing  | magic-tricks|
| Job           | accountant | chef     | journalist |
| Movie-Genre   | epic       |         | documentary|
| Transport     |            |         |             |

8. Now let's fill in the transport. From rule 6, the person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the journalist. Since the journalist can't drive the boat (rule 6), the person driving the boat must be in position 1.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |  7up         | hot-chocolate| tea       |
| Hobby         |  baking     | dancing  | magic-tricks|
| Job           | accountant | chef     | journalist |
| Movie-Genre   | epic       |         | documentary|
| Transport     | boat       |         |             |

9. Now let's fill in the remaining transport. Since the person driving the train can't be the person drinking tea (rule 8) and can't watch epic movies (rule 8), the person driving the train must be in position 3.

|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
| Beverage      |  7up         | hot-chocolate| tea       |
| Hobby         |  baking     | dancing  | magic-tricks|
| Job           | accountant | chef     | journalist |
| Movie-Genre   | epic       |         | documentary|
| Transport     | boat       |         | train      |

10. Now let's check the remaining rules. Rule 1 is satisfied because the person who's hobby is baking and the person driving the boat have different parity positions (1 and 3). Rule 5 is satisfied because the person drinking tea is not to the left of the person who's hobby is baking (tea is in position 3 and baking is in position 2). Rule 9 is satisfied because the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the person drinking hot-chocolate (magic-tricks is in position 3 and hot-chocolate is in position 1). All other rules are already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

2. The librarian cannot be in position 1 (since the electrician is there), so the librarian can be in positions 2 or 3. Let's assume the librarian is in position 2 (L).

3. Now, the videographer must be in position 3 (V).

4. The person drinking cola cannot be the electrician (E) or the librarian (L), so they can be in positions 1 or 2. Let's assume the person drinking cola is in position 1 (C).

5. The person drinking water must be in position 2 (W) because of rule 9. Since the nationalities are different, the person drinking water must be Russian (R).

6. The person watching adventure movies cannot be the Australian (A) because of rule 6, so the Australian must be watching disaster movies (D). Since the electrician (E) is not watching disaster movies, the Australian must be in position 3 (A).

7. The person watching documentary movies cannot be the Japanese (J) because of rule 12, so the person watching documentary movies must be the electrician (E).

8. The person driving the trike cannot be the electrician (E) or the person watching documentary movies (D), so the person driving the trike must be the librarian (L).

9. The person driving the snowmobile must be the Australian (A) because of rule 8.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv12-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we can place the martial-arts movie-genre and mango food either in the same row or in different rows but with the same column. Let's place them in the same row for simplicity. So, we can place martial-arts in the first row and mango in the second row.

2. From rule 2, the person watching thriller movies cannot be in the second row (since the mango is there) and cannot be in the first row (since the iced-tea must be there due to rule 10). So, place the thriller in the third row.

3. From rule 3, the brazilian cannot be in the first row (since the disaster movie is there). So, place the brazilian in the second or third row.

4. From rule 4, the soy-milk drinker is in the same row as the iced-tea drinker or in a different row but in the same column. Since the iced-tea drinker is in the first row (rule 10), place the soy-milk drinker in the second row.

5. From rule 5, the mango eater is not in the first column (since the car driver is there). So, place the mango in the second or third column. Let's place it in the second column for simplicity.

6. From rule 6, the jet-ski driver is in the same row as the cola drinker or the cola drinker is in the same column as the cauliflower eater. Since the cola drinker is in the second row (rule 4), place the cola in the second column (since the mango is there). So, the jet-ski driver is also in the second row.

7. From rule 7, the person watching disaster movies is in the third row (since the brazilian is not in the first row).

8. From rule 8, the soy-milk drinker is the mexican or the soy-milk drinker is watching martial-arts. Since the soy-milk drinker is already placed in the second row, the martial-arts movie-genre must be in the third row (since it cannot be in the first row due to rule 1). So, the soy-milk drinker is the mexican.

9. From rule 9, the jet-ski driver (who is also the cola drinker) is to the left of the person watching disaster movies. So, the jet-ski driver is in the first column and the person watching disaster movies is in the second or third column.

10. From rule 10, the iced-tea drinker is in an even position. Since the cola drinker (jet-ski driver) and the soy-milk drinker (mexican) are already placed, the iced-tea drinker must be in the first row.

11. From rule 11, the carrot eater is in the first column.

12. From rule 12, the brazilian or the person watching martial-arts movies is the bus driver. Since the brazilian is already placed, the person watching martial-arts movies must be the bus driver. So, the martial-arts movie-genre is in the third column.

Now, let's place the remaining items:
- The cauliflower eater is in the third column (since the cola drinker and the soy-milk drinker are already placed).

Lv12-5x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the hobbies in the Hobby column. Since filmmaking can't be to the left of dancing, we can place dancing in the first position and filmmaking in the second or third position. Let's place filmmaking in the second position for now. So, the Hobby column looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Dancing    | Filmmaking|   Card-games|

2. Since filmmaking is to the right of the person driving the train, the train can't be in the first or second position. Let's place it in the third position. So, the Transport column looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Dancing    | Filmmaking|   Card-games|
   | Transport     |   Jet-ski  | Snowmobile|   Train     |

3. Since the person driving the snowmobile is the person drinking water, we can place water in the second position and snowmobile in the first position. So, the Beverage and Transport columns look like this:

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Dancing    | Filmmaking|   Card-games|
   | Beverage      | Water      |   Sprite  |   Lemonade  |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Jet-ski  |   Train     |

4. Since the person drinking water is on the left or right of the person driving the train, water can't be in the first position. So, it must be in the second position.

5. Since the person drinking sprite is not the fan of funk or the person doing filmmaking, sprite can't be in the second position (because we placed water and filmmaking there). So, sprite must be in the first position.

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Dancing    | Filmmaking|   Card-games|
   | Beverage      | Sprite     |   Water   |   Lemonade  |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Jet-ski  |   Train     |

6. Since the person drinking sprite is not the fan of funk, funk can't be in the third position (because we placed lemonade there). So, funk must be in the second position.

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Dancing    | Filmmaking|   Card-games|
   | Beverage      | Sprite     |   Water   |   Lemonade  |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Jet-ski  |   Train     |
   | Music-Genre   | Disco      |   Funk    |   Indie     |

7. Since the person drinking lemonade and the person doing card-games have the same parity positions, the person doing card-games can't be in the first position (because we placed dancing there). So, card-games must be in the second position.

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Dancing    | Card-games| Filmmaking|
   | Beverage      | Sprite     |   Lemonade |   Water   |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Jet-ski  |   Train     |
   | Music-Genre   | Disco      |   Funk    |   Indie     |
   | Food          | Banana     |   Blueberry| Lettuce    |

8. Since the person eating banana is not to the right of the fan of funk, banana can't be in the third position (because we placed lettuce there). So, banana must be in the second position.

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Dancing    | Card-games| Filmmaking|

   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Jet-ski  |   Train     |
   | Music-Genre   | Disco      |   Funk    |   Indie     |
   | Food          | Banana     |   Blueberry| Lettuce    |

9. Since the person eating lettuce is on the left of the person driving the train, lettuce can't be in the third position. So, lettuce must be in the first position.

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Dancing    | Card-games| Filmmaking|

   | Music-Genre   | Disco      |   Funk    |   Indie     |
   | Food          | Lettuce    |   Banana  |   Blueberry|

10. Since the person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking water, water can't be in the first position (because we placed lettuce there). So, water must be in the third position.

   | Food          | Lettuce    |   Banana  |   Blueberry|

11. Since the fan of disco is on the left of the fan of indie, disco must be in the first position.

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Dancing    | Card-games| Filmmaking|

   | Food          | Lettuce    |   Banana  |   Blueberry|

12. Since the person eating banana is not to the right of the fan of funk, banana can't be in the second position (because we placed card-games there). So, banana must be in the third position.

   |               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
