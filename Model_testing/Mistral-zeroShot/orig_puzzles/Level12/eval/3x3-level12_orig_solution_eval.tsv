Lv12-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the Pakistani is not in the first position (as the bird owner must be to their left). So, the nationalities can be arranged as follows: ________, Pakistani, ________.

2. From point 2, the bird owner cannot be in the third position (as the helicopter driver must be to their right). So, the arrangement becomes: ________, ________, Pakistani.

3. From point 3, the bus driver must be in an odd position. The only odd position left is the first position. So, the arrangement becomes: Bus (Argentine), ________, Pakistani.

4. From point 4, the French cannot be the bird owner or the bus driver. Since the bird owner and the bus driver are already determined, the French must be in the middle position. So, the arrangement becomes: Bus (Argentine), French, Pakistani.

5. From point 5, the Argentine must be in the first position. So, the arrangement becomes: Bus (Argentine), French, Pakistani.

6. From point 6, the owner of the dog cannot be to the left of the French. Since the French is in the second position, the dog owner must be in the third position. So, the pets become: Dog (Pakistani), ________, Snake.

7. From point 7, the snake owner must be to the right of the bus driver (who is the Argentine). Since the Pakistani is to the right of the Argentine (from point 5), the snake owner must be in the first position. So, the pets become: Snake (Argentine), Dog (Pakistani), ________.

8. From point 8, the owner of the bird cannot be to the left of the French (who is the second position). Since the snake owner is in the first position, the bird owner must be in the third position. So, the pets become: Snake (Argentine), Dog (Pakistani), Bird (French).

Now, let's put the nationalities, pets, and transport together:

| Nationality   |   1    |     2      |     3     |
|--------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Pet           |        |            |           |
| Transport     |        |            |           |

| Nationality   | Argentine | French | Pakistani |
|--------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Pet           | Snake    | Bird   | Dog       |
| Transport     | Bus      |        |           |

Since the bus is driven by the Argentine (from our previous arrangement), the table becomes:

| Nationality   | Argentine | French | Pakistani |
|--------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Pet           | Snake    | Bird   | Dog       |
| Transport     | Bus      |        |           |

Now, let's fill in the missing pets and transport:

| Nationality   | Argentine | French | Pakistani |
|--------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Pet           | Snake    | Bird   | Dog       |
| Transport     | Bus      | Helicopter | Subway   |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the person driving the bike. Let's assign the sport of ice-hockey to the second position (2) and the bike to the third position (3).

2. The person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the sport of ice-hockey is already assigned, the only remaining sport is rugby. So, the person driving the quad-bike cannot be in the first position (1).

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since we know the position of the person playing ice-hockey, we can place the chinchilla's owner to the right of the person playing ice-hockey.

4. The person driving the quad-bike is not the owner of the chinchilla or the person driving the quad-bike is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey or both. Since we know the position of the person playing ice-hockey and the position of the chinchilla's owner, this condition is already satisfied.

5. The person driving the quad-bike is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey or the person driving the quad-bike is not the owner of the rat or both. Since we know the position of the person playing ice-hockey and the position of the chinchilla's owner, and we have already placed the quad-bike, this condition is also satisfied.

6. The person driving the quad-bike is on the far left. Since we have already placed the quad-bike, this condition is satisfied.

7. The owner of the rat is on the left of the person driving the bike. Since we know the position of the quad-bike and the position of the chinchilla's owner, we can place the rat's owner to the left of the bike.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv12-3x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is not the person who's hobby is dancing or the person driving the subway is not the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means that the person who's hobby is dancing cannot be in the first column (since it would force the sport of lacrosse to be in the first row), and the person driving the subway cannot be in the third column (since it would force the sport of lacrosse to be in the third row). So, the hobby of dancing cannot be in the first or third column, and the subway cannot be in the third row.

2. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the hobby of dancing cannot be in the first column, the bike must be in the second or third column.

3. The person driving the car is on the far right. Since the subway cannot be in the third column, the car must be in the third column.

4. The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car. Since the car is in the third column, the sport of lacrosse must be in the first or second column.

5. The person who's hobby is dancing is not to the right of the person driving the subway. Since the subway cannot be in the third row, the hobby of dancing must be in the first or second row.

6. The person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the sport of lacrosse is in the first or second column, the sport of tennis must be in the third row.

7. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the hobby of dancing cannot be in the first column, the skateboarding must be in the second or third column.

Now, let's place the information we have:

| Hobby       | Drawing | Dancing | Woodworking |
|------------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Sport      | Skateboarding | Lacrosse | Tennis |
| Transport   | Bike | Car | Subway |

Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing, and the bike is already in the second column, the skateboarding must be in the first column.

Now, the only remaining information is the position of the hobby of drawing. Since the person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing, and the bike is in the second column, the hobby of drawing must be in the first column.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-3x3-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. We know that the person watching spy movies can be the person drinking coffee or the person who's sport is soccer, or both. Let's assume the person watching spy movies is the person drinking coffee (C). This means the person who's sport is soccer (S) is not watching spy movies.

2. The person drinking hot-chocolate (H) is in an even position. Since there are 3 positions, the only even position is the middle one. So, H is in the second position.

3. The person who's sport is skateboarding (K) is to the right of the person who's sport is soccer (S). Since S is not in the first position (as per point 4), K must be in the third position.

4. The person drinking coffee (C) is to the left of the person who's sport is soccer (S). Since S is in the third position (as per point 3), C must be in the first position.

5. The person drinking fanta (F) and the person watching superhero movies (SH) have different parity positions. Since F is not in the even position (as per point 2), SH must be in the first or third position. But SH can't be in the first position because C is already there (as per point 4). So, SH must be in the third position.

6. The person who's sport is soccer (S) is not the person drinking hot-chocolate (H) or the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person watching spy movies (C). Since H is in the second position and C is in the first position, S can't be in the second position. So, S must be in the third position.

7. The person drinking fanta (F) is in the position where superhero movies (SH) are. So, F is in the third position.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv12-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the Thai on the far right since they are not allowed to be on the left of anyone. So, the Nationality column is: `######### | Thai`

2. Since the Thai is on the far right, the person eating pumpkin cannot be on the far left, so they must be in the middle: `######### | Thai | ######## | Pumpkin`

3. The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the Australian, so the Australian must be on the right: `######### | Thai | Australian | Pumpkin`

4. The owner of the bird is not the Australian or the person eating orange, so the owner of the bird must be on the left of the Australian and the person eating orange must be on the right of the Australian: `######### | Thai | Australian | Orange | Bird`

5. The person eating corn cannot be on the far left because the Indonesian is to the left of the person eating corn. Since the Thai and the Australian are already on the left, the Indonesian must be in the first position: `Indonesian | Thai | Australian | Orange | Bird`

6. The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the Australian, so the goldfish owner must be the Indonesian: `Indonesian (Goldfish) | Thai | Australian | Orange | Bird`

7. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person eating pumpkin, so the turtle owner must be in the last position: `Indonesian (Goldfish) | Thai | Australian | Orange | Turtle`

8. The person eating corn is between the owner of the bird and the person eating orange. Since the bird is the Indonesian and the orange is the Australian, the person eating corn must be the Australian: `Indonesian (Goldfish) | Thai | Australian (Corn) | Australian (Orange) | Turtle`

9. The person eating orange is between the owner of the bird and the person eating corn, so this is already satisfied.

10. The owner of the bird is not the person eating orange or the Australian, so this is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the genres are fantasy, superhero, and western, sports are skateboarding, soccer, volleyball, and the means of transport are bike, subway, trike.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person driving the subway is not to the right of the person watching fantasy movies. So, fantasy cannot be in the rightmost column.

3. From rule 2, we know that the person watching western movies is not the person driving the bike. So, bike cannot be in the same row as western.

4. From rule 3, the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway. So, subway cannot be in the leftmost column.

5. From rule 4, the person watching superhero movies is somewhere between the person driving the trike and the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we know that fantasy is not in the rightmost column, superhero cannot be in the leftmost column.

6. From rule 5, the person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is soccer or the person watching superhero movies is not the person driving the trike or both. This means superhero cannot be in the same row as soccer or trike.

7. From rule 6, the person watching western movies is not the person driving the bike. Since we know that subway cannot be in the leftmost column, western cannot be in the same row as bike.

8. From rule 7, the person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. So, volleyball cannot be in the leftmost column.

9. From rule 8, the person watching superhero movies is not to the right of the person watching western movies. Since we know that superhero cannot be in the leftmost column and volleyball cannot be in the leftmost column, superhero cannot be in the second column.

10. From rule 9, the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since we know that volleyball cannot be in the leftmost column, volleyball must be in the rightmost column.

11. Now we know that volleyball is in the rightmost column, so soccer must be in the middle column.

12. Since superhero cannot be in the second column, it must be in the leftmost column.

13. Now we know that superhero, soccer, and volleyball are in their respective columns. Since we know that fantasy is not in the rightmost column, it must be in the leftmost row.

14. Since the person driving the subway is not to the right of the person watching fantasy movies, the subway must be in the second row.

15. Since the person watching western movies is not the person driving the bike, the bike must be in the third row.

16. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is not specified to be anywhere in particular, it can be in any of the three rows. However, since it's a different sport, it cannot be in the same row as soccer or volleyball. So, it can only be in the first row.

17. Since the person who's sport is trike is not specified to be anywhere in particular, it can be in any of the three rows. However, since it's a different means of transport, it cannot be in the same row as subway or bike. So, it can only be in the second row.

```

The person driving the trike is not specified, but we know it's in the second row. The person driving the subway is in the second row, and the person watching fantasy movies is in the first row. The person watching superhero movies is in the first row, the person watching soccer is in the second row, and the person watching volleyball is in the third row.

Lv12-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is sailing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Let's denote the positions as S for sailing, W for weightlifting, C1, C2, and C3 for the three food choices, T for techno, D for d&b, and R for reggae.

   So, we have S < W.

2. The fan techno is not the person eating pepper or the fan techno is not the person who's sport is weightlifting or both. This means T cannot be in the same column as P (pepper) and T cannot be in the same row as W.

3. The person eating broccoli is not to the left of the person eating broccoli. This means there can only be one broccoli eater. Let's denote the position of the broccoli eater as B.

4. The person eating pepper is not to the right of the fan techno. Since T cannot be in the same row as P, this means P must be to the left of T.

5. The fan techno is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since S is to the left of W, T must be to the right of W.

6. The person eating pepper is the fan d&b. Since P cannot be in the same row as T, D must be in the same row as P.

7. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli. Since there is only one broccoli eater (B), S must be either to the left or to the right of B.

Now, let's arrange the information:

   - S < W
   - T cannot be in the same row as P and T cannot be in the same row as W
   - There is only one broccoli eater (B)
   - P is to the left of T
   - T is to the right of W
   - D is in the same row as P
   - S is to the left or right of B

Let's try to place the elements one by one:

   - We can't place W yet because it must be to the right of T, but we don't know where T is.
   - We can place B in any of the three positions. Let's place it in the first position for now.
   - Since S is to the left or right of B, S can only be in the second or third position. Let's place S in the second position for now.
   - Now we know T must be in the third position.
   - Since D is in the same row as P, P must be in the second column.
   - Now we know W must be in the first column.

So, the initial arrangement could be:

| Food  |    1    |       2       |    3     |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|
| Music |         |               |          |
| Sport |         |               |          |

   - Now we know the music genres. Reggae can't be in the same row as W (first column), so it must be in the third row. Techno is in the third row, so d&b must be in the first row.

So, the final arrangement is:

|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |
| Food          | Reggae  | Broccoli     | Pepper   |
| Music-Genre   |         |               | D&B      |

Lv12-3x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person driving the boat is between golf and skateboarding. Let's assume the order is Golf-Boat-Skateboarding for now.

2. From point 2, the person driving the bike is not the fan of trance or the person who does skiing. Since we know the order of sports, the person driving the bike can't be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position (Golf, Boat, Skateboarding). So, the person driving the bike must be in the 4th position (Quad-bike).

3. From point 3, the fan of trance and the person driving the boat have different parity positions. Since we know the position of the boat and trance can't be the same (as the boat driver is in the 2nd position), the fan of trance must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 4th position. But since the bike driver is in the 4th position, trance can't be in the 4th position. So, trance must be in the 1st or 3rd position. Let's assume trance is in the 1st position.

4. From point 4, the fan of reggae is to the left of the person who does skiing. Since we know the position of skiing (3rd position), reggae can't be in the 1st position (as trance is there). So, reggae must be in the 2nd position.

5. From point 5, the person who does golf is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since we know the position of the quad-bike (4th position), golf can't be in the 4th position. So, golf must be in the 1st position.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

| Transport     |        |        | quad-bike     |

   Since we haven't filled the sport and music genre for the 2nd and 3rd rows, let's use the remaining information:

6. From point 2, the person driving the bike is not the fan of trance or the person who does skiing. Since we know the position of trance (1st) and skiing (3rd), the person driving the bike must be a fan of soul (as the other option, reggae, is already taken). So, the 2nd row should be Soul.

7. From point 3, the fan of trance and the person driving the boat have different parity positions. Since we know the position of trance (1st) and the boat driver is between golf and skateboarding (2nd position), the boat driver must be a fan of trance (as the other option, reggae, is already taken in the 2nd position). So, the 3rd row should be Trance.

Now, the final solution table is:

| Transport     |        |        | quad-bike     |

   Since we have filled all the music genres, let's fill the sports based on the remaining information:

8. From point 4, the fan of reggae is to the left of the person who does skiing. Since we know the position of reggae (2nd) and skiing (3rd), the person doing golf must be a fan of skateboarding (as the other option, golf, is already taken). So, the 1st row should be Skateboarding.

9. From point 5, the person who does golf is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since we know the position of golf (1st) and the quad-bike driver is in the 4th position, the person doing skateboarding must be a fan of golf (as the other option, skiing, is already taken). So, the 2nd row should be Golf.

Now, the final solution table is:

   | Sport         | baseball | water-polo |           |

5. The russian is not the person watching romance movies or the russian is not the person who's sport is baseball or both. Since we already placed the Russian as the baseball player, the Russian cannot be the person watching romance movies. So, the person watching romance movies must be Indian or Malaysian. But the russian is not the person watching romance movies, so the person watching romance movies must be Malaysian.

6. The person who's sport is baseball is on the far left or far right. Since the baseball player is already on the left, it cannot be on the far right. So, the remaining sport, climbing, must be on the far right. Let's assume the nationality of the climber is Indian.

7. We have filled all the cells with the given conditions. So, the final solution table is:

   |               |    1     |     2      |     3     |
   | Movie-Genre   | mystery  | romance   | scientific |
   | Nationality   | Indian   | Malaysian | Russian   |
   | Sport         | baseball | water-polo | climbing  |

   But we need to put '#############' around the table, so the final solution is:

   |############|    1     |     2      |     3     |
   |############| mystery  | romance   | scientific |
   |############| Indian   | Malaysian | Russian   |

Lv12-3x3-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are 3 different hobbies, the first row must contain one of the hobbies (let's say card-games for now). The second row can't have card-games because of rule 2, so it must have one of the remaining hobbies (let's say filmmaking for now). The third row must have the remaining hobby, which is magic-tricks.

2. Now let's place the nationalities. Since the journalist is not the turkish (rule 7), the first row can't have the turkish nationality. So, the first row must have either german or thai. Let's place the thai in the first row for now. The second row can't have the thai nationality because the journalist is the thai or the person with card-games is the thai (rule 2), so the second row must have the german nationality. The third row must have the turkish nationality.

3. Now let's place the jobs. Since the social-worker is to the left of the person with magic-tricks (rule 3 and 4), the social-worker must be in the first or second row. Since the social-worker is not the person with filmmaking (rule 7), the social-worker can't be in the second row. So, the social-worker must be in the first row. The chef can't be in the first row because the social-worker is the chef or the person with filmmaking is the chef (rule 7), so the chef must be in the second row. The journalist can't be in the first row because the journalist is the person with card-games or the person with card-games is the thai (rule 2), so the journalist must be in the third row.

4. Since the person with card-games is to the right of the social-worker (rule 5) and to the right of the thai (rule 6), the person with card-games must be in the third row.

5. Since the person with filmmaking is not the turkish (rule 7) and the chef is not the person with filmmaking (rule 7), the person with filmmaking must be in the first row.

6. Finally, since the german is not to the right of the person with filmmaking (rule 8), the german must be in the second row.

The final solution table is:

|               |        Thai       |       German       |      Turkish      |
| Hobby         | Card-games        |   Filmmaking      | Magic-tricks      |
| Job           | Social-worker     |   Chef            | Journalist        |
| Nationality   |               |                   |                   |

However, we don't have enough information to fill in the nationality for the second row. The table could be filled with either german or thai, but not both. So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |        Thai       |       ########       |      Turkish      |
