Lv12-3x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the positions with an odd number are 1, 3, and 5, and the positions with an even number are 2 and 4, the person who's sport is tennis and the owner of the ferret have the same parity positions, so they must be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume Tennis is in position 1, and Ferret is in position 3 (for now).

2. The person driving the snowmobile is on the far right, so it must be in position 5.

3. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train. Since the train is not the snowmobile (from point 2), it must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the train is in position 2.

4. The owner of the bird is the person who's sport is biathlon or the owner of the bird is the person driving the train or both. If the bird is in position 1 (Tennis is there), then the biathlon cannot be in position 2 (Train is there). So, the bird must be in position 5, and the biathlon must be in position 3.

5. The owner of the ferret is on the left of the person driving the ship. Since the ferret is in position 3, the ship must be in position 4 or 5. But the ship cannot be in position 5 because the snowmobile is there (point 2). So, the ship is in position 4.

6. The person driving the trike is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the trike is in position 5, the water-polo must be in position 1 or 2. But the water-polo cannot be in position 1 because the biathlon is there (point 4). So, the water-polo is in position 2.

7. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere between the person who's sport is swimming and the person driving the trike. Since the swimming is in position 4 and the trike is in position 5, the snowboarding must be in position 3.

8. The owner of the goat is not to the right of the owner of the frog. Since the frog is in position 2 and the goat cannot be in position 5 (because the snowmobile is there), the goat must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But it cannot be in position 2 (because the train is there), or position 3 (because the ferret is there), or position 4 (because the ship is there). So, the goat is in position 1.

9. The owner of the bird is not to the left of the owner of the fish. Since the bird is in position 5 and the fish cannot be in position 1 (because the goat is there), the fish must be in position 4.

10. The person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the person driving the airplane. Since the tennis is in position 1, the airplane cannot be in position 2 or 3. So, the airplane is in position 4.

11. The person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis is in position 1 and the swimming is not the airplane (point 10), the swimming must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But it cannot be in position 2 (because the train is there), or position 3 (because the ferret is there), or position 5 (because the snowmobile is there). So, the swimming is in position 4.

12. The person driving the train is not the person who's sport is water-polo or the person who's sport is water-polo is not the owner of the frog or both. Since the train is in position 2 and the water-polo is in position 2, this condition is satisfied.

13. The owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the goat. Since the frog is in position 2 and the goat is in position 1, this condition is satisfied.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv12-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3 and 15, the lawyer or the fisherman is on the far right. Since the nurse is not on the far right (rule 2), the lawyer must be on the far right, and the fisherman is not. So, the lawyer is in the last column (column 5) and the fisherman is in one of the first four columns.

2. From rule 1, the nurse is somewhere between the analyst and the collector. Since the lawyer is in column 5, the nurse cannot be in column 5. So, the nurse is in one of the first four columns.

3. From rule 4, the nurse is not to the right of the puzzles person. Since the nurse is not in column 5, the puzzles person must be in one of the first four columns.

4. From rule 5, the nurse is not to the left of the teacher. Since the nurse is in one of the first four columns, the teacher must be in one of the last three columns (columns 3, 4, or 5).

5. From rule 7, the cooking person is not to the right of the fantasy person. Since the teacher is in one of the last three columns, the fantasy person must be in one of the first two columns (columns 1 or 2).

6. From rule 8, the fantasy person is the accountant. So, the accountant is in one of the first two columns.

7. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is puzzles is not the person watching western movies or the person watching western movies is not the accountant. Since the accountant is in one of the first two columns and the western movies person cannot be in column 1 (because the fantasy person is there), the western movies person must be in column 2.

8. From rule 11, the sudoku person is somewhere between the teacher and the cooking person. Since the teacher is in one of the last three columns and the cooking person is not in column 5 (because the lawyer is there), the sudoku person must be in column 4.

9. From rule 13, the puzzles person is in an even position. Since the puzzles person is not in column 1 (because the fantasy person is there), the puzzles person must be in column 2 or 4. But the puzzles person cannot be in column 4 because the sudoku person is there. So, the puzzles person is in column 2.

10. From rule 10, the collector and the accountant have different parity positions. Since the accountant is in column 1, the collector must be in column 3.

11. From rule 6, the zombie person is between the action person and the puzzles person. Since the action person is in column 1 and the puzzles person is in column 2, the zombie person must be in column 3.

12. From rule 14, the drama person is on the left of the action person. Since the action person is in column 1, the drama person must be in column 2.

13. From rule 12 and 15, the western movies person is the fisherman or the lawyer. Since the fisherman is in column 2 (because the zombie person is there), the lawyer must be in column 5.

14. From rule 13, the cooking person is in an odd position. Since the accountant, the fantasy person, the puzzles person, the drama person, and the zombie person are all in even positions, the cooking person must be in column 3.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-3x5-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the music genres to the rows (1-5). We can use the given information to eliminate some possibilities. For example, we know that the fan punk is not the fan d&b (from rule 1), so we can assign d&b to a different row. Let's say d&b is in row 1, punk is in row 2, jazz in row 3, pop in row 4, and rock in row 5.

2. Next, let's assign nationalities to the columns (A-E). Again, we can use the given information to eliminate some possibilities. For example, we know that the argentine is not to the left of the owner of the pony (from rule 3), so the argentine cannot be in column A or B. Let's say argentine is in column C, french in column D, malaysian in column E, polish in column A, and russian in column B.

3. Now, let's assign pets to the cells where we have a music genre and a nationality combined. We can use the given information to make some deductions. For example, from rule 10, we know that the malaysian is the fan jazz or the owner of the frog. Since the malaysian is not in column A or B (from our previous assignment), the frog must be in the same column as the malaysian, which is column E. Let's say the malaysian is the fan jazz and the owner of the frog.

4. Continue this process for all the rules, making deductions and assigning pets and nationalities where possible. Some rules may not provide enough information to make a definitive assignment, but you can make educated guesses based on the information given.

5. Once you have assigned all the pets, nationalities, and music genres, you should have a complete solution table.

Here is a possible solution:

```
  Music-Genre   |   1    |     2     |    3    |   4    |     5     |

Lv12-3x5-4	"To solve this puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person's hobby, music-genre, and transport. Let's start by assigning numbers to the positions from left to right.

1. The person driving the roller is not the person who's hobby is card-games or the person driving the roller is not the fan soul. This means that the person driving the roller cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5, and also cannot be in position 1 if the fan soul is in position 1. So, the person driving the roller can only be in position 3.

2. The fan folk is on the left of the fan salsa. This means the fan salsa cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the fan salsa is not to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (clue 12), the fan salsa cannot be in position 5.

3. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the roller is in position 3, the person driving the ship can only be in position 4 or 5.

4. The fan r&b is not to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. This means the fan r&b cannot be in position 4 or 5. Since the fan r&b is the person who's hobby is board-games (clue 17), the person who's hobby is board-games cannot be in position 4 or 5.

5. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere between the fan salsa and the fan soul (clue 5). Since the fan salsa is in position 2 and the fan soul cannot be to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (clue 7), the person driving the jet-ski can only be in position 3 or 4.

6. The person driving the bike is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is in an odd position (clue 16), the person driving the bike can only be in position 3, 5, or an even position. However, the person driving the bike and the person who's hobby is gardening have the same parity positions (clue 18), so the person driving the bike cannot be in an even position. Therefore, the person driving the bike is in position 5.

7. The fan soul is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games (clue 7). Since the person driving the bike is in position 5 and the fan r&b is the person who's hobby is board-games, the fan soul can only be in position 4 or 6.

8. The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right (clue 8). Since the person driving the roller is in position 3, the person driving the ship is in position 4, and the person driving the jet-ski is in position 3 or 4, the person driving the subway must be in position 1 or 5. However, the fan r&b is on the far left or far right (clue 9), so the person driving the subway cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the person driving the subway is in position 1.

9. The fan r&b is on the far left or far right (clue 9). Since the person driving the subway is in position 1, the fan r&b cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the fan r&b is in position 5.

10. The person driving the subway is on the right of the fan salsa (clue 10). Since the person driving the subway is in position 1 and the fan salsa is in position 2, this is satisfied.

11. The fan r&b is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship (clue 11). Since the fan r&b is in position 5 and the person driving the ship is in position 4, this is satisfied.

12. The fan salsa is not to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (clue 12). Since the fan salsa is in position 2 and the person who's hobby is gardening cannot be in position 4 or 5 (clue 4), the person who's hobby is gardening must be in position 1 or 3.

13. The person driving the jet-ski and the fan salsa have different parity positions (clue 13). Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 3 and the fan salsa is in position 2, this is satisfied.

14. The person who's hobby is writing is the fan soul or the person driving the subway is the person who's hobby is writing, but not both (clue 14). Since the person who's hobby is writing cannot be in position 5 (clue 9), the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 1 or 3. However, the fan soul is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games (clue 7), so the person who's hobby is writing cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person who's hobby is writing is in position 3, and the fan soul is in position 4.

15. The fan gospel and the person who's hobby is writing have the same parity positions (clue 15). Since the person who's hobby is writing is in position 3, the fan gospel must be in position 1 or 3. However, the fan gospel cannot be in position 1 because the person driving the subway is in position 1 (clue 8). Therefore, the fan gospel is in position 3.

16. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in an odd position (clue 16). Since the person who's hobby is skydiving cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5 (clues 8, 14, and 17), the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2.

17. The person driving the bike and the person who's hobby is gardening have the same parity positions (clue 18). Since the person driving the bike is in position 5 and the person who's hobby is gardening is in position 1 or 3, the person who's hobby is gardening is in position 3.

The final solution table is:

Lv12-3x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the German is either to the left or right of the person drinking water##3. Let's assume the German is to the right of the person drinking water (German position is 4 or 5).

2. From rule 2, the British is to the right of the Thai. Since the Thai is in the middle (position 3), the British must be in position 2 or 6.

3. From rule 3, the person drinking water is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the German is to the right of the person drinking water, the scooter driver must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

4. From rule 4, the Thai is in the middle (position 3).

5. From rule 5, the Thai and the person driving the motorbike have different parity positions##9. Since the Thai is in position 3, the motorbike driver must be in position 1, 3, 5, or an even position (2, 4, or 6).

6. From rule 6, the person drinking soy-milk is not the person driving the van or the malaysian or both. Since the Thai and motorbike driver have different parity positions, the motorbike driver cannot be in position 2 (even), so the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in position 4 (even). So, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1, 3, 5, or an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Also, the malaysian is not the person drinking soy-milk.

7. From rule 7, the malaysian is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the German. Since the German is in position 4 or 5, the malaysian must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. From rule 8, the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the Chinese. Since the German is to the right of the person drinking water, the Chinese must be in position 1 or 5.

9. From rule 9, the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since the Chinese is in position 1 or 5, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6.

10. From rule 10, the person drinking coffee and the British have different parity positions##9. Since the British is in position 2 or 6, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

11. From rule 11, the British is not to the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver is in position 1, 3, 5, or an even position, the British cannot be in position 2, 4, or 6. So, the British must be in position 1 or 3.

12. From rule 12, the person driving the van and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions##9. Since the British is in position 1 or 3, the person driving the van must be in position 3 or 5.

13. From rule 13, the malaysian is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. Since the Chinese is in position 1 or 5, the person drinking cola must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6.

14. From rule 14, the person driving the motorbike is not to the left of the person driving the train. Since the motorbike driver is in position 1, 3, 5, or an even position, the train driver cannot be in position 2 (odd). So, the train driver must be in position 4 or 6.

15. From rule 15, the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the train driver is in position 4 or 6, the person driving the motorbike cannot be in position 2 (even). So, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1, 3, 5, or an odd position.

16. From rule 16, the person driving the train is not the Thai. Since the train driver is in position 4 or 6, the Thai cannot be in position 4 or 6. So, the Thai must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

17. From rule 17, the person drinking water is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the Thai is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in position 1 (even). So, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6.

Now, let's put the information together:

| Beverage      |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |

| Transport     |            |           |         |           |         |

From rules 1, 11, and 17, we know that the German is in position 5, the British is in position 1, and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2.

From rule 3, the person drinking water is in position 1. Since the German is in position 5, the person drinking water cannot be the malaysian (rule 7). So, the person drinking water must be the Thai.

From rule 4, the Thai is in position 3.

From rule 5, the person driving the motorbike is in position 1, 3, 5, or an even position. Since the British is in position 1 and the Thai is in position 3, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 4 or 6.

From rule 6, the person drinking soy-milk is not the malaysian. Since the malaysian is not the Thai or the person driving the motorbike, the person drinking soy-milk must be the Chinese (position 4).

From rule 12, the person driving the van is in position 5.

From rule 13, the malaysian is in position 5.

From rule 15, the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person drinking cola. Since the malaysian is in position 5, the person drinking cola must be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, since the person drinking cola is not the Thai (rule 16), the person drinking cola must be the Chinese (position 2).

From rule 9, the person drinking coffee is in position 1, 3, 4, or 6. Since the British is in position 1, the person drinking coffee must be in position 3, 4, or 6. However, since the person drinking coffee and the British have different parity positions (rule 10), the person drinking coffee must be in position 6.

From rule 8, the person drinking 7up is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since the Chinese is in position 2 and the Thai is in position 3, the person drinking 7up must be in position 4 or 5. However, since the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee (rule 9), the person drinking 7up must be in position 4.

From rule 14, the person driving the train is in position 4 or 6. Since the person driving the train is not the Thai (rule 16), the person driving the train must be in position 6.

From rule 13, the malaysian is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is the Chinese (position 2), the malaysian must be in position 1.

From rule 2, the British is in position 2.

From rule 5, the person driving the motorbike is in position 4 or 6. Since the malaysian is in position 1, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 6.

From rule 12, the person driving the van is in position 5.

From rule 6, the person drinking soy-milk is not the malaysian. Since the malaysian is in position 1, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 5.

From rule 1, the German is in position 5.

From rule 3, the person drinking water is in position 1.

From rule 4, the Thai is in position 3.

From rule 17, the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-3x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of gospel is not to the right of the owner of the frog. Let's place the fan of gospel in the first four columns (1, 2, 3, 4) and the frog in the fifth column (5).

2. From rule 2, the fan of country and the owner of the mouse have different parity positions. Since the fan of gospel is already placed, the fan of country cannot be in the first four columns. So, the fan of country must be in the fifth column (5).

3. From rule 3, the Dutch is not to the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the fan of country is in the fifth column, the Dutch cannot be in the first four columns either. So, the Dutch must be in the fifth column (5).

4. From rule 4, the Indonesian and the fan of rock have different parity positions. Since the Dutch and the fan of country are already placed, the Indonesian cannot be in the first four columns. So, the Indonesian must be in the fifth column (5).

5. From rule 5, the owner of the cat is somewhere to the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the Dutch, Indonesian, and the fan of country are already placed, the owner of the cat must be in one of the first four columns.

6. From rule 6, the fan of country is the owner of the turtle or the fan of country is the Pakistani or both. Since the fan of country is already the owner of the turtle, the Pakistani cannot be in the fifth column (5). So, the Pakistani must be in one of the first four columns.

7. From rule 7, the Dutch and the fan of gospel have different parity positions. Since the Dutch and the fan of country are already placed, the fan of gospel cannot be in the first three columns (1, 2, 3). So, the fan of gospel must be in the fourth column (4).

8. From rule 8, the Indonesian is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the Indonesian is already placed, the owner of the chinchilla must be in one of the first four columns.

9. From rule 9, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the Indonesian is already placed, the owner of the turtle must be in one of the last three columns (3, 4, 5).

10. From rule 10, the owner of the cat is not the fan of rock. Since the owner of the cat is already placed, the fan of rock must be in one of the first four columns.

11. From rule 11, the fan of reggae is between the fan of gospel and the fan of country. Since the fan of gospel is in the fourth column (4) and the fan of country is in the fifth column (5), the fan of reggae must be in the third column (3).

12. From rule 12, the fan of rock is not to the left of the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian is in the fifth column (5), the fan of rock must be in one of the first four columns.

13. From rule 13, the owner of the turtle is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the Indonesian. Since the owner of the frog can be in any of the first four columns and the Indonesian is in the fifth column (5), the owner of the turtle can be in any of the second to fourth columns (2, 3, 4).

14. From rule 14, the fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the owner of the frog. Since the fan of reggae is in the third column (3) and the owner of the frog can be in any of the first four columns, the owner of the frog cannot be in the third column (3). So, the owner of the frog must be in one of the first two columns (1, 2).

15. From rule 15, the Dutch is on the left of the fan of gospel. Since the fan of gospel is in the fourth column (4), the Dutch must be in the first column (1).

16. From rule 16, the owner of the turtle is not to the left of the fan of rock. Since the fan of rock can be in any of the first four columns and the owner of the turtle can be in any of the second to fourth columns, the fan of rock cannot be in the second column (2). So, the fan of rock must be in one of the first three columns (1, 3, 4).

17. From rule 17, the owner of the mouse is on the right of the fan of folk. Since the fan of folk has not been placed yet, it must be in one of the first three columns (1, 2, 3). If it were in the first column (1), the owner of the mouse would have to be in the fifth column (5), which contradicts rule 5. So, the fan of folk must be in the second column (2). This means the owner of the mouse must be in the fourth column (4).

18. From rule 18, the Indonesian is not the owner of the turtle. Since the Indonesian is in the fifth column (5) and the owner of the turtle can be in any of the second to fourth columns (2, 3, 4), the owner of the turtle cannot be in the fifth column (5). So, the owner of the turtle must be in one of the second to fourth columns (2, 3, 4).

19. From rule 19, the owner of the frog is not the fan of reggae or the Dutch is not the owner of the frog or both. Since the fan of reggae is in the third column (3) and the Dutch is in the first column (1), the owner of the frog cannot be in the third column (3). So, the owner of the frog must be in one of the first two columns (1, 2).

20. From rule 20, the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is in the fourth column (4), the owner of the chinchilla must be in one of the last three columns (3, 4, 5).

21. From rule 21, the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is in the fourth column (4), the owner of the cat can be in either the first three columns (1, 2, 3) or the fifth column (5).

Now, let's place the remaining music genres:
- Since the fan of country is in the fifth column (5), the fan of folk must be in the second column (2).
- Since the fan of rock can be in any of the first four columns (1, 2, 3, 4) and the fan of reggae is in the third column (3), the fan of folk must be in the second column (2). This means the fan of rock must be in one of the first three columns (1, 2, 3).

Since we have placed all the nationalities, pets, and music genres, let's check the parity positions:
- The Dutch is in the first column (1), the Indonesian is in the fifth column (5), and the fan of country is in the fifth column (5). These three are in odd-numbered columns, so they have the same parity.
- The fan of gospel is in the fourth column (4), the fan of reggae is in the third column (3), and the fan of rock is in the first column (1). These three are in odd-numbered columns, so they have the same parity.
- The owner of the frog is in the first column (1), the owner of the mouse is in the fourth column (4), and the owner of the chinchilla is in one of the last three columns (3, 4, 5). These three are in odd-numbered columns, so they have the same parity.
- The owner of the cat is in one of the first three columns (1, 2, 3) or the fifth column (5), and the owner of the turtle is in one of the second to fourth columns (2, 3, 4). These two can have different parity.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv12-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the goldfish owner in the middle (position 3) because of rule 1.

2. Since the goldfish owner is not the videographer (rule 2), the videographer cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. So, the videographer must be in position 3 (left of goldfish owner) or position 6 (right of goldfish owner).

3. The bartender is drinking 7up (rule 3), so 7up must be in position 2. Since the videographer cannot be in position 2 (as the goldfish owner is in position 3), the videographer must be in position 6.

4. Now we know the videographer is in position 6, so the cat owner must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (not in position 6 because the videographer is there). Let's place the cat owner in position 1 for now.

5. The owner of the hamster is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (rule 6), so hot-chocolate cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (as the goldfish and cat owners are there). So, hot-chocolate must be in position 4 or 5. Let's place it in position 4 for now.

6. The person drinking sprite is to the left of the bartender (rule 7), so sprite cannot be in position 2 (as the bartender is there). So, sprite must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not in position 2). Since the cat owner is in position 1 and the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 4, sprite cannot be in position 1 or 4. So, sprite must be in position 3 or 5. Let's place it in position 3 for now.

7. The librarian is on the left or right of the accountant (rule 8), so the accountant cannot be in position 1 or 6 (as the cat owner and the videographer are there). So, the accountant must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since the bartender is in position 2 and the librarian cannot be in position 6 (as the videographer is there), the accountant must be in position 4 or 5. Let's place the accountant in position 4 for now.

8. Now the librarian must be in position 2 (left of accountant) or position 5 (right of accountant). Since the librarian is between the accountant and the person drinking 7up (rule 11), the person drinking 7up must be in position 3. So, the person drinking 7up is the bartender.

9. The owner of the hamster is not the person drinking iced-tea (rule 9), and the iced-tea drinker is not the librarian (rule 9). So, the iced-tea drinker cannot be in position 2 (as the librarian is there). So, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not in position 2). Since the cat owner is in position 1, the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 4, the bartender is in position 3, and the accountant is in position 4, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 5.

10. The person drinking water is to the left of the goldfish owner (rule 5), so water cannot be in position 3 (as the goldfish owner is there). So, water must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not in position 3). Since the cat owner is in position 1, the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 4, the bartender is in position 3, the accountant is in position 4, and the iced-tea drinker is in position 5, water must be in position 2.

11. The owner of the pony is not to the right of the owner of the pony (rule 4), so the pony cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5 (as the goldfish, cat, and iced-tea drinkers are there). So, the pony must be in position 1 or 2. Since the cat owner is in position 1, the pony cannot be in position 1. So, the pony is in position 2.

12. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the owner of the cat (rule 12), so sprite cannot be in position 3 (as the bartender is there). So, sprite must be in position 5.

13. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking sprite (rule 13), so iced-tea must be in position 1.

14. The pilot is somewhere to the left of the librarian (rule 14), so the pilot cannot be in position 5 (as the librarian is there). So, the pilot must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the bartender is in position 3, the pilot cannot be in position 3. So, the pilot is in position 2 or 4. Since the accountant is in position 4, the pilot cannot be in position 4. So, the pilot is in position 2.

15. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat (rule 15), so the hamster cannot be in position 5 (as the iced-tea drinker is there). So, the hamster must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the cat owner is in position 1, the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 4, the bartender is in position 3, the accountant is in position 4, the iced-tea drinker is in position 1, and the pilot is in position 2, the hamster must be in position 3.

16. The person drinking hot-chocolate and the videographer have the same parity positions (rule 16). Since the videographer is in position 6 and the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 4, they have different parity positions (videographer is odd, hot-chocolate drinker is even). This rule seems to be incorrect or there might be a mistake in the puzzle.

Final solution table:

| Beverage   | 7up   | hot-chocolate | iced-tea | sprite | water |
|-----------|-------|---------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Job        | bartender | accountant | librarian | pilot | videographer |

Lv12-3x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position, it can't be in position 1, 2, or 5. So, it must be in position 3 or 4.

2. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person eating onion. Since the person who's hobby is chess can't be in position 1, the only possible position for onion is position 2. So, board-games must be in position 3 or 5.

3. The person who's sport is swimming is between the person who's hobby is chess and the person eating grapefruit. Since chess can't be in position 1, the only possible positions for swimming are 2, 3, or 4. But since grapefruit can't be in position 1, swimming can't be in position 1 either. So, swimming must be in position 3 or 4.

4. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since chess can't be in position 1, grapefruit can't be in position 2 either. So, grapefruit must be in position 1 or 5. But since board-games is to the right of onion, grapefruit can't be in position 5. So, grapefruit must be in position 1.

5. The person who's hobby is reading is not the person eating grapefruit or the person who's hobby is reading is not the person who's sport is handball or both. Since grapefruit is in position 1, reading can't be in position 1. So, reading must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But since the person who's hobby is reading is not the person who's sport is handball, reading can't be in position 3 (because handball is in position 3). So, reading must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

6. The person who's sport is handball is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since handball is in position 3, rock-climbing must be in position 3.

7. The person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions. Since rock-climbing is in position 3, volleyball must be in position 3 or 5 (since positions 1, 2, and 4 are odd). But since the person who's hobby is reading is not the person who's sport is handball, reading can't be in position 5. So, volleyball must be in position 3.

8. The person who's sport is cycling is in the middle. Since handball is in position 3 and volleyball is in position 3, cycling must be in position 4.

9. The person who's hobby is puzzles and the person eating tomato have the same parity positions. Since cycling is in position 4, puzzles and tomato have the same parity. Since reading is in an odd position (position 2), tomato must be in an even position. So, tomato can be in position 2, 4, or 6. But since the person who's hobby is reading is not the person eating tomato, tomato can't be in position 2. So, tomato must be in position 4 or 6. But since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games, tomato can't be in position 6. So, tomato must be in position 4.

10. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since board-games is in position 3, reading must be in position 2 or 5. But since the person who's hobby is reading is not the person eating grapefruit, reading can't be in position 2. So, reading must be in position 5.

11. The person who's sport is snowboarding is not to the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since grapefruit is in position 1, snowboarding can't be in position 2 or 3. So, snowboarding must be in position 4 or 5. But since the person who's hobby is reading is in position 5, snowboarding can't be in position 5. So, snowboarding must be in position 4.

12. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since rock-climbing is in position 3, swimming can be in position 2 or 4. But since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games, swimming can't be in position 2 (because board-games is in position 3). So, swimming must be in position 4.

13. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person eating garlic. Since cycling is in position 4, garlic must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games, garlic can't be in position 2 (because board-games is in position 3). So, garlic must be in position 1 or 5. But since the person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position, garlic can't be in position 1. So, garlic must be in position 5.

14. The person who's hobby is puzzles and the person eating tomato have the same parity positions. Since tomato is in position 4, puzzles must be in position 2 or 4. But since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games, puzzles can't be in position 2 (because board-games is in position 3). So, puzzles must be in position 4.

15. The person who's hobby is reading is in an odd position. Since reading is in position 5, all other positions must be even. So, onion must be in position 2, tomato in position 4, and garlic in position 5.

16. The person who's hobby is puzzles and the person eating tomato have the same parity positions. Since tomato is in position 4, puzzles must be in position 2 or 4. But since the person who's hobby is reading is in position 5, puzzles can't be in position 2. So, puzzles must be in position 4.

17. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person eating onion. Since onion is in position 2, board-games must be in position 3 or 5. But since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games, board-games can't be in position 5. So, board-games must be in position 3.

18. The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person eating tomato. Since tomato is in position 4, chess must be in position 5.

Lv12-3x5-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the sports, pets, and foods to the columns and rows based on the given clues.

1. We know that the person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret. Let's assume that sailing is in column 3, and the ferret is in column 2 or 4.
2. The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the ferret, so the dog is in column 1, and the ferret is in column 2 or 4.
3. The person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since sailing is in column 3, water-polo must be in column 5. Swimming can be in column 1, 2, or 4.
4. The owner of the dog is the person eating spinach, so spinach is in column 1.
5. The person eating cabbage is not the owner of the cat or the owner of the cat is not the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the cat cannot be in column 1 (as it would be the owner of the dog), the cat must be in column 2, 4, or 5. The person who's sport is water-polo is in column 5, so the cat cannot be in column 5. Therefore, the cat is in column 2 or 4.
6. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not to the left of the person eating cabbage. Since cabbage is in column 2 or 4, ice-hockey cannot be in column 1.
7. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the owner of the pony or both2. Since the dog is in column 1, the pony cannot be in column 1.
8. The person eating cabbage is not the person who's sport is sailing. Since sailing is in column 3, cabbage cannot be in column 3.
9. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the person eating spinach. Since spinach is in column 1, ice-hockey cannot be in column 2 or 4.
10. The person eating pumpkin is on the far left. Since the dog and spinach are in columns 1 and 4, pumpkin must be in column 5.
11. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the owner of the pony. Since the pony cannot be in column 1, it must be in column 2, 3, or 5.
12. The owner of the ferret is not the person eating plum. Since the ferret is in column 2 or 4, plum cannot be in column 2 or 4.
13. The person who's sport is sailing is not to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since sailing is in column 3 and water-polo is in column 5, sailing cannot be in column 1 or 2.
14. The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the owner of the dog. Since pumpkin is in column 5 and the dog is in column 1, there is no conflict with this clue.
15. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the person eating spinach or the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the owner of the pony. Since ice-hockey cannot be in column 1, it must be in column 2, 3, or 5. Since the pony cannot be in column 1, it must be in column 2, 3, or 5.
16. The person eating cabbage is not the person who's sport is sailing. Since sailing is in column 3, cabbage cannot be in column 3.
17. The person eating pumpkin and the person who's sport is baseball have the same parity positions. Since pumpkin is in an odd position (column 5), baseball must also be in an odd position (column 3 or 5).
18. The person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the left of the person eating spinach. Since swimming can be in column 1, 2, or 4, and spinach is in column 1, swimming can be in column 1 or 2.
19. The person eating plum is not to the left of the person eating cabbage. Since cabbage is in column 2 or 4, plum cannot be in column 1.

Now let's assign the remaining items:
- Since the cat cannot be in column 1 or 5 (due to the dog and ice-hockey), the cat must be in column 2 or 4. Since the cat is not the person who's sport is water-polo (column 5), the cat must be in column 2.
- Since the pony cannot be in column 1 (due to the dog), the pony must be in column 3 or 5. Since the pony is not the owner of the dog (column 1), the pony must be in column 5.
- Since the person who's sport is baseball cannot be in column 1 (due to the dog and swimming), the person who's sport is baseball must be in column 3 or 5. Since baseball has the same parity as pumpkin (column 5), the person who's sport is baseball must be in column 3.
- Since the person who's sport is swimming cannot be in column 5 (due to baseball), the person who's sport is swimming must be in column 1 or 2. Since swimming is to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo (column 5), the person who's sport is swimming must be in column 1.
- Since the person who's sport is water-polo is not the owner of the cat (column 2), the person who's sport is water-polo must be in column 4 or 5. Since the person who's sport is swimming is in column 1, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in column 5.
- Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey cannot be in column 1 (due to the dog and swimming), the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be in column 2 or 4. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the owner of the pony (column 5), the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be in column 2.
- Since the person who's sport is sailing is not to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo (column 5), the person who's sport is sailing must be in column 3 or 4. Since the person who's sport is sailing is not the owner of the ferret (column 2), the person who's sport is sailing must be in column 4.
- Since the person who's sport is sailing is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret (column 2), the owner of the ferret must be in column 1.

Here is the final solution table:
