Lv12-7x5-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign parity (even or odd) to each person based on their position in the table. For example, the first person is even, the second person is odd, the third person is even, and so on.

2. Next, let's use the given clues to eliminate impossible combinations. For example, from clue 5, we know that the person drinking juice is not the Chinese, so the Chinese cannot be in the first, third, or fifth position.

3. Continue this process for all the clues. Some clues will help to eliminate multiple possibilities at once, while others will only eliminate one.

4. Once you've eliminated all impossible combinations, the remaining possibilities will form the solution.

Here's a simplified version of the table after applying some of the clues:

|               |      1       |     2      |     3      |     4     |     5      |
| Beverage      |              |            |            |           |            |
| Hobby         |              |            |            |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |              |            |            |           |            |
| Nationality   |              |            |            |           |            |
| Pet           |              |            |            |           |            |
| Sport         |              |            |            |           |            |
| Transport     |              |            |            |           |            |

- From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is badminton and the person watching satire movies have the same parity positions. Since badminton is an odd position (let's say 3), satire must be in an odd position as well (let's say 2).
- From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is basketball and the person watching satire movies have different parity positions. Since we've already placed satire at position 2, basketball cannot be in position 2.
- From clue 3, we know that the person driving the trike is not to the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since thriller is an even position (let's say 4), the trike cannot be in position 3 or 5.
- From clue 4, we know that the person drinking juice is not to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since filmmaking is an even position (let's say 2), juice cannot be in position 1.
- From clue 5, we know that the person drinking juice is not the Chinese. Since we've already placed juice at position 1, the Chinese cannot be in position 1.

And so on...

After applying all the clues, you should be able to fill in the table with the correct answers. The final solution table will be:

Lv12-7x5-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step can be quite challenging. I'll try to break it down into smaller steps.

Step 1: Let's start by assigning some variables to make it easier to reason about the problem.

- F: Food (blueberry, cabbage, cranberry, kale, spinach)
- H: Hobby (board-games, dancing, puzzles, skydiving, writing)
- J: Job (architect, dancer, musician, police-officer, software-developer)
- M: Movie-Genre (epic, mystery, scientific, spy, time-travel)
- G: Music-Genre (classical, electronic, pop, soul, trance)
- P: Pet (cat, frog, goat, goldfish, snake)
- T: Transport (boat, ship, skateboard, taxi, tram)

We'll use the puzzle numbers to represent the positions in the table. For example, if we know that the person eating spinach is on the left of the person watching scientific movies, we can write it as:

34. P1 = < P2 (where P1 is the position of the person eating spinach and P2 is the position of the person watching scientific movies)

Step 2: Let's start by solving some of the easier clues.

- From clue 1, we know that the owner of the goat is to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Let's say D is the position of the person who's hobby is dancing. Then, the owner of the goat is at position D+1.
- From clue 2, we know that the owner of the frog is not the person who's hobby is skydiving or the owner of the frog is not the person driving the tram. Let's say F is the position of the owner of the frog. If F is not the person driving the tram, then the person driving the tram is at position F+1 or F+2. If F is not the person who's hobby is skydiving, then the person who's hobby is skydiving is at position F-1, F, or F+1.
- From clue 23, we know that the person watching mystery movies is the person driving the ship or the person watching mystery movies is the musician. Let's say M is the position of the musician. If the person watching mystery movies is the musician, then M = Ship position. If the person watching mystery movies is not the musician, then the person watching mystery movies is at position M+1 or M+2.

Step 3: Let's continue solving more clues. We'll try to use the information we've already gathered to solve new clues.

- From clue 24, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is between the person driving the skateboard and the person eating blueberry.

- From clue 27, we know that the owner of the goat is to the right of the person driving the ship. If the person driving the ship is at position M or M+1, then the owner of the goat is at position M+2 or M+3.
- From clue 28, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles and the person eating cranberry have the same parity positions. Let's say C is the position of the person eating cranberry. If C is an even position, then the person who's hobby is puzzles is also at an even position. If C is an odd position, then the person who's hobby is puzzles is at an odd position.

Step 4: Continue solving more clues using the information we've already gathered.

Lv12-7x5-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step will help us find the solution. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign parity (even or odd) to each position. Since there are 5 people, we can assign positions 1, 3, and 5 as even and positions 2 and 4 as odd.

2. Let's start with the clues that give us direct information about the positions:
   - The person driving the bike is in an even position (4)
   - The person eating potato is on the right of the owner of the goat (4 is even, so the goat must be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the goat is in position 3 for now.)
   - The fan rock is somewhere to the left of the person driving the scooter (5 is odd, so the scooter must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the scooter is in position 1 for now.)
   - The fan rock is on the left of the owner of the mouse (3 is even, so the mouse must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the mouse is in position 2 for now.)
   - The fan trance and the social-worker have different parity positions (2 is even, so the social-worker must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the social-worker is in position 5 for now.)
   - The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere between the fan disco and the social-worker (5 is odd, so the chinchilla must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the chinchilla is in position 1 for now.)
   - The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion (1 is odd, so the onion must be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the onion is in position 3 for now.)
   - The person driving the tram is in the middle (2)
   - The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person watching disaster movies (1 is odd, so the disaster movies must be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the disaster movies are in position 5 for now.)
   - The person eating onion and the person watching disaster movies have the same parity positions (3 and 5 are both odd)

3. Now let's solve the clues that give us indirect information:
   - The person who's sport is climbing is not the person watching satire movies (5 is not 4)
   - The person who's sport is swimming is not the person eating onion (3 is not 3)
   - The owner of the mouse is not the fan trance (2 is not 5)
   - The person eating garlic is the owner of the fish or the person eating garlic is the person watching horror movies, but not both (1 or 3 is either the fish or the horror movies, but not both)
   - The fan rock is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is climbing (1 or 3 is climbing)
   - The fan rock is not the person driving the scooter (1 is not 1)
   - The fan rock is not the person who's sport is badminton (1 is not 2)
   - The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere between the fan disco and the social-worker (1 is between 5 and 5)
   - The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion (1 is to the left of 3)
   - The person who's sport is handball is somewhere to the right of the person eating pineapple (3 is to the right of 5)
   - The person eating onion is not the librarian (3 is not 4)
   - The person who's sport is rugby is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies (1 or 3 is scientific movies)
   - The person eating garlic is not to the right of the person driving the scooter (1 is not 1)
   - The person watching spy movies is not to the right of the fan trance (5 is not 5)
   - The person watching satire movies is not to the left of the person who's sport is climbing (1 or 3 is not 2)
   - The person driving the airplane is the coach or the person driving the airplane is the person eating potato, but not both (1 or 3 is either the coach or the potato, but not both)
   - The mechanic is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies (1 or 3 is disaster movies)
   - The fan metal is not to the left of the person driving the tram (5 is not 2)
   - The fan folk is somewhere to the right of the mechanic (3 is to the right of 1)
   - The fan metal and the social-worker have the same parity positions (5 and 5 are both odd)
   - The owner of the snake is not the librarian (4 is not 4)
   - The accountant is the fan metal or the fan metal is the person eating onion or both (1 or 3 is metal or 3 is onion, but not both)
   - The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter (2 is to the right of 1)
   - The person who's sport is swimming is not to the right of the social-worker (5 is not 5)
   - The person watching scientific movies is on the far right (4 is scientific movies)
   - The fan trance is the mechanic or the fan trance is the person who's sport is handball, but not both (1 or 3 is mechanic or 3 is handball, but not both)
   - The person driving the bike is somewhere between the person who's sport is badminton and the owner of the snake (2 is between 2 and 4)

4. Now let's fill in the table with the information we have:

|               |    1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |       5       |
| Food          | garlic   | onion     | potato     | snake      | trance       |
| Job           | accountant| mechanic   | coach      | librarian   | social-worker |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster | satire    | scientific  | horror     | spy          |
| Music-Genre   | disco    | folk      | metal      | rock       | trance       |
| Pet           | chinchilla| mouse     | goat       | fish       | snake        |
| Sport         | badminton| climbing   | swimming    | handball    | rugby        |
| Transport     | bike     | scooter   | airplane   | tram       | boat         |

5. We still have some inconsistencies in the table, but we can't solve them all with the given information. For example, the person eating garlic can't be both the accountant and the person watching horror movies, but we don't have enough information to determine which one it is. Similarly, the person who's sport is handball can't be both the fan trance and the mechanic, but we don't have enough information to determine which one it is.

The final solution table would look like this:

| Food          | garlic   | onion     | potato     | snake      | trance       |
| Job           | accountant| mechanic   | coach      | librarian   | social-worker |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster | satire    | scientific  | horror     | spy          |
| Music-Genre   | disco    | folk      | metal      | rock       | trance       |
| Pet           | chinchilla| mouse     | goat       | fish       | snake        |

| Transport     | bike     | scooter   | airplane   | tram       | boat         |

We still have some clues that we can't solve without more information about the parity positions:

- The person who's hobby is writing (W) and the person drinking mirinda (M) have different parity positions
- The teacher (Tch) and the Spanish (Sp) have different parity positions
- The person driving the scooter (Sc) and the teacher (Tch) have the same parity positions

4. Now we have most of the positions filled. Let's fill the remaining positions:
   - Position 1: Turtle owner (not the left of the firefighter, so it's not 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, or 7, and it's not the cat owner, so it's not 20. Let's assume it's 1)
   - Position 5: Roller driver (the owner of the mouse is the roller driver, so it's 1)

Lv12-7x5-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's identify the unique elements for each category:

1. Beverages: lemonade, mirinda, soy-milk, sprite, tea
2. Food: blueberry, cucumber, kale, orange, tomato
3. Hobbies: baking, card-games, collecting, drawing, woodworking
4. Jobs: designer, pilot, police-officer, scientist, software-developer
5. Movie-Genres: action, documentary, mystery, romance, superhero
6. Nationalities: american, argentine, spanish, thai, turkish
7. Pets: chinchilla, dog, hamster, hedgehog, turtle

Now, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating cucumber is on the far right, so we can place it in column 5.
2. The pilot is somewhere between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking sprite. Since the cucumber eater is on the far right, the pilot must be in either column 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the pilot in column 2 for now.
3. The person eating tomato is on the right of the person eating kale. Since the cucumber eater is on the far right, the tomato eater must be in column 4 or 5. Let's place the tomato eater in column 4 for now.
4. The American is on the right of the Thai. Since the cucumber eater is on the far right, the Thai must be in column 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the Thai in column 1 for now.
5. The person who's hobby is woodworking and the person drinking tea have different parity positions. Since the pilot, Thai, and cucumber eater are already placed, the only even positions left for the woodworking hobby are columns 2 and 4. Let's place the woodworking hobby in column 4 for now.
6. The argentine is in an even position. Since the Thai is in position 1, the argentine must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's place the argentine in position 2 for now.
7. The owner of the dog is not the Thai or the owner of the dog is not the person who's hobby is woodworking or both. Since the Thai is in position 1 and the woodworking hobby is in position 4, the dog owner can't be in position 1 or 4. Let's place the dog owner in position 3 for now.
8. The software-developer is between the person who's hobby is card-games and the person drinking tea. Since the pilot, Thai, cucumber eater, woodworking hobby, and argentine are already placed, the software-developer can only be in position 1, 2, or 3.
