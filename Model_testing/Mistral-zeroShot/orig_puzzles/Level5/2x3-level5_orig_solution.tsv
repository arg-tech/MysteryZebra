Lv5-2x3-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 pets (chinchilla, dog, turtle) and 3 sports (badminton, baseball, soccer). We also know that each pet has a corresponding sport.

2. From point 1, we can create a list of possible combinations for the pets and sports:

   | Pet | Sport |
   |-----|-------|
   | Ch  | B     |
   | Do  | S     |
   | Tu  | B, BA, BS | (B for badminton, BA for baseball, BS for soccer)

   Here, Tu has three possibilities because the person who plays baseball can be on the far left or far right, and we don't know the exact position of the person who plays badminton yet.

3. From point 2, let's consider the second condition: the owner of the dog is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. This means that the dog cannot be in the first or third column. So, the dog must be in the second column.

   | Pet | Sport |
   |-----|-------|
   | Ch  | B     |
   | Do  | S     |
   | Tu  | B, BA, BS |

4. Now, let's consider the third condition: the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog. This means that the turtle cannot be in the first column. So, the turtle must be in the second or third column.

   | Pet | Sport |
   |-----|-------|
   | Ch  | B     |
   | Do  | S     |
   | Tu  | BA, BS |

5. Since the person who's sport is baseball is on the far left or far right, the only possible position for baseball is the third column. This means that the person who plays soccer must be in the first column.

   | Pet | Sport |
   |-----|-------|
   | Ch  | B     |
   | Do  | S     |
   | Tu  | BA    |

6. Now, we know that the person who plays badminton is in the middle. Since the dog is on the right of the person who plays badminton, the chinchilla must be on the left.

   | Pet | Sport |
   |-----|-------|
   | Ch  | B     |
   | Do  | S     |
   | Tu  | BA    |

7. Finally, we have the solution:

   | Pet     |     1      |   2    |    3     |
   |---------|-----------|-------|----------|
   | Pet     | Chinchilla | Dog   | Turtle   |
   | Sport   | Badminton | Soccer| Baseball |

Lv5-2x3-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person drinking juice, and the person drinking juice is to the right of the person watching satire movies, we can deduce that hot-chocolate cannot be in the first column (as it would violate both conditions). So, hot-chocolate must be in the second or third column.

2. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking cola. Since hot-chocolate cannot be in the first column, cola must be in the first column.

3. Now, let's place cola in the first column. Since the person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking cola, juice must be in the second or third column.

4. The person watching family movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies. Since we have placed cola and juice in the first two columns, family movies must be in the first column and scientific movies in the third column.

5. Now, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person drinking juice, so hot-chocolate must be in the third column.

6. Finally, the movie genres must be placed according to their positions: Family in the first column, Satire in the second column, and Scientific in the third column.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
| Beverage   | Cola | Juice | Hot-chocolate |
| Movie-Genre | Family| Satire| Scientific    |
#############
```"
Lv5-2x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Russian is on the left of the Chinese, we can place the Russian in the first or second column. Let's place the Russian in the first column for now.

2. The Chinese is to the right of the Nigerian. So, the Nigerian must be in the first column as well, and the Chinese in the second or third column.

3. Now, the owner of the rat must be in the third column because the owner of the hamster is to the right of the owner of the rat and the owner of the mouse is to the left of the owner of the rat.

4. The owner of the mouse can be in the first or second column, but since the owner of the rat is in the third column, the owner of the mouse must be in the first column.

5. Now, the owner of the hamster can only be in the third column.

Final solution:

```
#############
|   Russian  |   Nigerian  |   Chinese  |
|   Hamster  |   Mouse     |   Rat      |
#############
```

This is the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv5-2x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person eating corn is to the left of the person eating plum. Let's denote the positions as C (corn), P (plum), and T (tomato). So, we have CP.

2. The person who's sport is biathlon is in the middle. Since we know the positions of corn and plum, biathlon must be in the middle position, so B.

3. The person eating plum is to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. So, P must be to the right of B, making the arrangement CPB or BCP.

4. The person eating corn is to the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since we know the position of biathlon (middle) and plum (right of biathlon), corn must be to the right of T. This means the arrangement must be CPB or BCP, and corn cannot be in the first position because it must be to the right of T. So, the final arrangement is BCP.

Now, let's fill in the sports and foods:

|         |   1    |    2     |   3    |
| Food    |       |         |        |
| Sport   |       |         |        |

Sport: Biathlon in the middle (2), Golf on the left (1), Soccer on the right (3)
Food: Plum in the middle (2), Corn on the left (1), Tomato on the right (3)

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|   Food    | Corn | Plum | Tomato |
| Sport     | Golf | Biathlon | Soccer |
#############"
Lv5-2x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the scooter is on the far left, so it must be in the first column. Let's place the scooter with the nationality that we don't know yet (let's call it X for now).

| Nationality   |    1    |    2     |     3     |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Transport    | scooter |         |          |

2. Now we know the Egyptian is driving the trike, so let's place the trike in the third column and the Egyptian nationality in the corresponding row. Since the Egyptian is to the right of the person on the far left (who is driving the scooter), the Egyptian cannot be in the first column. So, the Egyptian must be in the second or third column. Let's place the Egyptian in the second column for now.

| Nationality   |    1    |    2     |     3     |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Transport    | scooter | egyptian|          |

3. Now we have one nationality left (Turkish) and one transport left (quad-bike). Since the Turkish is to the right of the Egyptian, the Turkish cannot be in the first or second column. So, the Turkish must be in the third column.

4. Finally, we place the quad-bike in the first column since it's the only transport left.

| Nationality   |    1    |    2     |     3     |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Transport    | quad-bike| egyptian| trike    |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Nationality   |    1    |    2     |     3     |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Transport    | quad-bike| egyptian| trike    |
#############

This means the person driving the quad-bike is Turkish, the person driving the scooter is nationality X, and the person driving the trike is Egyptian. However, since we don't have specific information about nationality X, we can't determine it without additional information."
Lv5-2x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are three hobbies (dancing, gardening, rock-climbing) and three music-genres (dubstep, metal, techno). So, we can fill in the hobbies in the first row and music-genres in the second row.

   |               |     1     |    2    |       3       |
   | Hobby         | dancing  | gardening| rock-climbing |
   | Music-Genre   |         |         |              |

2. The fan of techno is the one with the hobby of rock-climbing, so we can fill in the techno genre in the third column of the second row.

   |               |     1     |    2    |       3       |
   | Hobby         | dancing  | gardening| rock-climbing |
   | Music-Genre   |         |         | techno       |

3. The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we already have the hobbies and music-genres filled in, this means that the dubstep fan must be in the first or second column. However, since the hobbies are different, the dubstep fan cannot be in the same column as the techno fan (rock-climbing). So, the dubstep fan must be in the first column.

   |               |     1     |    2    |       3       |
   | Hobby         | dancing  | gardening| rock-climbing |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep  |         | techno       |

4. Now, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. This means that the gardening hobby must be in the second column.

   |               |     1     |    2    |       3       |
   | Hobby         | dancing  | gardening| rock-climbing |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep  | metal   | techno       |

5. We have filled all the hobbies and music-genres correctly according to the given conditions. So, the final solution table is:

   |               |     1     |    2    |       3       |
   | Hobby         |##########|########|############# |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep  | metal   | techno       |

   The hobbies are: dancing, gardening, rock-climbing from left to right. The music-genres are: dubstep, metal, techno from top to bottom."
Lv5-2x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are three jobs (security-guard, software-developer, teacher) and three sports (badminton, skiing, volleyball). We also know that each person has a unique combination of a job and a sport.

2. From the first rule, we know that the person who plays skiing is to the right of the person who plays badminton. Let's assume the order is as follows:
   - Job 1 (Security-guard) plays Badminton (Column 1)
   - Job 2 (Software-developer) plays Skiing (Column 2)
   - Job 3 (Teacher) plays Volleyball (Column 3)

3. However, this arrangement violates the second rule, as the security-guard is to the left of the person who plays volleyball. To fix this, we can swap the positions of the security-guard and the software-developer.
   - Job 1 (Security-guard) plays Skiing (Column 2)
   - Job 2 (Software-developer) plays Badminton (Column 1)
   - Job 3 (Teacher) plays Volleyball (Column 3)

4. Now, the third rule is also satisfied, as the software-developer is to the right of the person who plays volleyball.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Security-guard   |   Badminton   |
|   Software-developer  |   Skiing   |
|   Teacher   |   Volleyball   |
#############
```

This arrangement satisfies all the given rules."
Lv5-2x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of drawing is on the left of the fisherman, and the hobbies are different, the hobby of the person on the far left cannot be drawing. So, the hobby of the person on the far left must be either baking or reading. Let's assume it's baking for now.

2. The person with the hobby of drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the hobby of the person on the far left is not drawing, the person on the far right must have the hobby of drawing.

3. Now, we know the hobbies of the people on the far left and far right. We can fill in the hobby of the person in the middle. Since the hobbies are different, the middle person must have the hobby of reading.

4. The designer is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the designer is not on the far left (as per point 4), the designer must be on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.

5. The designer is somewhere to the left of the fisherman. Since the designer is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading, and the person who's hobby is reading is on the far left, the designer must be in the middle.

So, the final solution table is:

|         |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Hobby   | baking  | reading  | drawing   |
| Job     |        | designer | fisherman |

But we don't know the jobs yet. Since the designer is in the middle, the job of the person on the far left must be the fisherman, and the job of the person on the far right must be a job other than designer and fisherman, which is the pilot.

So, the final solution table with jobs is:

|         |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Hobby   | baking  | reading  | drawing   |
| Job     | fisherman| designer | pilot    |

Lv5-2x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 3 beverages (7up, coffee, lemonade) and 3 transports (airplane, quad-bike, scooter). We need to arrange them in a row such that the given conditions are satisfied.

2. From condition 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person driving the airplane. So, let's place the airplane at position 1, and the lemonade drinker at position 3.

3. From condition 2, we know that the person driving the scooter is to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the lemonade drinker is at position 3, the quad-bike must be at position 2. Now, the scooter can only be at position 1 or position 3. But from condition 4, the scooter is in an odd position, so it must be at position 1.

4. Now, the airplane is at position 1, the quad-bike at position 2, and the scooter at position 1. The only remaining position for the lemonade drinker is position 2.

5. From condition 3, the person drinking 7up is to the left of the person drinking coffee. Since the lemonade drinker is at position 2, the coffee drinker must be at position 3. The only remaining position for the 7up drinker is position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-2x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the mechanic is on the far left or far right, and the freelancer is on the left of the mechanic, the mechanic can only be in the rightmost position. So, the mechanic is in the 3rd column and has a job of 'mechanic'.

2. Now, we know the mechanic is in the 3rd column, so the fan of salsa (since it's to the right of the fan of house) must be in the 2nd column. Let's assume the music-genre in the 2nd column is 'salsa'.

3. The fan of house is between the fan of salsa and the fan of reggae. Since the mechanic (who is the fan of salsa) is in the 3rd column, the only possible position for the fan of house is the 1st column. So, the music-genre in the 1st column is 'house'.

4. Now, the only remaining job for the 1st column is 'freelancer' (since the mechanic is in the 3rd column and the fan of house is in the 1st column).

5. The fan of reggaa is to the right of the fan of house, so it must be in the 2nd column. So, the music-genre in the 2nd column is 'reggae'.

Here is the final solution table:
