Lv5-3x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating raspberry is not in the first column (as per rule 12), so it must be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume it's in column 2 for now.

2. Since the person eating tomato is to the right of the person eating raspberry (rule 7), the tomato must be in column 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume it's in column 3 for now.

3. The person who's hobby is chess cannot be in the first column (as per rule 8), so it must be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume it's in column 4 for now.

4. The person who's hobby is cooking cannot be in the first column (as per rule 4), so it must be in column 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume it's in column 2 for now.

5. The person eating carrot is on the right of the person eating raspberry (rule 7) and the person eating raspberry is on the right of the person eating carrot (rule 1), so they must be in columns 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the carrot is in column 3 for now.

6. The person eating onion must be in the middle column (rule 5).

7. The person who's hobby is woodworking is to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving (rule 3), and the person who's hobby is skydiving is to the left of the person eating raspberry (rule 9). So, the woodworking must be in column 1, and skydiving must be in column 2.

8. The person who's sport is climbing is to the left of the person who's sport is sailing (rule 11), and the person who's sport is sailing is to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening (rule 12). So, the sailing must be in column 4, and the gardening must be in column 5.

9. The person who's sport is baseball is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (rule 8), and the person who's hobby is chess is in column 4. So, the baseball must be in column 5.

10. The person who's sport is rugby is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing (rule 6). Since climbing is in column 1, rugby can be in either column 1 or 2. However, if rugby was in column 1, it would violate rule 11 (climbing to the left of sailing), so rugby must be in column 2.

11. Now we know the positions of all sports, hobbies, and food. So, the final solution table is:

    |         |     1     |    2     |      3      |     4     |      5       |

    | Hobby   | woodworking| chess    | cooking    | gardening  | skydiving    |
    | Sport   | rugby    | climbing  | sailing    |           |              |

This is the final solution table."
Lv5-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking coffee is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Let's place coffee in the first position and almond-milk in the second position.

2. The person drinking juice is to the right of the person with the hobby of dancing. Since we already placed coffee and almond-milk, let's place dancing in the third position. This means juice must be in the fourth position.

3. The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person with the hobby of filmmaking. Since we already placed coffee, almond-milk, and dancing, filmmaking can only be in the fifth position. This means the turtle owner must be in the second or fourth position. Let's place the turtle owner in the fourth position for now.

4. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since we already placed dancing, filmmaking, and the turtle owner, the bird owner must be in the third position. This means traveling is in the first or fifth position. Let's place traveling in the fifth position for now.

5. The owner of the turtle is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the turtle owner in the fourth position, it must be on the far right. This means the person with the hobby of traveling must be in the first position.

6. The person drinking juice is to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we already placed traveling in the first position, juice must be in the second position.

7. The person who's hobby is gardening is the owner of the frog. Since we already placed all other hobbies, gardening must be in the third position. This means the frog owner (gardener) is in the third position.

8. The person drinking almond-milk is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person who's hobby is traveling. Since we already placed traveling in the first position and almond-milk in the second position, iced-tea must be in the third position.

9. The owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since we already placed traveling in the first position, the bird owner must be in the second or fourth position. But we already placed the turtle owner in the fourth position, so the bird owner must be in the second position.

10. The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we already placed gardening in the third position, dancing must be in the fourth position.

11. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person drinking coffee. Since we already placed coffee in the first position, video-games must be in the second position.

12. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since we already placed traveling in the first position, iced-tea must be in the fifth position.

Final solution table:

| Beverage   | Coffee   | Almond-milk | Iced-tea | Juice   |
| Hobby      | Video-games | Dancing   | Traveling | Gardening |
| Pet        | Ferret   |            |          | Turtle  |

Lv5-3x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can number them from 1 to 5 from left to right.

2. From point 4, the person watching family movies is in an odd position, so they must be either 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume they are in position 1 for now.

3. From point 5, the person drinking sprite is in an odd position, so they can't be in position 1. Let's assume they are in position 3 for now.

4. From point 6, the fan of funk is in an odd position, so they can't be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume they are in position 5 for now.

5. From point 7, the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda can't be in position 1 (because the family movie fan is there), mirinda must be in position 2 or 4. If mirinda is in position 2, then coffee must be in position 1. But that would mean the family movie fan is in an even position, which contradicts point 4. So, mirinda must be in position 4.

6. From point 9, the person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right. Since mirinda is in position 4, 7up can't be in position 5 (because sprite is there). So, 7up must be in position 1.

7. From point 10, the person watching documentary movies is on the left of the fan of dubstep. Since dubstep can't be in position 5 (because funk is there), dubstep must be in position 2.

8. From point 2, the fan of salsa is between the fan of metal and the person drinking cola. Since metal can't be in position 5 (because funk is there), and cola is the person watching martial-arts movies (point 12), metal must be in position 3.

9. From point 8, salsa must be in position 4.

10. From point 3, the fan of metal is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (which is the person drinking cola in position 2). So, metal must be in position 3 or 5. But since funk is in position 5, metal must be in position 3.

11. From point 11, the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person watching family movies. But we assumed family movies are in position 1, and 7up is in position 1. So, this point seems to be a contradiction. Let's reconsider our assumptions.

12. If we assume the family movies fan is in position 3 instead, then the person drinking sprite can be in position 1, the person drinking 7up can be in position 5, and the person watching documentary movies can be in position 2. This satisfies all the conditions.

Final solution:

| Beverage      | 7up   | sprite | coffee | mirinda | cola   |
| Movie-Genre   | doc   |        |        |        | martial-arts |

Lv5-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching romance movies is to the right of the person watching mystery movies. Let's place the mystery movies viewer in the first column (1) and the romance movies viewer in the second column (2).

2. The person watching martial-arts movies is the one driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter can only be in the last column (5), the martial-arts movies viewer must be in the last row (5).

3. The person driving the car is the one with the hobby of magic-tricks. Since the car can only be in the second row (2), the magic-tricks hobbyist must be in the second row.

4. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter is in the last row (5), the chess hobbyist must be in the third row (3) or the last row (5). However, since the car is already in the second row (2), the chess hobbyist must be in the last row (5).

5. The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies. Since the car is already in the second row (2), the musical movies viewer must be in the first row (1) or the third row (3). Let's place the musical movies viewer in the third row (3) for now.

6. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the dancing hobbyist is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of the skydiving hobbyist yet.

7. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. This condition repeats the previous one, so it doesn't provide new information.

8. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car. Since the helicopter is in the last row (5) and the car is in the second row (2), the helicopter must be in the first column (1).

9. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Since the airplane can only be in the last column (5), the mystery movies viewer must be in the second column (2).

10. The person driving the helicopter is on the far left or far right. Since the helicopter is already in the first column (1), it's on the far left.

11. The person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the car. Since the car is in the second row (2) and the train can only be in the last row (5), the train must be in the last column (5).

Now, we have a conflict: the dancing hobbyist must be to the right of the skydiving hobbyist, but the skydiving hobbyist is already in the first column (1). However, since the puzzle states that there are 5 different hobbies, the dancing hobbyist must be placed somewhere. One possible solution is to swap the positions of the dancing and mystery movies viewers, placing dancing in the second column (2) and mystery in the first column (1). This way, the dancing hobbyist is to the right of the skydiving hobbyist, and all other conditions are still met.

1. We know that the fan of hip-hop is not the person driving the train (from rule 1). So, let's assign the transport options to the remaining four people:
   - Person 1: Boat (rule 11)
   - Person 2: Train (rule 6, since there are 5 people and the train driver is in an even position)
   - Person 3: Subway (rule 10, since the person drinking soy-milk is also the person driving the subway)
   - Person 4: Tram (since the person drinking juice is not the train driver and not the person on the far right, so it must be either tram or boat, and since the boat is taken, it's the tram)
   - Person 5: Trike (rule 5, since the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the trike)

2. Now let's assign the music-genres:
   - Person 1: Techno (rule 11)
   - Person 2: D&B (since the fan of gospel is on the left or right of the fan of d&b, and we know the order of genres from techno to gospel, so d&b must be second)
   - Person 3: Gospel (rule 9, since the person drinking soy-milk is the fan of gospel)
   - Person 4: Hip-hop (since the fan of hip-hop is to the right of the person driving the train, which is person 2, so it must be person 4)
   - Person 5: Folk or Sprite (we don't have enough information yet to determine this)

3. Now let's assign the beverages:
   - Person 1: Sprite (since the fan of techno is on the left of the person drinking sprite, and we know the order of beverages from lemonade to sprite, so sprite must be first for person 1)
   - Person 2: Mirinda (since the fan of hip-hop is not the person drinking lemonade, so it must be mirinda or juice, and since the person drinking juice is not the train driver and not the person on the far right, it must be mirinda)
   - Person 3: Soy-milk (already assigned)
   - Person 4: Juice (since the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person driving the tram, which is person 4, so it must be juice)

Lv5-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the mystery movie watcher is between the fantasy and zombie movie watchers, we can place them in positions 2, 3, or 4. Let's place them in position 3 (mystery).

2. The R&B fan is in an even position, so they can be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's place them in position 4 (R&B).

3. The horse owner is to the right of the rat owner, so they can be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Let's place them in position 5 (Horse).

4. The salsa fan is to the right of the rat owner, so they can be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Since the salsa fan is also watching thriller movies, let's place them in position 6 (Salsa, Thriller).

5. The frog owner is to the right of the techno fan, so they can be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Since the frog owner is also to the right of the zombie movie watcher, they can't be in position 4. So, they can be in positions 5 or 6. However, if the frog owner was in position 6, the horse owner would have to be in position 5, which contradicts rule 9 (Techno). Therefore, the frog owner is in position 5 (Frog).

6. The zombie movie watcher is to the right of the frog owner and the rat owner, so they can be in positions 6 or 7. Since the zombie movie watcher is also to the right of the snake owner, they can't be in position 6. So, the zombie movie watcher is in position 7 (Zombie).

7. The snake owner is to the right of the horse owner, so they can be in positions 6 or 7. Since the snake owner is also to the right of the rat owner, they can't be in position 6 (Rat, Salsa). So, the snake owner is in position 7 (Snake).

8. The techno fan is to the left or right of the horse owner, so they can be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Since the techno fan is also to the left or right of the R&B fan, they can't be in position 4 (R&B). So, the techno fan is in position 3 (Techno).

9. The reggae fan is to the left or right of the fantasy movie watcher, so they can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6. Since the reggae fan is not in position 4 (R&B), they can't be in position 6 (Salsa, Thriller). So, the reggae fan is in position 1 (Reggae, Fantasy).

Final solution table:

    | Beverage    | Milk       | Chess     | Water    | Iced-tea| Subway | Jet-ski| Coffee |

14. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.

   | Hobby       | Chess     | ...      | Skydiving | Magic-tricks| Woodworking| Car    | ...    | ...    |
