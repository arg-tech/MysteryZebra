Lv5-7x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it requires a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step:

1. From rule 24, 27, and 29, we know that the fan of ambient, the architect, and the person who's sport is tennis are all on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the architect is in the middle (rule 22), the fan of ambient and the person who's sport is tennis must be on the same side as the architect. Let's assume they are on the right side of chess.

2. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the architect is the person who's hobby is writing (rule 40), the architect must be on the left side of chess.

3. From rule 21, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the architect is on the left side of chess, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be on the right side of chess.

4. From rule 16, we know that the manager is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the architect is on the left side of chess, the manager must be on the left side of chess as well.

5. From rule 31, we know that the person eating pear is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the architect, the person who's hobby is writing, the person who's hobby is chess, the person who's hobby is skydiving, and the manager are all on the left side of chess, the person eating pear must be on the right side of woodworking.

6. From rule 34, we know that the electrician is the person who's hobby is reading. Since the architect, the person who's hobby is writing, the person who's hobby is chess, the person who's hobby is skydiving, the manager, and the person eating pear are all placed, the only remaining hobby for the person eating pear is board-games.

7. From rule 36, we know that the fan of ambient is on the left of the person driving the trike. Since the architect, the person who's hobby is writing, the person who's hobby is chess, the person who's hobby is skydiving, the manager, the person eating pear (board-games), and the electrician are all placed, the person driving the trike must be the fan of dubstep (since the only remaining music genres are disco, dubstep, metal, pop, r&b, rock).

Since the fan of ambient is on the left of the person driving the trike (dubstep), and the person eating lime (skiing) is somewhere to the left of the person eating banana, the engineer must be on the right of the person driving the trike (dubstep) and on the left of the person eating banana.

11. From rule 1, we know that the person eating pepper is somewhere to the left of the fan of disco. Since the person driving the trike (dubstep) is on the left of the fan of disco, the person eating pepper must be on the right of the fan of disco.

12. From rule 25, we know that the person eating lime is the person watching disaster movies. Since the person eating lime (disaster movies) is somewhere to the left of the person eating banana, and the engineer is on the right of the person eating banana, the person watching disaster movies must be the engineer.

13. From rule 18, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is the coach. Since the person who's hobby is writing is the coach, the person watching fantasy movies is the coach.

Lv5-7x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the 7 people numbers from 1 to 7. We'll use the given information to eliminate possibilities and gradually fill in the table.

2. From the information given, we know that the fan of punk is either 2, 4, or 6 (1st, 3rd, or 5th position). Let's assume the fan of punk is in the 2nd position for now.

3. The person drinking 7up is to the right of the fan of punk, so it must be in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th position. Since the person drinking 7up is also to the right of the person who's sport is cricket, and cricket can't be in the 1st position (as it's to the left of the lizard owner, who has a later position), the person drinking 7up can't be in the 3rd position. So, the person drinking 7up is either 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume the person drinking 7up is in the 4th position for now.

4. The person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking water, so mirinda can't be in the 7th position. Since mirinda can't be in the 1st position (as it's to the right of the fan of dubstep, and the fan of dubstep can't be in the 1st position because the punk fan is in the 2nd position), mirinda can't be in the 2nd position either. So, mirinda can be either 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume mirinda is in the 3rd position for now.

5. The person eating papaya is between the person drinking juice and the person driving the ship. Since the person drinking juice can't be in the 1st position (as it's to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games, and card-games can't be in the 1st position because the fan of r&b can't be in the 1st position), the person drinking juice can't be in the 2nd position either (as the fan of r&b can't be in the 2nd position because the fan of punk is in the 2nd position). So, the person drinking juice can be either 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume the person drinking juice is in the 3rd position for now.

6. Now we have:

7. Continue filling in the table using the given information, keeping in mind the positions already assigned. Once you've filled in as much as possible, you may need to go back and reconsider some assumptions if they lead to contradictions.

8. After filling in the table, if there are still some variables with multiple possible solutions, you can use the remaining clues to narrow down the possibilities.

9. Once all variables have a unique solution, the final solution table will be '#############'.

This is a complex puzzle and may require multiple attempts to solve completely. Good luck!"
