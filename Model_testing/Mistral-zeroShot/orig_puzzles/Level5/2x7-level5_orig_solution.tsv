Lv5-2x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is eating asparagus. Let's place them in the table:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
   | Food    | asparagus|       |            |           |           |           |             |
   | Hobby   | baking   |       |            |           |           |           |             |

2. From rule 2, the person eating plum is on the right of the person eating lemon. Since we know the position of asparagus, let's place lemon to the left of asparagus:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
   | Food    | asparagus| lemon  |            |           | plum      |           |             |
   | Hobby   | baking   |       |            |           |           |           |             |

3. From rule 3, the person eating plum is somewhere to the left of the person eating kale. Since we know the position of plum and lemon, let's place kale to the right of plum:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |

4. From rule 4, the person eating cranberry is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since we don't know the position of the person who's hobby is writing yet, let's place cranberry in the remaining positions:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
   | Food    | asparagus| lemon  | plum       | kale      | cranberry |           |             |
   | Hobby   | baking   |       |            |           |           |           |             |

5. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is hiking is the person eating lemon. Since we know the position of lemon, let's place hiking in the table:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
   | Food    | asparagus| lemon  | plum       | kale      | cranberry | hiking    |             |

6. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we don't know the position of gardening yet, let's place gardening in the remaining positions:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
   | Food    | asparagus| lemon  | plum       | kale      | cranberry | hiking    | gardening  |
   | Hobby   | baking   | hiking |            |           |           |           | gardening  |

7. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we don't know the position of cooking yet, let's place cooking in the remaining positions:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |

8. From rule 8, the person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we know the position of kale and gardening, kale must be in the last position:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
   | Food    | asparagus| lemon  | plum       | kale      | cranberry | hiking    | gardening  | cooking    |
   | Hobby   | baking   | hiking |            |           |           |           | board-games| cooking    |

9. From rule 9, the person eating artichoke is on the left of the person eating cranberry. Since we know the position of cranberry, let's place artichoke in the first position:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
   | Food    | artichoke| lemon  | plum       | kale      | cranberry | hiking    | gardening  | cooking    |
   | Hobby   | baking   | hiking |            |           |           |           | board-games| cooking    |

10. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is hiking is the person eating lemon. We already placed hiking in the table, so lemon is correct.

11. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the right of the person eating asparagus. Since we know the position of asparagus and board-games, board-games is correct.

12. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we know the position of gardening and cooking, cooking is correct.

13. From rule 13, the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since we know the position of baking and writing, baking is correct.

14. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. Since we know the position of baking, let's place card-games in the remaining positions:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
   | Food    | artichoke| lemon  | plum       | kale      | cranberry | hiking    | gardening  | cooking    |
   | Hobby   | baking   | hiking | card-games | board-games| writing   |           |            |            |

15. From rule 15, the person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the right of the person eating lemon. Since we know the position of lemon and writing, writing is correct.

16. From rule 16, the person eating kale is the person who's hobby is board-games. We already placed kale and board-games in the table, so this rule is correct.

17. From rule 17, the person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. Since we know the position of baking, card-games is correct.

18. From rule 18, the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person eating plum. Since we know the position of plum and baking, this rule is correct.

Now we have the final solution table:

   |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
   | Food    | artichoke| lemon  | plum       | kale      | cranberry | hiking    | gardening  | cooking    |
   | Hobby   | baking   | hiking | card-games | board-games| writing   |           |            |            |

This table represents the final solution to the logic puzzle."
Lv5-2x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating cabbage is in an odd position (4), it can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

2. Since the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage (3), it can be in positions 2 or 4. Let's assume it's in position 2 for now.

3. The person drinking water is on the right of the person eating broccoli. Since broccoli can't be in position 1 (because cabbage is there), it can only be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 7. Let's assume it's in position 4 for now.

4. The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk (5). Since almond-milk can't be in position 7 (because zucchini is there), it can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 3 for now.

5. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person eating pepper (3). Since pepper can't be in position 1 (because asparagus is there), it can only be in positions 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Let's assume it's in position 5 for now.

6. The person eating carrot is in an odd position (4). Since it can't be in position 1 (because cabbage is there), it can only be in positions 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume it's in position 7 for now.

7. The person eating zucchini is on the far left or far right (3). Since it can't be in position 7 (because carrot is there), it must be in position 1.

8. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person eating zucchini (since zucchini is in position 1). So, almond-milk can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 2 for now.

9. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person eating cabbage (5). Since cabbage is in position 1, iced-tea can only be in positions 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7. Let's assume it's in position 6 for now.

10. The person eating radish is on the left of the person drinking tea (since tea is in position 5). So, radish can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 3 for now.

11. The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person eating radish. Since zucchini is in position 1 and radish is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

12. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda is in position 2, hot-chocolate can only be in positions 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Let's assume it's in position 5 for now.

13. The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person drinking tea (3). Since tea is in position 5, pepper can only be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7. But since pepper can't be in position 7 (because carrot is there), it must be in position 4.

14. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate is in position 5, mirinda can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. But since mirinda can't be in position 2 (because it's already assigned there), it must be in position 3.

15. The person eating broccoli is the person drinking hot-chocolate (15 and 16 are the same person). So, broccoli is in position 5.

16. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (3). Since hot-chocolate is in position 5, water can only be in positions 4 or 6. But since water can't be in position 4 (because carrot is there), it must be in position 6.

17. The person drinking water is on the right of the person eating broccoli. But we already placed water in position 6, and broccoli is in position 5. This condition is not satisfied, which means there's a contradiction in the given conditions.

So, the given conditions lead to a contradiction, and it's not possible to find a valid arrangement that satisfies all the conditions.

Final solution table:

| Beverage   | almond-milk | fanta | hot-chocolate | iced-tea | mirinda | tea | water |
| Food       | asparagus   | broccoli | cabbage | carrot | pepper | radish | zucchini |

This table is not valid because the condition that the person drinking water is on the right of the person eating broccoli is not satisfied."
Lv5-2x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, we know that the person driving the motorbike is in position 3.
2. From rule 8, the person driving the bike is in an odd position, so it can't be in position 3 (since motorbike is there). So, the bike is either in position 1 or 5.
3. From rule 11, the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter. Since the motorbike is in position 3, the scooter must be in position 2 or 4 (not 6 because of rule 13). If the scooter is in position 2, then the trike must be in position 1, but that would violate rule 5 (rock-climber to the left of trike). So, the scooter is in position 4, and the trike is in position 5 or 7.
4. From rule 13, the tram is to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the scooter is in position 4, the card-games person can't be in position 2 or 6. So, the card-games person is in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. If the card-games person is in position 1, then the tram is in position 2, but that would violate rule 12 (magic-tricks to the left of tram). So, the card-games person is not in position 1. If the card-games person is in position 3, then the tram is in position 4, but that would violate rule 14 (tram to the left or right of rock-climber). So, the card-games person is not in position 3. If the card-games person is in position 5, then the tram is in position 6, and the rock-climber is in position 7. This satisfies all rules, so the hobbies and transports are as follows:

   | Hobby       | Transport   |
   |------------|------------|
   | board-games | bike       |
   | camping    | bike       |
   | card-games | tram       |
   | magic-tricks| airplane   |
   | rock-climbing| quad-bike  |
   | skydiving   | quad-bike  |
   | writing     | scooter    |

5. Now we know the positions:

   | Hobby       | Transport   | Position |
   |------------|------------|----------|
   | board-games | bike       | 1        |
   | camping    | bike       | 5        |
   | card-games | tram       | 6        |
   | magic-tricks| airplane   | 2        |
   | rock-climbing| quad-bike  | 7        |
   | skydiving   | quad-bike  | 4        |
   | writing     | scooter    | 3        |

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv5-2x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching mystery movies is to the left of the owner of the rat (1, 5, 14). Since the owner of the fish is to the left of the owner of the rat (3), the fish cannot be in position 1. Also, the person watching drama is on the far right (6), so mystery can't be in the last position. So, mystery is either in position 2 or 3.

2. The owner of the bird is to the left of the owner of the rabbit (2). Since the owner of the rat is to the left of the person watching spy movies (13), the rabbit cannot be in position 1. So, rabbit is either in position 2, 4, 6, or 7.

3. The owner of the fish is in the middle (7). So, mystery can't be in position 7.

4. The person watching satire is to the left of the person watching mystery (8). Since mystery is either in position 2 or 3, satire can't be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, satire is either in position 7 or 8.

5. The owner of the chinchilla is the person watching western movies (4). Since the owner of the chinchilla is in an even position (16), chinchilla can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. So, chinchilla is either in position 2, 4, 6, or 8.

6. The owner of the rabbit is between the person watching comedy and the person watching drama (10). Since comedy can't be in position 1 (mystery is there), comedy is either in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. If comedy is in position 2, rabbit can't be in position 1 (since the owner of the bird is to the left of the owner of the rabbit). So, comedy is either in position 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. If comedy is in position 3, rabbit can't be in position 2 (since the owner of the rabbit is between comedy and drama). So, comedy is either in position 4, 5, 6, or 7. If comedy is in position 4, rabbit can't be in position 3 (since the owner of the bird is to the left of the owner of the rabbit). So, comedy is either in position 5 or 7. If comedy is in position 5, rabbit can't be in position 4 (since the owner of the rabbit is between comedy and drama). So, comedy is in position 7, and rabbit is in position 6.

7. The owner of the mouse is on the far left or far right (15). Since the owner of the chinchilla is in an even position (16), the mouse can't be in position 2, 4, 6, or 8. So, mouse is either in position 1 or 7. If mouse is in position 1, the owner of the bird is in position 2, and the owner of the rabbit is in position 6. If mouse is in position 7, the owner of the bird is in position 8, and the owner of the rabbit is in position 6.

8. The person watching time-travel is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla (11). Since the chinchilla is in an even position (16), time-travel can't be in position 2, 4, 6, or 8. So, time-travel is either in position 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. If time-travel is in position 1, the owner of the mouse is in position 7, and the owner of the rabbit is in position 6. If time-travel is in position 3, the owner of the mouse is in position 5, and the owner of the rabbit is in position 6. If time-travel is in position 5, the owner of the mouse is in position 3, and the owner of the rabbit is in position 6. If time-travel is in position 7, the owner of the mouse is in position 1, and the owner of the rabbit is in position 6. If time-travel is in position 9, the owner of the mouse is in position 1, and the owner of the rabbit is in position 5.

9. The person watching satire is to the left of the person watching mystery (8). Since mystery is in position 2, satire can't be in position 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. So, satire is in position 8.

10. The owner of the snake is to the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla (5). Since the chinchilla is in position 4, the snake can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. So, snake is either in position 2 or 6.

11. The person watching drama is on the far right (6).

12. The person watching satire is to the left of the person watching mystery (8).

13. The owner of the rat is to the left of the person watching spy movies (13).

14. The person watching mystery is to the left of the owner of the rat (14).

15. The owner of the fish is in the middle (7).

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |   5    |   6    |   7   |

   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Brazilian | French (Country) |  |  |  |  |
   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country |  |  |  |  |

4. The fan of gospel is on the left or right of the brazilian, so it can be in the first or third column. Since the chinese is on the left of the mexican, the mexican must be in the sixth or seventh column. If gospel were in the first column, the chinese would have to be in the second column, but the fan of country is the french, so gospel cannot be in the first column. Therefore, gospel is in the third column.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |  |  |  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Brazilian | French (Country) | Gospel |  |  | Mexican |
   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country | Gospel |  |  | Salsa/Indie/Soul |

5. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the japanese, so the japanese must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth column. Since the chinese is on the left of the mexican, the mexican must be in the sixth or seventh column, and gospel is in the third column, so the japanese cannot be in the sixth column. Therefore, the japanese is in the fourth column.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  |  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Brazilian | French (Country) | Gospel | Japanese |  | Mexican |
   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country | Gospel | Salsa |  | Indie/Soul |

6. The fan of indie is on the right of the dutch, so indie is in the fifth or sixth column. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the japanese, so indie cannot be in the fourth column. Therefore, indie is in the fifth column.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Brazilian | French (Country) | Gospel | Japanese | Indie | Mexican |
   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country | Gospel | Salsa | Indie | Soul/Rock/Classical |

7. The fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the chinese, so soul is in the fifth, sixth, or seventh column. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the japanese, so soul cannot be in the fourth column. The fan of classical is on the far left, so soul cannot be in the first column. Therefore, soul is in the sixth column.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Brazilian | French (Country) | Gospel | Japanese | Indie | Soul | Mexican |
   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country | Gospel | Salsa | Indie | Soul | Rock/Classical |

8. The fan of rock is classical, but it's already taken. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Final solution table (with the error):

```

Lv5-2x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the hobby of drawing is on the left or right of rock-climbing, we can place them in positions 1, 2, 5, or 6. Let's place drawing in position 1 for now.

2. Since almond-milk must be in an odd position, it can't be in position 1, so it must be in position 3, 5, or 7. Since the hobby of board-games is on the left of almond-milk, board-games can't be in position 5 or 7. So, let's place board-games in position 2.

3. Now, almond-milk must be in position 3.

4. Cola must be in an even position, so it can't be in position 1, 3, or 7. Since coffee is between lemonade and singing, and singing is on the left or right of iced-tea, we know that coffee can't be in position 1 or 7. So, let's place coffee in position 4.

5. Now, lemonade must be in position 2, and iced-tea must be in position 6.

6. Since singing is on the left or right of iced-tea, singing can't be in position 1 or 7. So, let's place singing in position 5.

7. Now, tea must be in position 7.

8. Since writing is somewhere to the left of rock-climbing, writing can't be in position 6 or 7. So, let's place writing in position 2.

9. Now, gardening must be in position 6.

10. Since singing is somewhere to the left of collecting, collecting can't be in position 1 or 2. So, let's place collecting in position 4.

11. Now, board-games must be in position 3.

12. Since drawing is on the right of gardening, drawing can't be in position 1. So, let's place drawing in position 7.

13. Now, 7up must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage   | 7up   | almond-milk | coffee   | cola     | lemonade | iced-tea | tea       |
| Hobby      | drawing| board-games  | writing  | collecting| singing   | gardening | rock-climbing|

Lv5-2x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the helicopter driver is in an odd position and to the right of the spy movie watcher (who is in an even position), the helicopter driver cannot be in position 1, 2, 4, or 6. So, the helicopter driver can be in positions 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the helicopter driver is in position 3 for now.

2. The scooter driver is in an even position, so it cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. So, the scooter driver can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the scooter driver is in position 2 for now.

3. Now, the tram driver is in the middle, so it must be in position 4.

4. The trike driver is in the middle, but we already placed the tram driver there. So, the trike driver cannot be in position 4. Let's assume the trike driver is in position 6 for now.

5. The person watching horror movies is driving the bike, so it must be in position 1.

6. The person watching horror movies is to the left of the scooter driver, so the scooter driver cannot be in position 6. So, the scooter driver must be in position 2.

7. The person driving the tram is to the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the tram is in position 4, the disaster movie watcher cannot be in position 3 (as that would place the disaster movie watcher to the left of the tram). So, the disaster movie watcher can be in positions 1, 2, 5, or 6. Let's assume the disaster movie watcher is in position 5 for now.

8. The person watching horror movies is to the left of the person driving the scooter, so the scooter driver cannot be in position 2. So, the scooter driver must be in position 6.

9. The person driving the tram is to the right of the person watching disaster movies, so the disaster movie watcher cannot be in position 5. So, the disaster movie watcher must be in position 1.

10. The person watching spy movies is in an even position, so it cannot be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. So, the spy movie watcher can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Since the helicopter driver is in position 3 and the scooter driver is in position 6, the spy movie watcher cannot be in position 6. So, the spy movie watcher can be in positions 2 or 4. Let's assume the spy movie watcher is in position 4 for now.

11. The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike. Since the bike driver is in position 1, the bus driver cannot be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the bus driver must be in position 7.

12. The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left or right of the person driving the roller. Since the bus driver is in position 7, the roller driver cannot be in position 6. So, the roller driver must be in position 5.

13. The person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching spy movies. Since the spy movie watcher is in position 4, the western movie watcher cannot be in position 5 or 6. So, the western movie watcher can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 7. Since the helicopter driver is in position 3, the western movie watcher cannot be in position 3. So, the western movie watcher can be in positions 1, 2, or 7. Since the scooter driver is in position 6, the western movie watcher cannot be in position 2. So, the western movie watcher must be in position 1.

14. The person watching family movies is between the person driving the bus and the person watching superhero movies. Since the bus driver is in position 7 and the superhero movie watcher cannot be in position 1 (as the western movie watcher is already there), the family movie watcher can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the scooter driver is in position 6, the family movie watcher cannot be in position 6. So, the family movie watcher can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the tram driver is in position 4, the family movie watcher cannot be in position 4. So, the family movie watcher can be in positions 2 or 5. Since the helicopter driver is in position 3, the family movie watcher cannot be in position 2. So, the family movie watcher must be in position 5.

15. The person driving the tram is to the right of the person watching disaster movies, and the person driving the bike is to the right of the person driving the tram. Since the disaster movie watcher is in position 1 and the bike driver is in position 5, the tram driver cannot be in position 2 or 3. So, the tram driver must be in position 4.

16. The person watching western movies is the person driving the roller. Since the western movie watcher is in position 1, the roller driver must be in position 1 as well.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-2x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 11, the bartender is on the far left, so we can place the bartender in the first column (1). Since the bartender is the fan of indie (rule 5), we can write 'indie' in the first row and first column.

2. From rule 12, the paramedic is the fan of blues. Since the paramedic is on the left of the fan of folk (rule 8) and on the left of the fan of blues (rule 9), the paramedic must be in the second column (2). So, we can write 'blues' in the second row and second column.

3. From rule 3, the electrician is the fan of folk. Since the paramedic is on the left of the fan of folk (rule 8), the electrician must be in the third column (3). So, we can write 'folk' in the second row and third column.

4. From rule 13, the librarian is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues. Since the paramedic (blues) is in the second column, the librarian must be in the first column. However, we already know that the bartender (indie) is in the first column, so the librarian must be in the sixth column (7). So, we can write 'librarian' in the last row and first column.

5. From rule 10, the fan of folk is on the left or right of the librarian. Since the librarian is in the seventh column, the fan of folk must be in the sixth column (5). So, we can write 'folk' in the fifth row and sixth column.

6. From rule 14, the fan of trance is somewhere to the left of the fan of techno. Since we don't know the position of techno yet, we can't place trance yet.

7. From rule 15, the fan of punk is on the right of the electrician (folk). Since the electrician is in the third column, the fan of punk must be in the fourth column (4). So, we can write 'punk' in the fourth row and fourth column.

8. From rule 7, the fan of techno is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues. Since the paramedic (blues) is in the second column, the fan of techno must be in the first column. However, we already know that the bartender (indie) and the librarian are in the first column, so the fan of techno must be in the seventh column (7). So, we can write 'techno' in the first row and seventh column.

9. From rule 4, the fan of hip-hop is between the bartender (indie) and the videographer. Since the bartender is in the first column and the videographer must be to the right of the fan of trance (which we don't know the position yet), the fan of hip-hop must be in the second column (2). So, we can write 'hip-hop' in the second row and second column.

10. From rule 6, the fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of trance. Since we know the position of hip-hop (second column), the fan of trance must be in the third column (3). So, we can write 'trance' in the second row and third column.

11. From rule 1, the fan of trance is somewhere to the left of the fan of hip-hop. However, this is already satisfied since we placed trance in the third column and hip-hop in the second column.

12. From rule 15, the social-worker is on the right of the electrician (folk). Since the electrician is in the third column, the social-worker must be in the fourth column (4). So, we can write 'social-worker' in the fourth row and fourth column.

13. From rule 16, the videographer is somewhere to the right of the fan of trance. Since we know the position of trance (third column), the videographer must be in the fifth column (5) or the sixth column (6) or the seventh column (7). However, since the bartender (indie) is in the first column and the librarian is in the seventh column, the videographer must be in the fifth column (5).

Lv5-2x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the gardener is to the left of the card-games person, and the water drinker is to the left of the card-games person, we can place the gardener and water drinker in the first two spots. Let's assume the gardener is in the first spot (1) and the water drinker is in the second spot (2).

2. The coffee drinker is the skydiving person, so we can place coffee in the spot corresponding to skydiving. Since the coffee drinker is on the far left or far right, and the gardener and water drinker are already placed, the only remaining spots for coffee are 1, 3, 5, or 7. However, since the person drinking mirinda is to the right of the coffee drinker, coffee cannot be in position 1 or 7. So, coffee must be in position 3 or 5. Let's place coffee in position 5 for now.

3. Since the coffee drinker (skydiving) is to the left of the person drinking mirinda, mirinda must be in position 6 or 7. But since the sprite drinker is to the right of the mirinda drinker, sprite must be in position 7. So, mirinda must be in position 6.

4. The person drinking water is to the left of the card-games person, so the card-games person cannot be in position 2. The card-games person must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the person drinking cola is to the right of the gardener (who is in position 1), the cola drinker cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the card-games person must be in position 4, and the cola drinker must be in position 6.

5. The person drinking milk is to the left of the traveler, and to the left of the board-games person. The only available spots to the left are positions 1, 2, and 3. But since the gardener is in position 1 and the water drinker is in position 2, milk must be in position 3.

6. The person drinking sprite is to the right of the person drinking 7up, and since sprite is in position 7, 7up must be in position 6.

7. The person who's hobby is traveling is to the right of the person drinking 7up, so the traveler must be in position 7.

8. The person who's hobby is board-games is to the left of the person drinking cola (who is in position 6), so the board-games person must be in position 5.

9. The person drinking milk is to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (who is in position 5), so milk must be in position 4.

10. The person who's hobby is photography is to the left or right of the person drinking coffee (who is in position 5), so photography can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 6, or 7. But since the person who's hobby is traveling is to the right of the person drinking 7up (who is in position 6), photography cannot be in position 7. So, photography can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But since the person who's hobby is card-games is to the right of the person drinking water (who is in position 2), photography cannot be in position 2. So, photography can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. But since the person who's hobby is board-games is to the left of the person drinking cola (who is in position 6), photography cannot be in position 5. So, photography must be in position 1.

11. The only remaining hobby is writing, which can be in positions 3 or 4. But since the person drinking milk is to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling (who is in position 7), writing cannot be in position 4. So, writing must be in position 3.
