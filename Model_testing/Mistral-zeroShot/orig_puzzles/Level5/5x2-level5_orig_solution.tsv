Lv5-5x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 hobbies, 2 jobs, 2 pets, and 2 sports. So, each category will have one unique item on each row.

2. Let's start with the beverages. Since the software-developer is either on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade, and there are only 2 positions, the software-developer cannot be drinking lemonade. So, the person on the left must be drinking lemonade, and the person on the right must be drinking water.

3. Now, let's consider the hobbies. The software-developer is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the software-developer is not the one with the hobby of skydiving (as we determined in step 2), the person on the left must have the hobby of skydiving. So, the hobbies are: Skydiving (left) and Hiking (right).

4. Next, let's consider the jobs. Since the software-developer is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving, and the person with the hobby of skydiving is on the left, the software-developer must be on the right. So, the jobs are: Analyst (left) and Software-Developer (right).

5. Now, let's consider the pets. The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the software-developer is the one on the right (as we determined in step 4), the person with the sport of skateboarding must be to the left of the software-developer. So, the person on the left must have the sport of skateboarding, and the person on the right must have the other sport, which is rugby. The pets are: Dog (right) and Hedgehog (left).

6. Finally, let's put everything together:

|            |       1       |         2          |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Beverage   | Lemonade     | Water             |
| Hobby      | Skydiving    | Hiking            |
| Job        | Analyst      | Software-Developer |
| Pet        | Dog          | Hedgehog          |
| Sport      | Skateboarding | Rugby             |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|            |       1       |         2          |

| Job        | Analyst      | Software-Developer |
| Pet        | Dog          | Hedgehog          |
| Sport      | Skateboarding | Rugby             |

Lv5-5x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different sports, and one is cycling (which is in an odd position), it must be in position 1 or 3. However, since the fisherman is on the right of the scientist, and the fisherman can't be in position 1 (because the cyclist must be in an odd position), the cyclist must be in position 1, and the other sport (skateboarding) must be in position 3.

2. The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the cyclist (who drinks lemonade) is in position 1, and the hedgehog can't be in position 2 (because the cyclist is in position 1), the hedgehog must be in position 1, and the turtle must be in position 2.

3. The fisherman is on the right of the scientist. Since the cyclist (fisherman) is in position 1, the scientist must be in position 2.

4. The person eating potato is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the cyclist (who drinks lemonade) is in position 1, and the hedgehog (who eats potato) is in position 1, the potato must be in position 2.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|            |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage   | Lemonade  | Water        |
| Food       | Potato    | Apricot      |
| Job        | Fisherman  | Scientist    |
| Pet        | Hedgehog   | Turtle       |
| Sport      | Cycling    | Skateboarding |

So, the final solution table is:

#############

| Beverage   | Lemonade  | Water        |

Lv5-5x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages, we can fill the first column with either 7up or Sprite. Let's assume the first row has 7up.

|               |     7up      |      Sprite     |
| Beverage      |            |                |
| Movie-Genre   |            |                |
| Nationality   |            |                |
| Sport         |            |                |
| Transport     |            |                |

2. Since there are 2 different movie-genres, we can fill the second row with either mystery or scientific. Let's assume the second row has mystery.

|               |     7up      |      Sprite     |
| Beverage      |            |                |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery     | Scientific      |
| Nationality   |            |                |
| Sport         |            |                |
| Transport     |            |                |

3. Since there are 2 different nationalities, we can fill the third row with either Chinese or Russian. Let's assume the third row has Chinese.

|               |     7up      |      Sprite     |
| Beverage      |            |                |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery     | Scientific      |
| Nationality   | Chinese     | Russian         |
| Sport         |            |                |
| Transport     |            |                |

4. Since there are 2 different sports, we can fill the fourth row with either rugby or skiing. Let's assume the fourth row has rugby.

|               |     7up      |      Sprite     |
| Beverage      |            |                |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery     | Scientific      |
| Nationality   | Chinese     | Russian         |
| Sport         | Rugby       | Skiing          |
| Transport     |            |                |

5. Now, the person drinking Sprite is on the left of the Chinese, so the first row should have Sprite.

|               |      Sprite   |     7up      |
| Beverage      | Sprite       | 7up          |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery     | Scientific    |
| Nationality   | Chinese     | Russian       |
| Sport         | Rugby       | Skiing        |
| Transport     |            |              |

6. The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skiing, so the fifth row should have quad-bike and the fourth row should have train.

|               |      Sprite   |     7up      |
| Beverage      | Sprite       | 7up          |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery     | Scientific    |
| Nationality   | Chinese     | Russian       |
| Sport         | Rugby       | Skiing        |
| Transport     | Quad-bike   | Train         |

7. The person driving the quad-bike is the person watching mystery movies, so the second row should have quad-bike and the second row should have train. This is a contradiction, as we already filled the fifth row with quad-bike.

There seems to be an error in the puzzle, as it is not solvable with the given conditions."
Lv5-5x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only 2 hobbies, the person who is filmmaking must be on the left, and the person who is reading must be on the right. Let's denote the positions as F for filmmaking and R for reading.

   |               | F  | R  |
   | Beverage      |    |    |
   | Hobby         | F  | R  |
   | Music-Genre   |    |    |
   | Nationality   |    |    |
   | Transport     |    |    |

2. The Thai is somewhere to the right of the fan of house. Since there are only 2 music genres, the person who likes house must be on the left. Let's denote the positions as H for house and FK for folk.

   |               | F  | R  |
   | Beverage      |    | H  |
   | Hobby         | F  | R  |
   | Music-Genre   | H  | FK |
   | Nationality   |    |    |
   | Transport     |    |    |

3. The person driving the subway is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since there are only 2 beverages, the person drinking cola must be on the right. Let's denote the positions as C for cola and L for lemonade.

   |               | F  | R  |
   | Beverage      | C  | L  |
   | Hobby         | F  | R  |
   | Music-Genre   | H  | FK |
   | Nationality   |    |    |
   | Transport     |    |    |

4. Now, let's fill in the nationalities. Since there are only 2 nationalities, one person must be American and the other Thai. Since the Thai is to the right of the fan of house, the Thai must be on the right. Let's denote the positions as A for American and T for Thai.

   |               | F  | R  |
   | Beverage      | C  | L  |
   | Hobby         | F  | R  |
   | Music-Genre   | H  | FK |
   | Nationality   | A  | T  |
   | Transport     |    |    |

5. Finally, let's fill in the transport. Since there are only 2 means of transport, one person must be using the bus and the other the subway. Since the person driving the subway is to the left of the person drinking lemonade, the person using the subway must be on the left. Let's denote the positions as B for bus and S for subway.

   |               | F  | R  |
   | Beverage      | C  | L  |
   | Hobby         | F  | R  |
   | Music-Genre   | H  | FK |
   | Nationality   | A  | T  |
   | Transport     | B  | S  |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-5x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 5 variables (Beverage, Job, Nationality, Sport, Transport) and 2 instances for each. Let's assign them as follows:

   |               |     1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola     | Fanta     |
   | Job           | Freelancer| Librarian |
   | Nationality   | Japanese | Spanish   |
   | Sport         | Handball  | Ice-Hockey|
   | Transport     | Skateboard| Tram      |

2. From the first rule, the librarian is to the left of the person driving the skateboard. So, the Job and Transport columns can't be in the same row.

   |               |     1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola     | Fanta     |
   | Job           | Freelancer| Librarian |
   | Nationality   | Japanese | Spanish   |
   | Sport         | Handball  | Ice-Hockey|
   | Transport     | Skateboard| Tram      |

3. From the second rule, the Spanish is to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since we already know the Job and Transport can't be in the same row, the Nationality and Sport columns can't be in the same row either.

   |               |     1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola     | Fanta     |
   | Job           | Freelancer| Librarian |
   | Nationality   | Japanese | Spanish   |
   | Sport         | Handball  | Ice-Hockey|
   | Transport     | Skateboard| Tram      |

4. From the third rule, the person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since we already know the Job and Transport can't be in the same row, the Beverage columns can't be in the same row either.

   |               |     1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola     | Fanta     |

   | Nationality   | Japanese | Spanish   |
   | Sport         | Handball  | Ice-Hockey|
   | Transport     | Skateboard| Tram      |

5. Now we have a contradiction, as we can't satisfy all the rules at once. The given rules are not consistent, and the puzzle cannot be solved as stated.

However, if we relax the rules a bit, for example, by allowing multiple people to have the same favorite beverage, job, nationality, sport, or transport, then we can solve the puzzle. But the given rules are inconsistent, and the puzzle cannot be solved as stated.

Lv5-5x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different hobbies, 2 different jobs, 2 different beverages, and 2 different movie genres. So, we can fill in the first row of the table with the different hobbies, jobs, beverages, and movie genres. Let's assume the hobbies are in the first row, jobs in the second row, beverages in the third row, and movie genres in the fourth row.

   |               |      1      |       2        |
   | Hobby         |             |                |

2. The person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is reading. This means the hobbies must be arranged as Reading, Board-games.

   |               |      1      |       2        |
   | Hobby         | Reading    | Board-games    |

3. The mechanic is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we don't know the jobs yet, we can't place them yet. But we know that the mechanic can't be in the second column because the person drinking iced-tea must be in the second column (as the mechanic is on the left). So, the jobs can only be arranged as Job1, Job2 with Job1 in the first column and Job2 in the second column.

   |               |      1      |       2        |

4. The police-officer is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since we don't know the pets yet, we can't place them yet. But we know that the police-officer can't be in the first column because the owner of the pony must be in the first column (as the police-officer is on the left or right). So, the pets can only be arranged as Pet1, Pet2 with Pet1 in the first column and Pet2 in the second column.

   | Pet           | Pet1       | Pet2           |

5. The person drinking fanta is the person watching time-travel movies. Since we don't know the beverages yet, we can't place them yet. But we know that the person drinking fanta must be in the second column because the person watching time-travel movies must be in the second column (as the person drinking fanta is this person). So, the beverages can only be arranged as Beverage1, Beverage2 with Beverage1 in the first row and Beverage2 in the second row.

   |               |      1      |       2        |

6. Now we have only the movie genre left to place. Since we know that there are 2 different movie genres, superhero and time-travel, and the person watching time-travel movies is in the second column, the movie genre must be arranged as Time-travel, Superhero.

   |               |      1      |       2        |
   | Hobby         | Reading    | Board-games    |
   | Job           | Job1       | Job2           |

7. Now we can place the pets. Since we know that there are 2 different pets, cat and pony, and the owner of the pony must be in the first column, the pets must be arranged as Pony, Cat.

   | Hobby         | Reading    | Board-games    |

   | Movie-Genre   | Superhero  | Time-travel    |
   | Pet           | Pony       | Cat            |

8. Finally, we can place the jobs. Since the mechanic is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea, and the police-officer is on the left or right of the owner of the pony, the jobs must be arranged as Police-officer, Mechanic.

   |               |      1      |       2        |
   | Hobby         | Reading    | Board-games    |

Lv5-5x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two types of food, the person eating carrot must be in column 2, and the person eating cherry must be in column 1.

2. Since there are only two means of transport, the person driving the skateboard must be in row 1, and the person driving the quad-bike must be in row 2. So, the security-guard must be in row 2, and the person driving the skateboard must be to the left of the security-guard, which means they are in column 1.

3. Now, we know the person driving the skateboard is in hobby 1 (since there are only two hobbies), so the hobby in row 2 must be cooking.

4. Since the person with the hobby of cooking is to the right of the person with the sport of biathlon, the person with the sport of biathlon must be in column 1. This means the person with the sport of golf must be in column 2.

5. Since there are only two jobs, the person with the job of firefighter must be in row 1, and the person with the job of security-guard must be in row 2. But we already know the security-guard is in row 2, so the firefighter must be in row 1.

6. Now, we know the person with the sport of biathlon is in row 1 and column 1. Since the person with the hobby of cooking is to the right of the person with the sport of biathlon, the person with the hobby of cooking must be in row 1 and column 2.

7. Finally, since the person eating carrot is to the right of the person eating cherry, the person eating carrot must be in row 2 and column 1, and the person eating cherry must be in row 2 and column 2.

Lv5-5x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two jobs, two music-genres, two nationalities, and two sports. Let's assign these categories to variables:
   - Jobs: A (designer) and B (police-officer)
   - Music-Genres: C (funk) and D (soul)
   - Nationalities: E (german) and F (indian)
   - Sports: G (snowboarding) and H (tennis)
   - Transport: I (boat) and J (train)

2. From rule 1, we know that the person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. This means that either J is in column 2 and H is in column 1, or J is in column 1 and H is in column 2. Let's assume J is in column 1 and H is in column 2 for now.

3. From rule 2, we know that the designer is the person driving the boat. Since we already placed the train driver, the only remaining spot for the boat driver is in column 2, row 1. So, I = A2.

4. From rule 3, we know that the indian is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk. Since we already placed the designer (who doesn't like funk), the only remaining spot for the indian is in column 2. So, F = 2_.

5. Now we have two variables left to place: the music-genre and the sport. Since the indian is in column 2, the fan of funk must be in column 1. So, C = 1_.

6. The remaining music-genre (soul) must be in the other cell of the same row as the indian (column 2). So, D = 2_.

7. The remaining sport (snowboarding) must be in the other cell of the same column as the designer (column 1). So, G = 1_.

8. The remaining sport (tennis) must be in the other cell of the same row as the train driver (column 2). So, H = 2_.

9. Now we have placed all the variables. The final solution table is:

   |               |    1     |       2        |
   | Job           |  A       |  B            |
   | Music-Genre   |  C (funk) |  D (soul)     |
   | Nationality   |  E (german)|  F (indian)   |
   | Sport         |  G (snowboarding) |  H (tennis)   |
   | Transport     |  I (boat)  |  J (train)    |

This solution satisfies all the given rules."
Lv5-5x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different nationalities, we can place one in each row. Let's place the Egyptian in the first row (nationality column).

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          |             |                    |
   | Job           |             |                    |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                    |
   | Music-Genre   |             |                    |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian    |                    |

2. The Egyptian is a fan of house music, so let's place house in the music-genre column for the first row.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          |             |                    |
   | Job           |             |                    |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                    |
   | Music-Genre   | House      |                    |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian    |                    |

3. The Egyptian is not a firefighter (from puzzle 1), so the first row's job cannot be firefighter. Since there are 2 different jobs, the first row's job must be software-developer.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          |             |                    |
   | Job           | Software-developer|                    |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                    |
   | Music-Genre   | House      |                    |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian    |                    |

4. The person watching spy movies is on the left of the person eating pepper. Since we have already placed the Egyptian and the software-developer, the only remaining option for the first row's food is eggplant (since there are 2 different types of food).

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Eggplant   | Pepper           |
   | Job           | Software-developer|                    |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                    |
   | Music-Genre   | House      |                    |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian    |                    |

5. Now we have one row filled. Let's fill the second row. The second row's nationality must be Polish (since there are 2 different nationalities).

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Eggplant   | Pepper           |
   | Job           | Software-developer|                    |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                    |
   | Music-Genre   | House      |                    |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian    | Polish            |

6. The second row's job cannot be firefighter (since there is only one firefighter). The second row's job must be firefighter.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Eggplant   | Pepper           |
   | Job           | Software-developer| Firefighter      |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                    |
   | Music-Genre   | House      |                    |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian    | Polish            |

7. The second row's movie-genre cannot be mystery (since there is only one mystery genre left). The second row's movie-genre must be spy.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Eggplant   | Pepper           |
   | Job           | Software-developer| Firefighter      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy        | Mystery          |
   | Music-Genre   | House      |                    |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian    | Polish            |

8. The second row's music-genre cannot be country (since there is only one country genre left). The second row's music-genre must be country.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Eggplant   | Pepper           |
   | Job           | Software-developer| Firefighter      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy        | Mystery          |
   | Music-Genre   | Country    | House            |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian    | Polish            |

9. The only remaining genre is mystery. Since the Egyptian is to the left of the software-developer, the first row's movie-genre must be mystery.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Eggplant   | Pepper           |
   | Job           | Software-developer| Firefighter      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Mystery    | Spy              |
   | Music-Genre   | Country    | House            |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian    | Polish            |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |      1      |         2          |
| Food          | Eggplant   | Pepper           |
| Job           | Software-developer| Firefighter      |

Lv5-5x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only 2 positions for each category, we can start by filling in one item from each category in the first row. Let's assume the first row is as follows:

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Beverage      | Milk       | Tea      |
   | Food          | Peas       | Potato   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family     | Zombie   |
   | Pet           | Guinea-pig | Hamster  |
   | Transport     | Motorbike  | Trike    |

2. Now let's use the clues to rearrange the items if necessary:

   - From clue 1, the person drinking tea (Tea) is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike (Motorbike). So, we can swap the positions of Tea and Trike if necessary to satisfy this condition.
   - From clue 2, the person eating peas (Peas) is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster (Hamster). Since there are only 2 positions, Peas must be on the same side as Hamster. Let's assume Peas is on the left for now.
   - From clue 3, the person watching zombie movies (Zombie) is somewhere to the left of the person eating potato (Potato). So, we can swap the positions of Zombie and Motorbike if necessary to satisfy this condition.

3. Now let's check the positions:

   - The person drinking tea (Tea) is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike (Motorbike), which is satisfied since Tea is in the first position and Motorbike is in the second position.
   - The person eating peas (Peas) is on the left of the owner of the hamster (Hamster), which is satisfied since Peas is in the first position and Hamster is in the second position.
   - The person watching zombie movies (Zombie) is somewhere to the left of the person eating potato (Potato), which is satisfied since Zombie is in the first position and Potato is in the second position.

So, the final solution table is:

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Beverage      | Milk       | Tea      |
   | Food          | Peas       | Potato   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family     | Zombie   |
   | Pet           | Guinea-pig | Hamster  |
   | Transport     | Motorbike  | Trike    |
