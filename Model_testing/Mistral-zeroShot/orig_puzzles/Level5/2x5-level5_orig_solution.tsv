Lv5-2x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all hobbies are different and in odd positions, we can place the hobbies in positions 1, 3, and 5. Let's place Reading in position 1 (1st rule), Chess in position 3 (4th rule), and Sudoku in position 5 (7th rule). This leaves Video-games and Singing for positions 2 and 4.

2. Since the person who's hobby is Singing is on the far right (6th rule), it must be in position 5. So, Video-games is in position 2.

3. Now, let's place the sports. Since the person who's sport is Snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is Parkour (2nd rule), and the person who's hobby is Reading is in position 1 (1st rule), Snowboarding must be in position 1. This means Parkour is in position 3.

4. The person who's sport is Weightlifting is on the right of the person who's sport is Snowboarding (6th rule), so it must be in position 5.

5. The person who's sport is Handball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is Volleyball (7th rule), and Volleyball is to the right of Parkour (8th rule). So, Handball can be in position 2, and Volleyball in position 4.

The final solution table is:

|         |    1     |       2       |      3       |    4    |     5      |

Lv5-2x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the roller is to the right of the person watching action movies, we can place the action movies and roller in the last two columns. Let's place action movies in column 5 and roller in column 3.

2. Now, the person driving the tram is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski cannot be in the last two columns (as roller is there), it can only be in the first three columns. Let's place jet-ski in column 1. This means tram is in column 2.

3. The person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. So, snowmobile can only be in the last three columns. Let's place it in column 4.

4. The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person driving the roller. Since roller is in column 3, documentary movies must be in column 2.

5. The person driving the tram is to the left of the person driving the roller. This contradicts rule 5, so we need to swap tram and roller. So, tram is in column 3 and roller is in column 2.

6. Now, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the tram. This means jet-ski can only be in column 1.

7. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since snowmobile is in column 4, animation movies can be in column 1 or 3. But it cannot be in column 1 as it is already occupied by jet-ski. So, animation movies are in column 3.

8. The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies. Since documentary movies are in column 2, animation movies are in column 3. But we already placed animation movies there. This contradicts rule 9 (animation movies are in the middle). So, documentary movies are in column 3 and animation movies are in column 1.

9. The person watching animation movies is in the middle. This contradicts our current arrangement. There seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as it is impossible to satisfy this rule.

10. The person watching animation movies is between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the tram. Since animation movies are in column 1 and snowmobile is in column 4, the person driving the tram must be in column 2. But we already placed tram in column 3. This contradicts rule 10. So, there seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as it is impossible to satisfy this rule.

11. The person watching action movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies. Since musical movies cannot be in the last two columns (as action movies are there), musical movies can only be in the first three columns. Let's place musical movies in column 2. This means action movies are in column 5.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |     1     |     2      |     3     |      4      |   5    |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | documentary | roller    | snowmobile | action  |
| Transport     | jet-ski   | tram        | roller    | snowmobile |         |

However, there are contradictions in rules 8 and 10, so the puzzle might be incorrect or incomplete."
Lv5-2x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking tea is in the middle, so Tea goes in the 3rd row.

2. Since the person drinking fanta is to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games, and the card-games person is not in the middle (because tea is there), fanta must be in the first or second row. However, since the person who's hobby is card-games is the person who's hobby is card-games, and we know that the person drinking tea is in the middle, the card-games person cannot be in the second row. So, fanta must be in the first row.

3. The person who's hobby is gardening is the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking tea is in the middle, and the person drinking fanta is in the first row, almond-milk must be in the fifth row.

4. Now we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is in the fifth row, so we can place the hobby Gardening in the fifth column.

5. The person who's hobby is card-games is the person who's hobby is card-games, so it must be in one of the remaining rows. Since it cannot be in the first row (because fanta is there), it must be in the second, third, or fourth row. However, since the person who's hobby is card-games is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing, and we know that the person drinking tea is in the middle, the person who's hobby is card-games cannot be in the third row (because tea is there). So, the person who's hobby is card-games must be in the second or fourth row.

6. Since the person who's hobby is gardening is to the left of the person who's hobby is reading, and we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is in the fifth row, the person who's hobby is reading must be in the fourth or fifth column. However, since the person who's hobby is card-games is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing, and we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is in the second or fourth row, the person who's hobby is reading cannot be in the fourth column (because the person who's hobby is card-games would be in the third row, which is not possible). So, the person who's hobby is reading must be in the fifth column.

7. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is in the second or fourth row, and the person who's hobby is reading is in the fifth column, the person who's hobby is card-games must be in the fourth row.

8. Now we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is in the fourth row, so we can place the hobby Card-games in the fourth column.

9. The person who's hobby is dancing is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games, and we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is in the fourth row. So, the person who's hobby is dancing must be in the third row.

10. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is in the third row, the hobby Dancing must be in the third column.

11. The person drinking cola is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person drinking board-games. We know that almond-milk is in the fifth row and Dancing is in the third column, so the person drinking cola must be in the fourth row and the hobby Board-games must be in the second column.

12. The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening, and we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is in the fifth row. So, the person drinking mirinda must be in the sixth column.

13. Since the person drinking cola is in the fourth row, the beverage Cola must be in the fourth row as well.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Cola    |   Dancing   |   Tea      |   Reading   |   Almond-milk   |   Mirinda   |
#############
```

For the hobbies:

```
#############
| Board-games|   Card-games|   None     |   Reading   |   Gardening    |   None      |

```

Note that the ""None"" in the beverage table represents the empty space where the person is not drinking anything."
Lv5-2x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 music genres and 5 nationalities. So, each row and each column represents a unique combination of music genre and nationality.

2. From rule 1, the Russian cannot be the fan of salsa (position 5) because the Russian is to the left of the fan of salsa, but there are only 4 positions to the left. So, the Russian can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

3. From rule 2, the British can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the British is in position 1, then the fan of gospel (which the British is to the left or right of) must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But this would mean that the fan of gospel is to the left of the fan of salsa (rule 10), which is not possible because the fan of salsa is in position 5 and there are no positions to the left of it. So, the British cannot be in position 1.

   If the British is in position 2, then the fan of gospel must be in position 1, 3, or 4. But this would mean that the fan of gospel is to the left of the fan of salsa (rule 10), which is not possible because the fan of salsa is in position 5 and there are no positions to the left of it. So, the British cannot be in position 2.

   If the British is in position 3, then the fan of gospel must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But this would mean that the fan of gospel is to the left of the fan of salsa (rule 10), which is not possible because the fan of salsa is in position 5 and there are no positions to the left of it. So, the British cannot be in position 3.

   Therefore, the British must be in position 4.

4. From rule 3, the Italian is the fan of pop, so the Italian is in position 3.

5. From rule 4, the fan of salsa is to the left of the fan of d&b. Since the Italian (fan of pop) is in position 3, the fan of salsa must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But the Russian cannot be the fan of salsa (rule 2), so the fan of salsa must be in position 1 or 2.

6. From rule 5, the fan of pop is the Italian, so the Italian is in position 3. Since the Italian is in position 3, the fan of salsa cannot be in position 3 because the fan of salsa is to the left of the fan of d&b, and the fan of d&b cannot be in position 1 (rule 1) or position 2 (because the British is in position 2). So, the fan of salsa must be in position 1.

7. From rule 6, the British is on the left or right of the Canadian. Since the British is in position 4, the Canadian can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But the Canadian cannot be in position 1 (rule 7) or position 5 (rule 4), so the Canadian must be in position 2 or 3.

8. From rule 8, the Canadian is in an even position. Since the Canadian cannot be in position 1 or 5 (already determined), the Canadian must be in position 2.

9. From rule 9, the fan of salsa is in an odd position. Since the fan of salsa is in position 1, the remaining nationalities must be in even positions. But the British is in position 4, which is odd. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we ignore rule 9 and assume that the fan of salsa can be in an even position, then the remaining nationalities would be:
- The Italian (fan of pop) is in position 3.
- The British (fan of gospel) is in position 4.
- The Canadian is in position 2.
- The Russian cannot be the fan of salsa (rule 1), so the Russian must be the fan of classical. Since the Russian cannot be in position 1 (rule 1) or position 5 (rule 4), the Russian must be in position 2 or 4. But the Russian cannot be in position 4 (already determined), so the Russian must be in position 2.
- The Indonesian and the Italian are the only nationalities left, and the Italian is already in position 3. So, the Indonesian must be the fan of d&b and is in position 5.

So, the final solution table would be:

```
#############
| Classical  | D&B   | Gospel | Pop    | Salsa  |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Russian   | Italian| British| Italian| Indonesian|
#############
```

But remember, this solution assumes that the fan of salsa can be in an even position, which contradicts rule 9. So, there might be an error in the puzzle."

7. The person eating artichoke is on the right of the person eating papaya. Since we placed papaya in the second row, we can place artichoke in the third row.

2. From point 4, the taxi driver is to the left of the airplane driver. Since the superhero movie watcher is in an odd position, the taxi driver cannot be in position 1 or 3, so the taxi driver must be in position 5.

3. From point 6, the taxi driver is on the far left or far right. Since the taxi driver is in position 5, the airplane driver must be in position 1, and the other three positions (2, 3, 4) are available for other transport.

4. From point 7, the helicopter driver is to the left of the mystery movie watcher. Since the taxi driver is in position 5, the mystery movie watcher cannot be in position 1, so the mystery movie watcher must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

5. From point 8, the mystery movie watcher is to the right of the motorbike driver. Since the mystery movie watcher is in position 2, 3, or 4, the motorbike driver must be in position 1.

7. From rule 4, we know that the fan of house is on the right of the fan of punk. Since we already have the fan of house, we can place punk in the row below it.

8. From rule 1, we know that the fan of house is on the right of the fan of punk. Since we already have them in their respective positions, the arrangement is correct.

   |               |       1       |   2   |   3   |     4     |   5   |

Lv5-2x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person eating cranberry is the same person in both rows 1 and 5 (since the same food can't be in two different rows). Let's denote the nationality of the cranberry eater as X.

2. From rule 2, the person eating strawberry is to the left of the nigerian. Since the cranberry eater is to the left of the spinach eater (rule 3), and the nigerian is to the right of the australian (rule 5), we can deduce that the strawberry eater can't be in rows 1, 2, or 5 (because the cranberry eater is already there, and the nigerian can't be in rows 1, 2, or 3 due to the position of the australian). So, the strawberry eater must be in row 4. Let's denote the nationality of the strawberry eater as Y.

3. From rule 4, the kiwi eater is to the left of the strawberry eater. Since the strawberry eater is in row 4, the kiwi eater must be in row 1, 2, or 3. However, the cranberry eater is already in row 1, so the kiwi eater can't be in row 1. Also, the nigerian can't be in rows 1, 2, or 3 due to the position of the australian, so the kiwi eater must be in row 3. Let's denote the nationality of the kiwi eater as Z.

4. From rule 6, the argentine is to the right of the person eating lemon. Since the cranberry eater is already in row 1, the argentine can't be in row 1 either. So, the argentine must be in row 2, 4, or 5. However, the nigerian can't be in rows 2, 4, or 5 due to the position of the australian, so the argentine must be in row 5. Let's denote the nationality of the argentine as A.

5. From rule 7, the strawberry eater (Y) is between the cranberry eater (X) and the italian. Since the strawberry eater is in row 4, the italian must be in row 2 or 5. However, the argentine is already in row 5, so the italian must be in row 2. Let's denote the nationality of the italian as I.

6. Now we know the nationalities of all the food eaters except for the lemon eater and the spinach eater. Since the nigerian can't be in rows 1, 2, or 3, and the argentine is in row 5, the only remaining nationality for the lemon eater and the spinach eater is the australian (since there are only 5 nationalities). Let's denote the nationality of the lemon eater as B and the spinach eater as C.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |    2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |
| Food          | cranberry| kiwi    | lemon      | strawberry| spinach   |
| Nationality   | X        | Z       | B          | Y         | A         |

Where X, Y, Z, A, and B represent the nationalities argentine, australian, canadian, italian, and nigerian respectively."
Lv5-2x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 6, the Australian is on the far left, so we can place the Australian in the first column.

|   | 1 (Australian) |  |  |  |  |
|----|---------------|----|----|----|----|
| Beverage |            |    |   |   |   |
| Nationality | Australian |   |   |   |   |

2. From rule 8, the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the Australian is already on the far left, the almond-milk drinker must be in the second or fifth column.

|   | 1 (Australian) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|----|---------------|----|----|----|----|
| Beverage | Cola | Almond-milk |   |   |   |
| Nationality | Australian |   |   |   |   |

3. From rule 2, the Spanish is between the person drinking fanta and the Turkish. Since the Australian is on the far left, the Turkish must be in the fifth column. So, the fanta drinker must be in the fourth column.

|   | 1 (Australian) | 2 | 4 (Spanish) | 5 (Turkish) |  |
|----|---------------|----|------------|-------------|----|
| Beverage | Cola | Almond-milk | Fanta | Water |   |
| Nationality | Australian |   | Spanish | Turkish |   |

4. From rule 3, the almond-milk drinker is on the far left or far right. Since the Australian is already on the far left, the almond-milk must be in the fifth column.

|   | 1 (Australian) | 2 | 4 (Spanish) | 5 (Almond-milk) |  |
|----|---------------|----|------------|----------------|----|
| Beverage | Cola | Water | Fanta | Almond-milk |   |
| Nationality | Australian |   | Spanish |   |   |

5. From rule 4, the Spanish is in an odd position. The only odd position left is the fourth column. So, the Spanish must be drinking fanta.

|   | 1 (Australian) | 2 | 4 (Spanish) | 5 (Almond-milk) |  |
|----|---------------|----|------------|----------------|----|
| Beverage | Cola | Water | Fanta (Spanish) | Almond-milk |   |
| Nationality | Australian |   | Spanish |   |   |

6. From rule 5, the Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice. Since the Spanish is in the fourth column and drinking fanta, the juice drinker must be in the third column.

|   | 1 (Australian) | 2 | 3 (Indonesian) | 4 (Spanish) | 5 (Almond-milk) |
|----|---------------|----|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Beverage | Cola | Water | Juice | Fanta (Spanish) | Almond-milk |
| Nationality | Australian |   | Indonesian | Spanish |   |

7. From rule 1, the Spanish is between the person drinking fanta and the Turkish. Since the Spanish is already in the fourth column and drinking fanta, the Turkish must be in the fifth column.

|   | 1 (Australian) | 2 | 3 (Indonesian) | 4 (Spanish) | 5 (Turkish) |
|----|---------------|----|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Beverage | Cola | Water | Juice | Fanta (Spanish) | Almond-milk |
| Nationality | Australian |   | Indonesian | Spanish | Turkish |

8. From rule 7, the person drinking water is the Spanish. But we already placed the Spanish in the fourth column drinking fanta. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the person drinking water is a mistake and the Spanish is indeed drinking water, then the final solution would be:

#############
|   | 1 (Australian) | 2 | 3 (Indonesian) | 4 (Spanish) | 5 (Turkish) |
|----|---------------|----|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Beverage | Cola | Water (Spanish) | Juice | Fanta | Almond-milk |
| Nationality | Australian |   | Indonesian | Spanish | Turkish |

Lv5-2x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating grapes is to the right of the person eating lemon. Let's place the lemon in the first position (1) and the grapes in the third position (3).

2. The person eating plum is to the left of the person eating banana. Since we already placed the lemon and grapes, the only available position for the banana is the second position (2). The plum must then be in the fourth position (4).

3. The person eating plum is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since we placed the plum in the fourth position, the scientific movies must be in the first, second, or fifth position. However, the person watching satire movies must be in an odd position (4), so the scientific movies can't be in the first position (1). Therefore, the scientific movies must be in the fifth position (5).

4. The person watching satire movies is in an odd position (4). The only remaining odd position is the third position. So, the satire movies are in the third position.

5. The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. Since we placed the scientific movies in the fifth position, the romance movies must be in the second position.

6. The person watching romance movies is in an even position (4). However, we already placed the romance movies in the second position, which is an odd position. This contradicts the given information. There seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

Final solution table (with the given information, there is an error in the puzzle):

| Food          | Banana | Plum   | Lemon   | Grapes  | Eggplant |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance| Scientific |  | Grapes  |  |
