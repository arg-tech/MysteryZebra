Lv5-5x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people and 5 items for each category. Let's label the people A to E and the items 1 to 5.

2. From rule 11, the horse owner is in an odd position. So, Horse Owner = A, C, or E.

3. From rule 12, the Guinea-Pig owner is to the left of the Fish owner. Since the Horse owner is A, C, or E, the Guinea-Pig owner can only be A or B. So, Guinea-Pig Owner = A or B.

4. From rule 17, the Gardener is the Horse owner. Since the Horse owner is A, C, or E, Gardener = C.

5. From rule 16, the Fanta drinker is on the far left or far right. Since the Gardener is C, Fanta cannot be 3 (as it would be to the right of the Gardener). So, Fanta = 1 or 5.

6. From rule 18, the Dutch is to the left of the Cola drinker. Since Fanta cannot be 3, Cola cannot be 1 (as it would be to the left of Fanta). So, Cola = 2, 4, or 5.

7. From rule 19, the Pony owner is on the far left or far right. Since the Cola drinker is 2, Pony cannot be 1 (as it would be to the left of Cola). So, Pony = 5.

8. From rule 10, the Radish eater is to the left or right of the Mirinda drinker. Since Pony = 5, Mirinda cannot be 1 (as it would be to the left of Pony). So, Mirinda = 2, 3, 4, or 5.

9. From rule 9, the Broccoli eater is to the left of the Puzzles person. Since the Gardener is C, Puzzles cannot be C. So, Puzzles = A, B, D, or E.

10. From rule 3, the Puzzles person drinks 7up. So, 7up = A.

11. From rule 13, the British is to the left or right of the Carrot eater. Since the Cola drinker is 2, the Carrot eater cannot be 1 (as it would be to the left of Cola). So, Carrot eater = 3, 4, or 5.

12. From rule 15, the Rock-Climber is to the right of the Colombian. Since the Cola drinker is 2, the Colombian cannot be 1 (as it would be to the left of Cola). So, Colombian = 3, 4, or 5.

13. From rule 14, the Rock-Climber is in an even position. So, Rock-Climber = 2, 4, or 6 (as 5 is odd due to the Horse owner being odd).

14. From rule 20, the Camper is to the right of the 7up drinker. So, Camper = 4 or 5.

15. From rule 21, the Turtle owner is to the left or right of the 7up drinker. Since the Camper is 4 or 5, the Turtle owner cannot be 1 (as it would be to the left of 7up). So, Turtle owner = 2, 3, 4, or 5.

16. Now we have placed 7up, Cola, Fanta, Horse, Guinea-Pig, Carrot, Broccoli, Colombian, Rock-Climber, Camper, Turtle, and Dutch. The only remaining item is Mirinda. Since Mirinda cannot be 1, it must be 2, 3, 4, or 5. But it cannot be 1, 3, or 5 (as they are already taken). So, Mirinda = 4.

17. Now we have placed all items. The final solution table is:

   |               |     1     |     2      |     3     |       4       |     5     |
   | Beverage      | 7up      |  Cola     |  Fanta    |  Mirinda     |  Turtle   |
   | Food          | Broccoli | Carrot    | Radish    | Zucchini     | Mango     |
   | Hobby         | Puzzles  | Gardening  | Rock-Climbing| Camping    | Skydiving  |
   | Nationality   | British  | Dutch     | Colombian  | Chinese     | Malaysian |
   | Pet           | Fish     | Guinea-Pig| Horse      | Pony        | Turtle    |

Lv5-5x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so we can label them A to E from left to right.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Dutch is watching zombie movies (11), they must be in position 2 (odd position, rule 4). Let's label them D.

3. The person watching family movies is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike (6), and the person driving the van is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies (7). So, the quad-bike driver must be A, and the van driver must be B. Let's label the quad-bike as family movies and the van as another movie genre (we'll fill it later).

4. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching musical movies (15), so the musical movies person must be C. Let's label the trike as musical movies.

5. The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking (10), and the person who's hobby is cooking is the person watching zombie movies (11). So, the baking person must be E, and the cooking person (who is also the Dutch) must be D. Let's label baking as another hobby and cooking as zombie movies.

6. The librarian is on the left of the security-guard (1), so the librarian must be A and the security-guard must be B. Let's label the librarian as a job and the security-guard as another job.

7. The musician is in the middle (5), so the musician must be C. Let's label the musician as a job.

8. The person who's hobby is writing is in an odd position (4), and it's on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography (12). Since the writing person is already placed (D), the photography person must be E. Let's label photography as another hobby.

9. The person who's hobby is camping is somewhere to the right of the security-guard (17), and it's also somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies (20). So, the security-guard must be B, the camping person must be A, and the musical movies person must be C. Let's label camping as another hobby.

10. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography (12), and the writing person is already placed (D). So, the photography person must be E.

11. The person who's hobby is cooking is between the person driving the van and the Spanish (19). Since the cooking person is already placed (D), the van driver must be A, and the Spanish must be E. Let's label the van as another movie genre and the Spanish as another nationality.

12. The person who's hobby is camping is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies (20), and the camping person is already placed (A). So, the musical movies person must be C.

13. The librarian is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is photography (13), and the librarian is already placed (A). So, the photography person must be E.

14. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking (14), and the cooking person is already placed (D). So, the romance movies person must be A, B, or C. Since A and C are already taken, the romance movies person must be B. Let's label romance movies as another hobby.

15. The person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the security-guard (17), and the camping person is already placed (A). So, the security-guard must be B.

16. The musician is somewhere to the left of the German (16), and the musician is already placed (C). So, the German must be E. Let's label the German as another nationality.

17. The paramedic is on the right of the German (18), and the German is already placed (E). So, the paramedic must be A, B, or D. Since A and D are already taken, the paramedic must be B. Let's label the paramedic as a job.

18. The only job left is the scientist. Since the scientist must be in an even position (4), the scientist must be E. Let's label the scientist as a job.

19. Now we have filled all the positions, and we can fill the remaining movie genres and hobbies. The remaining movie genres are family, fantasy, and romance. The remaining hobbies are baking, cooking, photography, and writing. Since we know the positions of the people, we can assign the remaining movie genres and hobbies to the people based on the given rules.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-5x5-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person in the table. Let's start by assigning variables to each person and their respective categories:

1. Food: F1 (blueberry), F2 (carrot), F3 (cucumber), F4 (pear), F5 (pepper)
2. Hobby: H1 (baking), H2 (board-games), H3 (fishing), H4 (reading), H5 (singing)
3. Music-Genre: M1 (blues), M2 (hip-hop), M3 (house), M4 (indie), M5 (techno)
4. Sport: S1 (badminton), S2 (biathlon), S3 (lacrosse), S4 (parkour), S5 (skateboarding)
5. Transport: T1 (quad-bike), T2 (ship), T3 (tram), T4 (trike), T5 (van)

Now let's use the given clues to deduce the positions:

1. M2 is somewhere to the right of H2 (board-games)
2. M4 is in the middle
3. M1 is somewhere to the left of S2 (biathlon)
4. M5 is somewhere to the right of H1 (baking)
5. H3 (fishing) is the same as S3 (lacrosse)
6. F2 is somewhere to the left of F3
7. M2 is on the left or right of F3 (pepper)
8. S5 (skateboarding) is the same as T2 (ship)
9. F1 is somewhere to the right of M3 (house)
10. H5 (singing) is the same as M2 (hip-hop)
11. S5 is somewhere to the right of S4 (parkour)
12. H4 (reading) is somewhere to the right of H2
13. M1 is on the far left or far right
14. H2 is in the middle
15. S5 is somewhere to the left of F4 (carrot)
16. F3 is somewhere to the right of M1 (blues)
17. S4 is on the left or right of F2 (pear)
18. T1 is somewhere to the left of S5
19. T5 is somewhere to the right of T4
20. M4 (indie) is the same as T3 (trike)
21. H1 is on the left of S1 (badminton)
22. F4 is somewhere to the left of T3
23. M5 (techno) is the same as F5 (pepper)
24. H2 is somewhere to the left of H5
25. T1 is somewhere to the right of T5
26. T2 is the only option left for S5 (skateboarding)

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |    1     |    2     |      3      |       4       |     5     |
| Food          | M1      | F2      | F3         | F4           | F5       |

| Transport     | T1      | T2      | T3         | T4           | T5       |

We still have some variables that are not assigned to specific positions, but we can use the remaining clues to deduce their positions:

1. F2 is somewhere to the left of F1
2. F1 and F2 are the only options left for blueberry and carrot
3. F1 must be in the first position (since M1 is on the far left)
4. F2 must be in the second position (since F2 is to the left of F1)
5. M3 must be in the third position (since M3 is to the left of S2)
6. S2 must be in the fourth position (since S2 is the only option left for biathlon)
7. T4 must be in the fourth position (since T4 is to the left of S5)
8. T3 must be in the fifth position (since T3 is the same as M4, which is in the middle)
9. T1 must be in the third position (since T1 is to the right of T4 and T5)
10. T5 must be in the sixth position (since T5 is to the right of T1)

Now we have the final solution table:

This table represents the final solution to the logic puzzle."
Lv5-5x5-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step will help us find the solution. Let's break it down:

1. We have 5 columns for food, hobbies, movie-genres, pets, and transport. Each row represents a person.

2. Let's start with the hobbies:
   - Magic-tricks is to the right of snowmobile (5) and to the right of lime (5). So, it can't be in the first row (since there's no row to its left). It also can't be in the last row (since there's no row to its right). So, it must be in the middle row. Let's place it in the third row.
   - Card-games is on the far left or far right (3). Since magic-tricks is in the middle, card-games must be in the first or last row. Let's place it in the first row.
   - Dancing is in the middle (18).
   - Singing is in the middle (18).
   - The remaining hobby, photography, must be in the last row since it's not in the first three rows due to the ""far left or far right"" condition (3).

3. Let's move on to the movie-genres:
   - Fantasy is driven by the motorbike (7).
   - Spy is to the right of card-games (5) and on the right of photography (21). So, it must be in the second or fourth row. Since it's not in the second row due to the ""to the right of card-games"" condition (8), it must be in the fourth row.
   - Time-travel is between lime and the owner of the turtle (9). Since lime can't be in the first or last row (3), time-travel can't be in the first or last row either. So, it must be in the second or fourth row. Since it's not in the fourth row (due to the ""to the right of lime"" condition (12)), it must be in the second row.
   - Zombie is on the left or right of watermelon (16). Since watermelon can't be in the first or last row (3), zombie can't be in the first or last row either. So, it must be in the second or fourth row. Since it's not in the second row (due to the ""to the right of lime"" condition (12)), it must be in the fourth row.
   - The remaining genre, mystery, must be in the third row since it's not in the first three rows due to the ""far left or far right"" condition (3).

4. Let's move on to the pets:
   - Bird is somewhere to the left of the ferret (2). So, it must be in the first or second row. Since the ferret is in the third row (due to the ""magic-tricks"" condition), the bird must be in the first row.
   - Ferret is in the third row (due to the ""magic-tricks"" condition).
   - Turtle is between lime and mouse (9). Since lime can't be in the first or last row (3), turtle can't be in the first or last row either. So, it must be in the second or fourth row. Since it's not in the second row (due to the ""time-travel"" condition (9)), it must be in the fourth row.
   - The remaining pets, mouse and hedgehog, must be in the first and last rows, respectively, since they're not in the second or fourth rows due to the ""turtle"" condition (9).

5. Let's move on to the food:
   - Lime is on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies (3) and on the right of magic-tricks (5). So, it can't be in the first row (since there's no row to its left). It also can't be in the last row (since there's no row to its right). So, it must be in the second or fourth row. Since it's not in the fourth row (due to the ""turtle"" condition (9)), it must be in the second row.
   - Cucumber is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane (19). So, it can't be in the first row (since there's no row to its left). It also can't be in the last row (since there's no row to its right). So, it must be in the second or fourth row. Since it's not in the fourth row (due to the ""turtle"" condition (9)), it must be in the second row.
   - Cranberry is somewhere to the left of the hedgehog (17). So, it must be in the first row.
   - Watermelon is on the left or right of zombie movies (16). Since zombie is in the fourth row, watermelon can't be in the first row (since there's no row to its left). So, it must be in the fifth row.
   - The remaining food, cucumber, must be in the third row since it's not in the first three rows due to the ""far left or far right"" condition (3).

6. Finally, let's move on to the transport:
   - Motorbike is driving fantasy movies (7).
   - Snowmobile is not in the first or last row (5) and not to the left of the person driving the train (20). So, it must be in the second or fourth row. Since it's not in the fourth row (due to the ""magic-tricks"" condition), it must be in the second row.
   - Train is on the left of the tram (15) and to the left of spy movies (20). So, it must be in the fourth row.
   - Tram is on the left of the train (15).
   - The remaining transport, airplane, must be in the first row since it's not in the first three rows due to the ""far left or far right"" condition (3).

Now, let's put it all together:

|               |      Cranberry |       Cucumber      |     Lime     |      Watermelon     |       Cucumber      |

| Hobby         |   Card-games  |   Magic-tricks      |   Dancing    |     Singing         |     Photography     |
| Movie-Genre   |   Airplane    |   Fantasy           |   Time-travel |     Zombie          |     Mystery         |

Lv5-5x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea, and there are only 5 positions, sprite must be in position 1 and iced-tea in position 2.

2. Now we know the positions of sprite and iced-tea. Let's place the teacher, who is either to the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since there are only 3 positions left for mirinda, it must be in position 3, 4, or 5. If the teacher is to the left of mirinda, mirinda can only be in position 4 or 5. But since the teacher is to the left or right of the person drinking mirinda, mirinda can't be in position 5 (because the teacher is already placed). So, mirinda is in position 4.

3. Now we know the positions of sprite, iced-tea, and mirinda. The person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 3 (since iced-tea is to the right of hot-chocolate).

4. The teacher is to the left or right of the person drinking mirinda, so the teacher must be in position 2.

5. Now we know the positions of sprite, iced-tea, mirinda, teacher, and hot-chocolate. The remaining beverage must be milk, which means it's in position 1.

6. The nationalities are placed according to the given conditions. The german is to the right of the teacher, so the german is in position 5. The canadian is on the left of the person drinking sprite, so the canadian is in position 2. The french is on the left or right of the pilot, and the pilot is on the right of the police-officer, so the pilot is in position 4. The remaining nationalities are British and Japanese. Since the Japanese is somewhere to the right of the person driving the van, and the german is also to the right of the person driving the van, the Japanese must be in position 5 (van driver). The British is the only nationality left, so it's the van passenger.

7. The jobs are placed according to the given conditions. The designer is the owner of the lizard, so the designer is in position 5. The police-officer is on the right of the pilot, so the pilot is in position 4. The teacher is in position 2. The remaining jobs are fisherman, fisherman (since there are 5 people), designer (since there are 5 people), and pilot (since there are 5 people). Since the designer is in position 5, the designer can't be a fisherman or a pilot. So, the fisherman is in position 1, the designer is in position 2, and the pilot is in position 3.

8. The pets are placed according to the given conditions. The owner of the fish is in the middle, so it's the person drinking milk (position 3). The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite, so the frog owner is either in position 1 or 2. But since the canadian is on the left of the person drinking sprite, the frog owner can't be the canadian. So, the frog owner is the person drinking hot-chocolate (position 3), and the frog is in position 1. The remaining pets are dog, lizard, and turtle. Since the designer is the owner of the lizard, the lizard is in position 5. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the japanese, so the turtle is in position 5.

9. The transports are placed according to the given conditions. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and on the left of the designer. The person driving the bike is also on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, so the bike is in position 1 and the snowmobile is in position 2. The person driving the car is somewhere to the right of the police-officer and on the right of the owner of the frog. The person driving the car is also on the right of the owner of the frog, so the car is in position 4. The remaining transports are airplane and van. Since the german is on the left or right of the person driving the van, and the Japanese is on the left or right of the person driving the van, the van must be in position 5. The only transport left is the airplane, so it's in position 3.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-5x5-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the food, hobbies, movie-genres, pets, and transport to the columns. We'll use the given information to place them in the first row (from left to right).

   - From rule 19, the owner of the goat is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. So, we can place 'dancing' in the second column and 'goat' in the first column.
   - From rule 20, the person eating broccoli is on the far left. So, we can place 'broccoli' in the first column.
   - From rule 18, the person eating peas is in the middle. So, we can place 'peas' in the third column.
   - From rule 21, the person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since we've placed 'dancing' and 'broccoli' already, 'skydiving' must be in the fourth or fifth column. Let's place it in the fourth column for now.
   - From rule 22, the owner of the cat is somewhere to the left of the person watching scientific movies. Since 'western' is in the fourth column, 'scientific' must be in the fifth column. So, we can place 'cat' in the second-to-last column.

   Now our initial arrangement is:

   | Food   | Hobby  | Movie-Genre | Pet   | Transport |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | broccoli| dancing |            | goat  |           |
   |         |        | scientific  | cat   |           |
   | peas   |        |            |       |           |
   |        | skydiving| western    |       |           |

2. Now let's fill in the hobbies, movie-genres, pets, and transport for the remaining rows using the given rules.

   - From rule 3, the person eating blueberry is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since 'dancing' and 'skydiving' are in the second and fourth columns, 'sudoku' must be in the third column. So, we can place 'blueberry' in the second row.
   - From rule 5, the person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since 'woodworking' is in the fifth column, 'fantasy' can be in either the first or second row. Let's place it in the first row for now.
   - From rule 6, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since 'scientific' is in the fifth column, 'fishing' must be in the fourth or fifth row. Let's place it in the fifth row for now.
   - From rule 7, the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating broccoli. Since 'broccoli' is in the first column, 'musical' can be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth row. Let's place it in the third row for now.
   - From rule 8, the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since 'fantasy' is in the first row, the rat can be in the second or third row. Let's place the rat in the second row for now.
   - From rule 9, the owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we don't know the position of the snowmobile yet, we can't place the guinea-pig yet.
   - From rule 10, the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since we don't know the position of the scooter yet, we can't place the goldfish yet.
   - From rule 11, the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since we don't know the position of the scooter yet, we can't place the jet-ski yet.
   - From rule 12, the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we don't know the position of the snowmobile yet, we can't place the goldfish yet.
   - From rule 13, the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This rule doesn't provide new information since we already know this from rule 12.
   - From rule 14, the person driving the train is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since we don't know the position of 'satire' yet, we can't place the train yet.
   - From rule 15, the person watching western movies is on the far right. Since 'western' is in the fourth column, this rule doesn't provide new information.
   - From rule 16, the person driving the snowmobile is in an even position. Since 'western' is in the fourth column, the snowmobile must be in the second or fourth row. Let's place it in the fourth row for now.
   - From rule 17, the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since we don't know the position of 'satire' yet, we can't place 'woodworking' yet.
   - From rule 18, the person eating peas is in the middle. Since 'peas' is in the third column, this rule doesn't provide new information.
   - From rule 19, the owner of the goat is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since 'dancing' is in the second column, this rule doesn't provide new information.
   - From rule 2, the person driving the train is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Since 'blueberry' is in the second row, the train can be in the first or third row. Let's place it in the first row for now.
   - From rule 4, the person eating artichoke is somewhere to the left of the person eating apricot. Since we don't know the position of 'apricot' yet, we can't place 'artichoke' yet.
   - From rule 8, the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since 'fantasy' is in the first row, the rat can be in the second or third row. However, since we already placed the rat in the second row, it must be in the third row. So, we can place 'rat' in the third row.
   - From rule 11, the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since we already placed the scooter in the second row, the jet-ski must be in the fourth row. So, we can place 'jet-ski' in the fourth row.
   - From rule 10, the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since we already placed the scooter in the second row, the goldfish must be in the third row. So, we can place 'goldfish' in the third row.
   - From rule 12, the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we already placed the goldfish in the third row, the snowmobile must be in the fourth row. So, we can confirm that the snowmobile is in the fourth row.
   - From rule 13, the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This rule doesn't provide new information since we already know this from rule 12.
   - From rule 14, the person driving the train is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since we already placed the train in the first row, the 'satire' must be in the third row. So, we can place 'satire' in the third row.
   - From rule 17, the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since 'satire' is in the third row, we can place 'woodworking' in the second row.
   - From rule 4, the person eating artichoke is somewhere to the left of the person eating apricot. Since 'woodworking' is in the second row and 'peas' is in the third row, 'apricot' must be in the fourth or fifth column. Let's place it in the fifth column for now.
   - From rule 16, the person driving the snowmobile is in an even position. Since we already placed the snowmobile in the fourth row, this rule doesn't provide new information.

3. Now let's fill in the remaining food, hobbies, movie-genres, pets, and transport using the given rules.

   - From rule 7, the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating broccoli. Since 'broccoli' is in the first column and 'musical' is in the third row, 'musical' must be in the fourth or fifth row. However, since we already placed 'musical' in the third row, it must be in the fifth row. So, we can place 'musical' in the fifth row.
   - From rule 6, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since 'scientific' is in the fifth column, 'fishing' must be in the fourth or fifth row. However, since we already placed 'fishing' in the fifth row, it must be in the fourth row. So, we can place 'fishing' in the fourth row.
   - From rule 1, the owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since 'dancing' is in the second column, the goat must be in the first column. So, we can place 'goat' in the first column.
   - From rule 18, the person eating peas is in the middle. Since 'peas' is in the third column, this rule doesn't provide new information.
   - From rule 4, the person eating artichoke is somewhere to the left of the person eating apricot. Since 'apricot' is in the fifth column, 'artichoke' must be in the first, second, or fourth column. However, since we already placed 'artichoke' in the first column, it must be in the fourth column. So, we can place 'artichoke' in the fourth column.
   - From rule 11, the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since we already placed the scooter in the second row and the jet-ski in the fourth row, this rule doesn't provide new information.

4. Now we have a complete solution:

   | Food   | Hobby  | Movie-Genre | Pet   | Transport |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
   | broccoli| dancing |            | goat  | jet-ski   |
   |         |        | musical    | cat   | scooter   |
   | peas   |        |            |       |           |
   |        | skydiving| western    |       | snowmobile |
   | artichoke|        |            |       | train     |
   | blueberry| sudoku  |            | rat    |           |
   |         |        | satire    |       |           |
   | apricot|        | scientific |       |           |
   |         | fishing  |            |       |           |

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle: rule 16 states that the person driving the snowmobile is in an even position, but we placed it in the fourth row, which is an odd position. This contradicts the given information. I'm sorry for the confusion, but the puzzle as it stands appears to be inconsistent."
Lv5-5x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can number them from 1 to 5 from left to right.

2. Let's assign the beverages to the people:
   - The chef is drinking hot-chocolate (position 3, according to rule 6), so the beverages are: 1 (cola), 2 (mirinda), 3 (hot-chocolate), 4 (tea), 5 (soy-milk)

3. Now let's assign the foods to the people:
   - The person eating lime is on the right of the person drinking mirinda (position 2), so the foods are: 1 (artichoke), 2 (cherry), 3 (garlic), 4 (lime), 5 (peach)

4. Let's assign the jobs to the people:
   - The chef is in an odd position (3), so the jobs are: 1 (doctor), 2 (firefighter), 3 (chef), 4 (freelancer), 5 (mechanic)

5. Now let's assign the movie-genres to the people:
   - The person watching spy movies is the person who's sport is biathlon (position 1, according to rule 3), so the movie-genres are: 1 (spy), 2 (adventure), 3 (animation), 4 (drama), 5 (thriller)

6. The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the freelancer (position 4, according to rule 9), so the person watching adventure movies is either 3 or 4. Since the person watching animation movies is the person who's sport is parkour (position 5, according to rule 15), the person watching adventure movies must be 4 (drama for position 3). So the movie-genres are: 1 (spy), 2 (adventure), 3 (animation), 4 (drama), 5 (thriller)

7. The person watching thriller movies is in an odd position (position 5, according to rule 11)

8. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon (position 1, according to rule 10), so the sports are: 1 (biathlon), 2 (parkour), 3 (soccer), 4 (tennis), 5 (water-polo)

9. The person watching animation movies is the person who's sport is parkour (position 5, according to rule 15), so the sports are: 1 (biathlon), 2 (parkour), 3 (soccer), 4 (tennis), 5 (water-polo)

10. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person eating cherry (position 2, according to rule 13), so the person drinking soy-milk is either 1 or 3. Since the freelancer is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk (position 2, according to rule 17), the person drinking soy-milk is 1. So the sports are: 1 (biathlon), 2 (parkour), 3 (soccer), 4 (tennis), 5 (water-polo)

11. The person who's sport is tennis is in an even position (position 4, according to rule 14)

12. The person watching thriller movies is in an odd position (position 5, according to rule 7), so the person watching thriller movies is not the person playing tennis (position 4)

13. The person playing tennis is in an even position (position 4), so the person watching thriller movies must be 5 (water-polo)

14. The person eating peach is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea (position 4, according to rule 18), so the person eating peach is either 1, 2, or 3. Since the person eating garlic is between the person who's sport is soccer and the chef (position 3, according to rule 8), the person eating peach is not 3. So the person eating peach is either 1 or 2. Since the person eating lime is on the right of the person drinking mirinda (position 2, according to rule 1), the person eating peach is 1 (artichoke for position 2)

15. The person eating garlic is between the person who's sport is soccer and the chef (position 3, according to rule 8), so the person eating garlic is 2 (garlic for position 3)

16. The person playing soccer is on the left of the doctor (position 1, according to rule 5), so the person playing soccer is 2 (firefighter for position 1)

17. The mechanic is on the right of the person drinking tea (position 4, according to rule 4), so the mechanic is 5 (mechanic for position 5)

So the final solution table is:

|               |       1       |   2    |     3     |     4      |      5      |
| Beverage      | hot-cho    te | mirinda|   soy-milk|    tea     | cola       |
| Food          |   artichoke | cherry |   garlic  |    lime    |    peach   |
| Job           |   chef      | firefighter| freelancer | doctor   | mechanic   |
| Movie-Genre   |   spy       | adventure| animation | drama     | thriller   |
| Sport         |   biathlon  | parkour  |   soccer  |   tennis  | water-polo |

Lv5-5x5-8	"To solve this puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person in the table. Let's start by assigning variables to each person and each position:

1. Person A (Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Sport)
2. Person B (Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Sport)
3. Person C (Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Sport)
4. Person D (Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Sport)
5. Person E (Fobby, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Sport)

Now let's use the clues to deduce the positions:

1. The person who's hobby is dancing is the person who's sport is skateboarding. So, Dancing = Skateboarding.
2. The person eating blueberry is on the left of the person eating watermelon. Let's assume Blueberry = Position 1, Watermelon = Position 3.
3. The brazilian is in an odd position. Since there are 5 people, the odd positions are 1, 3, and 5. Let's assume Brazilian = Position 1.
4. The person who's sport is handball is the person who's hobby is filmmaking. So, Handball = Filmmaking.
5. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the thai. Since the thai is not in position 1 (because the brazilian is there), the thai must be in position 2. So, Filmmaking = Position 2.
6. The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since badminton is not in position 5 (because the thai is there), the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 5. So, Fantasy = Position 5.
7. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's hobby is dancing. We already know this, so Dancing = Skateboarding = Position 3.
8. The person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since skateboarding is in position 3, skydiving must be in position 2 or 1. However, we know that the brazilian is in position 1, so skydiving must be in position 2. So, Skydiving = Position 2.
9. The person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the person eating peach. Since peach is not in position 1 (because the brazilian is there) or position 5 (because the person watching fantasy movies is there), handball must be in position 4. So, Handball = Position 4.
10. The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person eating artichoke. Since artichoke is not in position 5 (because the person watching fantasy movies is there), the person playing tennis must be in position 4 or 5. However, we know that handball is in position 4, so tennis must be in position 5. So, Tennis = Position 5.
11. The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since badminton is in position 2, tennis must be in position 4 or 5. However, we already know that tennis is in position 5, so this clue is redundant.
12. The british is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since skydiving is in position 2, the british must be in position 1 or 3. However, we know that the brazilian is in position 1, so the british must be in position 3. So, British = Position 3.
13. The british is in an odd position. We already know this, so no new information.
14. The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since dancing is in position 3, rugby must be in position 1, 2, or 4. However, we know that the brazilian is in position 1, the thai is in position 2, and the person watching fantasy movies is in position 5, so rugby must be in position 4. So, Rugby = Position 4.
15. The nigerian is somewhere to the left of the british. Since the british is in position 3, the nigerian must be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, we know that the brazilian is in position 1, the thai is in position 2, and the person watching fantasy movies is in position 5, so the nigerian must be in position 3. So, Nigerian = Position 3.
16. The person eating watermelon is the person watching comedy movies. Since watermelon is in position 3, comedy movies must be in position 3. So, Comedy = Position 3.
17. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon. Since dancing is in position 3, this clue is redundant.
18. The person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since skydiving is in position 2, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4 or 5. However, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is in position 5, so the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4. So, Mystery = Position 4.
19. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since skydiving is in position 2, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 1. So, Disaster = Position 1.
20. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person eating artichoke. Since skydiving is in position 2, the person eating artichoke must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, we know that the brazilian is in position 1, the thai is in position 2, and the person watching fantasy movies is in position 5, so the person eating artichoke must be in position 3. So, Artichoke = Position 3.
21. The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is singing. Since we don't know the position of singing yet, we can't deduce the position of gardening.
22. The person who's sport is tennis is between the thai and the person watching mystery movies. Since tennis is in position 5 and the thai is in position 2, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4. However, we already know that the person watching mystery movies is in position 4, so this clue is redundant.

Now we have the following table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |       4       |     5      |
| Food          | Artichoke | Watermelon | Blueberry | Comedy       | Tennis     |
| Hobby         | Skydiving  | Dancing    | Gardening  | Disaster     | Singing    |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster  | Comedy     |           | Mystery      | Fantasy    |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Thai       | Nigerian  |              | British    |
| Sport         | Rugby     | Skateboarding|           | Handball     | Tennis     |

We still don't know the position of singing, but we can deduce that it must be in position 1, 2, or 3, since gardening is to the left of singing. However, without more information, we can't determine the exact position of singing.

The final solution table is:

Lv5-5x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 5, we know that the person watching sports movies is in position 5.
2. From point 1, we know that the person watching drama movies is in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is occupied by sports movies). Let's assume it's position 1 for now.
3. From point 8, the person watching drama movies is eating peach. So, peach must be in position 1.
4. From point 10, we know that peach is in an odd position, so it can't be in position 1 (since we assumed it was there). Therefore, the person watching drama movies is in position 3 or 5. But since position 5 is already taken by sports movies, the person watching drama movies must be in position 3.
5. From point 18, the person eating corn is on the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since the person watching drama movies is in position 3 and eating peach, the person eating corn must be in position 2. So, corn is in position 2.
6. From point 19, the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is to the right of the person driving the scooter (from point 19), the person watching disaster movies can't be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the person watching disaster movies is in position 4 or 5. But since position 5 is already taken by sports movies, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 4. So, disaster is in position 4.
7. From point 15, the person driving the roller is on the right of the thai. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 4 and the person eating corn is in position 2, the thai can't be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the thai is in position 3. So, thai is in position 3.
8. From point 17, the person eating pineapple is on the right of the person watching sports movies (which is in position 5). So, pineapple is in position 6 or 7. But since position 6 is already taken by the roller, pineapple must be in position 7. So, pineapple is in position 7.
9. From point 20, the person eating corn is somewhere to the right of the indian. Since the person eating corn is in position 2, the indian can't be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the indian is in position 3, 4, 5, or 7. But since position 5 is already taken by sports movies, the indian can't be in position 5. Also, since the person driving the roller is in position 3 and the person eating pineapple is in position 7, the indian can't be in position 7. Therefore, the indian is in position 4. So, indian is in position 4.
10. From point 14, the teacher is somewhere to the left of the indian. Since the indian is in position 4, the teacher can't be in position 5 or 6. Therefore, the teacher is in position 3. So, teacher is in position 3.
11. From point 23, the person driving the scooter is the teacher (who is in position 3).
12. From point 4, we know that the manager is somewhere to the left of the chinese. Since the electrician is the chinese (from point 11), the manager can't be in position 2, 3, 5, or 7. Therefore, the manager is in position 4. So, manager is in position 4.
13. From point 13, the indian is in an odd position. Since we already placed the indian in position 4, the odd positions are 1, 3, 5, and 7. But since position 5 is already taken by sports movies, the only possible odd positions for the remaining people are 1, 3, and 7.
14. From point 16, the person driving the van is on the left of the entrepreneur. Since the manager is in position 4 and the teacher is in position 3, the entrepreneur can't be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, the entrepreneur is in position 7. So, entrepreneur is in position 7.
15. From point 9, the colombian is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the security-guard is the person driving the airplane (from point 5), the colombian can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 (since those positions are already taken). Therefore, the colombian is in position 2 or 4. But since the person eating corn is in position 2, the colombian can't be in position 2. Therefore, the colombian is in position 4. So, colombian is in position 4.
16. From point 12, the electrician is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 4 and the person driving the scooter is the teacher (who is in position 3), the person watching spy movies can't be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, the person watching spy movies is in position 2 or 7. But since the person driving the roller is in position 3 and the person eating pineapple is in position 7, the person watching spy movies can't be in position 7. Therefore, the person watching spy movies is in position 2. So, spy is in position 2.
17. From point 22, the person eating orange is somewhere to the right of the person eating mango. Since the person eating mango can't be in position 1 (since it's already taken by the colombian), the person eating mango is in position 2 or 4. But since the person watching spy movies is in position 2, the person eating mango can't be in position 2. Therefore, the person eating mango is in position 4. So, mango is in position 4.
18. From point 6, the teacher is somewhere to the left of the mexican. Since the teacher is in position 3 and the entrepreneur is in position 7, the mexican can't be in position 1, 3, 4, or 7. Therefore, the mexican is in position 2 or 5. But since the person eating corn is in position 2, the mexican can't be in position 2. Therefore, the mexican is in position 5. So, mexican is in position 5.
19. From point 11, the electrician is the chinese. Since the chinese is in position 1 (since the person eating peach is in position 3 and the person watching drama movies is in position 5), the job of the person in position 1 is electrician.
20. From point 16, the person driving the van is on the left of the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is in position 7, the job of the person in position 6 is driving the van.
21. From point 24, the person driving the scooter is in an odd position. Since the person driving the scooter is the teacher (who is in position 3), the teacher is in an odd position.

Lv5-5x5-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the people based on their hobbies, starting from the left. Skydiving is on the left of the ship driver, so Skydiving = 1, Ship = 2. Skydiving is also somewhere to the left of Badminton, so Badminton > 1.

2. Hiking is on the left or right of Rock-climbing, and we know Badminton > 1, so Hiking or Rock-climbing = 3. Since Hiking can't be 3 (because it's on the left or right of Rock-climbing), Hiking = 4, Rock-climbing = 3.

3. Board-games is in an even position, so Board-games = 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since Board-games is to the left of the Hamster owner, and we know Badminton > 1, Hamster owner > 3, so Board-games can't be 3 or 4. Board-games = 6 or 8. Since the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the Hamster owner, and we know Badminton > 1, Mirinda can't be 1 or 2. Mirinda = 5, 7, or 9. Since the person driving the tram is the owner of the Turtle, Turtle owner = 5, 7, or 9.
