Lv5-6x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different movie-genres, 2 different pets, 2 different sports, and 2 different means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 6 for each category.

2. From the first rule, we know that the beverages are hot-chocolate (1) and sprite (2). So, we can fill the first row as follows:

   |               |      1      |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Sprite      |

3. From the second rule, we know that the person who's sport is swimming (5) is the person driving the snowmobile (6). So, the fifth row should be Sport: Swimming and the sixth row should be Transport: Snowmobile. Let's fill them:

   |               |      1      |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Sprite      |
   | Food          |             |               |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |               |
   | Pet           |             |               |
   | Sport         |             |               |
   | Transport     |             |               |
   |               |             | Swimming      |
   |               |             |               |
   |               |             |               |
   |               |             |               |
   |               |             | Snowmobile    |

4. From the third rule, we know that the person driving the jet-ski (4) is on the right of the person drinking sprite (2). Since the person driving the snowmobile (6) is to the left or right of the owner of the goldfish (3), the goldfish (3) cannot be on the same row as the jet-ski (4). So, the jet-ski (4) must be on the right of the hot-chocolate (1). Let's fill them:

   |               |      1      |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Sprite      |
   | Food          |             |               |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |               |
   | Pet           |             |               |
   | Sport         |             |               |
   | Transport     |             |               |
   |               |             | Swimming      |
   |               | Sprite      |             |
   |               |             | Jet-Ski      |
   |               |             |               |
   |               |             | Snowmobile    |

5. From the fourth rule, we know that the person eating blueberry (3) is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies (4). Since the jet-ski (4) is on the right of the sprite (2), the time-travel movies (4) cannot be on the same row as the blueberry (3). So, the blueberry (3) must be on the left of the time-travel movies (4). Let's fill them:

   |               |      1      |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Sprite      |
   | Food          | Blueberry    |             |
   | Movie-Genre   |             | Time-Travel  |
   | Pet           |             |             |
   | Sport         |             |             |
   | Transport     |             |             |
   |               | Sprite      |             |
   |               | Blueberry   | Jet-Ski     |
   |               |             |             |
   |               |             | Snowmobile   |

6. From the fifth rule, we know that the goldfish (3) is on the left of the jet-ski (4). Since the blueberry (3) is on the left of the time-travel movies (4), the goldfish (3) must be on the left of the blueberry (3). But this is a contradiction because the goldfish (3) cannot be on the same row as the jet-ski (4). This means that the fourth rule is not possible with the given conditions.

So, the puzzle has no solution with the given conditions.

The final solution table is:

Lv5-6x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 hobbies, 2 jobs, 2 music-genres, 2 pets, and 2 sports. So, we can fill in the table with 2 unique options for each category.

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | coffee     | water     |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking | video-games|
   | Job           | dancer    | engineer  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b       | folk      |
   | Pet           | frog      | turtle    |
   | Sport         | parkour   | polo      |

2. From point 1, we know that the person who's hobby is video-games is the engineer. So, we can fill in the table as follows:

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | coffee     | water     |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking | video-games(engineer) |
   | Job           | dancer    | engineer  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b       | folk      |
   | Pet           | frog      | turtle    |
   | Sport         | parkour   | polo      |

3. The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee. Since there are only 2 options for beverages, the person playing parkour must be on the left, so we can fill in the table as follows:

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | coffee     | water     |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking | video-games(engineer) |
   | Job           | dancer    | engineer  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b       | folk      |
   | Pet           | frog      | turtle    |
   | Sport         | parkour   | polo      |
   Now, the person playing parkour is in the first row, so the person playing polo must be in the second row.

4. The fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the owner of the turtle. Since there are only 2 options for music-genres, the person who likes d&b must be on the right, so we can fill in the table as follows:

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | coffee     | water     |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking | video-games(engineer) |
   | Job           | dancer    | engineer  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b(right) | folk      |
   | Pet           | frog      | turtle    |
   | Sport         | parkour   | polo      |
   Now, the person who likes d&b is in the third column, so the person who likes folk must be in the first column.

5. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since we already know that the person who likes d&b is on the right, the person who likes filmmaking must be on the left. So, we can fill in the table as follows:

   |               |      1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | coffee     | water     |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking(left) | video-games(engineer) |
   | Job           | dancer    | engineer  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b       | folk(left) |
   | Pet           | frog      | turtle    |
   | Sport         | parkour   | polo      |

Now, we have filled in all the categories with unique options, and we have satisfied all the given conditions. So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-6x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different nationalities, the Argentine must be in the first column and the Nigerian in the second column. Let's place the Argentine in the first column, first row, and the Nigerian in the second column, first row.

   |               | Argentine   | Nigerian   |
   | Food          |             |            |

   | Nationality   | Argentine  | Nigerian   |
   | Transport     |             |            |

2. The Argentine drives the bus, so the first row, first column must be 'Bus'.

   |               | Argentine   | Nigerian   |
   | Food          | Bus         |            |

   | Nationality   | Argentine  | Nigerian   |
   | Transport     | Bus         |            |

3. The engineer is to the right of the Argentine, so the first row, second column must be 'Journalist'.

   |               | Argentine   | Nigerian   |
   | Food          | Bus         | Journalist |

   | Nationality   | Argentine  | Nigerian   |
   | Transport     | Bus         |            |

4. The person eating watermelon is to the left of the person eating broccoli. Since we don't know the food yet, let's place watermelon in the first column, second row, and broccoli in the second column, second row.

   |               | Argentine   | Nigerian   |
   | Food          | Bus         | Journalist |
   | Hobby         |             |            |

   | Nationality   | Argentine  | Nigerian   |
   | Transport     | Bus         |            |
   | Food          | Watermelon  | Broccoli   |

5. The person watching adventure movies is in an even position. Since we have already placed two items in the first and second rows, the third row must have adventure movies.

   |               | Argentine   | Nigerian   |
   | Food          | Bus         | Journalist |
   | Hobby         |             |            |

   | Job           |            |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure  |            |

6. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person watching thriller movies. Since there's only one empty cell left, it must be the hobby and movie-genre for the second column, second row.

   |               | Argentine   | Nigerian   |
   | Food          | Bus         | Journalist |
   | Hobby         |             | Rock-climbing|
   | Job           | Engineer   |            |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure  | Thriller   |
   | Nationality   | Argentine  | Nigerian   |
   | Transport     | Bus         |            |
   | Food          | Watermelon  | Broccoli   |

7. Now we can place the jobs. Since the engineer is to the right of the Argentine, the second row, first column must be the job of the Nigerian. Let's place it as 'Engineer'.

   |               | Argentine   | Nigerian   |
   | Food          | Bus         | Journalist |
   | Hobby         |             | Rock-climbing|
   | Job           | Engineer   | Engineer   |

   | Nationality   | Argentine  | Nigerian   |
   | Transport     | Bus         |            |
   | Food          | Watermelon  | Broccoli   |

8. The only remaining job is 'Journalist', so it must be the job for the Argentine in the first row, second column.

   |               | Argentine   | Nigerian   |
   | Food          | Bus         | Journalist |
   | Hobby         |             | Rock-climbing|
   | Job           | Journalist | Engineer   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure  | Thriller   |
   | Nationality   | Argentine  | Nigerian   |
   | Transport     | Bus         |            |
   | Food          | Watermelon  | Broccoli   |

9. Since the person eating watermelon is to the left of the person eating broccoli, the first row, second column must be 'Broccoli' and the second row, second column must be 'Watermelon'.

   |               | Argentine   | Nigerian   |
   | Food          | Bus         | Journalist |
   | Hobby         |             | Rock-climbing|
   | Job           | Journalist | Engineer   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure  | Thriller   |
   | Nationality   | Argentine  | Nigerian   |
   | Transport     | Bus         |            |
   | Food          | Broccoli   | Watermelon |

Now we have the final solution:

#############

Lv5-6x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 hobbies, 2 jobs, 2 nationalities, 2 pets, and 2 sports. So, each row and each column will have one unique item.

2. Let's start with the Nationality column. Since there are only 2 nationalities, we can fill one of the cells with Italian and the other with Malaysian. Let's place Malaysian in the top left cell (1,1) for now.

3. Now, let's fill the Hobby column. Since the person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the Malaysian, the camping hobby cannot be in the first column. So, it must be in the second column. Let's place camping in the second row (2,2).

4. The lawyer is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the Malaysian is in the top left cell, the lawyer cannot be in the top row. Also, the lawyer cannot be in the second row because the hobby in that row is camping, and the lawyer cannot be on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. So, the lawyer must be in the bottom row (2,1).

5. Now, we know the lawyer is a musician, so the job in the second row is musician. The sport in the second row is sailing, so the person who prefers sailing is in the second row. But we know the lawyer is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing, so the sailing sport must be in the first column (1,2).

6. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the Malaysian is in the top left cell, the goldfish cannot be in the first row or the first column. So, the goldfish must be in the second row or the second column. But the second row is already occupied by the lawyer and the sailing sport, so the goldfish must be in the second column (2,2).

7. This means the juice must be in the first column (1,1). So, the beverage in the second row (1,2) must be 7up.

8. The only remaining items are the hobby in the first row and the pet in the second column. Since the hobby in the first row cannot be camping (because the person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the Malaysian), it must be chess. The pet in the second column cannot be a cat (because the goldfish is in the second column), so it must be a cat.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
| Malaysian | Chess | Lawyer | Italian | Cat     | Sailing |
| Beverage  |       | Job    |        | Pet     | Sport   |

Lv5-6x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food, two hobbies, two jobs, two pets, two sports, and two means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. The person who's hobby is writing is the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This means that the pair (writing, ice-hockey) must be in the same row. Let's assign writing to the first hobby and ice-hockey to the second sport. So, the table looks like this:

   |             |     1      |     2     |
   | Food        |            |           |

   | Transport   |            |           |

3. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the teacher. Since writing is already assigned, the teacher must be in the second column. So, the table looks like this:

4. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since we don't have any assignments yet for the last two columns, we can't solve this condition yet.

5. The person eating orange is somewhere to the left of the teacher. Since we have the teacher assigned, we can assign the orange to the first column. So, the table looks like this:

   |             | Orange    | Teacher  |
   | Food        | Orange    | Teacher  |
   | Hobby       | Writing   |           |

   | Sport       | Ice-hockey|           |
   | Transport   |           |           |

6. Now we have one more condition left: the person who's job is a lawyer is in the first row. Since we have the teacher and the orange in the first row, the lawyer must be the food. So, the table looks like this:

   |             | Orange    | Teacher  |
   | Food        | Lawyer   | Teacher  |
   | Hobby       | Writing  |           |

   | Sport       | Ice-hockey|           |
   | Transport   |           |           |

7. We still have one more condition left: the person who owns the cat is in the second row. Since we have the teacher and the lawyer in the first row, the cat owner must be in the second row. Let's assign the cat to the second pet. So, the table looks like this:

   |             | Orange    | Teacher  |
   | Food        | Lawyer   | Teacher  |
   | Hobby       | Writing  |           |
   | Job         | Lawyer   |           |
   | Pet         | Cat      | Cat Owner|
   | Sport       | Ice-hockey|           |
   | Transport   |           |           |

8. Now we have one more condition left: the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the cat owner is in the second row, the jet-ski driver must be in the first row. Let's assign the jet-ski to the second transport. So, the table looks like this:

   |             | Orange    | Teacher  |
   | Food        | Lawyer   | Teacher  |
   | Hobby       | Writing  |           |
   | Job         | Lawyer   |           |
   | Pet         | Cat      | Cat Owner|
   | Sport       | Ice-hockey|           |
   | Transport   | Jet-ski  |           |

9. We still have one more condition left: the person who prefers tennis is somewhere to the right of the cat owner. Since the cat owner is in the second row, the tennis player must be in the third or fourth column. Let's assign tennis to the third sport. So, the table looks like this:

   |             | Orange    | Teacher  |
   | Food        | Lawyer   | Teacher  |
   | Hobby       | Writing  |           |
   | Job         | Lawyer   |           |
   | Pet         | Cat      | Cat Owner|
   | Sport       | Ice-hockey| Tennis   |
   | Transport   | Jet-ski  |           |

10. Now we have one more condition left: there are two different types of food, and we have already assigned one (orange). Let's assign pineapple to the second food. So, the table looks like this:

    |             | Pineapple| Orange  |
    | Food        | Lawyer   | Lawyer |
    | Hobby       | Writing  | Writing|
    | Job         | Lawyer   | Lawyer |
    | Pet         | Cat      | Cat    |
    | Sport       | Ice-hockey| Tennis |
    | Transport   | Jet-ski  | Jet-ski|

11. We have solved all the conditions, so the final table is:

    |             | Pineapple| Orange  |
    | Food        | Lawyer   | Lawyer |
    | Hobby       | Writing  | Writing|

Lv5-6x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 different items (beverages, food, hobbies, nationalities, sports, and transport) and each item has 2 different instances. So, we can arrange them in a 6x2 table.

2. From the clues, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person driving the scooter. This means that cycling and scooter must be in adjacent columns. Let's place them as follows:

   |               |      1      |    2     |
   | Beverage      |             |          |

   | Sport         | Cycling     | Scooter   |
   | Transport     |             |          |

3. The person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the left of the turkish. Since we already placed the sport, let's place the food and nationality now. We can't place cauliflower and turkish in the same column as they are adjacent according to the clue. So, let's place cauliflower in the first column and turkish in the second column:

   |               |      1      |    2     |
   | Beverage      |             |          |

   | Transport     |             |          |

4. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since we already placed the food, nationality, and sport, let's place the hobby and beverage now. We can't place mirinda and sudoku in the same column as they are adjacent according to the clue. So, let's place mirinda in the first column and sudoku in the second column:

   |               |      1      |    2     |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda    | Water    |

   | Sport         | Cycling     | Scooter   |
   | Transport     |             |          |

5. Finally, let's place the transport. Since we know the position of the sport, we can't place the transport in the same row as the sport. So, let's place jet-ski in the first row and scooter in the second row:

   |               |      1      |    2     |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda    | Water    |

Lv5-6x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different beverages, so let's label them as A and B. Since the fan of punk is on the far left, the person drinking A (let's say coffee) is on the right of the fan of punk, so A must be in the first column.

2. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the nurse. Since the fan of punk is on the far left, the nurse must be in the second column. So, the person drinking lemonade (B) must be in the first row of the second column.

3. The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies. Since the person drinking lemonade is in the second column, the person driving the skateboard (A) must be in the second row of either the first or second column. However, since the person drinking coffee (A) is on the left of the nurse, the skateboard cannot be in the second column. So, the skateboard is in the second row of the first column.

4. The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating lemon. Since the person drinking lemonade is in the first row of the second column, the person eating pineapple (A) must be in the first row of the first column.

5. Now, we have placed four items: skateboard, nurse, lemonade, and pineapple. The remaining items are coffee, family, musical, hip-hop, punk, and subway.

   | Transport     | skateboard| subway      |

6. The person watching family movies (family) must be in the second row of the second column, as it is to the right of the skateboard.

7. The remaining items are job, musical, and subway. Since the person driving the skateboard is in the second row of the first column, the person driving the subway (subway) must be in the first row of the second column.

8. The person with the job (let's say photographer) cannot be in the first row as the skateboard and subway are already placed there. So, the photographer must be in the second row. Since the person watching family movies is in the second row of the second column, the photographer (nurse) must be in the second row of the first column.

9. The remaining item is musical. Since the person watching family movies is in the second row of the second column, the person watching musical (musical) must be in the first row of the second column.

   | Nationality   | German | Russian |
   |--------------|--------|---------|

2. Since there are 2 different jobs (mechanic and photographer), and the mechanic is on the right of the owner of the dog, the mechanic cannot be in the first column. So, the mechanic goes in the second column, and the photographer goes in the first column.

5. Since there are 2 different music-genres (indie and trance), and the fan of indie is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi, the indie fan cannot be in the first column. The only remaining option for the indie fan is the second column. Since the mechanic is in the second column, the taxi driver must be in the first column.

Lv5-6x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different hobbies, 2 different jobs, 2 different movie-genres, and 2 different nationalities, we can place one of each in the first row and one in the second row.

2. From point 1, we know that the dressmaker is on the right of the photographer. So, the Job column looks like this:

3. From point 2, we know that the person eating apple is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the food and movie-genre are in different columns, we can't directly place them next to each other. However, we can deduce that the apple eater cannot be on the right of the drama watcher. So, the Food and Movie-Genre columns look like this:

   |               |      1       |      2      |

4. From point 3, we know that the photographer is on the left or right of the thai. Since the Job and Nationality are in different columns, we can't directly place them next to each other. However, we can deduce that the photographer cannot be on the left of the thai. So, the Job and Nationality columns look like this:

5. From point 4, we know that the person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the Beverage and Hobby are in different columns, we can't directly place them next to each other. However, we can deduce that the milk drinker cannot be on the right of the reader. So, the Beverage and Hobby columns look like this:

   |               |      1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | milk       |

3. Since the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the fan of reggae, the almond-milk drinker cannot be in the first column. So, the almond-milk drinker is in the second column, and the beverage in the first column is iced-tea.

4. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the left of the project-manager. Since the project-manager is in the second row, the rabbit owner must be in the first row. However, we already have two elements in the first row, so the rabbit cannot be placed. This means our current arrangement is not possible.

So, there seems to be a contradiction in the given information, and the puzzle cannot be solved as stated.
