Lv5-1x3-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three different genres: epic, romance, and superhero.
2. The person watching epic movies is on the far right.
3. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.

From point 2, we can deduce that the epic genre must be in the rightmost column (column 3).

Now, let's fill in the genres based on the information given:

|               |     1     |    2    |  3   |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         | epic |

Since the epic genre is in the rightmost column, the only genre left for column 1 is romance.

Now, we have the person watching romance movies to the left of the person watching superhero movies. So, let's place superhero in column 2:

|               | romance  |    2    | epic  |
| Movie-Genre   |         |         |      |

Now, we have filled in two genres. Since there is only one genre left (superhero), it must be in the remaining column (column 1):

|               | romance  | superhero| epic  |
| Movie-Genre   |         |         |      |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               | romance  | superhero| epic  |
| Movie-Genre   |         |         |      |

Lv5-1x3-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three different music genres: blues, rock, and soul.

2. The fan of rock is on the right of the fan of blues. This means that either Rock is in the 2nd or 3rd column, and Blues is in the 1st column.

3. The fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the fan of soul. This means that Soul must be in the 1st column.

4. Now we know that Blues is in the 1st row and Soul is in the 1st column. Since Blues is to the left of Soul, Blues cannot be in the 3rd row. So, Blues must be in the 1st row.

5. Now we know that Blues is in the 1st row and Soul is in the 1st column. Since Rock is to the right of Blues, Rock can only be in the 2nd or 3rd row. But since Soul is in the 1st column, Rock cannot be in the 1st row. So, Rock must be in the 3rd row.

6. Finally, since Blues is in the 1st row and Rock is in the 3rd row, Soul must be in the 2nd row.

The final solution table is:

```

Lv5-1x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating grapes is to the right of the person eating broccoli. So, the possible arrangements for the first two columns are:
   - Broccoli, Grapes
   - Grapes, Broccoli (this is not possible because the grapes must be to the right of broccoli)

2. Now, the person eating raspberry is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes. Since the only possible position for grapes is to the right of broccoli, the only arrangement for the last two columns is:
   - Grapes, Raspberry

3. Now, we can combine the columns to get the final arrangement:
   - Broccoli, Grapes, Raspberry

4. So, the final solution table is:

   |        |    1     |   2    |     3     |

Lv5-1x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three different movie genres: scientific, sports, and thriller.

2. From the first rule, we know that the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies. This means that the order must be either Thriller - Scientific - Sports or Scientific - Thriller - Sports.

3. From the second rule, we know that the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching sports movies. This means that the order cannot be Scientific - Thriller - Sports because that would place the sports person to the right of the scientific person, which is not allowed.

4. So, the only possible order is Thriller - Scientific - Sports.

5. Now, let's fill in the table:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |

Lv5-1x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating watermelon is to the left of the person eating carrot, we can rule out placing watermelon in the rightmost column (column 3). So, the watermelon can only be in either column 1 or column 2.

2. If watermelon is in column 1, then the person eating carrot must be in column 3, and the person eating banana must be in column 2, as it needs to be between watermelon and carrot. This arrangement doesn't satisfy the condition that the person eating banana is to the left of the person eating carrot.

3. Therefore, watermelon must be in column 2. This means the person eating carrot must be in column 3, and the person eating banana must be in column 1.

The final solution table is:

  |        |     1      |   2    |   3    |

Lv5-1x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. From point 3, we know that the person drinking milk is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking tea. This means that neither juice nor tea can be in the first or third position, as there would be no room for milk in between. So, the table now looks like this:

   |            |  1  |  2   |   3   |
   | Beverage   | juice|      | tea   |

2. From point 2, we know that the person drinking tea is to the left of the person drinking milk. This means that tea must be in the second position, and milk must be in the third position. So, the table now looks like this:

   |            |  1  |  2   |   3   |
   | Beverage   | juice| tea  | milk  |

3. From point 1, we know that the person drinking tea is either on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since we already placed tea in the second position, it must be on the right of milk, which is in the third position. But this contradicts point 2, as the person drinking tea should be to the left of the person drinking milk.

There seems to be a contradiction in the given conditions, and it's not possible to solve the puzzle with the given information.

Final solution: The puzzle cannot be solved with the given conditions.

However, if we make a small adjustment to the conditions to make them consistent, for example, changing ""the person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking milk##3"" to ""the person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking milk##3"", the puzzle can be solved. The final solution would be:

Lv5-1x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit, we can rule out the first column for the rabbit and the second column for the hamster. So, the initial table looks like this:

   |       |   1    |    2    |  3   |
   | Pet   | Rabbit | Hamster| Goat |

2. Now, since the owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat, the hamster cannot be in the third column. So, the updated table is:

   |       |   1    |    2    |  3   |
   | Pet   | Rabbit | Hamster|   Goat|

3. To satisfy both conditions, the only possible arrangement is:

   |       |   1    |    2    |  3   |
   | Pet   | Rabbit | Hamster| Goat |

So, the final solution is:

Lv5-1x3-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the person eating asparagus is to the right of the person eating raspberry, we can rule out the possibility of raspberry being in the first column (position 1). So, raspberry can only be in either position 2 or 3.

2. The person eating apple is on the left of the person eating raspberry. This means that if raspberry is in position 2, apple must be in position 1, and if raspberry is in position 3, apple can be either in position 1 or 2.

3. Now, let's consider the case where raspberry is in position 2. If apple is in position 1, then asparagus must be in position 3 because there's no other place left. But this contradicts the rule that the person eating asparagus is to the right of the person eating raspberry. So, raspberry cannot be in position 2.

4. Therefore, raspberry must be in position 3. Since raspberry is in the last position, the person eating apple must be in the first position, and the person eating asparagus must be in the second position.

So, the final solution table is:

  |        |   1   |     2     |     3     |
| Food   | Apple | Asparagus| Raspberry |

Lv5-1x3-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the hobby of filmmaking is to the left of the hobby of chess. So, we can write it as:

   |         |    ?    |    Chess   |
   | Hobby   |        |            |

2. The hobby of hiking is to the left of the hobby of filmmaking. So, we can write it as:

   | Hobby   |            |        |            |

3. Now, we have three hobbies (Hiking, Filmmaking, Chess) and three spots. So, we can fill in the table:

Lv5-1x3-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three different movie genres: comedy, martial-arts, and satire.

2. The person watching satire movies is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. This means satire cannot be in the rightmost column (column 3) because if it were, martial-arts would have to be in the leftmost column (column 1), and that would violate the rule that there are three different genres. So, satire must be in either column 1 or column 2.

3. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies. This means comedy cannot be in the rightmost column (column 3) because if it were, satire would have to be in the leftmost column (column 1), and that would violate the rule that there are three different genres. So, comedy must be in either column 1 or column 2 as well.

4. Since we know satire is not in column 3, and comedy is not in column 3, that means column 3 must be martial-arts.

5. Now, let's place satire and comedy. Since satire is to the left of martial-arts, it cannot be in column 1 (because that would place martial-arts in the leftmost position, violating the rule that there are three different genres). So, satire must be in column 1.

6. This leaves comedy for column 2.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |   1    |   2    |      3       |
