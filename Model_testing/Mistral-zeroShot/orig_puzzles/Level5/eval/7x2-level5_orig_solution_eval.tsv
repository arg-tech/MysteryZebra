Lv5-7x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two different hobbies (gardening and skydiving), we can place them in the first and second columns of the Hobby row, respectively. Let's assume gardening is in column 1 and skydiving is in column 2.

2. Since there are two different sports (surfing and water-polo), we can place them in the first and second columns of the Sport row, respectively. Since surfing is to the left of skydiving, we place surfing in column 1 and water-polo in column 2.

3. Since there are two different music-genres (punk and soul), we can place them in the first and second columns of the Music-Genre row, respectively. Since soul is to the left of punk, we place soul in column 1 and punk in column 2.

4. Since there are two different jobs (entrepreneur and manager), we can place them in the first and second columns of the Job row, respectively. Since the manager is to the right of the person eating broccoli (which we haven't placed yet), we place the manager in column 2.

5. Now we have one remaining job (entrepreneur) and one remaining food (broccoli). Since the manager is to the right of the person eating broccoli, we place the entrepreneur in column 1 and broccoli in the first row of the Food column.

6. Now we have one remaining food (cabbage) and one remaining beverage (cola). Since the person drinking milk is to the right of the person driving the ship (which we haven't placed yet), we place the milk in column 2 and cola in column 1.

7. Since there are two different means of transport (roller and ship), we can place them in the first and second columns of the Transport row, respectively. Since the person drinking milk is to the right of the person driving the ship, we place the roller in column 1 and ship in column 2.

The final solution table is:

```
               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage     | Cola        |  Milk     |

Lv5-7x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 items and we have 2 of each, they will be arranged in pairs. Let's start by placing the pairs we know:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | mirinda    |
   | Food          | raspberry    | spinach    |
   | Movie-Genre   | family       | satire     |
   | Nationality   | french       | russian    |
   | Pet           | cat          | snake      |
   | Sport         | basketball   | biathlon   |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | van        |

2. Now let's use the position clues:

   - The French is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the sports are already in place, the French must be in position 1 or 2. If the French were in position 1, the sport would have to be in position 6, which contradicts the fact that the French is to the left of the person playing basketball. So, the French is in position 2, and the person playing basketball is in position 5.

   - The person eating raspberry is on the left of the person watching family movies. Since the movies are already in place, the raspberry eater must be in position 1 or 2. If the raspberry eater were in position 1, the movie would have to be in position 6, which contradicts the fact that the raspberry eater is to the left of the person watching family movies. So, the raspberry eater is in position 2, and the person watching family movies is in position 5.

   - The owner of the cat is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since the beverages are already in place, the cat owner must be in position 1 or 2. If the cat owner were in position 1, the pet would have to be in position 6, which contradicts the fact that the cat owner is to the left of the person drinking mirinda. So, the cat owner is in position 1, and the person drinking mirinda is in position 6.

   - The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. Since the raspberry eater is already in position 2, the snake owner must be in position 3 or 4. If the snake owner were in position 3, the pet would have to be in position 6, which contradicts the fact that the raspberry eater is to the left or right of the snake owner. So, the snake owner is in position 4, and the pet is in position 5.

   - The person driving the van is in an odd position. Since the transports are already in place, the van driver is in position 1, 3, or 5. If the van driver were in position 1, the transport would have to be in position 6, which contradicts the fact that the van driver is in an odd position. If the van driver were in position 3, the transport would have to be in position 5, which contradicts the fact that the snake owner is to the left of the person driving the van (since the snake owner is in position 4 and the transport is in position 5). So, the van driver is in position 5, and the transport is in position 1.

3. Now let's check the remaining clues to make sure they hold:

   - The person driving the van is in an odd position. This is already satisfied since the van driver is in position 5.

   - The owner of the cat is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. This is already satisfied since the cat owner is in position 1 and the person drinking mirinda is in position 6.

   - The person eating raspberry is on the left of the person watching family movies. This is already satisfied since the raspberry eater is in position 2 and the person watching family movies is in position 5.

   - The French is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball. This is already satisfied since the French is in position 2 and the person playing basketball is in position 5.

   - The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. This is already satisfied since the raspberry eater is in position 2 and the snake owner is in position 4.

4. The final solution table is:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | mirinda    |
   | Food          | raspberry    | spinach    |
   | Movie-Genre   | family       | satire     |
   | Nationality   | french       | russian    |
   | Pet           | cat          | snake      |
   | Sport         | basketball   | biathlon   |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | van        |

Lv5-7x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two people, so we can fill in the table with two rows.

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          |         |         |
| Hobby         |         |         |
| Movie-Genre   |         |         |
| Nationality   |         |         |
| Pet           |         |         |
| Sport         |         |         |
| Transport     |         |         |

2. From point 1, we know there are 2 different types of food, 2 different hobbies, 2 different movie-genres, 2 different nationalities, 2 different pets, 2 different sports, and 2 different means of transport. So, we can fill in the first row with unique options for each category. Let's fill the first row with the following:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Cherry   | Carrot  |
| Hobby         | Chess    | Collect |
| Movie-Genre   | Family   | Superhero|
| Nationality   | Mexican  | Nigerian|
| Pet           | Dog      | Ferret   |
| Sport         | Basketball| Cricket  |
| Transport     | Airplane | Trike    |

3. From point 2, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the nigerian. So, the second row should have the superhero movie-genre on the left of the nigerian nationality. The only option is to swap the movie-genre and nationality columns for the second row:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Cherry   | Carrot  |
| Hobby         | Chess    | Collect |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero| Family   |
| Nationality   | Mexican  | Nigerian|
| Pet           | Dog      | Ferret   |
| Sport         | Basketball| Cricket  |
| Transport     | Airplane | Trike    |

4. From point 3, the person driving the airplane is on the far right. Since the airplane is already in the second row, no changes are needed.

5. From point 4, the owner of the dog is on the right of the person eating cherry. Since the dog owner is Person 1 and the cherry eater is Person 2, no changes are needed.

6. From point 5, the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since the superhero movie watcher is Person 2, the collector must be Person 1. So, we swap the hobby columns for the two rows:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Cherry   | Carrot  |
| Hobby         | Collect  | Chess    |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero| Family   |
| Nationality   | Mexican  | Nigerian|
| Pet           | Dog      | Ferret   |
| Sport         | Basketball| Cricket  |
| Transport     | Airplane | Trike    |

7. From point 6, the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the basketball player is Person 1 and the cricket player is Person 2, no changes are needed.

Now we have the final solution:

| Movie-Genre   | Superhero| Family   |
| Nationality   | Mexican  | Nigerian|
| Pet           | Dog      | Ferret   |

Lv5-7x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person watching comedy movies is not directly next to the fan of R&B. So, neither of them can be in the first column.

2. From point 2, the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since there are only two pets, the chinchilla must be in the second row. So, iced-tea must be in the second column.

3. From point 3, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since there are only two means of transport, the boat must be in the second row. So, the hobby of puzzles must be in the first column.

4. From point 4, the fan of R&B is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since there are only two sports, badminton must be in the second row. So, R&B must be in the first column.

Now we have the following:

|               | Iced-Tea | R&B      |
| Beverage      |          |          |
| Hobby         | Puzzles  |          |

| Pet           | Chinchilla| Fish     |
| Sport         | Badminton|          |
| Transport     |          | Boat     |

5. From point 5, the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since iced-tea is already in the second column, the person drinking it must be in the second row. So, the beverage in the first row must be lemonade.

6. Now we know that the person watching comedy movies is not directly next to the fan of R&B, so it can't be in the first row or second column. The only remaining spot is the second row, first column. So, the movie genre in the first row must be fantasy.

7. From point 6, the person watching fantasy movies must be in the first row. Since the hobby of puzzles is in the first column, the hobby of the person watching fantasy movies must be filmmaking.

8. From point 4, the fan of R&B is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the sport of badminton is in the second row, the fan of R&B must be in the second column.

9. From point 3, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since the hobby of puzzles is in the first column, the person driving the boat must be in the second row. So, the transport in the first row must be airplane.

10. From point 2, the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the iced-tea is in the second row, the person drinking it must be in the second column. So, the pet in the first row must be fish.

11. From point 1, the person watching comedy movies is not directly next to the fan of R&B. Since the fan of R&B is in the second column, the person watching comedy movies must be in the first row.

Now we have the final solution:

|               | Lemonade | R&B      |
| Beverage      | Airplane |          |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking| Puzzles  |

Lv5-7x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two jobs, the lawyer must be in row 1 or 2, and the software developer must be in the other row. Let's assume the lawyer is in row 1 (we'll see later if this assumption is correct).

2. Since there are only two hobbies, the person in row 1 (the lawyer) must have one of the two hobbies, let's say collecting. This means the person in row 2 must have the other hobby, sudoku.

3. Since there are only two movie genres, the person in row 1 (the lawyer) must have one of the two movie genres, let's say action. This means the person in row 2 must have the other movie genre, scientific.

4. Since there are only two music genres, the person in row 1 (the lawyer) must have one of the two music genres, let's say punk. This means the person in row 2 must have the other music genre, reggae.

5. Since there are only two nationalities, the person in row 1 (the lawyer) must be one of the two nationalities, let's say Pakistani. This means the person in row 2 must be the other nationality, Polish.

6. Since there are only two pets, the person in row 1 (the lawyer) must have one of the two pets, let's say a mouse. This means the person in row 2 must have the other pet, a turtle.

7. Since there are only two sports, the person in row 1 (the lawyer) must have one of the two sports, let's say parkour. This means the person in row 2 must have the other sport, weightlifting.

8. Now let's check the conditions:
   - The lawyer is in row 1, and the person watching action movies is in row 2, so the condition 1 is satisfied.
   - The owner of the turtle is in row 2, and the person who prefers reggae is also in row 2, so the condition 5 is satisfied.
   - The Polish is in row 2, and the person who's sport is weightlifting is in row 1, so the condition 3 is satisfied.
   - The person who's sport is parkour is in row 1, and the person who's hobby is sudoku is in row 2. They are not directly left or right of each other, but since there are only two positions, they must be in the positions they are, so the condition 4 is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

```

2. Since the person eating Plum is to the right of the person eating Cranberry, we can't place any other food or beverage between them. So, let's place the remaining beverages in the first row and the remaining food in the second row.

Lv5-7x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two different items for each category, so we can fill in the table with unique items for each category.

|               |         1          |     2     |
| Beverage      | 7up             | water    |

| Music-Genre   | ambient        | jazz     |
| Transport     | bus            | van      |

2. From point 1, we know the fan of ambient is the person driving the van. So, we can fill in the Transport column for person 1 with van and for person 2 with bus.

|               |         1          |     2     |
| Beverage      | 7up             | water    |

| Music-Genre   | ambient        | jazz     |
| Transport     | van            | bus      |

3. From point 2, we know the software-developer is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since there are only two people, the software-developer must be person 1. So, we can fill in the Job column for person 1 with software-developer and for person 2 with lawyer.

|               |         1          |     2     |

| Transport     | van            | bus      |

4. From point 3, we know the person driving the van is on the far left or far right. Since the software-developer is already in the far left position, the van driver must be person 2. So, we can fill in the Transport column for person 2 with van and for person 1 with bus.

|               |         1          |     2     |

| Transport     | bus            | van      |

5. From point 4, we know the person eating asparagus is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. Since asparagus is already in the leftmost position, the person drinking water must be person 2. So, we can fill in the Beverage column for person 2 with water and for person 1 with 7up.

|               |         1          |     2     |

| Transport     | bus            | van      |

6. From point 5, we know the person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the fan of jazz. Since dancing is already in the leftmost position, the fan of jazz must be person 2. So, we can fill in the Music-Genre column for person 2 with jazz and for person 1 with ambient.

|               |         1          |     2     |

Lv5-7x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two jobs, let's assign Job 1 to the entrepreneur and Job 2 to the police-officer.

2. Similarly, let's assign Movie-Genre 1 to musical and Movie-Genre 2 to scientific.

3. For Music-Genre, let's assign Music-Genre 1 to classical and Music-Genre 2 to salsa.

4. Since there are two nationalities, let's assign Nationality 1 to Argentine and Nationality 2 to Indian.

5. For Pet, let's assign Pet 1 to dog and Pet 2 to hedgehog.

6. For Sport, let's assign Sport 1 to cycling and Sport 2 to rowing.

7. For Transport, let's assign Transport 1 to helicopter and Transport 2 to scooter.

Now, let's use the given conditions:

1. The police-officer is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies. Since the entrepreneur is not a police-officer, the police-officer must be in the second row. The only available spot for the police-officer to be on the left of the musical movie fan is in the first row, so the first row must contain the musical movie fan and the second row must contain the police-officer.

2. The Indian is on the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the entrepreneur is not Indian, the scientific movie fan must be in the first row. The only available spot for the Indian to be on the right is in the second row, so the second row must contain the Indian.

3. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the fan of salsa music. Since the police-officer is not a cyclist, the cyclist must be in the first row. The only available spot for the cyclist to be on the right of the salsa fan is in the second column, so the first column must contain the salsa fan and the second column must contain the cyclist.

4. The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog. Since the police-officer is not a dog owner, the dog owner must be in the first row. The only available spot for the dog owner to be on the left is in the first column, so the first column must contain the dog owner and the first row must contain the dog. The only available spot for the hedgehog owner to be on the right of the dog owner is in the second column, so the second column must contain the hedgehog owner.

5. The person driving the scooter is on the far left. Since the first column is already occupied by the dog owner, the scooter driver must be in the second row.
