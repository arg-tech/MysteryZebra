Lv5-1x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the lawyer is on the left of the accountant, we can place the lawyer in the first or second position. Let's place the lawyer in the first position (L).
2. The accountant is on the right of the lawyer, so the accountant (A) must be in the second position.
3. The nurse is on the left of the lawyer, so the nurse (N) must be in the third position.
4. The dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the manager, so the dressmaker (D) can be in the fourth position or the third position. If D is in the fourth position, the manager (M) must be in the fifth position. If D is in the third position, the manager can be in the fourth or fifth position. We'll try both possibilities:
   a) If D is in the fourth position, the manager (M) must be in the fifth position. The coach (C) is on the left of the musician (M), so the coach can be in the sixth position, and the musician (M) can be in the seventh position. The coach is somewhere to the left of the musician, so the coach can be in the first, second, or third position. We'll try each possibility:
      i) If C is in the first position, the puzzle states that the dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the coach, so D must be in the second position. However, this contradicts the fact that the manager is on the right of the dressmaker. So, C cannot be in the first position.
      ii) If C is in the second position, D can be in the third position, and M can be in the fifth position. This satisfies all conditions.
      iii) If C is in the third position, D can be in the fourth position, and M can be in the sixth position. This also satisfies all conditions.
   b) If D is in the third position, the manager (M) can be in the fourth or fifth position. If M is in the fourth position, the puzzle states that the coach is on the left of the musician, so the coach (C) can be in the fifth position, and the musician (M) can be in the sixth position. The coach is somewhere to the left of the musician, so the coach can be in the first, second, or third position. We'll try each possibility:
      i) If C is in the first position, the dressmaker (D) must be in the second position, and the manager (M) can be in the fourth position. However, this contradicts the fact that the manager is on the right of the dressmaker. So, C cannot be in the first position.
      ii) If C is in the second position, the dressmaker (D) can be in the third position, and the manager (M) can be in the fifth position. This satisfies all conditions.
      iii) If C is in the third position, the dressmaker (D) must be in the fourth position, and the manager (M) can be in the sixth position. However, this contradicts the fact that the manager is on the right of the dressmaker. So, C cannot be in the third position.

So, the possible solutions are:

Solution 1:
|       |    L   |    A    |    N     |    D    |    M    |    C    |    M    |
| Job   |       |        |         |        |        |         |         |

Solution 2:
|       |    L   |    A    |    N     |    M    |    D    |    C    |    M    |
| Job   |       |        |         |        |        |         |         |

Since the musician is on the far right, we can place the musician (M) in the seventh position in both solutions.

Solution 1:
|       |    L   |    A    |    N     |    D    |    M    |    C    |    M    |
| Job   |       |        |         |        |        |         | musician|

Solution 2:
|       |    L   |    A    |    N     |    M    |    D    |    C    |    M    |
| Job   |       |        |         |        |        | manager | musician|

Now, we know that the coach is somewhere to the left of the musician. In solution 1, the coach (C) can be in the first, second, or third position. In solution 2, the coach (C) can be in the first, second, or sixth position. We'll try each possibility for both solutions:

Solution 1:
1. If C is in the first position, the puzzle states that the dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the coach, so D must be in the second position. However, this contradicts the fact that the manager is on the right of the dressmaker. So, C cannot be in the first position.
2. If C is in the second position, the puzzle states that the dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the coach, so D must be in the third position. This satisfies all conditions.
3. If C is in the third position, the puzzle states that the dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the coach, so D must be in the fourth position. However, this contradicts the fact that the manager is on the right of the dressmaker. So, C cannot be in the third position.

Solution 2:
1. If C is in the first position, the puzzle states that the dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the coach, so D must be in the second position. However, this contradicts the fact that the manager is on the right of the dressmaker. So, C cannot be in the first position.
2. If C is in the second position, the puzzle states that the dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the coach, so D must be in the third position. This satisfies all conditions.
3. If C is in the sixth position, the puzzle states that the dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the coach, so D must be in the seventh position. However, this contradicts the fact that the manager is on the right of the dressmaker. So, C cannot be in the sixth position.

So, the final solutions are:

Solution 1:
|       |    L   |    A    |    N     |    D    |    M    |    C    |    M    |    musician|
| Job   |       |        |         |        |        |         |         |

Solution 2:
|       |    L   |    A    |    N     |    M    |    D    |    C    |    M    |    musician|
| Job   |       |        |         |        |        | manager |         |

Both solutions are valid, but the second solution is more compact. So, the final solution is:

Lv5-1x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the guinea-pig is to the right of the cat and in an odd position, it can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

2. If the guinea-pig is in position 1, the cat can't be in position 2 (because of rule 11), so it must be in position 3, 5, or 7. But if the cat were in position 7, the pony would have to be in position 6 (because of rule 6), and there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the cat can't be in position 7. If the cat were in position 5, the pony would have to be in position 6, but then the goldfish would have to be in position 4 (because of rule 7), and there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the cat can't be in position 5 either. Therefore, the cat must be in position 3.

3. Now, the pony can't be in position 2 (because of rule 6), so it must be in position 4, 6, or 7. But if the pony were in position 4, the cat would have to be in position 5 (because of rule 6), which contradicts our assumption that the cat is in position 3. So, the pony can't be in position 4. If the pony were in position 6, the dog would have to be in position 5 (because of rule 5), and the goldfish would have to be in position 4 (because of rule 7). But there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the pony can't be in position 6 either. Therefore, the pony must be in position 7.

4. Now, the dog can't be in position 1 (because of rule 5), so it must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 8. But if the dog were in position 2, the bird would have to be in position 1 (because of rule 5), and there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the dog can't be in position 2. If the dog were in position 6, the hamster would have to be in position 5 (because of rule 9), and the goldfish would have to be in position 4 (because of rule 7). But there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the dog can't be in position 6 either. If the dog were in position 8, the bird would have to be in position 7 (because of rule 5), and the goldfish would have to be in position 6 (because of rule 7). But there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the dog can't be in position 8 either. Therefore, the dog must be in position 4.

5. Now, the bird can't be in position 1 (because of rule 4), so it must be in position 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7. But if the bird were in position 2, the dog would have to be in position 4 (because of rule 5), and there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the bird can't be in position 2. If the bird were in position 3, the guinea-pig would have to be in position 1 (because of rule 8), which contradicts our assumption that the guinea-pig is in position 1. So, the bird can't be in position 3. If the bird were in position 5, the hamster would have to be in position 6 (because of rule 9), and the goldfish would have to be in position 4 (because of rule 7). But there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the bird can't be in position 5 either. If the bird were in position 6, the hamster would have to be in position 5 (because of rule 9), and the goldfish would have to be in position 4 (because of rule 7). But there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the bird can't be in position 6 either. Therefore, the bird must be in position 7.

6. Now, the hamster can't be in position 1 (because of rule 9), so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But if the hamster were in position 2, the goldfish would have to be in position 1 (because of rule 9), which contradicts our assumption that the guinea-pig is in position 1. So, the hamster can't be in position 2. If the hamster were in position 3, the goldfish would have to be in position 2 (because of rule 9), which contradicts our assumption that the guinea-pig is in position 1. So, the hamster can't be in position 3 either. If the hamster were in position 4, the goldfish would have to be in position 3 (because of rule 9), but there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the hamster can't be in position 4 either. If the hamster were in position 5, the goldfish would have to be in position 4 (because of rule 9), but there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the hamster can't be in position 5 either. If the hamster were in position 6, the goldfish would have to be in position 5 (because of rule 9), but there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the hamster can't be in position 6 either. Therefore, the hamster must be in position 7.

7. Now, the goldfish can't be in position 1 (because of rule 9), so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But if the goldfish were in position 2, the hamster would have to be in position 3 (because of rule 9), which contradicts our assumption that the hamster is in position 7. So, the goldfish can't be in position 2. If the goldfish were in position 3, the hamster would have to be in position 4 (because of rule 9), but there's no room for the guinea-pig to be in an odd position (rule 3). So, the goldfish can't be in position 3 either. If the goldfish were in position 4, the hamster would have to be in position 5 (because of rule 9), and the guinea-pig would have to be in position 1 (because of rule 8). But there's no room for the bird to be to the left of the dog (rule 5). So, the goldfish can't be in position 4 either. If the goldfish were in position 5, the hamster would have to be in position 6 (because of rule 9), and the guinea-pig would have to be in position 3 (because of rule 8). But there's no room for the bird to be to the left of the dog (rule 5). So, the goldfish can't be in position 5 either. Therefore, the goldfish must be in position 6.

8. Now, the pony is in position 7, the dog is in position 4, the bird is in position 7, the hamster is in position 7, and the goldfish is in position 6. The only remaining pet is the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig is to the right of the owner of the cat (rule 1), it can only be in position 5.

Lv5-1x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, we know the American is either to the left or right of the Indian. Let's assume the American is to the right of the Indian for now (we'll check this assumption later). This means the Indian must be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

2. From rule 1, the Indian is between the Thai and the American. If the Indian is in position 2, the Thai must be in position 1 and the American in position 3. But this violates rule 5 (Malaysian is to the right of the American). So, the Indian cannot be in position 2.

3. If the Indian is in position 4, the Thai must be in position 5 and the American in position 6. This satisfies all rules except rule 5 (Malaysian is to the right of the American). So, the Indian cannot be in position 4.

4. Therefore, the Indian must be in position 6. This means the Thai is in position 5 and the American is in position 7 (to satisfy rule 1 and rule 7).

5. Now, the American is on the right of the Indian, the Malaysian is to the right of the American (rule 5), and the German is on the far right (rule 3). So, the Malaysian must be in position 1, the American in position 7, and the German in position 8.

6. The Colombian is between the Brazilian and the Thai (rule 4). Since the Thai is in position 5, the Colombian can only be in position 3 or 4. If the Colombian is in position 3, the Brazilian must be in position 1, but this violates rule 6 (Brazilian is to the left of the Colombian). So, the Colombian must be in position 4. This means the Brazilian is in position 2.

7. Now, all nationalities are placed:

   |               |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

Lv5-1x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 9, we know that gardening is either to the left or right of camping. Since camping is on the right of gardening (rule 1), it means gardening must be to the left of camping.

2. Now we know that gardening is to the left of camping, so we can place gardening in the first position (column 1).

3. From rule 5, we know that photography is between gardening and camping. So, photography must be in the second position (column 2).

4. From rule 6, we know that photography is to the left of gardening, so it is indeed in the second position.

5. From rule 1, we know that camping is to the right of gardening, so camping must be in the third position (column 3).

6. From rule 3, we know that camping is to the left of cooking. Since camping is in the third position, cooking must be in the fourth position (column 4).

7. From rule 4, we know that cooking is to the left of puzzles. Since cooking is in the fourth position, puzzles must be in the fifth position (column 5).

8. From rule 8, we know that puzzles are to the left of reading. So, reading must be in the sixth position (column 6).

9. From rule 7, we know that photography is to the right of woodworking. Since photography is in the second position, woodworking must be in the seventh position (column 7).

1. From rule 1 and 3, we know that the fan of dubstep is to the right of the fan of gospel and the fan of metal, and the fan of metal is to the right of the fan of gospel. So, the order must be something like this: Gospel, Metal, Dubstep, _____, _____, _____, _____.

2. From rule 2, we know that the fan of metal is to the right of the fan of gospel. So, the fan of gospel cannot be in the first position (since there's no one to its left). Therefore, the order must be something like this: _____, Gospel, Metal, Dubstep, _____, _____, _____.

3. From rule 4, we know that the fan of ambient is in the middle. Since there are 7 positions and we have filled 3 (Gospel, Metal, Dubstep), the fan of ambient must be in the 4th position. So, the order is now: _____, Gospel, Metal, Ambient, Dubstep, _____, _____.

4. From rule 5, we know that the fan of techno is on the far left or far right. Since we have filled 4 positions and there are 3 left, techno cannot be in the 8th position (since there's no one to its right). Therefore, the order must be something like this: _____, Gospel, Metal, Ambient, Dubstep, Techno, _____.

5. From rule 6, we know that the fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of ambient. Since we have filled 5 positions and there are 2 left, house cannot be in the 7th position (since there's no one to its right). Therefore, the order must be: _____, Gospel, Metal, Ambient, House, Dubstep, Techno.

6. From rule 7, we know that the fan of dubstep is on the right of the fan of ambient. So, the order must be: _____, Gospel, Metal, Ambient, House, Dubstep, Techno.

7. From rule 8, we know that the fan of metal is on the left or right of the fan of house. Since we have filled 6 positions and there's only 1 left, metal must be in the 6th position. So, the order is: _____, Gospel, House, Metal, Dubstep, Techno.

8. From rule 9, we know that the fan of gospel is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep. Since we have filled 6 positions and there's only 1 left, gospel must be in the 1st position. So, the final order is: Gospel, House, Metal, Ambient, Dubstep, Techno.

3. The Egyptian is in an even position (4). Since the Egyptian can't be in the first position (as the Indian is there), the Egyptian must be in position 4, 6, or 7.

4. The Turkish is to the left of the Egyptian in at least 5 positions. Since the Turkish can't be in the first position (as the Indian is there), the Turkish can't be in the second position (as the Canadian is there), and the Turkish can't be in the fourth position (as the Egyptian is there), the Turkish must be in position 3.

5. The Mexican is to the left of the Egyptian. Since the Mexican is in position 2 and the Egyptian is in position 4, the Mexican can't be in position 6 (as the Egyptian is in position 4 and there are only 3 positions between them). So, the Mexican must be in position 6.

6. The Pakistani is on the left or right of the Egyptian in at least 3 positions. Since the Turkish is to the left of the Egyptian, the Pakistani can't be to the left of the Egyptian (as there are only 2 positions to the left of the Egyptian). So, the Pakistani must be in position 5.

7. The Turkish is between the Mexican and the Indian in at least 2 positions. Since the Mexican is in position 6 and the Indian is in position 1, the Turkish must be in position 2 or 4. But the Turkish is already in position 3, so it must be in position 2.

   - Left of singing: X
   - Right of singing: Y

2. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since fishing is on the far right, drawing cannot be on the right. So, drawing = X and fishing = Y.

3. Now, the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since dancing is going to be on the right of singing (as singing is in the middle), traveling cannot be on the left of singing. So, traveling is either X or between X and singing.

4. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since dancing is on the right of singing, magic-tricks is on the right of singing.

5. Since traveling is an odd position and we have already placed singing, traveling cannot be in the middle. So, traveling must be either X or between X and singing.

6. If traveling is X, then the positions would be X-Traveling-Singing-Magic-Tricks-Fishing. But this arrangement violates the rule that traveling is an odd position. So, traveling must be between X and singing.

7. The only possible arrangement that satisfies all the conditions is:
   - X: Drawing

4. Now we know the Thai and Indian positions. Let's fill the nationalities for them:
   | 1 | 2 | 3 |   |   |   |   |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | E | T | I |   |   |   |   |

5. The Indonesian is on the left or right of the Pakistani. Since the Indonesian is already in position 3, the Pakistani can only be in position 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. If the Pakistani were in position 1, it would be on the left of the Egyptian, which contradicts the fact that the Egyptian is on the far left. If the Pakistani were in position 2, it would be on the left of the Indonesian, which contradicts the fact that the Indonesian is on the left or right of the Pakistani. If the Pakistani were in position 4, it would be on the left of the Thai, which contradicts the fact that the Thai is to the left of the Indonesian. If the Pakistani were in position 5, it would be on the left of the Spanish, which contradicts the fact that the Spanish is on the right of the Turkish. If the Pakistani were in position 6, it would be on the left of the Turkish, which contradicts the fact that the Turkish is on the left of the Pakistani. Therefore, the Pakistani can't be in any of the positions 1-6. This is a contradiction, as we have 7 nationalities and only 6 positions. There seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the Pakistani is in position 7 (which is not explicitly stated to be impossible), we can continue:

6. Now we know the Pakistani's position. Let's fill the nationalities:
   | 1 | 2 | 3 |   |   |   | P |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | E | T | I |   |   |   | P |

7. The Indonesian is on the left of the Pakistani. So, the Indonesian is in position 6.
   | 1 | 2 | 3 |   | I |   | P |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | E | T | I |   |   | I | P |

8. The Spanish is on the right of the Turkish. Since the Turkish can't be in position 1 (as the Egyptian is there), the Turkish can only be in position 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7. If the Turkish were in position 2, the Spanish would have to be in position 3, which contradicts the fact that the Indonesian is in position 3 (as the Spanish is to the right of the Turkish). If the Turkish were in position 4, the Spanish would have to be in position 5, which also contradicts the fact that the Indonesian is in position 3 (as the Spanish is to the right of the Turkish). If the Turkish were in position 5, the Spanish would have to be in position 6, which also contradicts the fact that the Indonesian is in position 3 (as the Spanish is to the right of the Turkish). If the Turkish were in position 6, the Spanish would have to be in position 7, which also contradicts the fact that the Indonesian is in position 3 (as the Spanish is to the right of the Turkish). If the Turkish were in position 7, the Spanish would have to be in position 6, which also contradicts the fact that the Indonesian is in position 3 (as the Spanish is to the right of the Turkish). Therefore, the Turkish can't be in any of the positions 2-7. This is a contradiction, as we have 7 nationalities and only 6 positions. There seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the Turkish is in position 1 (which is not explicitly stated to be impossible), we can continue:

9. Now we know the Turkish's position. Let's fill the nationalities:
   |  T | 2 | 3 |   | I |   | P |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   |   | T | I |   |   | I | P |

10. The Spanish is on the right of the Turkish. So, the Spanish is in position 2.
    |  T |  S | 3 |   | I |   | P |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    |   |   | T |   |   | I | P |

11. The remaining nationalities are Egyptian, Indian, Indonesian, and Thai. Since the Egyptian is on the far left, it must be in position 1.
    |  E |  S | 3 |   | I |   | P |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    |   |   | T |   |   | I | P |

12. The Thai is to the left of the Indonesian. So, the Thai is in position 3.
    |  E |  S |  T |   | T |   | P |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    |   |   |   | T |   | T | P |

13. The remaining nationalities are Indian and Indonesian. Since the Indonesian is to the left of the Indian, the Indonesian must be in position 5 and the Indian in position 6.
    |  E |  S |  T | I | T | I | P |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    |   |   |   |   | T | T | P |

So, the final solution table is:

This solution assumes that the Pakistani is in position 7 and the Turkish is in position 1, which are not explicitly stated to be impossible but are not explicitly stated to be possible either. The original puzzle seems to have a contradiction, as we have 7 nationalities and only 6 positions."	{}	False	0	False
Lv5-1x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in the middle, it must be between crime and drama. So, we can place romance in position 5.

2. Now, the person watching fantasy movies must be on the left of the person watching romance movies, so it can only be in position 2 or 4. However, if it were in position 4, the person watching animation would have to be in position 6, which contradicts the fact that animation is to the right of crime (position 3). So, fantasy must be in position 2.

3. Now, the person watching animation must be to the right of crime, so it can only be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since it can't be in position 5 (because romance is there), and it can't be in position 6 (because horror is to the right of animation), it must be in position 4.

4. Now, the person watching horror movies must be to the right of animation, so it can only be in position 5, 6, or 7. Since it can't be in position 5 (because romance is there), and it can't be in position 6 (because musical is to the left of drama), it must be in position 7.

5. The person watching musical movies must be to the right of drama, so it can only be in position 6 or 7. Since it can't be in position 7 (because horror is there), it must be in position 6.

6. The person watching crime movies must be in position 1 or 3. Since it can't be in position 1 (because drama is to the left or right of crime), it must be in position 3.

7. Finally, the person watching fantasy movies is to the left of the person watching drama movies, so it must be in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Crime    |   Fantasy   |   Animation  |   Drama    |   Romance   |   Musical   |   Horror    |   Other    |

This table satisfies all the given conditions."	{}	False	0	False
Lv5-1x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the genres are arranged in a line, and there are 7 different genres. So, we can number the positions from 1 to 7.

2. From rule 1, the fan of d&b is to the right of the fan of hip-hop. This means that either d&b is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and hip-hop is in position 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the positions are odd for hip-hop (rule 7), hip-hop can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. If hip-hop is in position 1, then d&b can only be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the fan of d&b is to the right of the fan of hip-hop (rule 1), d&b can't be in position 2. So, d&b can only be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. If d&b is in position 3, then hip-hop can only be in position 1 or 5. But since the positions are odd for hip-hop (rule 7), hip-hop can only be in position 1. So, d&b is in position 2.

3. From rule 2, the fan of gospel is to the right of the fan of funk. This means that either gospel is in position 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, and funk is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. But since the fan of gospel is to the left of the fan of ambient (rule 5), gospel can't be in position 7. So, gospel can be in position 3, 4, or 5, and funk can be in position 1, 2, or 6. If funk is in position 1, then gospel can only be in position 3, 4, or 5. But since the fan of gospel is to the right of the fan of funk (rule 2), gospel can't be in position 3. So, gospel can only be in position 4 or 5. If gospel is in position 4, then funk can only be in position 1, 2, or 6. But since the fan of reggae is to the right of the fan of funk (rule 6), funk can't be in position 1. So, funk is in position 2 or 6. But since the fan of d&b is to the right of the fan of hip-hop (rule 1), and hip-hop is in position 1, d&b can't be in position 2. So, funk is in position 6.

4. From rule 3, the fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the fan of hip-hop. Since we already placed d&b in position 2 and hip-hop in position 1, this rule is satisfied.

5. From rule 4, the fan of hip-hop is to the right of the fan of ambient. This means that ambient can only be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. But since the fan of gospel is to the left of the fan of ambient (rule 5), ambient can't be in position 7. So, ambient can be in position 1, 3, or 5. If ambient is in position 1, then funk can't be in position 6 (since it's to the right of ambient), which contradicts our previous placement of funk. So, ambient can't be in position 1. If ambient is in position 3, then funk can't be in position 6 (since it's to the right of ambient), which also contradicts our previous placement of funk. So, ambient can't be in position 3 either. Therefore, ambient must be in position 5.

6. From rule 6, the fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk. Since we already placed funk in position 6, reggae can only be in position 7.

7. From rule 5, the fan of gospel is to the left of the fan of ambient. Since we already placed ambient in position 5, gospel can only be in position 4.

8. From rule 7, the fan of hip-hop is in an odd position. Since we already placed hip-hop in position 1, all positions are accounted for, and there are no remaining odd positions. But since we know that the positions are numbered from 1 to 7, the only odd position is position 1. This contradicts our previous placement of hip-hop in position 1. However, if we shift all the genres one position to the right, the puzzle becomes solvable:

   |               |   1   |  2   |   3    |    4    |    5    |  6  |   7    |
   | Music-Genre   |       |      |        |         |         |     |        |
   | ambient      |       |      |        |         |         |     |        |
   | funk         |       |      |        |         |         |     | reggae  |
   | gospel       |       | d&b  |        |         |         |     |         |
   | hip-hop      | hip-hop|      |        |         |         |     |         |

So, the final solution table is:
