Lv5-6x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can fill in the numbers from 1 to 5 in the first column.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking juice is to the right of the Canadian. So, let's place Juice in the second row, second column (since the Canadian is in the first row).

3. From rule 2, we know that the Russian is the woodworker. Since there are only 5 hobbies, we can place Woodworking in the third row.

4. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking 7up is to the left of the woodworker. Since the woodworker is in the third row, we can place 7up in the second row, first column.

5. From rule 5, we know that the trance fan is to the left of the rock fan. Since the rock fan is in the sixth row (from rule 12), we can place Trance in the fifth row.

6. From rule 6, we know that the goat owner is to the left of the cat owner. Since the cat owner cannot be in the first column (as it's occupied by 7up), the goat owner must be in the first row. So, let's place Goat in the first row, fifth column.

7. From rule 7, we know that the soy-milk drinker is to the left or right of the milk drinker. Since the milk drinker cannot be in the first column (as it's occupied by 7up) or the fifth column (as it's occupied by Goat), the milk drinker must be in the second column. So, let's place Milk in the second row, second column. This means Soy-milk must be in the second row, fourth column.

8. From rule 8, we know that the dubstep fan is to the left of the British. Since the British is not in the first column (as it's occupied by Goat), the dubstep fan must be in the first row. So, let's place Dubstep in the first row, first column.

9. From rule 9, we know that the snake owner is to the right of the goat owner. Since the goat owner is in the first row, the snake owner must be in the first row, sixth column.

10. From rule 10, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is to the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver cannot be in the first row (as it's occupied by Dubstep), the camping person must be in the first row. So, let's place Camping in the first row, third column.

11. From rule 11, we know that the car driver is to the right of the Canadian. Since the Canadian is in the first row, the car driver must be in the second row.

12. We already placed the car driver in the second row from rule 11, so the Canadian must be in the first row.

13. From rule 13, we know that the almond-milk drinker is to the left of the lizard owner. Since the lizard owner cannot be in the first column (as it's occupied by Dubstep) or the fifth column (as it's occupied by Goat), the lizard owner must be in the second column. So, let's place Lizard in the second row, second column. This means Almond-milk must be in the first row, second column.

14. From rule 14, we know that the cat owner is to the left or right of the lizard owner. Since the lizard owner is in the second row, the cat owner must be in the second row. But the cat owner cannot be in the first or fifth column (as they are occupied by 7up and Goat respectively), so the cat owner must be in the fourth column.

15. From rule 15, we know that the car driver is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the car driver is in the second row, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in the second row. But the person who's hobby is cooking cannot be in the first or fifth column (as they are occupied by Dubstep and Goat respectively), so the person who's hobby is cooking must be in the third column.

16. From rule 16, we know that the hamster owner is in an even position. Since the hamster owner cannot be in the first row (as it's occupied by Dubstep) or the second row (as it's occupied by the car driver), the hamster owner must be in the third row.

17. From rule 17, we know that the argentine is to the left of the rock fan. Since the rock fan is in the sixth row, the argentine must be in the fifth row.

18. From rule 18, we know that the magic-tricks person is to the right of the gospel fan. Since the gospel fan cannot be in the fifth row (as it's occupied by the argentine), the gospel fan must be in the fourth row. So, let's place Gospel in the fourth row, third column. This means Magic-tricks must be in the fifth row, third column.

19. From rule 19, we know that the magic-tricks person is to the right of the 7up drinker. Since the 7up drinker is in the first row, the magic-tricks person must be in the second row. But the magic-tricks person cannot be in the first or fifth column (as they are occupied by Dubstep and Goat respectively), so the magic-tricks person must be in the fourth column.

20. From rule 20, we know that the goat owner is to the left of the lizard owner. This is already satisfied as we placed Goat in the first row, fifth column and Lizard in the second row, second column.

21. From rule 21, we know that the camping person is between the British and the Russian. Since the British is not in the first row (as it's occupied by Dubstep) and the Russian is in the third row, the camping person must be in the second row. But the camping person cannot be in the first or fifth column (as they are occupied by 7up and Goat respectively), so the camping person must be in the fourth column.

22. From rule 22, we know that the snake owner is to the right of the milk drinker. Since the milk drinker is in the second row, the snake owner must be in the third row. But the snake owner cannot be in the first or fifth column (as they are occupied by Dubstep and Goat respectively), so the snake owner must be in the second column.

23. From rule 23, we know that the airplane driver is to the right of the boat driver. Since the boat driver cannot be in the first row (as it's occupied by Dubstep) or the second row (as it's occupied by the car driver), the boat driver must be in the third row. So, let's place Boat in the third row, fourth column. This means Airplane must be in the third row, fifth column.

24. From rule 24, we know that the boat driver is to the left of the Canadian. Since the Canadian is in the first row, the boat driver must be in the second row. But the boat driver cannot be in the first or fifth column (as they are occupied by 7up and Goat respectively), so the boat driver must be in the fourth column.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

Lv5-6x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them P1 to P5 from left to right.

2. From point 9, we know the fan of indie is in the middle (P3). Let's place indie in the third row.

3. From point 16, we know the person driving the skateboard is in the middle (P3). Since the fan of indie is already in P3, the skateboard must be driven by P1 or P5. Let's place skateboard in P1 for now.

4. From point 17, we know the person drinking milk is the person driving the quad-bike. Since the skateboard is in P1, the milk must be in P5. So, milk is in P5 and quad-bike is in P5.

5. From point 18, we know the person watching satire movies is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda is not yet placed, we can't place satire movies yet. However, we know satire is to the left of P5 (mirinda).

6. From point 21, we know the person watching satire movies is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person watching fantasy movies. Since satire is to the left of P5 (mirinda), and P5 is the only empty spot to the right of fantasy, satire must be in P4. So, satire is in P4 and iced-tea is to the left of P4.

7. From point 2, we know the American is somewhere to the right of P5 (train). Since P5 is already occupied, the American cannot be in the first four positions. So, the American must be in P5.

8. From point 4, we know the American is in an odd position. Since the American is in P5, this means P1, P3, and P5 are occupied.

9. From point 6, we know the colombian is to the right of P4 (iced-tea). Since P1, P3, and P5 are occupied, the colombian must be in P2.

10. From point 8, we know coffee is on the left or right of the colombian. Since the colombian is in P2, coffee can be in P1 or P3. However, from point 23, we know the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard (P1). Since coffee is in P1, it cannot be the fan of folk. So, coffee must be in P3.

11. From point 11, we know the turkish is watching fantasy movies. Since satire is in P4 and fantasy is to the right of satire, the turkish is in P5.

12. From point 12, we know the person watching documentary movies is to the left of the person playing badminton. Since the turkish is in P5 (fantasy), the person watching documentary movies must be in P1, P2, or P3. However, from point 13, we know the person playing badminton is to the left of the person driving the train (P5). So, the person watching documentary movies must be in P2.

13. From point 13, we know the person playing badminton is to the left of the person driving the train. Since the person watching documentary movies is in P2, the person playing badminton must be in P1.

14. From point 14, we know the person playing volleyball is to the left of the person playing badminton. Since the person playing badminton is in P1, the person playing volleyball must be in P2.
