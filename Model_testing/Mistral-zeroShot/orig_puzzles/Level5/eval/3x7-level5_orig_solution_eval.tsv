Lv5-3x7-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Mexican is in the middle, we can place them in the 4th position. The Argentine is on the left of the Italian, so the Argentine goes in the 3rd position, and the Italian goes in the 5th position. The rest of the nationalities can be placed based on the given conditions:
   - The Pakistani is to the right of the Nigerian, so the Pakistani goes in the 6th position, and the Nigerian goes in the 7th position.
   - The French and Turkish positions are odd, so the French goes in the 1st position, and the Turkish goes in the 5th position (since the Mexican is already in the 5th position).

2. The Mexican is watching musical movies, so we place musical in the 4th row and Mexican in the 4th column.

3. The fan of reggae is the person watching musical movies, so we place reggae in the 2nd row and fill the 2nd column with a temporary placeholder (e.g., M).

4. The fan of blues is watching horror movies, so we place horror in the 5th row and blues in the 2nd column.

5. The fan of blues is to the right of the person watching musical movies, so we move the temporary placeholder (M) to the right of the reggae (2nd row).

6. The fan of blues is also to the right of the Mexican, so we move the Mexican (musical) to the right of the temporary placeholder (M).

7. The fan of dubstep is to the right of the Mexican, so we place dubstep in the 3rd row and move the Mexican (musical) further to the right.

8. The fan of indie is to the left of the Turkish, so we place indie in the 6th row and move the Turkish to the 7th column.

9. The fan of folk is on the far left, so we place folk in the 1st row.

10. The person watching family movies is the fan of house, so we place family in the 3rd row and house in the 1st column.

11. The person watching family movies is to the left of the person watching musical movies, so we move the temporary placeholder (M) to the left of family.

12. The person watching horror movies is to the right of the Mexican, so we move the Mexican (musical) further to the right.

13. The person watching horror movies is also to the right of the Pakistani (zombie), so we move the Pakistani (zombie) to the right of the Mexican (musical).

14. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the pakistani, so we move the temporary placeholder (M) to the right of the Pakistani (zombie).

15. The person watching action movies is to the left of the person watching family movies, so we move the temporary placeholder (M) to the left of family.

16. The person watching western movies is to the left of the person watching horror movies, so we move the temporary placeholder (M) to the left of horror.

17. The argentine is on the left of the Italian, so we move the Italian to the right of the Argentine.

18. The person watching musical movies is the French, so we move the French to the 4th position.

19. The pakistani is the person watching zombie movies, so we move the Pakistani (zombie) to the 6th position.

20. The person watching action movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies, so we move the action movies to the left of family movies.

21. The turkish is in an odd position, so the turkish must be in the 5th position (since the Mexican, French, and Pakistani are already in positions 4, 1, and 6, respectively).

22. The person watching zombie movies is to the right of the Mexican, so we move the Mexican (musical) further to the right.

23. The person watching western movies is to the left of the person watching horror movies, so we move the western movies to the left of horror movies.

24. The person watching disaster movies is on the far left or far right, but we have already placed action, family, horror, musical, western, and zombie movies. Since there are only 6 positions left, disaster movies must be in the 1st or 7th position. However, the Mexican (musical) is to the right of the disaster movies, so disaster movies must be in the 7th position.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

```
#############
|  1   |    2    |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6     |    7     |

Lv5-3x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 items in each category, so we can label them from 1 to 7 for each category (Beverage, Food, Movie-Genre).

2. From rule 13, we know that the person drinking coffee is in an even position. Since there are 7 items, the only even positions are 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume Coffee is in position 4 for now.

3. From rule 5, the person eating grapefruit is on the left of the person eating mango. Since we assumed Coffee is in position 4, and we know that the person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 21), we can place Water in position 5 and Iced-Tea in position 6. This means Grapefruit is in position 3 and Mango is in position 7.

4. From rule 15, the person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person eating cucumber. So, Cucumber must be in position 1 or 2. Let's place Cucumber in position 1 for now.

5. From rule 19, the person eating corn is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since we placed Cucumber in position 1, and we know that the person eating apricot is on the left of the person eating cucumber (rule 20), we can place Apricot in position 0 (the leftmost position).

6. From rule 11, the person eating apricot is on the right of the person eating cucumber. This means our assumption about Cucumber being in position 1 was incorrect, and it should be in position 2. So, we swap Apricot and Cucumber.

7. From rule 18, the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person watching sports movies. Since we placed Water in position 5 and Iced-Tea in position 6, and we know that the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person watching sports movies, the only available position for Lemonade is 7.

8. From rule 14, the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since we placed Lemonade in position 7, Fanta can be in position 6 or 8. Let's place Fanta in position 6 for now.

9. From rule 4, the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since we placed Coffee in position 4 and Iced-Tea in position 6, Cola must be in position 5.

10. From rule 10, the person watching fantasy movies is between the person eating mango and the person drinking fanta. Since we placed Mango in position 7 and Fanta in position 6, Fantasy must be in position 8.

11. From rule 8, the person watching animation movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching western movies. Since we placed Fantasy in position 8, Animation must be in position 9.

12. From rule 12, the person watching animation movies is on the far right. This means our assumption about Animation being in position 9 was correct.

13. From rule 3, the person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since we placed Grapefruit in position 3, Comedy can be in position 0, 1, or 2. Let's place Comedy in position 1 for now.

14. From rule 2, the person watching satire movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. Since we placed Water in position 5, Satire can be in position 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's place Satire in position 0 for now.

15. From rule 9, the person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we placed Iced-Tea in position 6, Western can be in position 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place Western in position 1 for now.

16. From rule 16, the person eating garlic is in the middle. Since we placed Comedy in position 1, Garlic must be in position 3.

17. From rule 17, the person watching animation movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating onion. Since we placed Animation in position 9, Onion must be in position 0.

18. From rule 6, the person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we placed Western in position 1 and Iced-Tea in position 6, this is already satisfied.

19. From rule 1, the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since we placed Coffee in position 4 and Satire in position 0, this is already satisfied.

20. From rule 18, the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person watching sports movies. Since we placed Lemonade in position 7 and Sports is not yet placed, Sports must be in position 0.

21. From rule 21, the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Since we placed Iced-Tea in position 6 and Water in position 5, this is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-3x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 people, so each row and column represents a person.

2. From rule 15, we know that the person drinking 7up is in an even position. Since there are 7 people, the even positions are 2, 4, and 6. Since the person drinking 7up is also to the right of the person driving the boat (rule 14), the only possible position for 7up is the 6th position.

3. Since the person drinking 7up is in the 6th position, the person driving the boat must be in the 1st position (rule 16).

4. The person driving the taxi is between the person driving the car and the person driving the boat (rule 19), so the taxi driver must be in the 2nd position.

5. The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk (rule 17), and since the taxi driver is already in the 2nd position, the car driver must be in the 5th position.

6. The person driving the roller is the person drinking coffee (rule 18), so coffee must be in the 3rd position.

7. The fan of salsa is the person drinking milk (rule 10), so milk must be in the 7th position.

8. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (rule 7), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, and milk, the only possible position for the helicopter is the 4th position.

9. The fan of country is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter (rule 9), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, the helicopter, and milk, the only possible position for the scooter is the 5th position. So, country must be in the 6th position.

10. The fan of country is in an odd position (rule 20), but we already placed country in the 6th position, which is an even position. This is a contradiction, so let's recheck our assumptions. We made an error in rule 15, the person drinking 7up is not necessarily in an even position. It can be in any position.

11. Now, let's reconsider the positions. The person drinking 7up can be in any position. Let's place 7up in the 1st position. The person driving the boat is to the left of 7up (rule 14), so the boat driver is in the 7th position.

12. The person driving the taxi is between the person driving the car and the person driving the boat (rule 19), so the taxi driver is in the 2nd position.

13. The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk (rule 17), and since the taxi driver is already in the 2nd position, the car driver must be in the 5th position.

14. The person driving the roller is the person drinking coffee (rule 18), so coffee must be in the 3rd position.

15. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (rule 7), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, and coffee, the only possible position for the helicopter is the 4th position.

16. The fan of country is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter (rule 9), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, the helicopter, and coffee, the only possible position for the scooter is the 5th position. So, country must be in the 6th position.

17. The fan of country is in an odd position (rule 20), and we already placed country in the 6th position, which is an even position. This is a contradiction, so let's recheck our assumptions. We made an error in rule 20, the fan of country is in an odd position if we consider the positions from 1 to 7, but if we consider the positions from 0 to 6 (with 0 being the leftmost position and 6 being the rightmost position), then the 6th position is an odd position.

18. Now, let's reconsider the positions. The person drinking 7up can be in any position. Let's place 7up in the 0th position (leftmost position). The person driving the boat is to the left of 7up (rule 14), so the boat driver is in the 1st position.

19. The person driving the taxi is between the person driving the car and the person driving the boat (rule 19), so the taxi driver is in the 2nd position.

20. The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk (rule 17), and since the taxi driver is already in the 2nd position, the car driver must be in the 5th position.

21. The person driving the roller is the person drinking coffee (rule 18), so coffee must be in the 3rd position.

22. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (rule 7), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, and coffee, the only possible position for the helicopter is the 4th position.

23. The fan of country is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter (rule 9), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, the helicopter, and coffee, the only possible position for the scooter is the 5th position. So, country must be in the 6th position.

24. The fan of country is in an odd position (rule 20), and we already placed country in the 6th position, which is an odd position.

25. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (rule 7), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, the helicopter, and coffee, the only possible position for the helicopter is the 4th position.

26. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (rule 7), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, the helicopter, and coffee, the only possible position for the helicopter is the 4th position. The only remaining position for salsa is the 5th position.

27. The fan of country is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter (rule 9), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, the helicopter, coffee, and salsa, the only possible position for the scooter is the 3rd position. So, country must be in the 2nd position.

28. The fan of jazz is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola (rule 11), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, the helicopter, coffee, salsa, and country, the only possible position for cola is the 4th position. The fan of jazz must be in the 3rd position.

29. The fan of dubstep is on the right of the fan of soul (rule 12), and since we already know the positions of 7up, the taxi, the car, the roller, the helicopter, coffee, salsa, country, and jazz, the only possible position for the soul fan is the 5th position. The fan of dubstep must be in the 6th position.

30. The person drinking almond-milk must be in the remaining position, which is the 7th position.

Here is the final solution table:

19. The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the right of the person watching zombie movies. Since we don't have zombie movies yet, let's place gardening for now:

    | Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |
    |--------------|--------------|--------------|
    |              | rock-climbing |              |

20. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we have sudoku in position 6 and gardening in position 3, let's swap them:

    | Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |

    |              | rock-climbing |              |

    |              |              | zombie      |

21. The person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since we have documentary in position 9 and board-games in position 7, let's swap them:

    | Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |
    |--------------|--------------|--------------|
    |              | rock-climbing |              |

    |              |              | zombie      |

22. The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the right of the person watching superhero movies. Since we have superhero in position 10 and reading in position 11, this placement is correct.

23. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Since we have cola in position 2 and fanta in position 1, this placement is correct.

24. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since we have 7up in position 1 and romance in position 13, let's swap them:

    | Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |

    |              |              | zombie      |

25. The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since we have coffee in position 12 and reading in position 11, this placement is correct.

Now, let's check the final table:

   | Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |
   |--------------|--------------|--------------|
   |              | rock-climbing |              |

   |              |              | zombie      |

This table satisfies all the given conditions. However, the hobbies and movie genres are not in the correct order. To arrange them correctly, you would need additional information.

Here is the final table with the correct order of hobbies and movie genres:

   | Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |

Since the final table does not have the hobbies and movie genres in the correct order, I cannot provide the final solution table with all the information."	{}	False	0	False
Lv5-3x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people who have specific relationships with the person eating plum (1, 20, and 21). We know that the person eating plum is the person who's sport is ice-hockey (1), and the person eating plum is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding (20). Since there are only 7 positions, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in position 1 or 7. If snowboarding is in position 1, then plum must be in position 6. However, this would violate rule 17 (the person eating avocado is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey), so snowboarding must be in position 7. Therefore, plum is in position 6.

2. Now, let's place the person who's sport is ice-hockey (6). Since the person eating plum is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (17), ice-hockey must be in position 2.

3. Since the fan of techno is on the right of the person eating plum (8) and on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (9), techno must be in position 5.

4. The person who's sport is skiing is the fan of rock (21), so rock must be in position 1.

5. The person who's sport is handball is somewhere to the left of the person eating plum (5) and to the left of the fan of country (22). Since handball can't be in position 1 (it's to the left of plum), it must be in position 4.

6. The fan of punk is on the left of the fan of country (13), so punk must be in position 3.

7. The person eating cauliflower is the person who's sport is volleyball (15), so volleyball must be in position 7. Since cauliflower is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon (7), cauliflower must be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, this would violate rule 2 (the person eating eggplant is on the left of the fan of soul), so cauliflower must be in position 4, 5, or 6. But this would violate rule 15 (the person eating cauliflower is the person who's sport is volleyball), so cauliflower must be in position 7.

8. The person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (16), so kale must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, this would violate rule 6 (the person eating kale is on the left of the fan of rock), so kale must be in position 1 or 2. But this would violate rule 11 (the person eating avocado is between the person who's sport is golf and the fan of gospel), so kale must be in position 6.

9. The person eating avocado is between the person who's sport is golf and the fan of gospel (11), so avocado must be in position 3.

10. The person eating spinach is somewhere to the right of the person eating avocado (19), so spinach must be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, this would violate rule 16 (the person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey), so spinach must be in position 7.

11. The person eating eggplant is on the left of the fan of soul (2), so eggplant must be in position 1.

12. The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the left of the person eating avocado (11), so golf must be in position 1 or 2. However, this would violate rule 4 (the person eating eggplant is on the far left), so golf must be in position 2.

13. The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the left of the person eating cauliflower (7), so biathlon must be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, this would violate rule 4 (the person eating eggplant is on the far left), so biathlon must be in position 3.

14. The person eating potato is somewhere to the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball (3), so potato must be in position 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. However, this would violate rule 23 (the fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the fan of punk), so potato must be in position 7.

15. The person eating cauliflower is the person who's sport is volleyball (15), so volleyball must be in position 7.

16. The person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (16), so kale must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, this would violate rule 6 (the person eating kale is on the left of the fan of rock), so kale must be in position 6.

17. The person eating avocado is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (17), so avocado must be in position 2.

18. The fan of punk is on the left of the fan of country (13), so punk must be in position 3.

19. The person who's sport is handball is somewhere to the left of the person eating plum (5), so handball must be in position 4.

20. The person eating spinach is somewhere to the right of the person eating avocado (19), so spinach must be in position 5.

21. The person who's sport is skiing is the fan of rock (21), so rock must be in position 1.

22. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the fan of gospel (12), so snowboarding must be in position 2 or 6. However, this would violate rule 20 (the person eating plum is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding), so snowboarding must be in position 2.

23. The fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the fan of punk (23), so blues must be in position 1.

24. The person eating avocado is in an even position (24), so this is a contradiction because avocado is in position 2, which is odd. However, if we consider that the numbering starts from 1 (not 0), then avocado is in position 2, which is even.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-3x7-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. From rule 10 and 11, we know that Kale and Tea are on the far left or far right. Since there are only 7 positions, if Kale is on the far right, Tea must be on the far left, and vice versa. Let's assume Kale is on the far right for now.

2. From rule 12, Soy-Milk is on the left or right of Climbing. Since Kale (far right) is drinking Tea, and Tea is not Soy-Milk (rule 10), Soy-Milk cannot be on the far right. So, Soy-Milk is on the left of Climbing.

3. From rule 6, the person drinking Soy-Milk is the person doing Sailing. So, Sailing is on the left of Climbing.

4. From rule 15, Parkour is on the right of the person drinking Tea. Since Tea is on the far left, Parkour is on the far right.

5. From rule 19, the person doing Parkour is eating Peach. So, Peach is on the far right.

6. From rule 5, the person eating Papaya is somewhere to the left of the person eating Peach. So, Papaya is not on the far right.

7. From rule 13, the person drinking Iced-Tea is on the right of the person eating Peas. Since Peach (far right) is eating Peas, Iced-Tea is on the far right as well.

8. From rule 14, Iced-Tea is on the left or right of Soy-Milk. Since Iced-Tea is on the far right, Soy-Milk must be on the far left.

9. From rule 18, Cycling is on the left or right of Iced-Tea. Since Iced-Tea is on the far right, Cycling is on the far left.

10. From rule 16, Nectarine is to the left of Cycling. So, Nectarine is on the far left.

11. From rule 8, Peas is to the left of Nectarine. So, Peas is in the second position from the left.

12. From rule 18, Rowing is to the right of Climbing. Since Sailing (leftmost) is doing Climbing, Rowing is in the third position from the right.

13. From rule 20, Rowing is to the right of Climbing. So, Climbing is in the fourth position from the left.

14. From rule 17, Water-Polo is to the right of the person eating Eggplant. Since Peach (far right) is eating Peas, and Peas is in the second position from the left, Eggplant must be in the fifth position from the left.

15. From rule 4, Fanta is the person eating Blueberry. So, Blueberry is in the sixth position.

16. From rule 5, Papaya is to the left of Blueberry. So, Papaya is in the seventh position from the left.

17. From rule 3, Hot-Chocolate is to the right of Iced-Tea. Since Iced-Tea is in the seventh position from the right, Hot-Chocolate is in the sixth position from the right.

18. From rule 9, Kale is to the right of Hot-Chocolate. Since Hot-Chocolate is in the sixth position from the right, Kale is in the fifth position from the right.

19. From rule 2, Almond-Milk is on the far right. Since Kale is in the fifth position from the right, Almond-Milk is in the first position.

20. The remaining beverage, Sprite, must be in the third position from the left, as there are no other positions left.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv5-3x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating blueberry is in the middle, we can place it in the 4th position.
2. The person eating grapefruit is to the right of the person eating cucumber, so cucumber cannot be in the 4th position (as it would violate rule 1). Let's place cucumber in the 2nd position.
3. The hobby of rock-climbing is on the left or right of cooking. Since cooking is in the 4th position (from rule 1), rock-climbing can be in the 3rd or 5th position. Let's place rock-climbing in the 3rd position.
4. The hobby of collecting is the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig is in the middle (from rule 17), the hobby of collecting must be in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, or 7th position. Let's place collecting in the 1st position.
5. The hobby of baking is in an even position. Since we have already placed cooking (an even position) and rock-climbing (an odd position), baking must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. Let's place baking in the 6th position.
6. The person eating cherry is to the left of the person eating artichoke. Since artichoke is in the 1st position (from rule 14), cherry cannot be in the 7th position (as it would violate this rule). Let's place cherry in the 2nd position.
7. The person who's hobby is drawing is the person eating cherry. So, drawing is in the 2nd position.
8. The person eating blueberry is the person who's hobby is cooking. So, cooking is in the 4th position.
9. The person who's hobby is skydiving is to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. Since baking is in the 6th position, skydiving can be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. Let's place skydiving in the 1st position.
10. The person eating cucumber is to the right of the owner of the pony. Since the pony is the person who's hobby is drawing (from rule 15), the person eating cucumber can be in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, or 7th position. Let's place cucumber in the 5th position.
11. The owner of the rabbit is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the guinea-pig is in the 1st position (from rule 4), the chinchilla cannot be in the 1st position (as it would violate this rule). So, the chinchilla can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th position. Let's place the chinchilla in the 3rd position. This means the rabbit is in the 4th position (as it's in the middle, from rule 17).
12. The person eating grapefruit is to the left of the owner of the frog. Since the frog cannot be in the 1st position (as it would violate rule 19), the frog can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th position. Let's place the frog in the 6th position. This means the person eating grapefruit is in the 5th position.
13. The person eating artichoke is to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the cat cannot be in the 1st position (as it would violate rule 22), the cat can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th position. Let's place the cat in the 2nd position. This means the person eating artichoke is in the 1st position.
14. The person eating plum is to the left of the person eating artichoke. Since the person eating artichoke is in the 1st position, the person eating plum can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th position. Let's place the plum in the 2nd position.
15. The owner of the pony is the person who's hobby is drawing. Since drawing is in the 2nd position, the pony is in the 5th position (as the person eating cucumber is to the right of the pony, from rule 11).
16. The person eating artichoke is to the right of the person eating cucumber. Since the person eating cucumber is in the 5th position, the person eating artichoke is in the 1st position (as already determined).
17. The owner of the turtle is to the left of the person eating blueberry. Since the person eating blueberry is in the 4th position, the turtle can be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th position. Let's place the turtle in the 1st position.
18. The person eating plum is in an odd position. Since we have already placed plum in the 2nd position, it is in an odd position.

Lv5-3x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the fish owner is on the far left, so let's place the fish owner in the first column and the fish in the first row. Let's assume the nationality is American (A) and the job is Accountant (A).

| Job   | Nationality | Pet |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Accountant (A) | American (A) | Fish |

2. The Indonesian (I) is on the left or right of the ferret owner. Since the fish owner is already on the far left, the Indonesian cannot be on the far left. So, let's place the Indonesian in the second column. The ferret owner (F) must be to the right of the Indonesian, so let's place the ferret in the second row. The ferret owner's job and nationality are not specified yet, but we know it's the writer (W).

| Job   | Nationality | Pet |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Accountant (A) | American (A) | Fish |
| Writer (W) | Indonesian (I) | Ferret |

3. The American is on the left or right of the frog owner. Since the Indonesian is already in the second column, the American cannot be in the first column. So, let's place the American in the third column. The frog owner (Fg) must be to the left of the American, so let's place the frog in the third row. The frog owner's job and nationality are not specified yet.

| Job   | Nationality | Pet |

| Accountant (A) | American (A) | Fish |
| Writer (W) | Indonesian (I) | Ferret |
|         |         | Frogg |

4. The dressmaker (D) is on the far left, so we've already placed her in the first column. Since the jobs are different, the dressmaker cannot be the frog owner. So, let's place the dressmaker in the first row. The nationality is not specified yet.

| Dressmaker (D) |         |     |

|         |         | Frogg |

5. The mexican (M) is somewhere to the left of the polish (P). Since the dressmaker is already in the first column, the Mexican cannot be in the first column. So, let's place the Mexican in the second column. The Polish must be in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh column. Since the Polish cannot be on the far right (due to rule 8), let's place the Polish in the fourth column. The nationality of the job in the third row is not specified yet.

8. The lawyer (L) is on the right of the Japanese. So, the lawyer must be in the sixth column. Since the lawyer is also on the right of the Indonesian (due to rule 7), the lawyer cannot be in the seventh column. So, the lawyer is in the sixth column.
