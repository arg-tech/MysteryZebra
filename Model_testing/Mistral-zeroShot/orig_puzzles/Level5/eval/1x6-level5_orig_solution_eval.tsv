Lv5-1x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the boat is in an even position and to the left of the person driving the snowmobile (which is also in an even position), the boat must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, since the airplane is on the far right, the boat cannot be in position 6. So, the boat is either in position 2 or 4.

2. If the boat is in position 2, then the snowmobile must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the person driving the subway is to the left of the bus and the bus is to the left of the snowmobile, the snowmobile cannot be in position 1. So, the boat is in position 4, and the snowmobile is in position 5.

3. Now, the bus must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the subway is to the left of the bus, the bus cannot be in position 3. So, the bus is in position 1, and the subway is in position 2.

4. The motorbike must be in an odd position, so it can be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the boat is to the left of the motorbike, the motorbike cannot be in position 2. So, the motorbike is in position 5, and the airplane is in position 6.

5. Now, the only remaining transport is the boat (position 4), bus (position 1), subway (position 2), motorbike (position 5), and airplane (position 6). The remaining positions are for the boat, bus, subway, motorbike, and airplane in that order from left to right.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-1x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobby of hiking is either to the left or right of drawing. Let's assume hiking is to the left of drawing (otherwise, we can swap the positions of hiking and drawing later).

2. Gardening is to the left of puzzles. Since puzzles are in an even position, and we know hiking is to the left of drawing, gardening cannot be in the first position. So, gardening must be in the second position.

3. Now, we know that gardening is to the right of drawing. Since we already placed gardening in the second position, drawing must be in the first position.

4. Video-games are to the left of hiking. Since hiking is in the first position (as we assumed), video-games must be in the third position.

5. Puzzles are in an even position, so they must be in the fourth position.

6. Writing is to the right of video-games, so writing must be in the sixth position.

7. Now, hiking is in the first position, and we know that video-games are to the left of hiking. So, hiking cannot be in the last position. Therefore, hiking must be in the fifth position.

8. Finally, since gardening is to the left of puzzles and we know their positions, puzzles must be in the third position.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| Drawing   | Gardening | Hiking   | Puzzles | Video-games | Writing  |

Lv5-1x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the subway is either on the far left or far right, and the boat is to the right of the subway, the boat cannot be in the first or last position. So, the boat can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. The trike is to the left of the train, so the train cannot be in the first position.

3. The helicopter is on the far left or far right, and the subway is also on the far left or far right. Since the subway is to the right of the boat, the helicopter cannot be to the right of the boat. So, the helicopter can only be in positions 1, 2, or 6.

4. The subway is in a far left or far right position, and the boat is to the right of the subway. So, the subway cannot be in the first or last position.

5. The snowmobile is to the left of the trike. Since the trike is to the left of the train, the snowmobile cannot be in the last position.

6. Now, let's place the subway. Since it cannot be in the first or last position, and it is to the right of the boat, the only possible positions for the subway are 3, 4, or 5. If the subway is in position 3, the boat must be in position 2, the helicopter can be in position 1, the trike in position 6, the train in position 5, and the snowmobile in position 4. If the subway is in position 4, the boat must be in position 3, the helicopter can be in position 1, the trike in position 5, the train in position 6, and the snowmobile in position 2. If the subway is in position 5, the boat must be in position 4, the helicopter can be in position 1, the trike in position 3, the train in position 6, and the snowmobile in position 2.

7. Since the subway is somewhere to the right of the boat, the subway cannot be in position 3 (as it would violate rule 5). So, the subway can only be in positions 4 or 5. If the subway is in position 4, the boat must be in position 3, the helicopter can be in position 1, the trike in position 5, the train in position 6, and the snowmobile in position 2. If the subway is in position 5, the boat must be in position 4, the helicopter can be in position 1, the trike in position 3, the train in position 6, and the snowmobile in position 2.

8. The only possible solution is when the subway is in position 4 and the boat is in position 3.

Final solution:

Lv5-1x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the horse owner is either to the left or right of the frog owner, and the frog owner is to the right of the rat owner, we can't have the horse owner as the first or second person (as the rat owner would be the first or second, and the horse owner would have to be the third, which violates the odd position rule for the frog owner). So, the horse owner is either the fourth, fifth, or sixth person.

2. The frog owner is to the right of the rat owner, so the rat owner can't be the first or second person. The rat owner can't be the fourth person because the frog owner must be in an odd position, and the fourth position is even. So, the rat owner is either the third, fifth, or sixth person.

3. The lizard owner is to the left of the snake owner. Since the horse owner can't be the first or second person, the snake owner can't be the second person (as the horse owner would have to be the first, which violates the lizard owner being to the left of the snake owner). So, the snake owner is either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth person.

4. The fish owner is on the far left, so they are the first person.

5. The rat owner can't be the first or second person, so they can't be the third person (as the snake owner would have to be the second, which violates the lizard owner being to the left of the snake owner). So, the rat owner is either the fourth, fifth, or sixth person.

6. The frog owner is in an odd position, so they can't be the second, fourth, or sixth person (as those are even positions). So, the frog owner is the third person.

7. The horse owner can't be the first or second person, so they can't be the third person (as the frog owner would have to be the second, which violates the frog owner being to the right of the rat owner). So, the horse owner is either the fifth or sixth person.

8. Since the lizard owner is to the right of the horse owner, the horse owner can't be the sixth person (as the sixth position is the last position, and there are no positions left to the right for the lizard owner). So, the horse owner is the fifth person.

9. The rat owner can't be the first or second person, so they can't be the third person (as the frog owner would have to be the second, which violates the frog owner being to the right of the rat owner). The rat owner can't be the fourth person (as the lizard owner would have to be the third, which violates the lizard owner being to the left of the snake owner). So, the rat owner is the fifth person.

10. The snake owner can't be the first or second person, so they can't be the third person (as the lizard owner would have to be the second, which violates the lizard owner being to the left of the snake owner). The snake owner can't be the fourth person (as the frog owner would have to be the third, which violates the frog owner being to the right of the rat owner). So, the snake owner is the sixth person.

11. The lizard owner can't be the first or second person, so they can't be the third person (as the frog owner would have to be the second, which violates the frog owner being to the right of the rat owner). The lizard owner can't be the fourth person (as the fish owner is already there). So, the lizard owner is the sixth person.

Lv5-1x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the American is to the right of the Canadian, and the Spanish is to the left of the Canadian, we know that the Spanish cannot be in the first position, and the American cannot be in the last position. So, the Spanish cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6. The American cannot be in positions 4 or 6.

2. The French is to the right of the Canadian, so the French cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

3. The Australian is in an even position, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the Australian is to the right of the Spanish, the Australian cannot be in position 2.

4. Now we know that the Australian is in position 4, and the Spanish is to the right of the Australian, so the Spanish must be in position 5.

5. The French is to the right of the Canadian, so the French must be in position 6.

6. The only remaining nationality for position 1 is the Canadian, and the only remaining nationality for position 3 is the American.

Lv5-1x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person eating lettuce (L) is on the left of the person eating peas (P). Let's denote the positions as L-1 and P-2 (since positions start from 1).

2. From rule 2, the person eating broccoli (B) is on the right of the person eating peas, so B-3.

3. From rule 4, the person eating spinach (S) is on the left or right of B. If S were on the left of B, it would have to be in position 1, but that's where L is, so S must be on the right of B, so S-4.

4. From rule 3, the person eating pepper (Pp) is in an even position. Since we already placed P and B, Pp can only be in position 2 or 6. But from rule 7, P is on the right of L, so Pp can't be in position 2. Therefore, Pp-6.

5. From rule 5, L is somewhere to the left of S. Since L is in position 1 and S is in position 4, this rule is satisfied.

6. From rule 6, L is somewhere to the left of Cucumber (C). Since L is in position 1 and S is in position 4, C can only be in position 5.

7. From rule 7, P is on the right of L, so C can't be in position 2 (since that would place P in position 3, violating rule 2). Therefore, C-5.

8. From rule 8, L is somewhere to the left of C. Since L is in position 1 and C is in position 5, this rule is satisfied.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv5-1x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking water is to the right of the person drinking tea. So, we can place tea and water in the last two positions (4 and 6).

2. Since the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person drinking water, sprite must be in one of the positions 1, 2, 3. But if sprite were in position 1, it would be to the left of tea, which contradicts rule 2. So, sprite must be in positions 2 or 3. Let's place sprite in position 2 for now.

3. Now, the person drinking tea is to the left of the person drinking sprite. So, tea must be in position 1.

4. The person drinking milk is to the left of the person drinking tea. So, milk must be in position 0 (to the left of the table).

5. The person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, and 5, cola can only be in positions 0 or 4. But if cola were in position 0, it would be to the left of milk, which contradicts rule 4. So, cola must be in position 4.

6. The person drinking water is to the left of the person drinking cola. So, water must be in position 5.

7. The person drinking fanta is to the left of the person drinking cola. So, fanta must be in position 3.

Lv5-1x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person eating potato is the same person, so we can fill in the potato in one cell. Let's put it in the first column for now.

2. From rule 2, we know that the person eating peach is to the right of the person eating lettuce. Since we already have the potato, let's put the lettuce to the left of it.

3. From rule 3, the person eating broccoli is to the right of the person eating peach. Since we don't have the peach yet, we can't place the broccoli for now.

4. From rule 4, the person eating cucumber is to the left of the person eating onion. Since we don't have the onion yet, we can't place the cucumber for now.

5. From rule 5, the person eating potato is to the left of the person eating peach. Since we already have the potato and lettuce, we can place the peach to the right of the lettuce.

6. From rule 6, the person eating potato is to the left of the person eating lettuce, but we already have them in the correct order. No action needed.

7. From rule 7, the person eating cucumber is to the right of the person eating broccoli. Since we don't have the broccoli yet, we can't place the cucumber for now.

Now we have the positions of potato and lettuce, and we know that peach is to the right of lettuce. Let's try to place the remaining three foods (broccoli, cucumber, onion) based on the remaining rules.

8. From rule 3, the person eating broccoli is to the right of the person eating peach. Since we have peach in the second position, we can place broccoli in the third position.

3. From point 4, we know that almond-milk is to the left of water. So, almond-milk must be in the second position.
4. Now, since almond-milk is to the left of water, and water is between mirinda and almond-milk, mirinda must be in the third position.
5. From point 1, we know that coffee is to the right of milk. Since almond-milk is in the second position, milk cannot be in the first position. So, milk must be in the fourth position.

2. The adventure movie watcher is to the left of the spy movie watcher. Since we already have two people on the left, the only option for the spy movie watcher is spot 3. So, Adventure (3) is to the left of Spy (4).

3. The documentary movie watcher is either to the left or right of the thriller movie watcher. Since we have already placed the thriller movie watcher, the only option for the documentary movie watcher is spot 5. So, Documentary (5) is either to the left or right of Thriller (2).

4. The family movie watcher is on the right of the horror movie watcher. Since we have already placed the horror movie watcher, the only option for the family movie watcher is spot 6. So, Family (6) is to the right of Horror (2).

5. Now, let's check the positions of the documentary movie watcher. Since the family movie watcher is to the right of the horror movie watcher, and the family movie watcher is to the right of the documentary movie watcher, the only possible position for the documentary movie watcher is to the left of the thriller movie watcher (position 1). So, Documentary (1) and Thriller (2) swap places.

6. Now, let's check the positions of the adventure movie watcher. Since the adventure movie watcher is to the left of the spy movie watcher, and the adventure movie watcher is to the right of the family movie watcher, the only possible position for the adventure movie watcher is spot 4.
