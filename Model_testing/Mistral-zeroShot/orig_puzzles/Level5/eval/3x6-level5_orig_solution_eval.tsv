Lv5-3x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the software-developer and the accountant are on the far left or far right, they can't be in positions 2, 3, or 4. So, they must be in positions 1, 5, or 6. Let's assume the software-developer is in position 1 and the accountant is in position 6 (this will help us solve other constraints).

2. Now, the person watching romance movies is between the software-developer and the person watching family movies. So, the person watching family movies must be in position 3 or 5. If it's in position 3, then the person watching romance movies is in position 2. But this would mean the software-developer is in position 2, which contradicts our assumption. So, the person watching family movies is in position 5. This means the person watching romance movies is in position 4.

3. The person watching drama movies is the mechanic. Since the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person watching animation movies, the person watching animation movies must be in position 1 (as the accountant is in position 6). So, the mechanic is in position 2.

4. The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the accountant (who is drinking hot-chocolate) is in position 6, the person drinking fanta can only be in position 5 or 6. But since the person watching family movies is in position 5, the person drinking fanta must be in position 6.

5. The person drinking juice is the person drinking juice. So, the person drinking juice is in position 3.

6. The person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the mechanic (who is watching drama movies) is in position 2, the person watching spy movies can be in position 1 or 3. But since the person watching spy movies is on the right of the freelancer (who is to the right of the photographer), the person watching spy movies can't be in position 1. So, the person watching spy movies is in position 3.

7. The freelancer is somewhere to the right of the photographer. Since the person watching spy movies is in position 3, the photographer must be in position 4. This means the freelancer is in position 5.

8. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 6, the person drinking soy-milk can be in position 5 or 6. But since the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies, it must be in position 5.

9. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is in position 5, the person drinking soy-milk is in position 4.

10. The social-worker is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 6, the social-worker can be in position 5 or 6. But since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 4, the social-worker must be in position 6.

11. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the accountant (who is drinking hot-chocolate) is in position 6, the person drinking milk can be in position 5 or 6. But since the person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, it must be in position 5.

12. The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking milk is in position 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 6.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv5-3x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 13, the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left. Let's place it in position 1 (Beverage 1).
2. From rule 11, the person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking sprite and the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea is in position 1, let's place sprite in position 3 (Beverage 3) and mirinda in position 2 (Beverage 2).
3. From rule 7, the person drinking sprite is in an odd position. Since it's already in position 3 (Beverage 3), the next odd positions are 1, 5, and 6. Since the iced-tea is in position 1, let's place water in position 5 (Beverage 5).
4. From rule 14, the person drinking water is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since water is in position 5 (Beverage 5), the person driving the scooter must be in an even position. The even positions are 2, 4, and 6. Since the scooter can't be in position 6 (Transport 6) due to rule 18, it must be in position 4 (Transport 4). Let's place the scooter in Transport 4.
5. From rule 15, the person eating lime is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. Since lime can't be in position 1 (Food 1) due to rule 8, it must be in position 2 (Food 2). Let's place lime in Food 2.
6. From rule 16, the person eating asparagus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter is in position 4 (Transport 4), asparagus can't be in position 1 (Food 1) due to rule 8. So, asparagus must be in position 3 (Food 3). Let's place asparagus in Food 3.
7. From rule 10, the person eating asparagus is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since asparagus is in position 3 (Food 3), the motorbike must be in an even position. The even positions are 2, 4, and 6. Since the motorbike can't be in position 6 (Transport 6) due to rule 18, it must be in position 4 (Transport 4). However, this conflicts with the scooter being in position 4. Since the scooter is already placed, the motorbike must be in position 2 (Transport 2). Let's place the motorbike in Transport 2.
8. From rule 12, the person driving the car is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since almond-milk can't be in position 1 (Beverage 1) due to rule 13, it must be in position 2 (Beverage 2). Since the motorbike is in position 2 (Transport 2), the car must be in position 1 (Transport 1). Let's place the car in Transport 1.
9. From rule 17, the person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car. This is already satisfied since the motorbike is in position 2 (Transport 2) and the car is in position 1 (Transport 1).
10. From rule 9, the person eating pumpkin is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter is in position 4 (Transport 4), let's place pumpkin in Food 6.
11. From rule 4, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person eating asparagus. Since asparagus is in position 3 (Food 3), almond-milk can be in position 2 (Beverage 2) or position 4 (Beverage 4). However, since water is already in position 5 (Beverage 5), almond-milk must be in position 4 (Beverage 4). Let's place almond-milk in Beverage 4.
12. From rule 1, the person eating lime is on the right of the person eating orange. Since lime is in position 2 (Food 2) and asparagus is in position 3 (Food 3), orange must be in position 1 (Food 1). Let's place orange in Food 1.
13. From rule 19, the person driving the boat is in an even position. Since the boat is not mentioned yet, let's place it in position 6 (Transport 6).
14. From rule 14, the person drinking water is on the right of the person driving the scooter. This is already satisfied since water is in position 5 (Beverage 5) and the scooter is in position 4 (Transport 4).
15. From rule 18, the person driving the trike is on the far left. Since the iced-tea is already in position 1 (Beverage 1), the trike must be in position 6 (Transport 6). Let's place the trike in Transport 6.

Lv5-3x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating grapefruit is to the left of the person driving the skateboard (#3), and the person eating onion is on the far left (#6), the person driving the skateboard must be eating pineapple. So, let's place the skateboard and pineapple in the table:

   |             |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |     5      |       6       |

2. The person eating pineapple is somewhere to the right of the person eating banana (#2 and #5), so banana must be in column 1 or 2. Since the person driving the skateboard is eating pineapple (#3), banana can't be in column 3. So, let's place banana in column 1:

   |             |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |     5      |       6       |

Lv5-3x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 13, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the far left. Let's place sprite in position 1.

2. From point 16, we know that the person watching romance movies is the person driving the bus. Since there are only 6 positions and we already have one filled, the person watching romance movies must be in position 6 (since positions are numbered from 1 to 6).

3. From point 14, we know that the person watching romance movies is in an odd position. This means it cannot be in position 2, 4, or 6 (since those are even). So, it must be in position 3 or 5. However, from point 2, we know that the person watching mystery movies is to the right of the person driving the subway, and from point 16, we know that the person watching romance movies is the person driving the bus. Since the bus is in position 6, the subway must be in position 5. This means the person watching romance movies cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 5.

4. From point 15, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since we know the position of the person watching romance movies (position 5), the person watching superhero movies must be to the right of position 5, which means it can only be in position 6. So, the person drinking soy-milk is in position 4.

5. From point 10, we know that the person drinking juice is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since we know the position of the person drinking sprite (position 1), the person drinking almond-milk must be to the right of position 1, which means it can only be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, from point 8, we know that the person drinking juice is the person watching disaster movies. Since we know the position of the person watching romance movies (position 5), the person watching disaster movies cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But from point 11, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking fanta, and we know the position of the person drinking sprite (position 1). This means the person drinking fanta must be to the right of position 1, which means it can only be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But from point 10, we know that the person drinking juice is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk, and we know the position of the person drinking sprite (position 1) and the person drinking fanta (position 2). This means the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3 or 4. However, from point 4, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the far left or far right. Since we know the position of the person watching romance movies (position 5), the person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 1 or 6. But from point 1, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies, and we know the position of the person watching superhero movies (position 6). This means the person driving the taxi cannot be in position 6. So, the person driving the taxi must be in position 1, which means the person watching mystery movies must be in position 6. This means the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 4.

6. From point 11, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since we know the position of the person driving the taxi (position 1), the person drinking fanta must be to the right of position 1, which means it can only be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But from point 10, we know that the person drinking juice is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk, and we know the position of the person drinking sprite (position 1) and the person drinking almond-milk (position 4). This means the person drinking fanta must be in position 2.

7. From point 9, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since we know the position of the person driving the taxi (position 1), the person driving the train can only be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. But from point 3, we know that the person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the person watching horror movies, and we know the position of the person watching romance movies (position 5). This means the person watching horror movies cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. But from point 12, we know that the person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies. Since we know the position of the person driving the subway (position 5), the person watching horror movies cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. But from point 6, we know that the person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies, and we know the position of the person watching romance movies (position 5). This means the person watching sports movies cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. But from point 7, we know that the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since we know the position of the person driving the subway (position 5), the person driving the train cannot be in position 5. So, the person driving the train must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. But from point 12, we know that the person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies. Since we know the position of the person driving the train (position 1, 2, 3, or 6), the person watching horror movies cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. So, it must be in position 4 or 5. But from point 6, we know that the person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies, and we know the position of the person watching romance movies (position 5). This means the person watching sports movies cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 4. This means the person driving the train must be in position 2, 3, or 6. But from point 1, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies, and we know the position of the person watching superhero movies (position 6). This means the person driving the train cannot be in position 6. So, the person driving the train must be in position 2 or 3. But from point 3, we know that the person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the person watching horror movies, and we know the position of the person watching horror movies (position 4). This means the person driving the train cannot be in position 3. So, the person driving the train must be in position 2.

8. From point 6, we know that the person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies. Since we know the position of the person driving the train (position 2), the person watching sports movies can only be in position 3, 4, or 5. But from point 2, we know that the person watching mystery movies is to the right of the person driving the subway, and we know the position of the person driving the subway (position 5). This means the person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 3 or 4. But from point 4, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the far left or far right. Since we know the position of the person watching romance movies (position 5), the person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 3.

9. From point 1, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies. Since we know the position of the person driving the train (position 2) and the person watching mystery movies (position 3), the person watching superhero movies can only be in position 4 or 6. But from point 5, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking juice, and we know the position of the person drinking juice (position 1). This means the person watching superhero movies cannot be in position 6. So, it must be in position 4.

10. From point 5, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since we know the position of the person driving the taxi (position 1) and the person watching superhero movies (position 4), the person drinking juice can only be in position 2 or 3. But from point 8, we know that the person drinking juice is the person watching disaster movies. Since we know the position of the person watching romance movies (position 5), the person watching disaster movies cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 2.

11. From point 11, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since we know the position of the person driving the taxi (position 1) and the person drinking juice (position 2), the person drinking fanta can only be in position 3, 4, or 5. But from point 10, we know that the person drinking juice is the person watching disaster movies. Since we know the position of the person watching romance movies (position 5), the person drinking fanta cannot be in position 5. So, it must be in position 3 or 4. But from point 4, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since we know the position of the person drinking juice (position 2) and the person drinking almond-milk (position 4), the person drinking fanta can only be in position 3.

12. From point 8, we know that the person drinking juice is the person watching disaster movies. Since we know the position of the person drinking fanta (position 3), the person watching disaster movies cannot be in position 3. So, it must be in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-3x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the sport of surfing is in an even position and to the right of the engineer (who is not the first person), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, since the person eating banana is the person who's sport is surfing (from rule 8), and banana cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 3), surfing must be in position 4.

2. Now we know that the person who's sport is surfing is in position 4, so the engineer must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (not position 6 because of rule 1). Since the engineer is to the left of the person eating apple (from rule 4), the engineer must be in position 1.

3. The person eating pepper is to the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since cycling cannot be in position 6 (as it would violate rule 1), it must be in position 2, 3, or 4. If cycling is in position 2, then pepper must be in position 6, which violates rule 1. So, cycling must be in position 3, and pepper must be in position 5.

4. The doctor is the person eating avocado (from rule 7). Avocado cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 4), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the photographer is to the right of the person who's sport is surfing (from rule 6), and the person who's sport is surfing is in position 4, the photographer must be in position 5 or 6. If the photographer is in position 6, then the doctor must be in position 2, which violates rule 9 (photographer is in an even position). So, the doctor is in position 2, and the photographer is in position 6.

5. The photographer is to the right of the pilot (from rule 11), so the pilot must be in position 1 or 3. Since the photographer is also to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon (from rule 10), and the person who's sport is surfing is to the right of the photographer (from rule 6), the person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 2. So, the pilot is in position 3.

6. The person who's sport is handball can be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the doctor is to the left or right of the person who's sport is handball (from rule 12), and we already know the doctor is in position 2, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 1 or 3. Since the person who's sport is volleyball is between the dancer and the pilot (from rule 13), and we already know the dancer is in position 1 and the pilot is in position 3, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 2. So, the person who's sport is handball is in position 5.

7. The only remaining position for the dancer is position 6. The only remaining food is pumpkin. So, the person eating pumpkin is the dressmaker (as there are no other jobs left).

Lv5-3x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the onion eater is between the indie fan and the radish eater. Let's place the indie fan and radish eater first. Since the trance fan is on the far left or far right (rule 5), and the radish eater is to the left of the pop fan (rule 8), the trance fan cannot be at position 1 or 6. So, let's place the trance fan at position 6. Now, the radish eater must be to the left of the pop fan, so radish eater goes at position 5. The onion eater must be to the right of the indie fan, so onion eater goes at position 2 or 3. Let's place the onion eater at position 3 for now.

2. The magic-tricks hobbyist is to the right of the punk fan (rule 2). Since the trance fan is at position 6, the punk fan cannot be at position 6. So, the punk fan can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5. If the punk fan is at position 1, then the magic-tricks hobbyist must be at position 6. But that would mean the magic-tricks hobbyist is to the right of the gardening hobbyist (rule 4), which is not possible since the gardening hobbyist is at position 5 (radish eater). So, the punk fan cannot be at position 1. If the punk fan is at position 2, then the magic-tricks hobbyist must be at position 3. But that would mean the magic-tricks hobbyist is to the right of the gardening hobbyist (rule 7), which is not possible since the gardening hobbyist is at position 5 (radish eater). So, the punk fan cannot be at position 2. If the punk fan is at position 4, then the magic-tricks hobbyist must be at position 5. But that would mean the magic-tricks hobbyist is to the right of the gardening hobbyist (rule 7), which is not possible since the gardening hobbyist is at position 5 (radish eater). So, the punk fan cannot be at position 4. Therefore, the punk fan must be at position 5. The magic-tricks hobbyist is to the right of the punk fan, so the magic-tricks hobbyist is at position 6.

3. The peach eater is to the right of the onion eater (rule 3). So, the peach eater can be at position 4 or 6. If the peach eater is at position 4, then the gardening hobbyist (radish eater) must be at position 3. But that would mean the gardening hobbyist is to the left of the magic-tricks hobbyist (rule 7), which is not possible since the magic-tricks hobbyist is at position 6. So, the peach eater must be at position 6.

4. The gardening hobbyist (radish eater) is to the right of the gardening hobbyist (rule 4). So, the gardening hobbyist (radish eater) must be at position 5.

5. The baking hobbyist is to the left of the gardening hobbyist (rule 6). So, the baking hobbyist can be at position 1, 2, or 4. If the baking hobbyist is at position 1, then the trance fan must be at position 6. But that would mean the trance fan is on the far left (rule 5), which is not possible since the radish eater is to the left of the trance fan. So, the baking hobbyist cannot be at position 1. If the baking hobbyist is at position 2, then the onion eater must be at position 3. But that would mean the onion eater is to the right of the indie fan, which is not possible since the indie fan is at position 3. So, the baking hobbyist cannot be at position 2. Therefore, the baking hobbyist must be at position 4.

6. The pear eater is on the left or right of the baking hobbyist (rule 14). Since the baking hobbyist is at position 4, the pear eater can be at position 2 or 6. If the pear eater is at position 2, then the onion eater must be at position 3. But that would mean the onion eater is to the right of the indie fan, which is not possible since the indie fan is at position 3. So, the pear eater must be at position 6.

7. The singing hobbyist is on the far left or far right (rule 17). Since the trance fan is at position 6, the singing hobbyist cannot be at position 6. So, the singing hobbyist must be at position 1.

8. The photography hobbyist is on the left or right of the gardening hobbyist (rule 10). Since the gardening hobbyist is at position 5, the photography hobbyist can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 6. If the photography hobbyist is at position 1, then the trance fan must be at position 6. But that would mean the trance fan is on the far left (rule 5), which is not possible since the radish eater is to the left of the trance fan. So, the photography hobbyist cannot be at position 1. If the photography hobbyist is at position 2, then the onion eater must be at position 3. But that would mean the onion eater is to the right of the indie fan, which is not possible since the indie fan is at position 3. So, the photography hobbyist cannot be at position 2. If the photography hobbyist is at position 4, then the pear eater must be at position 6. But that would mean the pear eater is to the right of the baking hobbyist, which is not possible since the baking hobbyist is at position 4. So, the photography hobbyist cannot be at position 4. Therefore, the photography hobbyist must be at position 6.

9. The traveling hobbyist is in an odd position (rule 9). The only odd positions left are 1 and 3. If the traveling hobbyist is at position 1, then the singing hobbyist must be at position 6. But that would mean the singing hobbyist is to the right of the gardening hobbyist (rule 12), which is not possible since the gardening hobbyist is at position 5. So, the traveling hobbyist cannot be at position 1. Therefore, the traveling hobbyist must be at position 3.

Now, let's put everything together:

Lv5-3x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people, so each row represents a person.

2. From rule 2, the person watching drama is on the far left, so let's place Drama in the first column.

3. From rule 9, the fan of country is on the far right, so let's place Country in the last column.

4. From rule 7, the person watching family movies is the fan of blues, so we know that Blues is somewhere in the same row as Family. Since Drama is on the far left, Family cannot be in the first column. So, let's place Family in the second column and Blues in the same row.

5. From rule 8, the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person watching family movies. Since Family is in the second column, Apricot can be in the first or second column. Let's place Apricot in the first column for now.

6. From rule 15, the person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the fan of country. Since Country is in the last column, Pear cannot be in the last column. So, let's place Pear in the second to last column.

7. From rule 18, the person eating asparagus is on the left of the fan of house. Since House cannot be in the last column (because Country is there), it cannot be in the first column either (because Apricot is there). So, let's place Asparagus in the first column and House in the third column.

8. From rule 17, the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person eating pear. Since Pear is in the second to last column, Crime can be in any column to the left of it. Let's place Crime in the first column for now.

9. From rule 13, the person eating tomato is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since Thriller is not placed yet, let's place Thriller in the last column and Tomato in the next to the last column.

10. From rule 12, the person watching musical movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since Time-travel is not placed yet, let's place Time-travel in the second to last column and Musical in the last column.

11. From rule 11, the person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of country. Since Family is in the second column and Country is in the last column, this rule is already satisfied.

12. From rule 3, the fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues. Since Blues is in the second row, Reggae can be in any row below it. Let's place Reggae in the third row for now.

13. From rule 14, the person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person eating pear. Since Pear is in the fourth column, Time-travel can be in any column to the right of it. Let's place Time-travel in the fifth column for now.

14. From rule 16, the person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies. Since Family is in the second column, Radish can be in any column to the left of it. Let's place Radish in the first column.

15. From rule 6, the person eating radish is the fan of d&b. Since Radish is in the first column, D&B can be in the first row.

16. From rule 10, the person watching family movies is the fan of blues. Since Family is in the second column and Blues is in the second row, this rule is already satisfied.

17. From rule 5, the person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the person eating tomato. Since Tomato is in the fourth column, Musical can be in any column to the left or right of it. Let's place Musical in the third column for now.

18. From rule 18, the person eating asparagus is on the left of the fan of house. Since House is in the third column, Asparagus can be in any column to the left of it. Let's place Asparagus in the second column for now.

Now, let's check the rules again to see if they are all satisfied:

1. The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish. Since Radish is in the first column and Pepper is not placed yet, Pepper can be in any column to the right of Radish. Let's place Pepper in the second column.

2. The fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues. Since Blues is in the second row and Reggae is in the third row, this rule is already satisfied.

3. The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person eating pear. Since Crime is in the first column and Pear is in the fourth column, this rule is already satisfied.

4. The person eating tomato is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since Tomato is in the fourth column and Thriller is in the fifth column, this rule is already satisfied.

5. The person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the person eating tomato. Since Musical is in the third column and Tomato is in the fourth column, this rule is already satisfied.

6. The person eating asparagus is on the left of the fan of house. Since Asparagus is in the second column and House is in the third column, this rule is already satisfied.

So, all the rules are satisfied with the following arrangement:

Lv5-3x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the singing person is on the left of the camping person, we can place the Singing (S) and Camping (C) in the first two columns. Let's place S in the first column and C in the second column.

2. The Security-Guard (SG) is to the right of the Board-Games (BG) person. Since BG can't be in the first row (because S is there), it must be in the second row. So, let's place BG in the third column of the second row.

3. The Indonesian (ID) is the person who's hobby is Chess (Ch). Since Ch can't be in the first row or the second column (because S and BG are there), it must be in the fourth column of the third row. So, let's place Ch in the fourth column of the third row and ID in the third column of the third row.

4. The Doctor (D) is between the Writer (W) and BG. Since BG is in the second row, D can't be in the first or second row. Also, D can't be in the fourth column (because Ch is there). So, D can only be in the third column of the fourth row. W must be in the third column of the fifth row, and BG in the third column of the second row.

5. The Canadian (CA) is in an odd position. Since we have filled the first, third, and fifth columns of the first row, the second and fourth columns are even. So, CA can't be in the first row. Also, CA can't be in the second column (because S is there), or the fourth column (because Ch is there). So, CA can only be in the sixth column of an odd row.

6. The Videographer (V) is to the right of the Polish (PL). Since PL is in the first column, V can't be in the first row or the first column. Also, V can't be in the second column (because S is there), or the fourth column (because Ch is there), or the sixth column (because CA is there). So, V can only be in the fifth column of an odd row.

7. The Malay (M) is the person who's hobby is Singing (S). Since S is in the first column, M can't be in the first row or the first column. Also, M can't be in the second column (because C is there), or the fourth column (because Ch is there), or the sixth column (because CA is there). So, M can only be in the fifth column of an even row.

8. The Librarian (L) is on the right of W. Since W is in the fifth row, L can't be in the sixth row. Also, L can't be in the first column (because S is there), or the fourth column (because Ch is there), or the sixth column (because CA is there). So, L can only be in the second or third column of the fifth row.

9. The odd positions are the first, third, and fifth rows. Since CA is in the sixth column of an odd row, the only odd position left for CA is the second row. So, CA is in the sixth column of the second row.

10. The PL is on the far left. Since M is in the fifth column of an even row, PL must be in the first column of the same row. Since CA is in the sixth column of the second row, PL can't be in the second row. So, PL is in the first column of the fourth row.

11. V is in the fifth column of an odd row. Since PL is in the first column of the fourth row, V can't be in the fourth row. So, V is in the fifth column of the third row.

12. M is in the fifth column of an even row. Since V is in the fifth column of the third row, M can't be in the third row. So, M is in the fifth column of the fifth row.

13. L is on the right of W. Since W is in the third column of the fifth row, L can't be in the sixth column of the fifth row (because M is there). So, L is in the second column of the fifth row.

14. The Thai (TH) is the person who's hobby is Camping (C). Since C is in the second column, TH can't be in the first row or the second column. Also, TH can't be in the fourth column (because Ch is there), or the sixth column (because CA is there). So, TH can only be in the third column of an even row. Since C is in the second column, TH can't be in the second row (because BG is there). So, TH is in the third column of the fourth row.

15. The British (BR) is on the right of PL. Since PL is in the first column of the fourth row, BR can't be in the first column of the fourth row. So, BR is in the second column of the fourth row.

16. S is in the first column. Since M is the person who's hobby is S, M is in the fifth row. So, S is in the first column of the first row.

17. BG is the lawyer (LW). So, LW is in the third column of the second row.

18. The hobby of the person in the second column of the first row is Reading (R).

19. The hobby of the person in the third column of the sixth row is Sudoku (Su).

20. TH is in the third column of the fourth row, so TH is the person who's hobby is Camping (C).

1. We know that there are 6 different movie genres, nationalities, and sports. So, each row and each column should have a unique value.

2. From rule 13, we know that the person watching adventure movies is either to the left or right of the polish. Since the polish is the person who's sport is parkour (rule 8), we can place the parkour in the third column (Column 3).

3. From rule 11, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the person watching adventure movies (which is in Column 3). So, snowboarding goes in Column 4. Since the snowboarding is the canadian (rule 5), the canadian goes in the fourth row (Row 4).

4. From rule 19, we know that the chinese is to the left of the canadian. Since the chinese is the person who's sport is water-polo (rule 18), water-polo goes in the second row (Row 2).

5. From rule 17, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is to the left of the chinese. So, volleyball goes in the first column (Column 1).

6. From rule 16, we know that the canadian is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since the canadian is already placed in Row 4, the person watching romance movies must be in Row 5. So, romance goes in the fifth row.

7. From rule 14, we know that the person who's sport is golf is the person watching thriller movies. So, golf goes in the sixth row (Row 6).

8. From rule 10, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is to the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since golf is in Row 6, fantasy goes in Row 1, 2, 3, or 4. But it can't be in Row 1 (since it's to the right of golf), and it can't be in Row 2 (since water-polo is already there). So, fantasy goes in Row 3.

9. From rule 6, we know that the person watching animation movies is to the left of the canadian. Since the canadian is in Row 4, animation goes in Row 1, 2, or 3. But it can't be in Row 1 (since fantasy is already there), and it can't be in Row 3 (since fantasy is there too). So, animation goes in Row 2.

10. From rule 15, we know that the canadian is on the left of the person watching romance movies. Since romance is in Row 5, the canadian must be in Row 4. But we already placed the canadian in Row 4. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it stands.

Here's the table up to the point where we found the contradiction:

|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |      4       |    5    |     6      |
| Movie-Genre   | animation| fantasy    | adventure  | romance     | thriller | snowboarding|
| Nationality   |         |           |           | canadian    |         | polish     |
| Sport         |         |           | parkour    |            | golf     | snowboarding|

The puzzle seems to have an inconsistency. I'm unable to provide the complete solution due to the contradiction."	{'movie-genre': ['animation', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'romance', 'thriller', 'snowboarding'], 'nationality': ['', '', '', 'canadian', '', 'polish'], 'sport': ['', '', 'parkour', '', 'golf', 'snowboarding']}	True	2	False
