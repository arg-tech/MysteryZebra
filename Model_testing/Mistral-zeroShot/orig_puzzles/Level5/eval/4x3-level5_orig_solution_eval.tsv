Lv5-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the japanese is in an odd position and there are 3 options, they must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, since the sprite drinker is to the right of the japanese (1), the sprite drinker cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 6). So, the japanese must be in position 3.

2. Now we know the japanese is in position 3, so the sprite drinker must be in position 4 or 5. But since the sprite drinker is to the right of the japanese, they cannot be in position 4 (as it would violate rule 5). So, the sprite drinker must be in position 5.

3. Now we know the sprite drinker is in position 5, so the almond-milk drinker must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But since the almond-milk drinker is to the left of the sprite drinker (5), they cannot be in position 5. So, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 1 or 2. However, if the almond-milk drinker was in position 1, it would violate rule 6 (the sprite drinker is to the right of the almond-milk drinker). So, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 2.

4. Now we know the almond-milk drinker is in position 2, so the water drinker must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the water drinker is to the left of the sprite drinker (5), they cannot be in position 5. So, the water drinker must be in position 1 or 3. However, if the water drinker was in position 1, it would violate rule 5 (the thai is to the right of the water drinker). So, the water drinker must be in position 3.

5. Now we know the water drinker is in position 3, so the thai must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But since the thai is to the right of the water drinker (3), they cannot be in position 3. So, the thai must be in position 1, 2, or 5. However, if the thai was in position 1, it would violate rule 4 (the japanese is in an odd position). So, the thai must be in position 5.

6. Now we know the thai is in position 5, so the person eating watermelon must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the watermelon eater is to the left of the hamster owner (as the hamster owner is to the right of the thai), they cannot be in position 5. So, the watermelon eater must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, if the watermelon eater was in position 1, it would violate rule 2 (the watermelon eater is to the left of the hamster owner). So, the watermelon eater must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But if the watermelon eater was in position 4, it would violate rule 5 (the thai is to the right of the water drinker, who is to the right of the watermelon eater). So, the watermelon eater must be in position 3.

7. Now we know the watermelon eater is in position 3, so the person eating corn must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But since the person eating cranberry is between the person eating corn and the owner of the snake, the person eating corn must be in position 1 or 4. However, if the person eating corn was in position 1, it would violate rule 2 (the watermelon eater is to the left of the hamster owner, who is to the right of the person eating corn). So, the person eating corn must be in position 4.

8. Now we know the person eating corn is in position 4, so the person eating cranberry must be in position 2.

9. Now we know the person eating cranberry is in position 2, so the owner of the snake must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the owner of the ferret is to the right of the thai (who is in position 5), the owner of the snake cannot be in position 5. So, the owner of the snake must be in position 1 or 3. However, if the owner of the snake was in position 1, it would violate rule 7 (the person eating cranberry is between the person eating corn and the owner of the snake). So, the owner of the snake must be in position 3.

10. Now we know the owner of the snake is in position 3, so the owner of the ferret must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But since the owner of the ferret is to the right of the thai (who is in position 5), the owner of the ferret cannot be in position 5. So, the owner of the ferret must be in position 1, 2, or 4. However, if the owner of the ferret was in position 1, it would violate rule 3 (the owner of the ferret is to the right of the thai, who is to the right of the person drinking water, who is in position 3). So, the owner of the ferret must be in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the hobbies. Since rock-climbing is on the left of sudoku, we can place them as follows:

   |               | Rock-climbing | Sudoku       |   3    |
   | Beverage      |        |               |        |
   | Hobby         | Baking      |               |        |
   | Music-Genre   |        |               |        |
   | Pet           |        |               |        |

2. Now, let's place the hobby of baking. Since it's not rock-climbing or sudoku, it must be in the remaining spot.

   |               | Rock-climbing | Sudoku       | Baking   |
   | Beverage      |        |               |        |
   | Hobby         |        |               |        |
   | Music-Genre   |        |               |        |
   | Pet           |        |               |        |

3. Next, let's place the music-genres. Since the fan of reggae is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku, it must be in the first column. Blues can't be in the first column because the sprite drinker is to its right, so blues must be in the second column. Folk can't be in the second column because the milk drinker is to its right, so folk must be in the third column.

   |               | Rock-climbing | Sudoku       | Baking   |
   | Beverage      | 7up          | Sprite      | Milk    |
   | Hobby         |        |               |        |
   | Music-Genre   | Reggae      | Blues       | Folk    |
   | Pet           |        |               |        |

4. Now, let's place the pets. Since the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the owner of the chinchilla, the mouse must be in the first or second row. The chinchilla can't be in the first row because the milk drinker is to its right, so the chinchilla must be in the second row. The only remaining spot for the mouse is the first row.

   |               | Rock-climbing | Sudoku       | Baking   |
   | Beverage      | 7up          | Sprite      | Milk    |
   | Hobby         |        | Rock-climbing|        |
   | Music-Genre   | Reggae      | Blues       | Folk    |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla  |        | Mouse   |

5. Finally, let's place the remaining beverages. Since the person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla, it must be in the third row. The only remaining spot for the milk drinker is the third row. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues, so it must be in the second row. The only remaining spot for the sprite drinker is the second row.

   |               | Rock-climbing | Sudoku       | Baking   |
   | Beverage      | 7up          | Sprite      | Milk    |
   | Hobby         |        | Rock-climbing|        |
   | Music-Genre   | Reggae      | Blues       | Folk    |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla  |        | Mouse   |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person watching romance movies, we can place Swimming in the third column and Romance in the second row. Let's mark it as R2 and S3.

2. The fan of electronic is between the fan of funk and the fan of pop. Since the fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the fan of funk, we can place Pop in the first column and Funk in the second column. Let's mark it as P1 and F2.

3. The fan of electronic is in an even position. Since we already placed Pop and Funk, the only even position left is the third column. So, we place Electronic in the third column. Let's mark it as E3.

4. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies. Since we already placed Romance in the second column, Family must be in the first column. Let's mark it as F1.

5. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since we already placed Filmaking in the third column, Video-games must be in the first column. Let's mark it as V1.

6. The fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the fan of funk. Since we already placed Pop and Funk, the only position left for the fan of pop is the first column. But we already placed Pop there, so there's a contradiction here. Let's recheck the puzzle.

7. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is between the person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we already placed Filmaking in the third column, Volleyball and Cooking must be in the first and second columns respectively. Let's mark it as V1 and C2.

8. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since we already placed Romance in the second column and Volleyball in the first column, there's no contradiction here.

However, there's still a contradiction with point 6, which states that the fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the fan of funk, but we already placed Pop and Funk in the first and second columns respectively, and there's no way to move them without violating other conditions.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle as it stands, and it's not possible to solve it with the given conditions."	{}	False	0	False
Lv5-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the reggae fan is to the left of the hip-hop fan, so we can't place them in the same column. Let's place the reggae fan in the first column (Column 1) and the hip-hop fan in the second or third column.

2. The Spanish is watching western movies, so we place them in the second row (Movie-Genre). Since the Spanish is on the left of the hip-hop fan, the hip-hop fan can't be in the second row, so they must be in the third row. This means the reggae fan is in the first row.

3. The person watching western movies is on the left of the hip-hop fan, so the Spanish (western movies) must be in the first column.

4. The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person eating cauliflower. Since the Spanish (western movies) is in the first column and the first row is filled, the cauliflower eater must be in the first row, which means the fantasy movie watcher is in the third row.

5. The turkish is on the far right, so they must be in the third column.

6. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the Spanish (who is watching western movies), so they must be in the third row as well.

7. The person eating peas is somewhere to the left of the hip-hop fan. Since the hip-hop fan is in the third column, the pea eater can't be in the third column. They can't be in the first column because the reggae fan is there. So, the pea eater must be in the second column.

2. Let's start with the sports. We know that the skateboarder is on the left of the jet-ski driver and on the left or right of the trance fan. Let's place skateboarding in the first column (1) and put jet-ski in the third column (3). Since skateboarding is on the left of the jet-ski driver, the skateboarder must be in the first row. Now we know that the skateboarder is in the first row and third column.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

3. The skateboarder is on the left or right of the trance fan. Since the skateboarder is in the first row and third column, the trance fan must be in the second row. Let's place trance in the second row and second column.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

| Transport     |             |         | Jet-ski |

4. The skateboarder is on the left of the trance fan, so the skateboarder must be in column 1. Since the skateboarder is in the third row, the trance fan must be in the second row. This means that the D&B fan must be in the first row. Let's place D&B in the first row and first column.

|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |

5. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski is in the third row, the trike must be in the fourth row. Let's place trike in the fourth row and third column.

6. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since the mystery movies are in the third column, the airplane must be in the second row. However, the second row is already occupied by the trance fan. This means that the mystery movies cannot be in the third column, so they must be in the first column. Let's place mystery in the first column and airplane in the second row.

7. The person watching family movies is on the left of the fan of soul. Since the soul fan is in the third column, the family movies must be in the second column. Let's place family in the second column and second row.

8. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the mystery movies are in the first column and family movies are in the second column, they are not on the same column, so they must be on different rows. Since the family movies are in the second row, the mystery movies must be in the first row. Let's place mystery in the first row and first column.

9. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies, but we already placed the mystery movies in the first row. This means that the airplane cannot be in the second row, so it must be in the fourth row. Let's place airplane in the fourth row and first column.

10. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski, but we already placed the jet-ski in the third column. This means that the trike cannot be in the fourth column, so it must be in the second column. Let's place trike in the second column and second row.

11. The person watching family movies is on the left of the fan of soul. Since the soul fan is in the third column, the family movies must be in the second column. However, the second column is already occupied by the trike. This means that the family movies cannot be in the second column, so they must be in the first column. Let's place family in the first column and first row.

| Transport     | Airplane     | Jet-ski  |         |

12. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies, but we already placed the mystery movies in the first row. This means that the airplane cannot be in the second row, so it must be in the fourth row. However, the fourth row is already occupied by the skateboarder. This means that the puzzle has a contradiction and cannot be solved with the given conditions.

Therefore, the puzzle has no valid solution with the given conditions.

2. The polish is on the left of the person eating pomegranate, so the pomegranate eater cannot be the polish. Let's place the pomegranate eater in the second column (Food column). Since there are only 3 types of food, the polish must be in the third column (Food column).

   | Food          | Pomegranate  | Lettuce | Polish      |
   | Nationality   | Pakistani     | Dutch   | Polish      |
   | Pet           |               |         |             |
   | Sport         |               | Weightlifting | Volleyball  |

4. The owner of the rat is on the right of the owner of the volleyball. Since the volleyball player is in the third column (Nationality column), the rat owner must be in the third column (Pet column).

   |               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
   | Food          | Pomegranate  | Lettuce | Polish      |
   | Nationality   | Pakistani     | Dutch   | Polish      |
   | Pet           |               | Rat     |             |
   | Sport         |               | Weightlifting | Volleyball  |

5. The person eating lettuce is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since the rat owner is in the third column (Pet column), the fish owner must be in the first column (Food column).

   |               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
   | Food          | Lettuce      | Pomegranate| Polish      |
   | Nationality   | Pakistani     | Dutch   | Polish      |
   | Pet           | Fish         | Rat     |             |
   | Sport         |               | Weightlifting | Volleyball  |

6. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the left of the polish. Since the polish is in the third column (Nationality column), the fish owner must be in the second column (Nationality column). But we already have the Dutch there, so the polish must be in the first column (Nationality column).

   |               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
   | Food          | Lettuce      | Pomegranate| Polish      |
   | Nationality   | Polish      | Dutch   | Pakistani   |
   | Pet           | Fish         | Rat     |             |
   | Sport         |               | Weightlifting | Volleyball  |

7. Now we have a contradiction because the polish is supposed to be on the left of the person eating pomegranate, but in our current arrangement, the pomegranate eater (Dutch) is on the left of the polish. This means the puzzle has no solution with the given conditions.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |       1       |    2    |      3      |
| Food          | Lettuce      | Pomegranate| Polish      |
| Nationality   | Polish      | Dutch   | Pakistani   |
| Pet           | Fish         | Rat     |             |
| Sport         |               | Weightlifting | Volleyball  |
#############

However, this solution is invalid due to the contradiction in the conditions. The puzzle has no valid solution."	{'food': ['lettuce', 'pomegranate', 'polish'], 'nationality': ['polish', 'dutch', 'pakistani'], 'pet': ['fish', 'rat', ''], 'sport': ['', 'weightlifting', 'volleyball']}	True	3	False
Lv5-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching sports movies is not in the first column (since the person eating strawberry is to the right of them). So, the person watching sports movies can be in the second or third column.

2. The person watching action movies is to the left of the person eating corn. Since the classical fan is on the left of the person eating corn, the person watching action movies can't be in the first column (as it would place the classical fan to the left of the action movie fan and the action movie fan to the left of the corn eater, violating the order). So, the person watching action movies can only be in the second or third column.

3. The fan of classical is on the left of the person eating corn, so the person eating corn must be in the third column.

4. The person who's sport is biathlon is to the right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the person eating corn is in the third column, the person doing swimming must be in the first column. So, the person doing biathlon must be in the second or third column.

5. The person who's sport is lacrosse is to the left of the fan of classical. Since the fan of classical is in the second column, the person doing lacrosse must be in the first column.

6. The person watching sports movies is to the left of the fan of salsa. Since the person doing lacrosse is in the first column and the person doing swimming is in the third column, the person watching sports movies must be in the second column.

7. Now we know the positions of all the elements except the movies and music genres. Since there are only three different movie genres and we have placed two of them, the remaining movie genre must be in the first column. So, the person watching action movies is in the first column.

8. The remaining movie genre for the third column is sports, and the remaining music genre for the second column is disco.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1      |     2     |    3     |
| Food          | corn      | potato   | strawberry|

Lv5-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating tomato is on the far left or far right, and the argentine is on the far left, the person eating tomato cannot be argentine. So, the argentine must be eating either grapefruit or orange.

2. The person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the argentine is not the person eating tomato, the person writing cannot be argentine either. So, the person writing must be eating either grapefruit or orange.

3. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person writing is to the left of the person dancing, the person doing puzzles must be eating tomato.

4. The person eating tomato is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapefruit. So, the person eating grapefruit must be on the far left.

5. The owner of the ferret is on the far left or far right. Since the argentine and the person doing puzzles (eating tomato) are already placed, the owner of the ferret cannot be argentine or eating tomato. So, the owner of the ferret must be eating either grapefruit or orange.

6. The dutch is on the far right. Since the person eating grapefruit is on the far left, the person eating orange must be dutch.

7. The owner of the goat is between the owner of the lizard and the person eating grapefruit. Since the person eating grapefruit is on the far left and the dutch is eating orange on the far right, the owner of the goat must be eating tomato, and the owner of the lizard must be eating grapefruit.

8. Now, we have filled all the nationalities and food. The hobbies are still to be filled. Since the person doing puzzles is eating tomato, the person doing writing must be doing puzzles, and the person doing dancing must be doing writing.

9. The only hobby left is for the person doing the hobby of the lizard owner. Since the lizard owner is eating grapefruit, the hobby of the lizard owner can be any of the three hobbies. Let's assume the lizard owner does dancing. This would mean the person doing puzzles is writing, which contradicts the fact that the person doing writing is to the left of the person doing dancing. So, the lizard owner must be doing puzzles, and the person doing dancing must be doing writing.

Lv5-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating pomegranate is the person who's hobby is reading (point 4), we can place the pomegranate eater in the second column (column 2) and the hobby of drawing in the first column (column 1).

2. The fan of house is the person who's sport is cricket (point 2), so we can place cricket in the third row (row 3) and house in the second row (row 2).

3. The person eating spinach is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding (point 3), so we can place snowboarding in the first row (row 1) and spinach in the third column (column 3).

4. Now we know that the person eating kale is on the right of the fan of house (point 6), so kale must be in the second column (column 2) or the third column (column 3). Since the hobby of drawing is already in the first column (column 1), kale must be in the third column (column 3).

5. The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient (point 5), so ambient must be in the first row (row 1) or the second row (row 2). Since the hobby of drawing is already in the first column (column 1), ambient must be in the first row (row 1).

Lv5-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of house is either to the left or right of the person eating raspberry. Let's assume the fan of house is on the left of the raspberry eater (H1). This means the raspberry eater (R) must be on the right (R3).

2. The fan of house is somewhere to the right of the fan of jazz (J). Since the fan of house is already placed (H1), the fan of jazz (J2) must be on the left.

3. The thai (T) is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games (V). Since we placed the raspberry eater (R3) on the right, the video-games person (V) must be on the left (V1). This means the thai (T2) is on the right of V1.

4. The thai (T2) is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving (S). Since we placed the video-games person (V1), the skydiving person (S) must be on the left (S3).

5. The person who's hobby is video-games (V1) is on the right of the australian (A). Since we placed the thai (T2) on the right of V1, the australian (A) must be on the left (A2).

6. The person eating pear (P) is between the person who's hobby is writing (W) and the person eating lettuce (L). Since we placed the thai (T2) on the right of V1, the writing person (W) must be on the left (W3). This means the pear eater (P2) is between W3 and L1.

7. The only remaining spot for the lettuce eater (L1) is the leftmost spot, and the only remaining music-genre for L1 is techno. The only remaining nationality for L1 is brazilian.

8. The only remaining spot for the writing person (W3) is the middle spot, and the only remaining music-genre for W3 is jazz. The only remaining nationality for W3 is australian.
