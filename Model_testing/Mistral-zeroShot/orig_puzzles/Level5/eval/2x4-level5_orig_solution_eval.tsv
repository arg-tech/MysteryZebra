Lv5-2x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The Brazilian is drinking lemonade (point 5), so let's place the lemonade in the odd position (point 3). Since there are 4 positions, the lemonade will be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's place it in position 1 for now.

2. Now we know the Brazilian is in position 1, so the Nigerian must be to the left or right of position 1 (point 2). Since the nationalities are different, the Nigerian cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the Nigerian in position 2 for now.

3. The person drinking water is to the left of the Nigerian (point 4), so the water cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. The only remaining position is 2, so the water is in position 2.

4. Now we know the water is in position 2, so the Nigerian must be in position 4.

5. The French is drinking sprite (point 6), so the sprite must be in the position of the French nationality. Since the French is not in the first three positions (the Brazilian is in position 1, the Nigerian in position 4, and the water in position 2), the French must be in position 3.

6. The only beverage left is hot-chocolate. Since it cannot be in position 1 (because the Brazilian is there), it must be in position 3 (the only remaining position).

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |   1    |       2       |     3     |   4    |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | water | sprite | lemonade |
| Nationality   | brazilian | nigerian | french  |         |

However, we don't know the nationality for the last position 5. Since we have placed all the nationalities in the first four positions, the last position must be empty. So, the final solution table with the nationality information is:

  |               |   1    |       2       |     3     |   4    |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | water | sprite | lemonade |
| Nationality   | brazilian | nigerian | french  |         |

And the final solution table without the nationality information is:

  |               |   1    |       2       |     3     |   4    |

Lv5-2x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the Egyptian is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the horse. Since there are only four positions, the Egyptian cannot be in the first or last position. Also, the Egyptian cannot be next to the horse because the horse is in the last position (as we will see later). So, the Egyptian must be in the second or third position.

2. From rule 2, the Malaysian is to the left of the horse owner. Since the Egyptian cannot be in the first position, the Malaysian must be in the first position.

3. From rule 3, the owner of the bird is to the right of the owner of the goat. Since the Malaysian is in the first position and cannot be the owner of the goat (as the Malaysian is not the last), the goat owner must be in the fourth position.

4. From rule 4, the owner of the bird is to the right of the Malaysian. So, the owner of the bird must be in the third position.

5. From rule 5, the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the Australian. Since the Malaysian is in the first position and the goat owner is in the fourth position, the Australian must be in the second position.

6. Now we know the positions of all pets and their owners. The final solution table is:

Lv5-2x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating corn is driving the car, we can place corn in the 1st column and car in the 2nd row.

   | Food |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
   |------|------|---------|----------|--------|
   | Transport |      |         |           |        |

2. The person driving the train is on the right of the person eating corn. So, the train must be in the 3rd row. Since the train cannot be in the 1st or 4th column (as per the given conditions), it must be in the 3rd column.

   | Food |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
   |------|------|---------|----------|--------|
   | Transport |      |         | train    |        |

3. The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. So, the quad-bike cannot be in the 3rd row (as it would be to the left of the train). It also cannot be in the 1st row (as it would be to the left of the car, which is the person eating corn). So, the quad-bike must be in the 2nd row.

   | Food |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
   |------|------|---------|----------|--------|
   | Transport |      | quad-bike| train    |        |

4. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person eating peach. Since the bus cannot be in the 3rd row (as it would be to the left of the train), it must be in the 1st row. The only remaining position for peach is the 4th column.

   | Food |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
   |------|------|---------|----------|--------|
   | Transport | bus  | quad-bike| train    | peach  |

5. The person eating potato is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train. So, potato must be in the 4th row. Since the only remaining food is cabbage, it must be in the 1st column.

   | Food |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
   |------|------|---------|----------|--------|
   | Transport | bus  | quad-bike| train    | potato |

6. Now, we need to check if the positions of the foods and transports satisfy all the conditions. They do, so the final solution is:

Lv5-2x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of card-games is on the left of the person with the hobby of singing, we can place them in the first two columns from the left. Let's assume the hobby of card-games is in the first column and singing in the second column.

2. The person with the hobby of woodworking is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies. Since we already placed the person with the hobby of card-games and singing, the only available spots to the left of woodworking are the third and fourth columns. Let's place woodworking in the third column.

3. The person with the hobby of card-games is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching epic movies. Since we already placed the person with the hobby of card-games in the first column, the person watching romance movies must be in the second column, and the person watching epic movies must be in the fourth column. Also, the person with the hobby of card-games is to the left of the person watching romance movies, so the hobby of card-games must be in the first column, and the person watching romance movies must be in the second column. This means the person watching epic movies is in the fourth column.

4. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since we already placed the person watching romance movies in the second column, the person watching family movies can only be in the first or third column. However, since the person with the hobby of woodworking is in the third column, the person watching family movies cannot be in the third column. So, the person watching family movies is in the first column.

5. The person watching romance movies is the person who's hobby is skydiving. We already placed the person watching romance movies in the second column, so the hobby of skydiving is in the second column.

Final solution table:

Lv5-2x4-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the kale eater is to the left of the disaster movie watcher (not the first position because of rule 5). So, the possible positions for kale are 1, 2, or 3.

2. The kale eater is on the left or right of the eggplant eater (not in the first position because of rule 3). So, the possible positions for eggplant are 2 or 4.

3. The eggplant eater is to the left of the banana eater (not in the last position because of rule 3). So, the possible positions for banana are 3 or 4.

4. The western movie watcher is to the right of the disaster movie watcher (not in the first position because of rule 4). So, the possible positions for western are 2, 3, or 4.

5. The disaster movie watcher is to the left or right of the corn eater (not in the last position because of rule 5). So, the possible positions for corn are 1, 2, or 3.

6. The kale eater is to the right of the mystery movie watcher. Since kale can't be in the first position, the mystery movie watcher can only be in position 4.

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- Since the western movie watcher is to the right of the disaster movie watcher, and the mystery movie watcher is in position 4, the western movie watcher can only be in position 3.

- Since the eggplant eater is to the left of the banana eater, and the western movie watcher is in position 3, the banana eater can only be in position 4.

- Since the kale eater is to the right of the mystery movie watcher, and the banana eater is in position 4, the kale eater can only be in position 2.

- The only position left for the corn eater is position 1.

Lv5-2x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the police-officer is in an odd position, they can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the police-officer is in position 1 for now.

2. The electrician is to the left of the Turkish. Since the police-officer is in position 1, the electrician can only be in position 2 or 3. If the electrician is in position 2, the Turkish would have to be in position 4, but that would mean the thai is in position 1, which contradicts the first rule. So, the electrician must be in position 3.

3. Now we know the Turkish cannot be in position 1 (because the electrician is to their right), so they must be in position 2.

4. The thai cannot be in position 1 (because the Turkish is between them and the police-officer), so they must be in position 4.

5. The paramedic is to the right of the Japanese. Since the Turkish is in position 2, the Japanese can only be in position 1 or 3. If the Japanese were in position 1, the paramedic would have to be in position 5, but that would mean the firefighter is in position 1, which contradicts the first rule. So, the Japanese must be in position 3.

6. Now the only remaining job for position 5 is the firefighter.

Lv5-2x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the music genres are ambient, hip-hop, jazz, and salsa, and the pets are goldfish, hamster, snake, and turtle.

2. The owner of the hamster is the fan of salsa, so we can place the hamster owner in the 'Salsa' row and the 'Hamster' column. Let's place the hamster in position 2 (row 2, column 2).

3. The fan of ambient is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the snake. Since the hamster owner is the fan of salsa, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 1 or 3. If the fan of hip-hop was in position 1, the fan of ambient would have to be in position 2, but that's where the hamster owner is. So, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 3. This means the fan of ambient is in position 2. Let's place ambient in position 2 (row 1, column 2).

4. The owner of the goldfish is in an even position. Since the hamster is in position 2 and the fan of ambient is in position 2, the goldfish owner must be in position 4. Let's place the goldfish in position 4 (row 3, column 4).

5. The fan of jazz is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the fan of hip-hop is to the left of the fan of ambient, and the fan of ambient is to the left of the goldfish owner, the fan of jazz must be in position 1 or 3. If the fan of jazz was in position 1, the fan of hip-hop would have to be in position 3, but that would violate rule 3 (the fan of ambient is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the snake). So, the fan of jazz must be in position 3. Let's place jazz in position 3 (row 1, column 3).

6. The fan of salsa is the owner of the hamster, so we've already placed them.

7. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient. Since the fan of ambient is in position 2, the turtle owner must be in position 1 or 4. If the turtle owner was in position 1, the goldfish owner would have to be in position 3, but that would violate rule 4 (the goldfish owner is in an even position). So, the turtle owner must be in position 4. Let's place the turtle in position 4 (row 2, column 4).

8. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient and the owner of the turtle. Since the fan of ambient is in position 2 and the turtle owner is in position 4, the snake owner must be in position 5. Let's place the snake in position 5 (row 3, column 2).

Lv5-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 3, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Let's place weightlifting in the last position (column 4).

2. From point 4, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. So, soccer cannot be in the first position (column 1).

3. From point 2, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is to the left of the person drinking tea. Since soccer is not in the first position, tea must be in the first position. So, tea is in column 1.

4. From point 5, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is to the left of the person drinking cola. Since tea is in the first position, surfing cannot be in the first position either. So, cola must be in the second position.

5. Now, we have placed tea, cola, and surfing. Since there are only three positions left for mirinda and soccer, mirinda must be in one of the remaining positions. Let's place mirinda in the third position (column 3) for now.

6. From point 1, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since mirinda is in the third position and surfing is in the second position, mirinda must be to the right of surfing. But this contradicts point 1. So, our assumption about mirinda being in the third position is incorrect.

7. Let's try placing mirinda in the fourth position instead. Now, mirinda is to the right of surfing (who is in the second position), and the person to the left of surfing is drinking cola (from point 5). This satisfies all conditions.

8. The only remaining position for soccer is the first position (column 1).

So, the final solution table is:

Now, let's fill in the sports based on the given conditions:

1. From point 2, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is to the left of the person drinking tea. Since soccer is in the first position and tea is in the first column, soccer must be water-polo (as it's the only sport that can be to the left of tea).

2. From point 4, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since soccer is in the first position and weightlifting is in the fourth position, soccer must be water-polo (as it's the only sport that can be to the right of weightlifting). This is a contradiction, but it's the only possible contradiction left. So, our assumption about soccer being water-polo is incorrect.

3. Let's try placing soccer in the fourth position instead. Now, soccer is to the right of weightlifting (who is in the last position), and the person to the left of weightlifting is drinking tea (from point 3). This satisfies all conditions.

4. The only remaining position for water-polo is the first position.

5. From point 5, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is to the left of the person drinking cola. Since surfing is in the second position and cola is in the third position, surfing must be surfing.

6. From point 3, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since weightlifting is in the fourth position and iced-tea is in the first column, weightlifting must be weightlifting.

So, the final solution table is:

Now, let's fill in the remaining sport:

1. From point 1, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since mirinda is in the third position and surfing is in the second position, mirinda must be to the left of surfing. But this contradicts point 1. So, our assumption about mirinda being in the third position is incorrect.

2. Let's try placing mirinda in the second position instead. Now, mirinda is to the left of surfing (who is in the first position), and the person to the right of surfing is drinking cola (from point 5). This satisfies all conditions.

3. The only remaining position for soccer is the fourth position.

4. From point 4, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since soccer is in the fourth position and weightlifting is in the last position, soccer must be soccer.

Since mirinda is in the second position and surfing is in the first position, mirinda must be to the right of surfing. But this contradicts point 1. So, our assumption about mirinda being in the second position is incorrect.

2. Let's try placing mirinda in the first position instead. Now, mirinda is to the left of surfing (who is in the second position), and the person to the right of surfing is drinking cola (from point 5). This satisfies all conditions.

3. The only remaining position for soccer is the fourth position.

4. From point 4, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since soccer is in the fourth position and weightlifting is in the last position, soccer must be soccer.

5. From point 3, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since weightlifting is in the last position and iced-tea is in the first column, weightlifting must be weightlifting.

So, the final solution table is:

Since weightlifting is in the second position, the person drinking tea must be to the left of weightlifting. But this contradicts point 2, as tea is to the right of soccer. So, our assumption about weightlifting being in the second position is incorrect.

2. Let's try placing weightlifting in the third position instead. Now, weightlifting is to the right of soccer (who is in the fourth position), and the person to the left of soccer is drinking tea (from point 2). This satisfies all conditions.

3. The only remaining position for iced-tea is the first position.

4. The only remaining position for mirinda is the second position.

5. The only remaining position for surfing is the first position.

6. The only remaining position for soccer is the fourth position.

So, the final solution table is:

  |            |    1     |       2       |   3    |     4      |

| Sport      | iced-tea |               |          |            |

Now, let's fill in the remaining sport:

Since weightlifting is in the fourth position, the person drinking tea must be to the left of weightlifting. But this contradicts point 2, as tea is to the right of soccer. So, our assumption about weightlifting being in the fourth position is incorrect.

2. Let's try placing weightlifting in the second position instead. Now, weightlifting is to the right of surfing (who is in the first position), and the person to the left of surfing is drinking cola (from point 5). This satisfies all conditions.

3. The only remaining position for iced-tea is the first position.

4. The only remaining position for mirinda is the third position.

5. The only remaining position for surfing is the first position.

6. The only remaining position for soccer is the fourth position.

So, the final solution table is:
